<P>
   She's gotten a little, well, frumpy. Many of her old admirers
have moved on, and younger ones, used to a quicker tempo and a
brassier look, are not necessarily taking their place. So Mother
Jones, the counter-culture dowager, is getting a make-over this
week, hoping to rekindle old flames and light some new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1976 as the house organ of the nonprofit Foundation
for National Progress, and named for labor organizer Mary Harris
Jones, Mother Jones calls itself ``a magazine of investigation and
ideas for independent thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after early acclaim for hard-nosed investigative
reporting that many other journals wouldn't touch, the magazine, a
bimonthly based in San Francisco, lost focus in the 1980s and early
1990s as its readers aged and their political activism waned, said
Jay Harris, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed, Harris said, crediting Jeffrey Klein, one of
the founders of the magazine, who returned as editor in 1992 to get
the magazine back to its roots. But despite a circulation increase
of about 25 percent since Klein's return, sales of Mother Jones
have stagnated at about 145,000 copies an issue since last year,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Despite a ``very loyal band'' of readers, ``there is very
little depth of engagement left among baby boomers,'' said Vishwa
Marwah, president of Tattoo Marketing, a San Francisco consulting
firm that did research for Mother Jones.
</P>
<P>
   And though there is ``an emerging next generation that does
care, their language is not the same,'' he said. ``This generation
communicates visually as well as verbally.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Klein said, means ``more visual entry points'' _ bolder
graphics and brighter colors meant to attract readers who ``are
more likely to be channel flickers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention more articles about technology and corporate
misfeasance, which hold more interest for younger readers than
tales of political corruption, Marwah said.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue sporting the new look will be mailed to
subscribers this week. It features a cover story on Rupert Murdoch,
the chairman of News Corp., rendered in the form of a mock tabloid
pullout. Sections have been added and revamped. Headlines are
bigger, type is darker and the use of photographs has been
increased.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein insists that ``underneath the glitz, we're
harder-edged than ever.''

   Miami Herald to End Its International Edition
</P>
<P>
   Citing financial reasons and a push to include more news about
Miami for foreign readers, The Miami Herald plans to stop
publishing the international edition it has sold throughout Latin
America and the Caribbean for 52 years and replace it with a
portion of the Miami edition.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of The Herald say they expect to save money on the
change, which is scheduled to take effect by the end of the month.
The international edition has never yielded a profit, said Douglas
Clifton, The Herald's executive editor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes on the heels of other developments that have
led to questions about The Herald's future, including the departure
of the headquarters of its parent, Knight Ridder, to California, a
decline in circulation and an unexpected change of publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its modest circulation of a little more than about
19,000, the international edition is often regarded as the region's
international English language newspaper. It offers more
prominently displayed articles about Latin America and less
advertising than local papers. But Herald executives said that some
newspapers in the region, particularly in the Bahamas, which print
The Herald's international edition, had expressed more interest in
local Miami news.

   `Burn Rate' Author Gets a Media Column
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How does an erstwhile journalist and failed
entrepreneur become a media critic?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Michael Wolff, whose media column has its debut
in the current issue of New York magazine, his new status as enfant
terrible of media culture old and new is a result of his recent
book, ``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the
Internet'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   The book recounts Wolff's escapades, raising and spending money
in the early days of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s, as the
publisher of Netguide, a series of books about the Internet. Though
``Burn Rate'' has been acclaimed for its candid, behind-the-scenes
glimpse at the frenzy of the early online world, it did not endear
its author to the many people whose blunders in their race for
money and power he details.
</P>
<P>
   Since early summer, Wolff has been critiquing the online media
for the Industry Standard, an Internet trade publication. His New
York magazine column will focus on the traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff finds his sudden stature as pundit ``funny'' because he
ended up where he is because he got out of journalism in the first
place. (He had written for magazines and had two books published
before moving on to Netguide.) ``It is an irony that I giggle at
every day,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until a story about the book appeared in New York
that the notion occurred to the magazine's editors that Wolff might
be a candidate for the media critic job, which had been open since
Rich Turner left for Newsweek last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolff column, according to Caroline Miller, New York's
editor, will be ``written from his personal perspective, from his
experiences and considerable relationships with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff described his approach to writing as ``there is no `off
the record.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Media is filled with people who are always spouting off at
each other,'' he said. ``So much of the information that moves
around in the business is information people feel they can't
report. The nice thing about a column is it's my space and I can
report that.''

   All Walks of Celebrities Offer Their Predictions
</P>
<P>
   From two guys in a New Jersey basement comes this weighty tome:
``Predictions for the New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   By day, Todd Nickerson, 30, and David Kristof, 32, are
telecommunications salesmen. By night, they are neophyte authors
with worldwide headquarters in a Basking Ridge basement with a
computer data base of more than 6,000 celebrities who have received
their brief queries to write predictions or messages of hope for
the new millennium on a simple postcard.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 messages came back _ enough material to fill a
book that will be published by Andrews &AMP; McMeel in November with
reproductions of the handwritten or typewritten musings. The
various millennium musers range from Bill Cosby and Joan Rivers _
who predicted that ``interest rates will be higher and my breasts
will be lower'' _ to Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama, who expressed
confidence that mankind will ``act with more maturity in the next
century and thus create better prospects for peace, harmony and
tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson said that he and his partner did not have a
particularly rigorous selection system; they gleaned names of the
famous and infamous from magazines and newspapers, drawing the line
at murderers. They unsuccessfully approached headliners like Monica
Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Paula Jones, but were satisfied with
responses from Gloria Steinem, Chuck Yeager and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't quite honestly sure that it would be a success,''
Nickerson said. ``We've just been blown away by all the
responses.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he expressed some disappointment that he did not get a
postcard from President Clinton, who preferred to remain silent
about the post-millennium. On this issue, he apparently agreed with
Kenneth Starr, the independent prosecutor, who didn't return his
card, either.

EDITORIAL: BAD AIR DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   This long, hot summer has produced one of the worst smog seasons
in years for the Northeastern United States. It has also been
unkind to the lakes and streams in the Adirondacks and other
Northeastern forests, which continue to suffer from acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, there is a common culprit _ windblown pollution
that originates in the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest and
drifts eastward to poison the air over Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
New York and New England.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be relief on the way, in the form of new anti-smog
regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency and a
bill introduced by New York's two senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan
and Alfonse D'Amato. Both are under attack from Midwestern
governors and congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental agencies report nearly 2,000 violations of
federal ozone standards so far this year. New York alone recorded
74 violations between mid-May and mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   As for acid rain, a new federal study mandated by the 1990 Clean
Air Act shows that emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main cause of
acid rain, have declined sharply, due mainly to controls imposed by
the 1990 act and an innovative financial system under which
pollution credits are traded on the open market. But the study also
says that the Adirondacks ecosystem is not improving, suggesting
that further reductions in sulfur dioxide will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, is scheduled next month to
issue new regulations governing power plant emissions of nitrogen
oxides _ a fossil fuel byproduct that produces ozone, or smog, when
heated by the summer sun. Eastern states like New York and New
Jersey would be required to make some reductions, but most of the
burden would fall on ``upwind'' states like Ohio and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   As a collateral benefit, the regulations would also improve
water quality in the Northeast. Nitrogen-based air pollution
destroys oxygen in water, placing another burden on estuaries like
Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay that are already threatened by
agricultural runoff.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to the legislative equivalent of the EPA
regulations, the Moynihan-D'Amato bill would require a 70 percent
cut in nitrogen oxide emissions and a 50 percent cut in sulfur
dioxide emissions beyond those required in the 1990 act.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would also offer an emissions trading system for
nitrogen oxide similar to the scheme that has helped bring down
sulfur emissions. Taken together, some scientists believe, these
cuts would allow ecosystems in the Adirondacks and other
Northeastern forests to move toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Both the EPA regulations and the bill are strongly opposed by
the Midwestern utilities and their congressional allies. They argue
that the new controls will be expensive, and that they do not cover
cars and trucks, a major source of smog-causing nitrogen oxides.
</P>
<P>
   They are right on both counts. But if history is any guide, the
costs will be considerably less than the companies predict, and
pollution from cars and trucks is being addressed under other
sections of the Clean Air Act. In any case, the greater unfairness
is that one section of the country, the Northeast, suffers
disproportionately from pollution manufactured elsewhere. That
unfairness needs correcting.

STATE'S MEDICAID ROLLS HAVE DECLINED SINCE '95 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a trend that has alarmed health care providers,
the number of poor people enrolled in Medicaid in New York state
has been declining for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   While the strong economy may account for some of the drop, many
analysts say the decline is, in part, a side effect of the overhaul
of the nation's welfare system in late 1996, legislation that was
intended to move recipients into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress drafted the overhaul, it took pains to spell out
that people no longer entitled to welfare, particularly children,
would continue to be eligible for Medicaid, the federal and state
health benefits program created more than 30 years ago for the very
poor and the very sick. But in practice, health care analysts
contend, people who have been removed from welfare or discouraged
from applying in the first place have also been swept from the
Medicaid rolls.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, whose efforts at reforming welfare were
taking shape before the federal overhaul began, the number of poor
people enrolled in Medicaid declined 26 percent, to 1.28 million,
between January 1995 and January 1998, according to analysts at the
United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit philanthropic and medical
research organization based in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the drop is a matter of debate, because of
growth in other, overlapping Medicaid categories, like disabled
adults and the ``medically needy,'' whose high medical expenses
offset their higher income. State officials, taking into account
some of those categories, put the decline in the number of poor
Medicaid recipients at closer to 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the figure, health care providers and analysts are
increasingly alarmed by the trend, which they say reflects an
emerging national pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very group that is eligible for Medicaid and not getting
it are the kids who have the highest rates of asthma, anemia and
every imaginable health care problem,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener,
director of community pediatrics for Montefiore Medical Center in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that 4.5 million children in New York state
are eligible for Medicaid but are not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can say for sure why Medicaid enrollment has fallen, but
analysts offer many reasons. The most optimistic is that in a
stronger economy, more people are finding jobs that offer private
health insurance. But Kathryn Haslanger, director of policy
analysis for United Hospital Fund, said this was unlikely to
account for much of the change, because the ranks of the uninsured
have been growing even faster in New York than in the nation as a
whole, and many low-wage jobs do not offer affordable insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Another partial explanation is that more low-income families may
be forgoing both welfare and Medicaid because new workfare rules
make it harder to combine a relief check with off-the-books
earnings, even as a better economy makes it easier to find a
part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many parents may not realize that their children probably
are still eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons concern new barriers in the public-assistance
system, and the factor that Jim Tallon, president of the United
Hospital Fund, described as ``demand suppression _ where people are
simply not coming in the front door of the public-assistance
program because they perceive it not to be open to them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the vast majority of low-income Medicaid
beneficiaries were enrolled at the same time they qualified for
cash assistance in their local welfare office. This is still the
case, but fewer people have been seeking welfare, and more are
being turned away. The number of welfare recipients in the state
has shrunk since 1995 by at least 547,000, two-thirds of them
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In welfare and Medicaid we are asking the former public
assistance system to do two opposing things,'' Tallon noted. ``One
is to divert people away from benefits, and the other is
simultaneously to maintain their eligibility for benefits. The data
suggests that there has been an enormous underestimation of the
administrative difficulty of implementing two conceptually
conflicting requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the two public policy goals is evident in
New York. Gov. George Pataki has been in the forefront of a
national push to extend health insurance to more children, and
state lawmakers recently passed bills expanding both Medicaid and
Child Health Plus, a program aimed at insuring children of families
with somewhat higher income than the limit for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York City, where most of the state's poor and
uninsured families live, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been just as
outspokenly committed to redesigning welfare centers so that poor
people are discouraged from public assistance at the front door by
being directed to seek jobs or charity before they are allowed to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources
Administration, which oversees both welfare and Medicaid, said the
city is beginning an internal review of how welfare centers handle
Medicaid, ``to make sure that people are getting what they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, people who still obtain Medicaid along with a
welfare grant are now at greater risk of losing both. Thousands of
recipients are cut from the rolls each month for failing to meet
strict workfare requirements, according to city data. People who
lose public assistance for any reason automatically lose Medicaid,
too, unless they appear in person at a Medicaid office for a
``redetermination'' of eligibility within 30 days _ a process that
state officials acknowledge has led to erroneous terminations.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, which pioneered the job-center model now gearing
up in New York City, a recent study by researchers at the Medical
College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee documented a 24 percent drop in
Medicaid enrollment among the state's children when they compared
the three-year period before that state's version of welfare reform
and the six-month period after full implementation in September
1997. Wisconsin recently started an aggressive Medicaid outreach
campaign, largely because state Medicaid caseloads had fallen so
much more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Though national Medicaid enrollment figures are not yet
available for the period following the federal welfare overhaul,
during the 1995-1996 period, when similar welfare changes were
already well under way in many states, the decline already was
taking shape, said Leighton Ku, a health policy analyst at the
Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social policy research organization
based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Few state Medicaid directors have been willing to draw attention
to the problem, Ku said. ``One, welfare reform is sacrosanct in
many states,'' he said. ``And the decline in caseload means for the
first time Medicaid is not eating the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Coalition of Prepaid Health Services Plans
recently reported that ``involuntary disenrollments'' are running
20 percent higher this year than last year among more than 200,000
Medicaid managed-care members and now affect more than 4.17 percent
of the caseload each month, wreaking havoc with health care and
billing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the Greater Hospital Association of New York said
they hoped the loss of children from Medicaid would be partly
offset and stemmed by Child Health Plus and ``enrollment-friendly''
measures recently passed by the state for children receiving both
welfare and Medicaid.

   On a flight from Hartford, Conn., to Chicago recently, a lovely
lady who has to be everyone's idea of a grandmother settled into
the seat next to me. Obviously not a frequent flier, she looked
about with lively interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a spacious seat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly don't give you a lot of room for your knees, do
they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they don't,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   When our meals arrived, she examined the salad closely, and she
poked the cellophane-wrapped roll with an inquiring finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread,'' I said, anticipating her question.
</P>
<P>
   Then the main course arrived, which bore a faint resemblance to
chicken. She looked at it and tested it with her fork. Then, very
quietly, she mused: ``So this is life in the fast lane.''

<P>
   ``What do you say before you leave the table?'' her mother
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check,'' Rachel replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Rachel,'' her mother groaned. ``That's not what you say.''

   The softball field is a short walk from Robert T. Quade's house
in Bernardsville, N.J., and for more than three decades he has
strolled down on summer evenings to watch the men's teams in
action.

<P>
   Over the years, there have been changes: uniforms and equipment,
sponsors, haircut styles, cellular phones.

   Many players, coming directly from work, have wolfed down pizza
slices, hamburgers and sub sandwiches, but on a hot dusty day last

   Sheila Stuart was looking for a parking space on East 71st
Street recently when she spied a car about to pull out. So did the
motorist ahead of her. As she attempted to pull forward into it,
the driver ahead simultaneously tried to back in. Stalemate. Both
sat there, neither one able to claim the spot, and neither one
willing to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, the other driver got out of his car and
walked back toward Ms. Stuart, who rolled down her window and
asked, ``Are you a gambling man?'' He was, he said. How about
flipping a coin for the space, she asked. He produced a quarter,
flipped it and said, ``Your call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads,'' Ms. Stuart called _ and it was. The man smiled, got
into his car and drove off, no doubt to continue his search.

   Commuters to New York are so used to traffic jams that they
generally take them in stride. In five years of commuting from New
Jersey to Manhattan over the George Washington Bridge, Leslee
Fetner has seen drivers reading newspapers, styling their hair,
applying makeup and, of course, talking on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But she was pleasantly distracted one day recently when traffic
was particularly heavy. A sleek blue sports convertible pulled
alongside. The driver _ white plastic baton in hand _ was earnestly
conducting a symphony that was obviously coming from his radio or
CD player. Next stop, Carnegie Hall?
</P>
<P>
   Verla C. Gabriel was in an elevator with two other women,
obviously friends. One, who had seen a list of to-do chores posted
in the other's kitchen, asked what ``metal'' meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means cleaning silver,'' the friend replied. ``I didn't
want to write silver because if a burglar came, he'd start looking
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could write `argent' or another foreign word,'' the first
woman suggested.
</P>
<P>
   No way, said the woman. ``New York burglars are multilingual,
everyone knows that.''

takes out her cell phone. She punches several buttons, still
looking bored. ``So, what do you want for supper?'' she asks.

NOTES AND QUOTES FROM THE PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Despite finishing second in the PGA
Championship, Steve Stricker has much to be pleased about. He has
bounced back strong from a disappointing 1996, and he and his wife,
Nicki, are expecting a child in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker broke down in tears at the post-tournament news
conference when he began talking about his wife, who often caddies
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more questions about Nicki, she makes me cry,'' Stricker
said of his wife, who watched the tournament from home. ``I talked
to her last night, and she was really excited. We have a lot to
look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker's even-par 70 Sunday was his first round in the 70s in
the tournament. He said the experience would help him in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot today,'' Stricker said. ``You try to make it
feel like a regular tournament, but it's nearly impossible. This is
my first opportunity to win a major. I was fighting my swing. I
woke up early this morning, couldn't go back to sleep. I'm not
going to lie. It was difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   No Majors for Woods
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, forced to settle for a tie for 10th place in the
tournament, was also forced to accept not winning a major
championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I won one and played miserably the rest of the year,
but this year I have three top 10s'' Woods said, assessing his play
in the major championships. ``That's not too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play too well today. I didn't hit the ball solid, and
I couldn't control my shots the way I needed to to give myself a
chance. Quite frankly, it's a mini-miracle to shoot what I shot the
last two rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh's victory meant that all four majors were won by
players in their 30s or older. Mark O'Meara, who is 41, won the
Masters and the British Open; Lee Janzen, who won the U.S. Open, is
33, and Singh is 35.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, one of Singh's friends on tour, was glad to see him
rewarded for his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I''ve never seen anyone work as hard as that man does,'' Price
said of Singh. ``A couple of weeks back, I said to my caddie, `I'm
going to stay on the practice tee longer than Vijay today.' I was
there for five hours. I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach Revisited
</P>
<P>
   More than six months after it started, the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am is finally scheduled to end on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the tournament's three courses saturated by water in
January, soaked by heavy rains in California, the tournament was
suspended Feb. 2 after only 36 holes. Faced with the prospect of
seeing the Pebble Beach event canceled for the second time in three
years because of rain, tournament and PGA Tour officials decided to
postpone the third round until March 2, and to end the event after
54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   However, several weeks after the original postponement, it
became obvious that the courses would still not be ready in early
March. At that point, it was decided to hold the third round on the
Monday after the PGA Championship, the next time the tour would be
out West.
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday night, players boarded a charter flight to Monterey,
Calif., to complete what will be remembered as a bizarre
tournament. Some of the players who are out of contention at Pebble
Beach are not expected to return for Monday's final round, but the
contenders definitely will, with a $450,000 first-place check at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Herron and Tom Watson are tied for the lead at six under
par, one stroke ahead of Jay Haas, Tom Lehman and Phil Mickelson.
Because Pebble Beach is the last West Coast event, the $100,000
bonus given by Bank of America for the year's West Coast money
leader has been put on hold until after Monday. David Duval is the
West Coast money leader with $533,663, but he will start Monday's
action 10 strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying Northwest Exposure
</P>
<P>
   The majority of players hoped that a future major would be held
at Sahalee Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great course,'' Davis Love III said. ``It proved it
could stand up to the best players in the world. We all got
frustrated at times because it's a tricky course. But we enjoyed
it. They did a great job with it.''

COLUMN: TO THE MAYOR, THIS LAW IS GARBAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you think like the mayor?
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever wondered about this, well, then, here's a
chance to test your Rudy-Q against Hizzoner's.
</P>
<P>
   What is the most effective step that the city could take to
bolster recycling?
</P>
<P>
   A: Increase the frequency of pickups.
</P>
<P>
   B: Expand public education about the program.
</P>
<P>
   C: Install recycling bins on subway platforms and in other
public places.
</P>
<P>
   D: Crush up huge slabs of asphalt and concrete, bury the rubble
in a landfill and call the whole process recycling.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered D, pat yourself on the back or, if you prefer,
just kick an addict off methadone.
</P>
<P>
   At Fresh Kills, the city's Sanitation Department has long used
the debris from old roads to construct temporary pathways through
the dump. It is the cheapest way, officials say, to keep the trucks
carrying the city's garbage from sinking into it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   No one, for fairly obvious reasons, ever thought of the process
as recycling until two years ago, when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
proposed the idea. According to a 1989 law, the city must recycle
25 percent of its waste measured by weight: Why not count those
tons of old cement and asphalt toward the total?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor pressed this argument despite incredulous resistance
from environmentalists, community groups and the City Council. He
advocated it through two losing court cases, and would presumably
still be advocating it now except that the state's highest court
refused to let him. In a brief ruling last month, the state Court
of Appeals summarily dismissed the city's request for another
hearing on the issue and so left standing the lower court's
judgment that asphalt slabs are ``not even remotely like'' the
materials the recycling laws were meant to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the mayor has worked so creatively with old roadways, he
has shown precious little interest in what more conventional minds
think of as recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city's program has gradually expanded to include more
materials, like junk mail and milk cartons, Giuliani has repeatedly
cut its financing. In recent years, the frequency of recycling
pickups has actually fallen in many neighborhoods outside
Manhattan. The city's overall recycling rate, meanwhile, has
stalled at about 15 percent of household trash.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the asphalt argument, the mayor is legally obliged
to improve the recycling rate, yet right now, he is again trying to
squeeze the program's budget. This spring, the City Council
appropriated $8.5 million to reinstate weekly pickups citywide.
First, the mayor vetoed the funds. Then, when the Council overrode
his veto, he sat on them (the funds, that is). At this point, there
is no indication that he will actually allow the money to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the mayor, Colleen Roche, accounted for
Giuliani's inaction by blaming the Council. It had not appropriated
the necessary capital funds for buying trucks, she said. But
Council members are skeptical and say that if trucks were genuinely
the problem, a solution could easily be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's consistent opposition to the recycling program has
left even some of his supporters baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Though the costs of recycling are higher than dumping at Fresh
Kills, that will soon not be an option, thanks in no small part to
Giuliani himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1996, the mayor was instrumental in the deal
that set the dump's closing date as Dec. 31, 2001 _ by a happy
coincidence, the very day his term ends. Come Jan. 1, 2002, every
bottle and can that the city does not recycle, it will have to pay
to bury somewhere else, probably hundreds of miles away. And as the
city ships more of its garbage out of state, it is expected that
the costs of dumping and recycling will become roughly comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Even in political terms, Giuliani's dim view of recycling is
puzzling. When polled on the matter, New Yorkers, 4-1, favor
expanding the program. This support cuts not just across racial and
ethnic lines but party lines as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the mayor has never responded very cheerfully
to outside imperatives. It is the City Council that set the 25
percent quota and though that legal mandate has kept the program
alive, Giuliani has never pretended to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the law is absurd,'' he once said, only to turn around
and insist that he could, quite reasonably, satisfy it with
asphalt.

INVESTIGATORS HOPEFUL THAT SUSPECT WILL PROVIDE KEY TO BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds State Dept. warning to U.S. citizens in Pakistan and details
on Howaida's suspected bomb plot involvement.)  (See also EMBASSYBOMB-ALBANIA and EMBASSYBOMB-KENYA) 
(js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement officials investigating the
bombings at the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania expressed
optimism Sunday that a man brought back to the Kenyan capital over
the weekend after being detained in Pakistan could help authorities
unravel the plot behind the deadly terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect has been identified by government representatives in
Pakistan and Kenya as Mohammed Sadik Howaida. American officials
said Sunday that they are increasingly certain he played a direct
and possibly key role in the nearly simultaneous bombings on Aug. 7
that killed more than 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the officials said that one or two other men are in
custody in Pakistan who are also suspected of complicity in the
bombings, possibly helping to arrange clandestine passage for
Howaida and other confederates through Pakistan to the relative
safety of neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they suspect Howaida of a significant role in
part because he took the risk of remaining in Nairobi, Kenya, until
the day of the bombing. That suggested that his presence was
necessary possibly because he was involved in building the bomb or
in transporting it to the embassy. It is unknown whether anyone saw
him in Nairobi before the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the apprehension of Howaida raised the possibility
of a quick breakthrough in the case and of a highly significant
advance in the United States' often lonely and frustrating effort
to combat international terrorism against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued an order Sunday directing the
departure of all non-emergency personnel and families from Pakistan
and warned visitors against traveling to the country for fear they
might be targets of terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged to consider
carefully their security situation and, in light of the ordered
departure of all non-emergency official personnel, to consider
seriously departing Pakistan,'' the warning said.
</P>
<P>
   A rapid end to the investigation would also send a powerful
message to terrorists, in contrast to the long list of cases that
have remained open for years without identifying the perpetrators _
like the 1996 bombing of the U.S. Air Force apartment complex in
Saudi Arabia in which 19 Americans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But should Howaida be able to name collaborators who may be
hiding in Afghanistan, the United States could face the problem of
trying to apprehend suspects probably living under the protection
of the Taliban, the radical Islamic group that controls most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani news media reported Sunday that Howaida said he had
proudly taken part in the bombing as part of an Islamic war against
the United States, and had spent part of the last three years
traveling to Kenya to plan the bombing. Some of the reports said
Howaida told Pakistani officials he knew nothing of the bombing in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, officials would not elaborate on Howaida's role, but
Pakistani news reports said that he confessed to a role in the
bombings when he was arrested after arriving in Karachi, Pakistan,
from Nairobi on the day of the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   He was initially detained when Pakistani immigration officials
noticed that his face did not match his Yemeni passport and he
attempted to bribe authorities to obtain his release.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Howaida is suspected of being an associate or
supporter of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire, who, from
a stronghold in Afghanistan, has pledged a holy war on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They said their hopes that Howaida can provide a detailed
portrait of the plot are primarily based on Pakistani intelligence
reports indicating that after his arrest Howaida volunteered that
he was part of a team recruited and financed by bin Laden and, as
an engineer, helped provide technical expertise to the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the details about Howaida's account are the
outlines of an intricate plot requiring organization, technical
skill and financing. But American authorities would not discuss the
implications of Howaida's statements, saying that they wanted to
withhold judgment about his role until FBI agents are able to fully
question him about the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, bin Laden has been the object of intense
scrutiny because of his strident anti-American statements and
because of suspicions that he may have been involved in previous
terrorist acts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though law enforcement officials still have no direct
evidence that bin Laden was involved in the bombings, he has been
at the center of an intense internal discussion at the FBI over
whether the New York office should take jurisdiction of the bombing
case away from the Washington field office, which has jurisdiction
over crimes against Americans on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in New York have argued that they have
investigated bin Laden in connection with the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993, and therefore should take over the Kenya and
Tanzania bombing investigations if he is found to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the Pakistani authorities had detained a suspect in
the bombings came as American officials said that Pakistan wanted
to keep a low profile, fearing a domestic backlash of the kind that
followed disclosures that Pakistan had assisted in the 1995 arrest
of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the mastermind of the World Trade Center
bombing, and in the 1997 capture of Mir Amal Kansi, the man
convicted of killing CIA employees outside the agency's
headquarters in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pakistani authorities were vague about how Howaida
was returned to Nairobi. A spokesman for the Pakistani government
in Kenya said that the suspect had been turned over to the custody
of Kenya, not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Newsweek magazine, in its Monday issue, said that
investigators in Nairobi found a 100-pound steel drive shaft
imprinted with the vehicle identification number of the truck
thought to have carried the bomb. Authorities would not confirm
this, but said that the discovery would be less significant than in
other recent bombings, such as the World Trade Center bombing, when
the identification number led authorities to rental agencies used
by the bombers.

CELEBRATIONS IN NEW YORK DRAW WALL-TO-WALL POLITICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boys and girls in the fur-festooned blue and pink
gowns were wilting in the heat, their glittery lips going dry with
thirst. Twenty feet away, Peter Vallone, his white guayabera shirt
taking on wrinkles, tapped a rolled-up Dominican flag against his
leg impatiently. The Dominican Day Parade was more than an hour
late getting started because the mayor and the governor had not
shown up yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Flood, an aide to Vallone, materialized out of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just spoke to Ramon,'' he said. ``There's no way to do this
parade and then the other parade and sneak you into the press
conference, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really frustrating,'' Vallone, the City Council speaker
who is running for governor, said as he scanned the starting-line
crowd, which also included all three Democratic candidates for the
U.S. Senate. ``It's very rude to keep people waiting like this,
especially in the hot sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's annoyance was understandable. There were so many
parades, after all, and so little time.
</P>
<P>
   While New York City seldom seems emptier than on a weekend in
August, many of those who are left behind take advantage of the
opportunity to celebrate. And so it was that with at least six
festivals drawing the attention of state- and national-level
candidates, New York City spent much of Sunday in a state of
near-political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Office-seekers dashed from parade to street fair, changing
marshal sashes in the car as they idled in mini-traffic jams caused
by the very events they were trying to get to, and weighing the big
questions. Would the congresswoman wait for the candidate she was
endorsing to arrive? Was it possible to visit only the Indian
parade or just the Pakistani festival without alienating the other
constituency?
</P>
<P>
   Even though New York may be a media capital, the proliferation
of outlets itself makes old-fashioned politicking even more
important here than elsewhere, said Vallone's communications
director, Peter Ragone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other places, in modern politics, you can just spend a lot
of money on TV,'' Ragone said. ``Here, it's so hard to reach a big
group of people that field organization and pressing the flesh
could make the big difference.'' And with 75 percent of the vote in
the Democratic primary expected to come from downstate, a day on
the stump becomes not just a scheduling challenge but an endurance
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do my two miles on the treadmill this morning,''
Geraldine Ferraro, one of the Senate candidates, said, noting that
she had started the day at a Baptist church in Queens and planned
to hit the grand finale of the Harlem Week '98 street fair and the
Fere Agosto festival on Arthur Avenue in the Little Italy section
of the Bronx. ``I figure I'll make it up out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani finally
arrived _ ``coincidentally, at the same time,'' Vallone said _ and
the Dominican parade stepped off onto Avenue of the Americas at
36th Street, the logistical difficulties did not end. For one
thing, there were not enough endorsers to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Linares, the Dominican-American Councilman from
Washington Heights who had endorsed Vallone at a pre-parade
breakfast, walked instead with Rep. Charles Schumer, the Senate
candidate, whom he had also endorsed. Linares kept breaking from
the march to hustle Schumer off to the side to shake hands, leaving
Vallone to stand in the middle and wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to switch off,'' Ragone said. ``But now it looks
like we may have to depart.'' He went off to speak to Vallone, but
the candidate simply glanced up at his watch as he waved his left
hand overhead and said he wanted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, around 43rd Street, Ragone and a colleague, barking
into their cell phones over the roars and whistles of the crowd,
got the break they needed: a call from an advance man for Nydia
Velazquez, a Democratic congresswoman from Brooklyn who was set to
march with Vallone in the Brooklyn Puerto Rican Parade in
Williamsburg _ which was just about to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nydia's advance guy says that she's running a little late,
too,'' Ragone said. ``He wanted to know if we could meet up and do
the endorsement after the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely half an hour later, Vallone hopped out of the back of his
car in Williamsburg, shook hands with a man wearing a baseball cap
that declared ``Women want me, fish fear me'' and clutching a stack
of Vallone fliers, and marched in the last several hundred feet of
the parade before cutting across McCarren Park. With a little salsa
step, he took the stage overlooking a dusty ball field, just in
time for Ms. Velazquez's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``On September 15, you will see a parade of candidates'' on the
ballot, she told the crowd, and said she hoped they would vote for
Vallone, ``un Democrata de verdad.'' Vallone thanked Ms. Velazquez
profusely, gave his condensed stump speech and headed for Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a disaster that turned out to be a nice stop,'' he said,
praising his campaign team for coordinating it and noting with
pleasure that for the second day in a row, he had not run into any
of his opponents on the campaign trail. (One of them, Betsy
McCaughey Ross, spoke at a church in the Bronx, then spent much of
the afternoon in East Hampton at a benefit for a group that runs
women's shelters in Suffolk County. ``We did the unusual, we did
the unpredicted,'' said Kevin Davitt, Ms. McCaughey Ross'
spokesman.)
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, Vallone bought a Not Just Fruit salad from a vendor,
Robert Best _the first bite he had eaten since the
pre-pre-parade-breakfast with his wife _ and bought a present for
his 8-year-old granddaughter: a tiny Cleveland Browns pillow that,
when turned inside out, became a teddy bear.

FIRE FORCES THEATER EVACUATION 2ND DAY IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A popular Upper West Side movie theater was evacuated
for the second time in as many days Sunday after a small fire broke
out in a storage room on the fourth floor, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's fire at the Sony Lincoln Square and Imax Theater, which
started shortly before 2:50 p.m. as moviegoers were watching
matinees of shows like ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Lethal Weapon
4,'' came less than 24 hours after a pair of noxious smoke bombs
were set off in the theater, sending 4,000 people rushing outside.
Twenty-one people were treated for breathing difficulties, and two
had to be taken to local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike that disturbance, which appeared to be the work of
pranksters, Sunday's fire was believed to be an accident, said
Assistant Chief Daniel Nigro of the New York City Fire Department.
A knapsack that firefighters had thought was suspicious, he added,
turned out to be harmless.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 61 firefighters were brought out by the fire, which
was extinguished in less than 25 minutes. Three patrons were taken
to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center for treatment of smoke
inhalation, said Elbert Washington, a Fire Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a firefighter who was hit by a falling tile as he
battled the small blaze joined them later after complaining of neck
pain.
</P>
<P>
   For the others, the smoky fire spoiled an afternoon at the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a bomb or something,'' said Matthew
Constantino, 25, adding that he did not wait for an explanation
before leaving his seat at the movie ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie just went off,'' he added, ``and this little guy
came to the front and said that due to circumstances beyond his
control, we would all have to be evacuated from the theater. The
guy did a good job of getting people out, but a lot of them refused
to leave unless they got fresh tickets. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater workers who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
ticketholders who missed shows Sunday would be able to exchange
them.
</P>
<P>
   A theater manager, who would not give his name, refused comment
on the fire or any possible refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance also caused trouble for drivers trying to make
their way along Broadway or crosstown on 67th and 68th Streets, as
about two dozen Fire Department vehicles clogged the roads for more
than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most theaters in the multiplex, which has 13 screens, had
reopened by 7 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Miller, 30, from the Lower East Side, said he would revisit
the theater quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try again tomorrow,'' he said. ``I mean, the chance of
something like this happening two days in a row is pretty rare, so
I bet three days in a row gives me even better odds.''

`PRIVATE RYAN' HOLDS OFF RIVALS TO BOX OFFICE POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan''
remained victorious for the fourth straight weekend at the box
office with an estimated $12.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,654 theaters
nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The performance gave DreamWorks' D-Day epic an impressive
$125.8 &UR;  &LR; million in its first 24 days as the weekend-to-weekend
decline registered a mere 24 &UR;  &LR; percent, indicating that ``Saving
Private Ryan'' has an excellent shot at becoming the 24th movie to
top the $200 &UR;  &LR; million mark in U.S. grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll continue to see the movie play well into the
fall,'' said distribution chief James Tharp. ``It won't be as
affected as other films by the start of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. agreed, noting that
``Saving Private Ryan'' will receive an additional boost near the
end of the year as Hollywood's awards season heats up. ``I think
$200 &UR;  &LR; million is in the bag already,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a solid second was 20th Century Fox's opening of ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back'' with $11.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,339 theaters.
The romance, with Angela Bassett involved with a man half her age,
overcame mixed reviews with a strong marketing effort, Rockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Box office tracker Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source,
said ``Stella'' will continue to draw well for several weeks but
noted its results could be held down by two openings starring
African-Americans next weekend _ New Line's ``Blade'' with Wesley
Snipes as a vampire fighter and Sony's ``Dance With Me'' with
Vanessa Williams as a salsa dancer. ``It's strange that these have
been bunched together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' debut of ``The Avengers'' came in third with
$10.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,466 theaters after the studio took the rare
step of not screening the action-fantasy for critics prior to the
opening. Reviews this weekend were brutal and the returns for the
$60 &UR;  &LR; million project, starring Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ray
Fiennes, were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reviews don't matter much on a movie like this, but it's a
tough sell since the TV series was only on for a few years,'' said
Bucksbaum, who had been expecting a $15 &UR;  &LR; million opening.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's fifth weekend of ``There's Something About
Mary'' was an impressive fourth with $8.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,201 sites
to go past $91 &UR;  &LR; million. It lost only 8 &UR;  &LR; percent from the previous
weekend and will soon become the 175th film to top the
$100 &UR;  &LR; million mark in U.S. grosses, although it will be one of the
few to do so without ever leading the weekend box office.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `There's Something About Mary' is a low comedy that's really
worked well,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight 1998 titles to hit the $100 &UR;  &LR; million milestone are
``Deep Impact,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``Mulan,''
``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' edged a pair of entries in their second weekends _
Paramount's ``Snake Eyes'' with $8.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,718 sites and
Miramax's ``Halloween: H20'' with $8.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,669 sites. The
latter, with a slight $17 &UR;  &LR; million budget, is churning out profits
for parent Walt Disney Co. with $39.8 &UR;  &LR; million in its first 12
days.
</P>
<P>
   The slasher sequel was followed by a pair of family comedies
with solid returns in their third weekends _ Fox's ``Ever After''
with $5.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,058 locations and Disney's ``The Parent
Trap'' with $5.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,407 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Disney's seventh weekend of
``Armageddon'' with $4 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,786 theaters and Warner Bros.'
second weekend of ``The Negotiator'' with $3.98 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,032
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fifth weekend of ``The Mask of Zorro'' came in 11th with
$3.88 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,123 sites, followed by Warner's sixth weekend
of ``Lethal Weapon 4'' with $3.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1928 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' has reached $179.9 &UR;  &LR; million in 47 days and ranks
34th on the all-time domestic list behind ``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other new entries posted unimpressive results _ Miramax's
comedy sequel ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' fetched $2.7 &UR;  &LR; million at
1,669 theaters and PolyGram's Malaysian drama ``Return to
Paradise'' with $2.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 969 screens as the latter failed
to capitalize on generally positive reviews. Bucksbaum said
PolyGram may have been distracted by the pending sale of its film
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Searchlight's limited opening of offbeat comedy ``The Slums
of Beverly Hills'' generated strong returns with $135,000 at seven
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business has reached $4.2 &UR;  &LR; billion and is
8 &UR;  &LR; percent ahead of the same period last year. Summer business,
starting with the Memorial Day weekend, is at about $2 &UR;  &LR; billion, or
about 11 &UR;  &LR; percent up from the same period last year. The 1997
summer set a record of $2.22 &UR;  &LR; billion when it closed out on Labor
Day, while this summer will finish around $2.5 &UR;  &LR; billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall business is pretty good right now, considering that
it's the soft end of summer with the last hurrah for vacations,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Titanic'' drew $715,000 at 594 theaters in its
35th weekend to push its overall domestic total to $598.9 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' will face competition next weekend from
``Dance With Me,'' ``Blade'' and two new comedies _ Warner's
``Wrongfully Accused'' with Leslie Nielsen in a spoof of ``The
Fugitive'' and Paramount's ``Dead Man on Campus.''

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: LOCAL RACE WITH A MAJOR TV BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While candidates for statewide office in next month's
Democratic primary have received a good deal of attention for their
spending for television advertisements, they are not alone in
buying media time. In a more local race, one candidate is planning
a television blitz in which he will spend more than any of his
opponents have raised for their entire campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Noach Dear, a candidate in the Democratic
primary for a congressional seat in a district that includes parts
of Brooklyn and Queens, is planning a $700,000 advertising campaign
that will run on the major network affiliate stations in the two
weeks before the Sept. 15 primary. The seat is now held by Rep.
Charles Schumer, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Dear, who represents Borough Park, Brooklyn, is one of four
elected officials seeking the Democratic nomination to represent
the 9th Congressional District. The others are Anthony Weiner, a
city councilman from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and two members of
the Assembly, Daniel Feldman of Sheepshead Bay and Melinda Katz,
who represents Forest Hills, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dear has taken on an unusual campaign tactic. His
campaign has produced a 10-minute videotape that will be mailed to
about 20,000 residents in the congressional district who are
considered likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   John Paone, a spokesman for Dear's campaign, said the tapes will
include biographical information about the Councilman, his views on
various issues and ``testimonials from people he has worked with.''
They will also include comments from constituents and at least one
elected official _ City Councilman Alfonso Stabile, a Republican
from Howard Beach, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dear's spending on television is considerable, his
opponents suggest that such heavy spending is unnecessary and that
they do not feel overwhelmed by the councilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the race will depend on grass-roots operation and
people who really care who represents them,'' Ms. Katz said. ``I'm
counting on volunteers and people in the community. I don't think
money can buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said, ``Most likely, he'll spend the most money, but
he'll come in last. You can't buy a district like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the campaigns of Dear's opponents suggested that
the councilman's strategy was to advertise on television at the
expense of appearances at forums or debates with his Democratic
rivals. Just last month, Dear declined to participate in a debate
between the candidates on New York 1, the cable news station. They
also pointed out that Dear has so far not participated in any
forums or debates with other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Paone denied that the councilman refuses to debate, but said
that the candidate prefers responding to the questions at forums
from ordinary citizens in the district, rather than reporters. ``He
just thinks voters should have more of a voice in the process,''
Paone said.
</P>
<P>
   A Rare Primary Challenge
</P>
<P>
   For leaders of political parties in New York City, there are few
priorities higher than keeping their incumbents from facing primary
challenges. And of the Democratic Party chairmen in the five
boroughs, none is quite as passionate as Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx
Democratic chairman, whose organization works diligently through
the courts and other means to keep insurgents off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ramirez, an assemblyman from Kingsbridge,
successfully challenged the election petitions of an opponent, who
was thrown off the ballot. And the assemblyman has had no
challenger since he was elected in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, Ramirez must feel he is traveling in uncharted
territory. He is facing a primary challenge from Richard Soto, a
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Soto ran unsuccessfully last year for a City Council seat. And
while he lost to Adolpho Carrion Jr., the candidate backed by the
Democratic Party organization, he won nearly 40 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said he relished the prospect of a campaign. ``There are
a few things I do well, and campaigning is one of them,'' he said.
``I love to go out and talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the activities within the Democratic organization in the
Bronx have made it clear that its chairman would prefer no
opposition. The organization spared no effort to force Soto off the
ballot by challenging his filing papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have subpoenaed our witnesses, and 15 to 20 of the people
who signed petitions,'' said Carl Saez, Soto's campaign manager.
``They had 10 lawyers down at the Board of Elections trying to
knock us off the ballot. We feel that Ramirez is concerned with
establishing his own fiefdom instead of being concerned about the
community. He's afraid of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   A Battle for Independence
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, their contest at the polls turned out to be one
of the closest among the state's legislative elections. Now, it
seems that Ann Margaret Carrozza, a first-term Democratic
assemblywoman from Queens, will once again face Douglas Prescott,
the Republican and former assemblyman she defeated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott's defeat was considered a major blow to Queens
Republicans because he had represented the 26th Assembly District
in northeastern Queens for all but two years since 1980. Ms.
Carrozza, a political novice who had worked as a law secretary to a
state Supreme Court justice in Queens, won with 53 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half her total came from voters who pulled the lever
under the Independence Party line. And so a battle between Ms.
Carrozza and Prescott has been waged this summer over which
candidate would receive the Independence Party's designation.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Republican officials had courted the Independence
Party and thought they had a deal giving Prescott the nomination,
but the party selected Ms. Carrozza. Prescott tried to gather
enough signatures to force a primary on that ballot line, but that
effort failed last week when a state Supreme Court justice tossed
out his petitions, saying that they had been improperly collected.
Prescott did not return calls to his home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carrozza must still face Prescott in November. ``I feel
positive and optimistic,'' she said. ``I just hope that the race
will be one where we discuss issues and that the other side will
not be nasty.''

CUTS STING MARINERS IN CLOSE SHAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Mariners were reminded Sunday that proper
execution often is the difference in a close game.
</P>
<P>
   A missed sacrifice bunt, a blown chance at a double play and a
couple of outfield throws that were cut off when they might have
produced outs put the M's in a what-if mood after a 5-3 loss to the
Chicago White Sox before 25,471 fans at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the nine-game road trip that began with a four-game sweep
in Detroit ended with a four-losses-in-five-games whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been the pattern all year,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``We've had our good streaks and our bad streaks. We just
haven't been able to get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner starter Jeff Fassero pitched a complete game but wasn't
particularly sharp in absorbing his ninth loss in 10 decisions.
Chicago second baseman Ray Durham led a 13-hit assault with a
two-run homer in the third inning to erase a one-run Sox deficit
and singled home the eventual game-winner in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner's two-run homer in the top of the seventh pulled
Seattle even.
</P>
<P>
   But close games aren't the Mariners' forte this season _ they
are 4-19 in one-run games and 12-12 in two-run games _ and they
returned home last night for an eight-game homestand, undoubtedly
wondering when they will win another close one.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an explanation, Mariner shortstop Alex Rodriguez said,
``Our fundamentals, as a unit, haven't been very good this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   He was involved in two of the most crucial plays, both in the
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez didn't hear a call from third baseman Russ Davis,
he cut off a throw from center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., erasing any
chance of cutting down Albert Belle at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a close play,'' Davis said, ``but I didn't
tell Alex what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rodriguez: ``I (cut it) on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   To magnify what might have been, Wil Cordero chopped a grounder
to Rodriguez, who got caught between hops. He said he didn't want
to be over-aggressive and mishandle the ball or force an awkward
throw to second base.
</P>
<P>
   He took the safe route and didn't have enough time to complete
what would have been an inning-ending double play, allowing Belle
to score and give Chicago a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Buhner's 11th homer of the season produced his 28th and
29th RBIs since the All-Star break and tied the score, Davis
doubled to right-center, putting the Mariners in position to regain
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then came another fundamental breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher John Marzano, trying to advance Davis to third with a
sacrifice bunt, bit at reliever Keith Foulke's first pitch and
bunted the ball on one hop to the pitcher, who gunned down Davis at
third.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Marzano said he should have waited for a better
pitch to bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up and in, and although (Foulke) made a good play on
the ball, it wasn't a good bunt by any stretch of the
imagination,'' Marzano said. ``Yeah, I should have waited for a
pitch I could have gotten down better.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mariner catcher Chad Kreuter led off the seventh inning
with a double into the left-field corner, and Durham ended his
productive game with a game-winning single to center off Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   After arguing with plate umpire Bill Miller about a called
strike, Durham calmed down and delivered a base hit that scored
pinch-runner Mike Cameron from second base.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who pitched out of most of the other jams he
encountered, then yielded a run-scoring single to Mag-glio Ordonez
for an eighth-inning insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mariner left fielder Raul Ibanez made a strong throw to
the plate, Davis cut it off and settled for the inning-ending out
at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, late in the game, I probably should have
let (the throw) go through,'' Davis said. ``But I didn't think it
was going to be in time to get (Robert Machado).''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero pitched his club-high fifth complete game of the season,
but labored most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept us in the game, but he's been sharper,'' Piniella
said. ``The White Sox hit the ball well against us the whole
series. They even had 17 hits in the game they lost (Saturday
night).''

HUARD'S GOAL FOR '98 GOES FAR BEYOND HELPING SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Brock Huard has heard from former Husky teammate
Jerome Pathon how different the NFL is from college. Maybe that's
why Huard is the happiest man in Seattle right now.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he was right to stay at the University of Washington
for his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get caught up in the emotion of that, `I could be in
the NFL,' but then you look at it and you know you've made the
right decision,'' Huard said.
</P>
<P>
   And since Pathon made a visit to the Kingdome last week to play
against the Seahawks as a member of the Indianapolis Colts, it is
easier for Huard to smile. All the talk, all the feedback serves to
re-affirm Huard's decision.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 10 Huskies drafted last April is telling the
6-foot-5, 225-pound lefty quarterback how great it is, how easy
life gets once you've grabbed the NFL's brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are preparing for a season in which they could be
frequently over-matched. Still, Huard is like a kid with a happy
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not trade places with anybody in the world right
now,'' Huard said Sunday about a season he hopes becomes one of the
most fulfilling experiences of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Huard, a Heisman Trophy candidate and top pro prospect,
is placing no pressure on himself beyond this season. The future
will take care of itself, he figures, which is why he has not taken
out an insurance policy to protect himself against a career-ending
injury _ a standard practice among top collegians, especially when
they have passed up a pro draft to stay one more year in school.
</P>
<P>
   Huard said an insurance policy to protect his financial
potential is not his style. He is ``letting that rest in greater
hands.'' He believes that if his football career came to an end in
college and not in the NFL, where many expect Huard will be a top
draft pick next April, then a different course in life was meant
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of goals and dreams. I just kind of take
this one day at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of mind-set, Huard does not care that 1998 will
in no way resemble last season, when the Huskies, stocked with
future NFL draft picks, were preseason favorites to win the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year there was such great expectation. I think some of
the expectation outweighed some of that excitement. It was like,
`Let's get to the game and prove that we can live up to these
expectations,''' said Huard, who has all but been left behind after
the departure of 1997 Husky standouts like Pathon, Rashaan Shehee,
Jason Chorak, Cam Cleeland, Benji Olson, Olin Kreutz, Fred Coleman
and Tony Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is as if Huard is starring in ``Gulliver's Travels,'' the
way he towers in stature and ability over his (pardon the
expression) no-name Husky teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had some great physical talent, but the overtone
now is that we're a better team. We're a better group of guys, a
better attitude. There's a lot of positive feelings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the fault of the guys who had talent, and not that
all the 10 draft picks last year were bad guys. I'm not saying that
at all. But what happens sometimes, guys who have been waiting
their turn, guys that have been backups, they're getting their
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Huard wants to lead them, even if the Husky schedule takes
them to Arizona State on opening day, and through Pac-10 favorite
UCLA and Lincoln, Neb., and even though the go-to guys Huard is
supposed to throw to, and the guys who are going to carry the ball,
have yet to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pathon and Coleman accounted for 111 receptions,
1,968 yards and 15 touchdowns. Now all eyes will be on track star
Ja'Warren Hooker to fill some of that void, along with Gerald
Harris and Huard's former Puyallup High School teammate, Dane
Looker.
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons, Huard is only 1,819 passing yards short of
his brother Damon's school record. Yet, he is not looking for
individual stats or accomplishments to measure his success.
</P>
<P>
   He called the hug of friendship and gratitude he got from
Coleman on the field after last year's Aloha Bowl one of the best
moments in his career. It is for such moments that he is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can I improve myself and just give of myself to make
everyone else better? That's what it is,'' Huard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders need to serve. Great leaders do that. They serve first
and they give first, and if they can command that respect, they can
lift people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many of us know ourselves so well, so young, but Huard is a
rare and lucky one. The light came on and the vision was clear,
which may be why The Big Man on Campus is wearing a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in the NFL now are saying how different it is. Things
like `Boy, it's a lot of work. I can't believe we start training
camp in mid-July. This is a business. You have to earn your
paycheck,''' Huard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm making my $670 a month right now. Actually, I'm
not making anything yet, since we're living in the dorms, but that
$670 (stipend) will be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Which goes to show you: All the money in the world couldn't buy
you a college quarterback with better priorities.

HUSKIES OPEN WITH ATTITUDE CHECK

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Last year, when the University of Washington football
team gathered in fall camp for its conditioning tests _ 16 sprints
of 110 yards in a required time _ one of the guys who didn't make
it was a senior co-captain.
</P>
<P>
   Bad sign.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the leaders of the 1998 club that had its first
two-a-day drills Sunday, and they'll say that what might have
seemed like a trifling, mid-August moment was actually symptomatic
of what went awry with the '97 Huskies, who started with national
championship aspirations and finished 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he didn't make them (the 110s) didn't look good
at all,'' said tight end Reggie Davis, a '98 co-captain.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the season, after a convincing loss to Nebraska and
three numbing November defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Huskies are like a lot of other clubs, saying their
minds are right. One hundred twelve Division I-A teams, honk if
you've got a better attitude than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year is really different,'' insisted rover Nigel Burton,
another co-captain. ``People are really looking out for each other.
Everybody seems to be buying into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, Burton and the two other co-captains, linebacker Lester
Towns and quarterback Brock Huard, agree that they don't want to
repeat mistakes they saw made by some of last year's seniors, the
class that had a collegiate-high 10 players drafted by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great guys on the team,'' said Davis. ``But I think
there was too much focus on going to the next level before it was
time. I plan on going to the NFL myself, but that's not something I
focus on right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially now that I'm a senior, I could understand thinking
about the NFL _ thinking I've got to perform this year, that I've
got to have the ball to show people what I can do. I just think it
comes down to prioritizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was asked how much ``senioritis'' played a part on the
1997 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge,'' he said, as he downed a Philly cheesesteak sandwich
between practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had 10 or 12 guys (anticipating the NFL). (It
was) `I got to get better, I got to do this, I got to do that.' The
problem is, there were a lot of I's in that statement, and in the
long run, it hurt us as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton won't forget the mess of November, when the Huskies
allowed 124 points to Oregon, UCLA and Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it on the defense,'' Burton recalls. ``The other team
would score, we'd come off the field, and it was like watching 11
dogs snapping at each other. It was like, `I didn't mess up, you
messed up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Pointing fingers, yelling at each other, coaches trying to
calm things down on the sideline ... part of that is the heat of
battle. But it wasn't positive, it was critical, it was `You, you,
you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody always tried to fix it, but the damage was already
done.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been few discouraging words uttered about the '97
Husky seniors. These were the freshmen who entered the UW in 1993
and were immediately bludgeoned with the Pac-10's two-year bowl
sanction.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the end, some of last year's seniors simply got tired
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get inside their heads,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he sensed senioritis last year, UW coach Jim
Lambright said, ``I just think this is a different group, a
different year. You have much more dominant captain control of the
team. It's been great, the commitment by so many more players over
the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the coaches have done some soul-searching away from
videotape and playbook. In July, they attended a retreat in
Winthrop sponsored by positive-thinking guru Lou Tice.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that came out was, change is growth,'' said
offensive coordinator Scott Linehan. ``For us as a coaching staff,
we've been doing pretty much the same thing since I've been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coaching staff has worked some (long) hours, and when we
lost a game, it was worse. But maybe we can work smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, you get to know a little more about the
people you work with. It's kind of fun to see (assistant coach) Ron
Milus on a horse. I never thought I'd see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton says he senses a change in the coaching approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just us (players),'' Burton said. ``The longer they
can keep their new attitude, keep things positive, the longer we're
going to be able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more of our meetings have been less X's and O's, more
about goal-setting, making sure everything's right with our team.
It's just kind of snowballing. There's a good feeling about being
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: ILB Lester Towns, still bothered by the after-effects of
April foot surgery, did little in Sunday's workouts. ... The
on-again, off-again weather caused the Huskies some uncertainty for
their afternoon practice. They wanted to work out on grass, but an
overnight irrigation and the unexpected rains drenched the natural
stuff and kept them on AstroTurf. ... Burton and RB Maurice Shaw
were limited by mild hamstring pulls. ... The three-game academic
suspension of CB Mel Miller bumps Toure Butler into a starting role
through the Nebraska game and means redshirt freshman Wondame Davis
must play early. ... Using an index of weight lifts including the
bench press, incline press, squat and power clean, the Huskies'
five strongest players are offensive linemen Chad Ward, Brad Hutt
and Ben Kadletz, plus Towns and Reggie Davis. ... Towns did a
480-pound bench press and 415 incline to set UW linebacker records,
Hutt did the same with 391 in the power clean and WR Andre
DeSaussure had a 375 bench for an all-time high at his position.

DOUBLE BOGEY ENDS LOVE'S BID FOR REPEAT PGA TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ There would be no rainbow over Davis Love III
Sunday, only rain on his parade, ending his bid to become the PGA's
first back-to-back champion since Denny Shute in 1936-37.
</P>
<P>
   Love began the day at 3 under par, four strokes behind Vijay
Singh and Steve Stricker. He finished with an even-par 70 and a tie
for seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Before he started the final round, Love alluded to the rainbow
that spread over the 18th green at Winged Foot Golf Club in New
York, where he claimed his first major victory in the 1997 PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, I was hoping for a rainbow before we started to
get me off to a good start,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   But he never saw one Sunday, and said it felt a little different
this year, having to chase the leaders rather than leading the
tournament and holding on for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know what it felt like last year chasing Justin
(Leonard) and myself,'' Love said. Love and Leonard began the final
round at Winged Foot tied for first place, seven strokes ahead of
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The end came early Sunday. After running off four consecutive
pars, Love put his tee shot on the 195-yard par-3 fifth hole into a
pond and ended up with a double bogey from which he never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My round was not very good,'' Love said. `` ... It was not
what I was looking for today. Obviously, Vijay was in control and
it would have taken a lot, probably even an impossible score, to
win. It certainly wasn't the round I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Love acknowledged that the weather has played a big role in the
last two PGA Championships. He said Sunday's rain made the greens
and fairways softer at Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it made play a little easier, but it's still the last
round of a major, so it still plays pretty hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outgoing champion also had kind parting words for Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great course,'' Love said. ``It proved it can stand up
to the best players in the world. We all got frustrated at times
because it's a tricky course. You have to be very patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed it, it is in great shape, and they did a great job
with it.''

SINGH NO LONGER AN ISLAND UNTO HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Staying on the island will be hard now.
</P>
<P>
   Not Fiji. Vijay Singh long ago left his Polynesian homeland.
Hasn't returned in years.
</P>
<P>
   The island he's been on is mostly self-created. The solitary man
on the practice range. The reticent man who resents interviews. The
stoic man who never betrays an emotion. A colorless man of color in
a mostly white game. The man with a cheat in his past.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is PGA champion, a winner of one of pro golf's four
majors. At least a part of him now belongs to sports history, to
the golf public. And to a world that demands more of its champions
than grinding efficiency, one that won't let him emulate the other
mysterious Polynesian icons, the equally inscrutable stone faces of
Easter Island.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the PGA Championship draws him from his self-made
isolation will be one of the more intriguing stories on the golf
tour. But when he grows contemptuous of the personal stretch, he
can always return in comfort to a little patch of forest east of
Seattle, where he said he ``got the most yelling I've ever got.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy the touts didn't see coming won the little Redmond golf
festival Sunday, and in return, it won him over _ an affection that
seemed to startle a man unfamiliar with such expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at how many cheers I got on every hole I went
to,'' Singh said. ``I think this is the best crowd I've ever
experienced for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really very fair. I just wish we could have this
kind of crowd every tournament we go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a lot of people have cheered for Singh.
</P>
<P>
   His now-infamous episode of scorecard alteration at the 1985
Indonesian Open got him suspended from the Australian PGA Tour and
led to his temporary golf exile in Borneo. The frequency with which
the subject was reintroduced upon his appearances in Europe and the
United States has led to an alienation with the golf media.
</P>
<P>
   In Fiji, almost none of his immediate family remains, having
scattered to New Zealand, Australia and beyond. The Fijian East
Indian community of which they were a part has grown large and
influential, to the dismay of some of the native population. The
tension created racial politics, including for a time legislated
discrimination. So it wasn't so surprising the way he responded to
a question about how his victory will be greeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm a hero in Fiji,'' he said. ``It's hard to answer
that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, he and his wife and son have lived in one those
faceless golf-community suburbs near Jacksonville, Fla. They also
keep an apartment in London. The man who never misses a cut and
never makes an impression is virtually a man without a country,
even though he has played golf in many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now a winner of six PGA Tour events and seven on the European
tour, he was probably more deserving than either Colin Montgomerie
of Phil Mickelson of the dubious sobriquet of ``best golfer never
to win a major.'' But he is so bereft of constituency that he
seemed only on the periphery of the PGA's golf consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation was that Singh and another unlikely challenger,
fellow third-round leader Steve Stricker, would fall to pressure on
a damp day that anticipated charges from Tiger Woods and Mark
O'Meara. Instead, golf's likeliest history makers fell back. It was
left to former PGA champions Nick Price and Steve Elkington to get
hot. But they began too late.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament came down to the final twosome on the 17th green.
Singh was a stroke ahead of Stricker and each had a similar putt of
12 feet for par.
</P>
<P>
   For Singh, such pressure evokes a memory from his days of exile
as a teaching pro in Borneo after his fall from grace. To keep his
wits and his competitive edge in the steaming jungle courses, he
would play high-stakes handicap games with timber and oil
executives.
</P>
<P>
   He told John Garrity of Sports Illustrated that he was down to
the last hole with $10 in his pocket and $700 on the line. The
par-5 required a shot over water to an island fairway, but he hit
his drive out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling I had when I stood over the next drive was the
worst feeling I've ever had in the game,'' Singh said. ``How would
I pay if I lost? Would I lose my job? What would I tell my wife?''
</P>
<P>
   Singh found the fairway with his second shot and made eagle
while his opponent double-bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I won the hole and a lot of money,'' Singh said. ``Now
whenever I'm in contention in a tournament, I think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sahalee, far from the equatorial jungle but with almost as
much at stake, Singh drained his putt. Stricker slid past to the
left, and the guy called the hardest working man in golf business
had his championship, and considerable redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 1985 transgression, which Singh to this day denies was
cheating, calling it a misunderstanding, he has had no further
character challenges. Neither are there challengers to his
standards of effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us foreigners tend to gravitate towards each other
over the years, and I've played a lot of golf with him,'' said
Price, a native of Zimbabwe who finished tied for fourth. ``I've
never seen anyone work as hard as that man does.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks back I said to my caddie, `I'm going to stay
on the practice tee longer than Vijay today.' I was there for about
five hours. I couldn't do it, and that was just one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to anyone who lives in Jacksonville ... I mean that
guy's torn up more practice tees. I wonder how much earth he's
moved over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a fresh patch of earth now. The man who left one island
for another is upon golf's mainland, whether or not he _ and golf _
are ready.

COUPLES FINISHES STRONGLY IN FRONT OF HOMETOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The standing ovation echoed through the
evergreens, and Fred Couples soaked it in like the liquid sunshine
that briefly covered Sahalee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly bowing out after the first two rounds, the native
son rebounded with a 3-under-par 67 Saturday and a 68 Sunday to
finish at even par in his 17th PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough to put him in contention, but Couples was
pleased he made the cut and gave his hometown fans something to
cheer about in the final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the 18th green, fans started chanting, ``Freddie,
Freddie, Freddie.''
</P>
<P>
   He only wished his entire round Sunday had ended like it began,
with back-to-back birdies. Instead, he had to scramble to save pars
on the back side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day. I got off to a booming start, then slowed
down a little bit and then played well the rest of the way,''
Couples said. ``To shoot 2-under (Sunday), I'm real proud of that.
... I wish I would have played well on the first day.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples also was proud of Seattle-area golf fans and the golf
course itself, which had never played host to a regular PGA Tour
event, much less a tournament the magnitude of the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I grew up so I was waiting for this a long
time,'' Couples said. ``So far, everyone has liked the place and
that's a good feeling, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was the heavy fan favorite, Couples said he
thought the crowd ``was behind everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With everyone screaming at you, it was lot of fun, but it's a
long week,'' Couples said. ``I would never say that I didn't have a
great time, but I knew on Monday not to get too enthralled with
being from here. It's a big tournament and I just wanted to go out
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The course held up well, according to Couples, and Sahalee
proved that the Seattle area can support one of golf's major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area deserved a big tournament. The people have come out
from everywhere to watch it,'' he said. ``That's what you go by.
And any golf course that you make this hard is going to be close to
par.''
</P>
<P>
   For Couples, the key to making Sahalee difficult enough for a
major event was shortening two par-5s (the sixth and 18th holes)
and converting them to par-4s, lowering the par for the course from
72 to 70 for the best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed to do that. You need to have a par-70,'' Couples
said. ``I don't think any player has had a gripe about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because the course measures 6,906 yards doesn't necessarily
mean it's short and easy for Couples or any of the other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great course,'' Couples said. ``True, the first couple
of days, it played a little shorter off the tees, with people
hitting a lot of irons. But I have played at Inverness before and
Riviera, and it's a lot like those courses. It's just a lot longer
from your tee shot to the greens here.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples also liked the course conditions, calling the greens
``the best we've played on all year. The rough was deep and
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Couples will play in a skins game against Ernie
Els in Whistler, B.C., then will wed Thais Bren on Sept. 12. He
will go to Paris for a European Tour event, have a honeymoon, and
return to play the Las Vegas Invitational and The Tour Championship
in October.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't plan to get back on a regular PGA Tour schedule until
next January, when he hopes to accumulate enough points to make the
Ryder Cup team. The 1999 Ryder Cup will be played at the Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., and Couples is in fourth place, behind
Mark O'Meara, David Duval and Tiger Woods, for one of the top 10
spots on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Points are awarded for top-10 finishes at PGA Tour co-sponsored
events during 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will play a lot early on the West Coast up until (the
Masters), and see what happens,'' Couples said. ``I always get off
to a quick start, so if I do, that will put me in position to maybe
make the team. If that's the case, then I will try to play a little
more to get points to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   After he tapped in his final par putt, Couples felt the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard it up close, I felt like I would like to hear
that every week,'' Couples said. ``I'd like to play in Seattle
every week.''

DAVENPORT NOT NO. 2 THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Lindsay Davenport is on such a roll
that not even the world's top-ranked player can slow her down.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's scorching play continued Sunday as she beat
top-ranked Martina Hingis 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the final of the Acura
Classic at Manhattan Country Club. It was Davenport's third
straight tournament victory and 12th consecutive match win.
</P>
<P>
   As Davenport, the second-ranked player, inches closer to Hingis
in the rankings, she points to serenity as the key to her streak.
``I just feel so calm and in control out there on the court,''
Davenport said. ``I don't ever feel rushed. I don't feel I am not
getting upset like I used to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Service breaks were the key to the match. Hingis broke Davenport
twice in the first set to win, recovering from a 4-2 deficit.
Davenport won the final two sets because she broke Hingis' serve
early and did not allow Hingis to break her.
</P>
<P>
   The sore point for the 17-year-old Swiss miss was her first
serve. She put in 84 percent of her first serves in the first set.
In the following two sets, she made just 45 percent of her first
serves. Hingis also was hurt by seven double faults to Davenport's
three. Yet Davenport did not see Hingis' serve as a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She served well,'' Davenport said. ``I think people always
underestimate her serve. She might not hit it 110 (mph), but she
places it where she wants it to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's hard returns affected Hingis' serve. ``She put on a
lot of pressure from her side,'' Hingis said. ``Because of that, in
the third set, you get a little tired and you can't concentrate
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Though women's tennis has become more of a serving game _ like
the men's _ not all of the players have become accustomed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In women's tennis now, you have to keep holding serve,''
Hingis said. ``It's like men's tennis, and I just don't feel at
home with that strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Davenport's win, Hingis has a strong grip on the No.1
ranking. With the victory, Davenport made up 54 points in the
rankings and now trails Hingis by 444 points. Davenport might have
the latest bragging rights, but she does not put heavy stock into
them or the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one is 52 weeks of a player's results,'' she said. ``I
have had three great weeks, but Martina has had about 40 greater
weeks than I have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, a resident of Newport Beach, took home $79,000 with
the win plus an Acura, the first car she has won in her career.
Hingis made $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   The match lasted 1 hour, 26 minutes. It ended on a marathon
point, in which Hingis twice hit drop shots to force Davenport to
charge the net. Hingis also hit a lob that forced Davenport to the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone thought I had won that point before I won
it,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's goal is not to become No.1. Rather, she wants to win
a Grand Slam tournament. She will have a chance at the U.S. Open,
which starts August 31. Davenport is hoping her streak will
continue until the Open. Hingis joked that she is hoping for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to take a break now and let somebody else win a
tournament,'' Hingis said.

VINTAGE MCENROE DEFEATS LLOYD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ If John McEnroe had had his way, he would have
preferred to play one of his longtime rivals, Jimmy Connors or
Bjorn Borg, in Sunday's final of the $200,000 Citibank Champions
tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the competitive fires that such matches arouse in
McEnroe, he was eager to end Connors' reign as the four-time winner
of this event and to avenge a loss to Borg in last year's
semifinals. But Connors had to default in the quarterfinals to John
Lloyd because of a foot injury and Borg withdrew before the
tournament for players 35 and over started because of foot
blisters.
</P>
<P>
   So, the 39-year-old McEnroe found himself playing the
44-year-old Lloyd, against whom he was 13-0 in matches on the
regular and senior tours. McEnroe made it 14 after a 6-1, 6-2 rout
in front of about 3,000 at Manhattanville College.
</P>
<P>
   Though McEnroe insists he is not the player he was while winning
seven Grand Slam events and 77 career titles over all, he certainly
appeared to be close to his top form Sunday afternoon. That was
particularly true of his serve. He yielded only eight points in
eight service games and permitting Lloyd to reach deuce only once,
in the opening game of the 1-hour 10-minute match. In addition,
McEnroe drilled six aces; Lloyd had none.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John serves with that accuracy, especially in the corners,
I don't think anyone is going to get it back,'' said Lloyd, who had
his service broken twice in each set, ``and I don't care how young
the guys are. And when he plays like he did today, I think he would
cause damage among a lot of the players on the regular tour.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe conceded that he had not lost much on his wicked twist
serve. ``My service is the closest part of my game to being what it
was before,'' said McEnroe, whose victory, worth $50,000, was his
third in four tournaments on the Nuveen Tour this year. ``And my
serve was better than average when I played.''
</P>
<P>
   So were his ground strokes, volleys and his service returns, and
they were all vintage McEnroe Sunday, as was his footwork and court
coverage. Lloyd is primarily a serve-and-volley player, but McEnroe
passed him whenever he tried to come in to the net. Lloyd had to
stay back and hit ground strokes, which proved futile against a
gifted and steady shot-maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan was to be aggressive from the start against John,''
said Lloyd, who lives in Pacific Palisades, Calif., ``but obviously
it didn't work.''

SINGH CAPTURES PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vijay Singh often strayed from the fairway,
visiting places that resembled his native Fiji and adopted
Malaysia. But the world traveler pushed aside the branches and
plowed his way through the tall grass to complete the golfing
journey of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Singh calmly shot his way to a two-stroke victory Sunday in the
80th PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club, holding off both
Steve Stricker and a Pacific Northwest monsoon.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing an easy smile and a confident swing, Singh collected
his first victory in a major championship, a check for $540,000 and
a considerable boost to his golf reputation. He shot a 2-under-par
68 Sunday, giving him a 9-under 271 total.
</P>
<P>
   Of East Indian heritage with a first name that means ``victory''
in Hindi, Singh had been better known as a player who practiced
incessantly and won too infrequently. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I thought was never going to happen,'' said
Singh, as a heavy, post-tournament rain beat down on the media
tent. ``I never expected it to happen like this. I've practiced so
hard for this. It's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Geography prevailed while history took a beating in Sahalee's
tree-lined classroom. Mark O'Meara, pursuing a rare third major
victory in one season, finished tied for fourth, five strokes back.
Davis Love III, bidding to become the PGA's first repeat champion
in 61 years, wound up tied for seventh, six strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   The people's choices also took a backseat. Tournament favorite
and first-round leader Tiger Woods finished tied for 10th, eight
strokes back, and Seattle native Fred Couples closed strongly to
finish tied for 13th, nine back.
</P>
<P>
   Singh gave only Stricker a chance to beat him, and it was a
fleeting opportunity. The two golfers entered the final round tied,
then Stricker grabbed a one-shot lead through four holes, gave it
back a hole later and fell behind for good with a bogey at No. 6.
If this was match play, it was over by the 17th hole, when Stricker
bogeyed one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of South Seattle might not know Singh well, but
everyone from the South Pacific to Southern Asia was ready to claim
him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ani Gulati, an Indian-American attorney, flew from Minneapolis
solely to watch Singh play. He couldn't believe his good fortune _
witnessing Singh score his career breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   On the 10th tee, a bearded man in a red turban, Gurpreet Singh
Pall, stood fixated on the golfer, close enough to touch him. The
Microsoft employee, who let out a loud squeal when Singh nearly
holed a shot on the 15th, was accompanied by two other
Indian-Americans, Sesh Velamoor and Sunny Singh, both involved in
the computer industry. The trio came away captivated by the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``India is only known for scientists and engineers,'' Velamoor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And camels,'' said Gurpreet Singh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it will be for golf,'' Velamoor concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In winning for the sixth time on the PGA Tour and 24th time
worldwide, Singh simply would not go away, as he had so many times
before. He grabbed the lead from Woods in the second round and
shared it with Stricker after the third.
</P>
<P>
   Burning in his memory were recent failed attempts in the PGA
Championship _ he finished 13th, fifth and fourth in three of the
previous five events. He even asked Nick Price, a three-time major
winner, for some early morning advice regarding the task at hand.
Price's words were more of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Go out there and play your own game. You know what
to do. You've played it enough,''' Singh said. ``And that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh had won in such far-flung places as Nigeria, Morocco,
Zimbabwe, Sweden and the Ivory Coast. He had worked as a club pro
in Malaysia and Borneo. Sahalee couldn't show him much he hadn't
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   After parring the first four holes, Singh scored one of his two
final-round birdies. On the par-3 fifth hole, he hit a 6-iron
within 5 feet and coaxed in the putt. He parred the next five
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker fell behind for good with his bogey at the 480-yard
sixth hole, hitting his tee shot into the trees. He dropped another
stroke at the ninth, splashing his tee shot into the lake for a
bogey 4.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Stricker matched birdies at the par-5 11th hole, with
the leader hitting the top of a tree with his second shot but
somehow putting the ball on the green. Basking in his good fortune,
Singh leaned on his club for several seconds and beamed.
</P>
<P>
   He made his only serious mistake on the par-4 12th, bogeying
after he landed his tee shot in a fairway bunker and his second
shot in greenside rough.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-4 14th hole, Singh pulled one deep into the woods.
But he handled the predicament like a champion, hooking one through
the trees and the people, and stopping it on the front of the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Singh matched birdies with Stricker on the par-4 15th, both
dropping medium-range putts.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the final three holes, Singh had absorbed
Stricker's best shot and still held a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-3 17th, both golfers hit tee shots into the trap left
of the green, and each left his bunker shot well short. Singh,
however, dropped the longer of the two putts from about 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker slid his putt past the cup, making bogey and giving
Singh a two-stroke lead going to the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Wanamaker Cup now had a Fiji address on it.
</P>
<P>
   Walking off the 18th green after making par, Singh was greeted
with hugs from his wife, Ardena, his son, Qass, and Australian
golfer Steve Elkington, winner of the 1995 PGA Championship and the
third-place finisher Sunday. Singh had three-putted once in four
days. He had come a long way. And he still wasn't sure where he had
landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing all those places,'' he said, ``I never thought I'd be
doing this.''

PGA PLAYERS ENJOY SAHALEE BUT MISS THE PAR-FIVES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Players left Sahalee Country Club with good
things to say, yet they also departed Sunday wondering how the PGA
Championship course might have played in its normal setup _ as a
par-72.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a nice golf course, but I personally wish they
would leave the par 5's as 5's,'' said Joey Sindelar, who finished
at 7-over-par. ``The 18th would have been a cool par-5.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to his U.S. Open experience in San Francisco last June
_ where he finished tied for 43rd _ Sindelar was ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course was fun,'' he said. ``The Olympic Club was a
headache, from the time you teed off until the time you were done.
This was the way I would have set up a golf course, where it's
slightly easier when the ball goes in the rough and slightly easier
when it goes in the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson's only complaint with his week in the Pacific
Northwest was the lack of par-5s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of what the PGA and USGA does with par-5s, but
other than that, I think they did an excellent job of setting up
this golf course,'' the lefty said. ``Yes, I would return. Even
though this city doesn't have a regular golf event, we all felt
welcome here.''

PGA CONTENDERS, PREDENDERS FALL BY WAYSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Big names, small names, no-names _ they all
wanted to break up the match-play battle between Vijay Singh and
Steve Stricker and turn it into a rollicking party.
</P>
<P>
   Persistently, they fired, shooting for the leaders and the pins.
The golf course was supposedly exposed, softened by the rain,
vulnerable to the greatness-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   The brash youngster, Tiger Woods, figured to challenge. He began
Sunday's final round five shots behind. Given the conditions and
his capabilities, a 62 or 63 seemed possible. It could have
produced a dramatic finish, a playoff with Singh, heroic headlines,
added footage to the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tiger ``In The'' Woods was basically beauty bark in the
PGA Championship, enhancing Sahalee's landscape by his presence
only. As far as his game at tight layouts, it needs work.
</P>
<P>
   Woods tied for 10th with Skip Kendall and Kenny Perry at
1-under-par after shooting a final-round 71. Consecutive bogeys at
six and seven followed by another at nine yanked Woods from
Sunday's storyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well,'' said Woods, who finished with three
top-10s in the major championships this year. ``I didn't hit the
ball solid and I couldn't control my shots the way I needed to to
give myself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   After leading the tournament with a 66 on Thursday, Woods never
broke par again. Blame it on wayward drives, not mental mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it's a mini-miracle to shoot what I shot the
last two rounds,'' he said. ``(On Saturday), I only hit seven
fairways and today was about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday was the only day I hit the ball well. I never made a
bad mental decision in the tournament. I made some physical errors,
but I can say I played 18 holes, four days in a row, without one
mental error. That's amazing considering where I have come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the rest of the contenders, Steve Elkington was the one
who appeared on the doorstep with the loudest knock.
</P>
<P>
   The former PGA champion shot a 67 and moved within two strokes
of Singh after a birdie at 17.
</P>
<P>
   The fluid swinger from Australia hoped to birdie 18 and apply
continued pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have forced Vijay to make par to win,'' said
Elkington, who instead bogeyed after missing a 3-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington gambled by using his driver, attempting to get
increased distance to make for a shorter approach. That backfired
when his tee shot found the rough.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Elkington was rejected. He won his first and only
major in 1995 at Riviera, sinking a birdie putt at 18 to force a
playoff with Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price is the only man to interrupt the PGA's current string
of first-time winners. He won in '92 and '94 and had a chance
Sunday to add '98 to the list.
</P>
<P>
   After an eagle at the par-5 11th, Price moved to 4-under for the
tournament and 5-under for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had visions of having a good shot at it, even winning it,''
Price said.
</P>
<P>
   But he parred in, missing opportunities at the 16th and 17th
holes, the latter with his ball hanging on the lip, defying
gravity, denying Price.
</P>
<P>
   Others tried for starring roles only to end up like a potted
plant on the set, there for effect.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lickliter got it to 5-under before finishing in a tie for
fourth with Price and Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair, last week's Buick Open champ, used his unorthodox
putting stroke to move to 5-under after a birdie at No. 11. He
ended up at 3-under in a tie for seventh with defending champ Davis
Love III.
</P>
<P>
   Even a bogey at 18 could not spoil the afternoon or the memories
for Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sahalee was great,'' he said. ``The fans coming up the last
few holes were thanking us for coming here. We have never heard
that before.''

WALLACE COULTER, 85, INVENTOR OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ark., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace Henry Coulter, an inventor whose experiments in a
Chicago basement spawned Coulter Corp., one of the world's leading
makers of medical diagnostic equipment of all types, died on Aug. 7
at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. A Miami resident, he was 85.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a long illness, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, who held 74 patents, was best known for developing the
``Coulter Principle,'' which provided a methodology for counting,
measuring and evaluating microscopic particles suspended in fluid.
The resulting Coulter Counter helped reshape the field of
hematology and cellular biology.
</P>
<P>
   With his younger brother, Joseph, he built the first commercial
blood-cell counter. It changed clinical diagnostics and medical
research by replacing labor-intensive and often haphazard methods
for counting blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   With Joseph's knowledge of electronics, business sense and knack
for finding the right staff, the brothers turned the family venture
into an enterprise with more than 5,000 employees, designing and
manufacturing diagnostic systems for laboratories throughout the
world. Remarkably, the pair also remained a team and close friends
until Joseph's death in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Coulter was born in Little Rock, Ark., and developed a
fascination for electricity and crystal radio sets in childhood. He
studied at Westminister College and took electrical engineering
courses at Georgia Tech. But he got restless and in 1934 went to
work as a radio station engineer and announcer.
</P>
<P>
   After working in electronic development for Press Wireless in
New York and Raytheon Manufacturing, he moved to Chicago in 1946
and went to work for Illinois Tool Works and the Mittelman
Electronics Division of Century Steel. In his spare time, he and
his brother, an electronics engineer, spent hours experimenting in
their basement.
</P>
<P>
   This led Coulter to discover the Coulter Principle and to
construct the Coulter Counter, which the brothers set out to
produce and market. They incorporated in 1958, moved the company
headquarters to Miami and added to its catalogs many other types of
equipment used in diagnosing types of cancer, non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, leukemia and other complex modern diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter served as the longtime president of the company, which
was sold last year to Beckman Instruments Inc. Known as Beckman
Coulter now, it is based in Fullerton, Calif., and has more than
10,000 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE CIRCLE COMES ROUND AT COLUMBUS CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to civic amenities, New York City has
long known how to squander an opportunity. Take Columbus Circle,
the repellent open space at the southwest corner of Central Park.
In the 1950s, Robert Moses secured federal slum clearance funds to
raze the rundown theaters, shops and apartments to the west of the
circle, only to put up the windowless New York Coliseum, of which
Frank Lloyd Wright once observed, ``It's a great utilitarian
achievement, but architecture is something else again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Huntington Hartford enlisted the architect Edward Durell
Stone to create yet another windowless building to the south of
Columbus Circle for a museum devoted to representational art. With
its pseudoclassical design, the building was supposed to serve as a
rebuke to modernism. But its white marble facade, perforated
corners and spindly columns inspired Ada Louise Huxtable, The
Times' architecture critic, to dismiss it as a ``die-cut Venetian
palazzo on lollypops.'' Others compared it to a giant shower stall.
The museum closed in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Today Columbus Circle remains a bleak place of traffic jams,
soulless architecture and unrealized potential. But now that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have
ended 15 years of squabbling and chosen a promising developer for
the Coliseum site, there is a chance to transform the circle into
the splendid gateway it was meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   The new building at the Coliseum site will help tremendously.
The developers, Time Warner and the Related Cos., have commissioned
an immense complex that will include a hotel, stores and
apartments, as well as a 1,000-seat performance hall for a new home
for Jazz at Lincoln Center. The scheme by David Childs has twin
towers designed to echo the great apartment buildings on Central
Park West. Its curved facade and a circular rotunda at the entrance
work together to evoke the circle on which it sits.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Giuliani administration reconfigured the traffic
at Columbus Circle to make it into a true roundabout. But the mayor
will not say what he would prefer to do with the old Huntington
Hartford building, now owned by the city, though it is obvious he
would be happy for it to be torn down. Many an architecture buff
has recoiled at its sight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the building has also become a kind of beloved eyesore, an
icon of its time. For all its classical pretensions, it reflects an
attempt by a serious architect of another era to evoke tradition
and modernity as they were then viewed. The architect Robert Stern
has led an unsuccessful campaign to get it designated as a
landmark, which would keep it preserved in the face of what he
calls the ``ever-present tendency to dismiss, or even revile, the
recent past.'' Other architects have begun standing up for a
building they admit privately they were trained to dislike, in part
because of its original reactionary purpose.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani announced the new Time Warner complex last month,
I felt eager myself to see that dowdy marble shower stall torn
down. Now I am not so sure. The essence of urbanism, articulated by
the architectural historian Vincent Scully, is a kind of dialogue
across time by buildings that respect each other. When I studied
under Scully at Yale, he reviled that building. Recently, he told
me he sympathized with the views of his former student, Stern.
``It's strikingly awful, a pungent anachronism, a folly,'' Scully
said. ``But if we acted only on current preferences, we would be
tearing everything down.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many new visitors to Columbus Circle, the Stone
structure may yet find new life as a museum for art or music. But
no dialogue across time will be possible unless it is better
facilitated by the circle itself.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the urgent priority of the mayor should be to
generate discussion on transforming the whole area. The Municipal
Art Society sponsored a competition in which several architects
proposed building fanciful hemispheres or circles of light
overhead. More realistic, perhaps, would be an elaborate new
circular pattern of trees, paving stones, benches and fountains
restoring life to the circle.
</P>
<P>
   Any surface improvements could be enhanced by a rethinking of
transportation patterns below ground. The Columbus Circle subway
station is a subterranean nightmare, in which riders scuttle
through dark decrepit tunnels to make connections or get to the
surface. Childs, the architect of the Time Warner complex, suggests
a set of raised skylights bringing light and clarity to the
underworld. The American Institute of Architects has called for a
thorough rehabilitation of the subway to reflect its coming
importance as a hub.
</P>
<P>
   With Times Square, Grand Central Terminal and possibly the old
Post Office at 34th Street transforming themselves before our eyes,
there is ample evidence that New York City can reinvent itself. Ten
years from now, Columbus Circle, like Rockefeller Center and
Lincoln Center before it, could become a place that seems like it
was always meant to be instead of a squandered opportunity.

FIGHTING THE CATCH-22S OF THE MEDICAID SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-MEDICAID-DECLINE)  
(mk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cynthia Salomon was seven months' pregnant when her
husband, Jose Lazo, was diagnosed with testicular cancer. It was
Jan. 8, their daughter's second birthday. They had three jobs
between them _ he cooked in two restaurants, she answered the
telephone in a bank. But by Feb. 3, after his first operation, she
was just another applicant for relief and Medicaid at the East End
Income Support Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salomon waited for hours at the Manhattan welfare center,
only to be sent home to call for an appointment. She called 15
times a day to get through. She submitted hospital records, rent
receipts, birth certificates and bank statements, dealing with
caseworkers trained to push people to work.
</P>
<P>
   But by late April, when their second daughter was born and Lazo
underwent more surgery, they still had neither Medicaid nor rent
money for their East Harlem apartment.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the family was eligible three times over for Medicaid,
the federal and state health benefits program created more than 30
years ago for the very poor and the very sick. Even if they had not
been close to destitution, Ms. Salomon and the children were
entitled to coverage under expanded Medicaid eligibility for
pregnant women and young children.
</P>
<P>
   The Patient Accounts department of Mount Sinai Medical Center,
where the baby had been born April 25th with a broken clavicle,
eventually referred Ms. Salomon to REAP, the Resource, Entitlement
and Advocacy Program, founded eight years ago by the hospital's
auxiliary. The program wages a kind of rear guard action to capture
not just Medicaid payments for the hospital, but every government
benefit available to those who come to its storefront office on
Madison Avenue and 97th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Over several weeks, Penny Schwartz, the director, and Ydelina
Reyes, one of the program's eligibility specialists, spent up to
three hours a day calling administrators at the welfare center and
city Medicaid offices on behalf of Ms. Salomon and her family, they
said. But the computers kept spitting out rejections.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz finds it hard to convey to outsiders the Catch-22s
of the system. For example, unemployed parents can rarely prove
poverty to the satisfaction of the Medicaid system until they get
public assistance, she said, because Medicaid requires income
documentation like a welfare check or pay stub to show how expenses
are met. Welfare system computers do not allow more than one change
to be made to a case each day, so that when Ms. Salomon gave birth,
caseworkers deducted a $50-a-month pregnancy allowance from the
welfare grant the family had never received, and did not add the
new baby.
</P>
<P>
   By June, Lazo's hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, was losing
patience. He was scheduled for re-admission June 16 for
chemotherapy and an expensive bone marrow transplant. The hospital
financial department ruled that unless his Medicaid enrollment was
completed by then, providing him a number that could be used for
billing, his admission would have to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 13th we were at home crying, thinking, `Oh my God,''' Ms.
Salomon recalled. ``If he doesn't get the chemotherapy, the doctor
said the cancer would kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial Medicaid number was activated later that day. ``It
was nerve-rackingly close,'' said Ms. Schwartz.

DREIFORT SETS TONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Darren Dreifort knew the score Sunday even if
there wasn't one in the top of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate was Andres Galarraga, who had beaten the Los
Angeles Dodgers with home runs the past two days, shaken further
their confidence and sent a message that somebody's season was just
about over.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort hit him in the left side with a fastball. And when
Galarraga took a couple of steps toward the mound, Dreifort came
down to get in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happened. Or did it?
</P>
<P>
   Although Dreifort wasn't around when Eric Young homered in the
eighth inning to give the Dodgers a 1-0 victory over the Atlanta
Braves at Dodger Stadium, that showdown with Galarraga might have
been the Kodak moment of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Does it mean the Dodgers' dreary season finally has turned
around with a victory over the best team in the National League?
Baseball rarely paints with such broad strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter if the pitch was intentional or
not,'' said closer Jeff Shaw, who pitched the ninth for his 36th
save. ``Galarraga had been diving out over the plate all series
driving balls to right center and killing us. After Darren went
inside he never swung like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort wouldn't say if he meant what he threw. Galarraga was
in the trainers room after the game and did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dodgers head out on the road after a disappointing
4-5 homestand, they hopefully take a little of Dreifort's grit with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum is too strong a word, especially when you played the
way we have,'' shortstop Mark Grudzielanek said. ``But this thing
is almost over. We need to have a great trip, one week where we
play like we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort pitched seven innings and allowed just one hit, a
second-inning single by Javy Lopez. He also walked six and always
seemed to be pitching out of the stretch. Scott Radinsky (5-5)
pitched the eighth to get the victory, which moved the Dodgers
within six games in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren's effort was such a boost for us,'' said manager Glenn
Hoffman, whose team has not been swept at home all season. ``It
would have been very difficult to leave here on a down note.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty in the past week, including a .197 (13 for 66)
average with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot was Young, who had 14 hits on the homestand. But
he was 0 for 3 Sunday before hitting a 1-1 fastball from Denny
Neagle (11-11) into the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think it was gone? I never think it's gone,'' said
Young, who has 37 homers in his six-year career but two in the last
two games. ``I was running like it was triple.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers scored just five runs in the first two games
of the series, it was clear they weren't going to break out against
Neagle, who is having a tough season after winning 20 games in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tom) Glavine was the hard-luck guy last year,'' Neagle said.
``He had 12 no decisions with a 2.50 ERA in those games. I was
getting seven, eight runs a game every time I pitched. Now, it's my
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got the leadoff hitter on in the third, fourth and
fifth innings, but Neagle wiggled out of trouble each time.
</P>
<P>
   Their best chance came in the fourth, when Trenidad Hubbard
opened with a double to right-center. But Raul Mondesi's impatience
at the plate was glaring when he struck out on pitches out of the
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, back in the starting lineup after missing two
games with a sore right thumb, flied deep to center, but Andruw
Jones glided to the wall and made the catch look easy. Eric Karros
grounded to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was through after seven but had a chance to win in the
bottom of the inning when Grudzielanek singled with one out. With
Charles Johnson at the plate, Grudzielanek took off for second but
stopped halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez threw to second, but Grudzielanek raced back to first and
beat the return throw. It was the kind of break the Dodgers hadn't
seen all series. But Roger Cedeno batted for Dreifort and grounded
into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hit-and-run play and I like that,'' Grudzielanek
said. ``That's what we need to do, set a tone, put pressure on the
other team. It didn't mean a run tonight, but it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort struggled in his previous four starts, allowing 16
earned runs in 24 innings over four starts. Before that, he limited
the Cincinnati Reds to one hit in eight innings July 20, his only
victory in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a lot of pitches,'' said Dreifort, who had 118. ``But
I felt good out there. I got some great defense. This was a good
win.''

Happy homestand warms the heart
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Three things we realized on an entertaining, star-studded, nip
and not to mention tuck afternoon of baseball at the Astrodome:
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood's arm is not dead. Neither, technically, are the
Chicago Cubs. And there are at least 128 people in this town who
prefer Beanie Babies over watching Randy Johnson pitch.
</P>
<P>
   You know who you are.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson wowed us to begin the 10-game homestand Aug. 7, a
record 52,071 fans saw the start of what had to be considered a
critical stretch for the Astros, in the standings and at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 128 more people came to the Dome, boosting the
regular-season attendance record to 52,199 and hoping their kids
would be among the first 20,000 to click the turnstiles, thereby
scooping up Derby the Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Baby craziness was a part of this day _ from the
overnight camping at the gate after Saturday night's win, to the
long line of fans circling the stadium before the doors opened, to
the vendors who barked out, ``Get your ice cold Beanie beer!''
</P>
<P>
   This highly successful ploy _ some 20 big-league teams have
cashed in on the Beanie giveaways _ was designed for kids
14-and-under. But from the looks of the Astrodome parking lot
Sunday, it just as well could have been for moms 30-and-over who
drive minivans, have school-age children, and couldn't tell you
what it means to protect the plate but sure know about telling
their kids to protect the Ty tags.
</P>
<P>
   Beanies take back seat
</P>
<P>
   Even the Astros caught the craze, some of them talking in the
clubhouse before the game about which Beanies their kids did and
didn't have, then carefully stowing Derby the Horse in their
lockers.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the craze was the game. And yet again, there was
reason to believe ticketing gimmicks should be saved for weekday
games.
</P>
<P>
   This also, after all, was a day for big-time baseball stars, a
division race and a tense, emotional game between contenders.
</P>
<P>
   There was Kerry the Ace, Sammy the Slugger, Moises the Stud and
Biggio the Ballplayer. They put on a quality show that might have
ended with the Astros finishing the homestand on a down note but
not exactly singing the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad it had to end that way,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said after the 11-inning 2-1 loss that came only after pinch hitter
Manny Alexander skipped a two-out grounder between Biggio and Jeff
Bagwell. A little to the left or a little to the right, and the
Astros would have been out of that jam and perhaps ultimately back
in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   The seeing-eye grounder was a bad break for the Astros for sure,
but Dierker had no reason to cry in his beer, or even over his
Derby the Horse.
</P>
<P>
   In taking eight of 10 games in the homestand, the Astros managed
to turn what was a 4{-game edge over the Cubs in the National
League Central into an eight-game lead as they head off on a road
stretch at Philly, Milwaukee and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros remain in control of the division, and unless things
fall apart over the next 10 days, they should take the title with
relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at (the homestand) ahead of time, it figured to be
important, and it was,'' Dierker said. ``We hoped for more, but we
can't argue with extending the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros hang in there
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Sunday's game only should have given the Astros
confidence about how the remainder of the season will go. Starter
Sean Bergman (eight innings, nine strikeouts) was superb. The
bullpen arms _ Mike Magnante, Doug Henry, Jay Powell and Trever
Miller _ did their jobs, save for Alexander's well-placed grounder
off Miller that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   And despite facing Wood, the kid who sat them down a
record-tying 20 times the last time he faced them and had 11 K's on
Sunday, the Astros scratched out a game-tying run in the fifth
inning. Eventually, the Astros made it to the Cubs' bullpen and _
what else on Beanie Baby day _ were Ty-ed after nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, Wood was said to have been inflicted with
baseball's ``tired arm'' syndrome, which often gets to 21-year-olds
thrown into big-league schedules. But if he was, he's feeling much
better now.
</P>
<P>
   Wood regularly hit 98 mph on the radar gun and held Derek Bell,
Bagwell and Moises Alou without a hit. Still, there was a chance
for victory for the Astros, and how many times does that happen on
days when the Cubs have Wood on the hill and in the same game
slugger Sammy Sosa adds to his remarkable home-run count? (No. 47
came in the fourth.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go 8-2 (on the homestand), you take it,'' Biggio
said. ``You have to be happy with 8-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you weren't among the 20,000 who got a Beanie Baby.

Latest champ pays dues with hard work
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ In recent years, for reasons that defy a simple
explanation, the PGA Championship has evolved into the
proletariat's major. It's the one Slam where the everyman can
dance, too, and the 80th edition provided perhaps the best example
yet of how level its fairways have become.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jeff Sluman won in 1988, the Wanamaker Trophy has been the
Holy Grail for the PGA Tour wannabes. Let the established masters
win the Masters. At the PGA, the less accomplished or heralded you
are, it seems, the greater your chances of leaving with a smile and
first-place jingle in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Vijay Singh having become the latest member of the
Wanamaker club, 10 of the past 11 PGA winners are first-time guests
in the majors' winner's circles. The lone exception has been Nick
Price, who announced himself at the 1992 PGA but broke with fashion
by prevailing again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vijay'' means victory in Hindi. But Vijay Singh was hardly
unto the golfing manor born. If ever there has been a self-made
champion, a byproduct of ridiculously long hours spent smacking
balls on the driving range or tapping them into cups on a putting
green, it's Singh. Golf isn't merely a livelihood. It's his
passion, his compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   His all-consuming obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've practiced so hard for this,'' Singh said Sunday, and he
wasn't exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk Thursday night, after the first round of the PGA at
Sahalee Country Club, I shared a hotel elevator with Singh, his
wife, his son and his golf bag. Only the latter, by all accounts,
is always at his side. Singh had, of course, just returned from his
second home on the range after scoring an even-par 70, four strokes
off Tiger Woods' then tournament-leading, course-record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay was going to order room service, probably poke a few more
putts across the carpet, then turn in for the evening and dream
about his next round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to sleep thinking about golf,'' he once told a reporter.
``I wake up thinking about it. I have a family, but my mind is
consumed by golf. I like to practice _ and there is always
something to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it made perfect. Singh took the PGA by two shots over
Steve Stricker, who, come to think of it, would have made a perfect
PGA title-holder in his own right, considering his conspicuous lack
of credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay committed myriad mistakes across the back nine, plunking
shots off the tree limbs, planting them in the rough and burying
them in bunkers. But he recovered magnificently on every occasion
save for his bogey on No. 12. His steady hand _ well, crossed hands
_ on the greens proved particularly rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best putting tournament I ever had,'' he proclaimed it
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stricker passed him briefly with a birdie on the fourth
hole, once Singh regained the lead on No. 6 there was no stopping,
or catching, him. Sunday was Vijay Day. He ended it singin' in the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   But missing from the suddenly turbulent skies over this heavily
forested plateau east of Seattle was any trace of a rainbow. There
was nothing magical about Singh's triumph, as there had been when
Davis Love III got the monkey off his back a year ago at Winged
Foot. Love, the son of a beloved PGA teaching pro who had died in a
plane crash, was reared to win a major. He just hadn't done it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Love might be the most popular player on the tour. Singh
is something of a loner with just a few close friends among his
peers. If you want to know Vijay, you better bring your clubs. He
doesn't waste time chit-chatting when there are buckets of balls to
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his past is shrouded in mystery and, according to him,
gross misunderstanding. In 1985, he was charged with doctoring a
scorecard at the Indonesian Open in order to make the cut. He says
it was the official scorer who messed up, but he was banned from
the Asian Tour because of the incident and wound up take a teaching
pro's job in Borneo _ for $160 a month.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to competition a couple of years later on the
African Safari Tour. He played in a dozen countries before he
earned a PGA Tour exemption in 1993, after which he moved to
Florida and pretty much turned his back on his native Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Why? It's complicated stuff, relating in part to the poor
treatment of Indian immigrants by ethnic Fijians on the South
Pacific island, and he's disinclined to explain his feelings
through the media, which he distrusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten a lot of bad press,'' says his caddie, Scotsman
David Renwick. ``If I were him, I wouldn't want to talk to you
guys, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Renwick's role probably can't be overstated. He carried Steve
Elkington's clubs at Riviera in the 1995 PGA _ yes, Elk won _ and
was in the employ of Jose Maria Olazabal for his Masters victory in
1994. He gave Singh an edge he couldn't have had on his own, save
for the obvious one.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay was made for the PGA, wasn't he? As a good golfer who
never had won a major, he was the right man in the right place at
the right time.

BENNETT M. DERBY, 69, AUTHORITY ON BRAIN INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Maine, Vt., Mich., Va.)  (lh) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Bennett M. Derby, a neuropathologist who
specialized in brain injuries suffered by boxers and who persuaded
New York boxing officials to establish stronger safety standards,
died Aug. 9 at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a professor of neurology and pathology at the New
York University School of Medicine since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   After the widely reported boxing death of Willie Classen in
1979, Derby reviewed videotapes of the bout at the Felt Forum in
Madison Square Garden and then testified before a state Senate
investigating committee that the fighter seemed to have suffered a
concussion a round before receiving the knockout punches that
eventually killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive rights to the left side of the boxer's head in
the ninth round ``stopped his clock,'' Derby said, and the fight
should have been halted then. Instead, the referee let the bout
continue.
</P>
<P>
   A ringside doctor _ a pediatrician working his first fight for
$50, without training in trauma or athletic injury _ testified that
he had not even seen the three punches, but had been engaged in a
conversation that might have distracted him. He also pronounced the
fighter fit to continue after examining him before the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
   As Classen rose, late, for the 10th, he took two rights to the
head that in Derby's view caused a brain hemorrhage and his death.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the fighter's weakened reflexes that left him open to
the fatal blows, Derby said. ``In the ninth round I saw exactly
when the fight should have been stopped,'' he testified. ``In the
10th round, I saw a man killed in front of my eyes. All of this was
preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   He testified that the customary count of 10 was not enough time
for a boxer to recover his senses, that the standard one-minute
rest between rounds was not enough for a doctor to assess brain
injury, and that after being knocked out, boxers should be barred
from ring training and fights for 90 days, not 30.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he advocated CAT scans of the brain for all boxers at
regular intervals and after a knockout. In 1983, such exams were
required, at state expense. Derby kept files on boxers whose brain
conditions he tracked over the years, looking for blood clots or
atrophy.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts resulted in mandatory protective headgear for
amateur boxers, softer ring mats to prevent head injury, and trauma
training for referees and ringside doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Derby was an attending neurologist at Bellevue Hospital Center,
where Classen died five days after his knockout, prompting the
state Athletic Commission to suspend all professional fights until
more safety procedures could be adopted. The next year, Derby was
named to the commission's medical advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s and '80s, Derby's expertise helped solve hundreds of
murder cases and prison deaths in New York, Maine and other states,
said Dr. Michael Baden, New York City's chief medical examiner in
the '70s and now director of forensic sciences for the New York
State Police.
</P>
<P>
   He said Derby worked to improve care of battered children and to
prevent brain deterioration resulting from repeated sports injuries
_ the sort of decline experienced by Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   From 1965 to 1980, Derby was chief of the neurology service at
the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he was employed by the U.S. attorney's office for
the Eastern District of New York and the Medical Review Board of
the state's Commission of Correction, and was the city's assistant
medical examiner.

   LOS ANGELES _ Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan''
remained victorious for the fourth straight weekend at the box
office with an estimated $12.9 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,654 theaters
nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The performance gave DreamWorks' D-Day epic an impressive
$125.8 &UR;  &LR; million in its first 24 days as the weekend-to-weekend
decline registered a mere 24 &UR;  &LR; percent, indicating that ``Saving
Private Ryan'' has an excellent shot at becoming the 24th movie to
top the $200 &UR;  &LR; million mark in U.S. grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll continue to see the movie play well into the
fall,'' said distribution chief James Tharp. ``It won't be as
affected as other films by the start of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. agreed, noting that
``Saving Private Ryan'' will receive an additional boost near the
end of the year as Hollywood's awards season heats up. ``I think
$200 &UR;  &LR; million is in the bag already,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a solid second was 20th Century Fox's opening of ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back'' with $11.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,339 theaters.
The romance, with Angela Bassett involved with a man half her age,
overcame mixed reviews with a strong marketing effort, Rockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Box office tracker Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source,
said ``Stella'' will continue to draw well for several weeks but
noted its results could be held down by two openings starring
African-Americans next weekend _ New Line's ``Blade'' with Wesley
Snipes as a vampire fighter and Sony's ``Dance With Me'' with
Vanessa Williams as a salsa dancer. ``It's strange that these have
been bunched together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' debut of ``The Avengers'' came in third with
$10.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,466 theaters after the studio took the rare
step of not screening the action-fantasy for critics prior to the
opening. Reviews this weekend were brutal and the returns for the
$60 &UR;  &LR; million project, starring Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph
Fiennes, were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reviews don't matter much on a movie like this, but it's a
tough sell since the TV series was only on for a few years,'' said
Bucksbaum, who had been expecting a $15 &UR;  &LR; million opening.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's fifth weekend of ``There's Something About
Mary'' was an impressive fourth with $8.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,201 sites
to go past $91 &UR;  &LR; million. It lost only 8 &UR;  &LR; percent from the previous
weekend and will soon become the 175th film to top the
$100 &UR;  &LR; million mark in U.S. grosses, although it will be one of the
few to do so without ever leading the weekend box office.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `There's Something About Mary' is a low comedy that's really
worked well,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight 1998 titles to hit the $100 &UR;  &LR; million milestone are
``Deep Impact,'' ``Godzilla,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``Mulan,''
``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' edged a pair of entries in their second weekends _
Paramount's ``Snake Eyes'' with $8.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,718 sites and
Miramax's ``Halloween: H20'' with $8.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,669 sites. The
latter, with a slight $17 &UR;  &LR; million budget, is churning out profits
for parent Walt Disney Co. with $39.8 &UR;  &LR; million in its first 12
days.
</P>
<P>
   The slasher sequel was followed by a pair of family comedies
with solid returns in their third weekends _ Fox's ``Ever After''
with $5.8 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,058 locations and Disney's ``The Parent
Trap'' with $5.5 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,407 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Disney's seventh weekend of
``Armageddon'' with $4 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,786 theaters and Warner Bros.'
second weekend of ``The Negotiator'' with $3.98 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,032
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fifth weekend of ``The Mask of Zorro'' came in 11th with
$3.88 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,123 sites, followed by Warner's sixth weekend
of ``Lethal Weapon 4'' with $3.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1928 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' has reached $179.9 &UR;  &LR; million in 47 days and ranks
34th on the all-time domestic list behind ``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other new entries posted unimpressive results _ Miramax's
comedy sequel ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' fetched $2.7 &UR;  &LR; million at
1,669 theaters and PolyGram's Malaysian drama ``Return to
Paradise'' with $2.4 &UR;  &LR; million at 969 screens as the latter failed
to capitalize on generally positive reviews. Bucksbaum said
PolyGram may have been distracted by the pending sale of its film
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Searchlight's limited opening of offbeat comedy ``The Slums
of Beverly Hills'' generated strong returns with $135,000 at seven
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business has reached $4.2 &UR;  &LR; billion and is
8 &UR;  &LR; percent ahead of the same period last year. Summer business,
starting with the Memorial Day weekend, is at about $2 &UR;  &LR; billion, or
about 11 &UR;  &LR; percent up from the same period last year. The 1997
summer set a record of $2.22 &UR;  &LR; billion when it closed out on Labor
Day, while this summer will finish around $2.5 &UR;  &LR; billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall business is pretty good right now, considering that
it's the soft end of summer with the last hurrah for vacations,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's ``Titanic'' drew $715,000 at 594 theaters in its
35th weekend to push its overall domestic total to $598.9 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' will face competition next weekend from
``Dance With Me,'' ``Blade'' and two new comedies _ Warner's
``Wrongfully Accused'' with Leslie Nielsen in a spoof of ``The
Fugitive'' and Paramount's ``Dead Man on Campus.''

YOUNG FINDS RIGHT HOME RUN STROKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers usually worry when leadoff
man Eric Young hits a home run. It typically throws off his swing
for a while. They don't want the little man to think too big.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was different, especially after Young's eighth-inning
home run off Denny Neagle gave the Dodgers a 1-0 victory over the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It was his second in two games and gave him 14 hits in the
Dodgers' nine-game homestand. But in between home runs, Young flied
out four times and popped out once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team I play for, they always get on me about that,''
said Young, who has four this year and 37 in his six-year career.
``They think about it a lot. I guess I do, too. My game usually is
keeping the ball on the ground and making things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers were 13 for 66 (.197) with runners in
scoring position during the homestand, Young was not part of the
problem, having four consecutive multihit games until going 1 for 4
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He had a four-hit game against Florida on Tuesday, but No.2
hitter Mark Grudzielanek went 0 for 5 and the Dodgers lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as I have felt in a long time,'' said Young,
who has missed 32 starts this year with a strained left thigh.
``This is what we need to get things going, getting me on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said he could tell Young went for
a bigger swing after homering Saturday in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saying on the bench that he was starting to pull his
front arm out after the first home run,'' Hoffman said. ``But
today, he just laid the bat on the ball. It was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: The Dodgers failed to score in Darren Dreifort's
seven innings of work, giving him just 61 runs in 1641/3 innings
(3.34 runs per game), third lowest in the NL. Teammate Carlos Perez
has the lowest.... The victory snapped a losing streak against the
Braves at eight games. The two teams play next weekend in Atlanta
as part of a seven-game Dodgers trip that begins Tuesday night in
Pittsburgh.... When Andres Galarraga was hit by a Dreifort pitch in
the second inning, it was the 20th time that has happened this
season. That ties Jeff Blauser's single-season club record. He has
132 lifetime, most among active players.... Scott Radinsky began
the eighth inning and retired the Braves in order. Coming in,
Radinsky had allowed 17 of 34 inherited base runners to score....
Two hits by the Braves tied a season low.... They are 82-42, the
best record in the NL.

VIJAY DAY: A MAJOR VICTORY FOR SINGH 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ As a light mist fell over the Sahalee CC in
Sunday's final round of the 80th PGA Championship amid the towering
pine trees, Vijay Singh of the Fiji Islands realized his finest
moment of a long and dedicated career when he resolutely carved out
a 68 for a 9-under 271 to win his first major title out here in the
suburbs of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This was a triumph for hard work, because nobody has spent more
time on a practice tee or rearranging furniture in a motel room to
practice putting than Singh. He has been seen on practice tees as
darkness settled in, a solitary presence. He has won five times on
the US PGA Tour, but victories also have came in South Africa,
Germany, Nigeria, Sweden, Zimbabwe, Morocco, and Malaysia. Now he
has joined the list of golf's major champions.
</P>
<P>
   Executing a marvelous shot out of the woods on the 14th hole
that drew its way onto the green to save par, Singh took it from
there to beat Steve Stricker (70_273) by two shots in the first PGA
Championship in this region since Ben Hogan won in 1946 at Portland
GC in Oregon. Steve Elkington, who has struggled because of sinus
problems and injuries, made a bold bid to stay in the hunt but a
bogey 5 on the final hole brought him in third on 67_274 totals.
</P>
<P>
   There was an early burst by Mark O'Meara to write history when
he started off par, eagle, par, par, birdie. He'd won the Masters
and the British Open to become the oldest (41) to win two majors in
the same year, and just Hogan in 1953 had won three. Reality set in
when he bogeyed the sixth, seventh, and eighth holes. O'Meara's
eagle putt was 50 feet, and a closing birdie putt on the 17th was
the same distance. ``It's a little disappointing,'' he said, ``but
that's the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, who was taught the game by his airplane technician father
and took his first job as a professional in Borneo, rarely faltered
as he marched to his first major, with wife Ardena and 8-year-old
son Qass in the gallery. He and Stricker, whose wife and former
caddie Nicki is expecting their first child at home in Edgerton,
Wis., engaged in an enthralling duel that was entered by Elkington
before he finished with the bogey on 18.
</P>
<P>
   Singh staked his ground with a birdie on the par-3 fifth when he
hit a 6-iron to 4 feet to pull even with Stricker. Singh took the
lead on the sixth when Stricker missed an 8-foot par-saving putt.
The lead became two when Stricker pulled a 4-iron on the par-3
ninth and bogeyed. After they each birdied the 11th, Singh bogeyed
out of the left trap on the 12th to let Stricker back in.
</P>
<P>
   Then it became match play, with Singh's marvelous save on the
14th preserving his 1-up advantage. After they both birdied the
15th and penciled in pars on the 16th, Stricker did himself in when
he couldn't get up and down out of a sand trap on the 17th, where
he'd taken a double bogey Friday. ``I had an opportunity to put a
little bit of pressure on 17, because I had the tee there first,''
he said. ``I didn't hit a very good shot, and that was the turning
point when he made the up-and-down and I missed my par.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh played the treacherous 18th with a two-putt par, and he
finally broke into a smile as he approached the green. ``This is a
dream come true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit of a struggle at times,'' said Stricker.
``I thought I hung in there pretty well and I gave myself a chance
down to the end. That's really what I set out to do. Just to have a
chance. I fought hard. I didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was simply a case of Singh finally realizing all the promise
of a career that has spanned the globe, evoking memories of seeing
him on a practice tee when everybody else had left the course
except the media. He started to putt cross-handed at the Western
Open, and he estimated he's tried between six and eight putters
this year. ``I think I'll stay with the one I have now,'' he said.
The putter was his magic wand with the PGA Championship on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The shot of the tournament was the one out of the trees that
Singh hit on the 14th. ``I got away with one on 11 when I pushed my
second shot to the right,'' said Singh. ``Then I hit a bad shot on
12 and another on 13. When I hit that tee shot on 14, my caddie
(David Renwick) said, `Hey come on. You can do better than this.
You're going to lose if you keep doing what you're doing.' So it
wasn't a difficult shot out of the trees. I just had to hook it
about 50 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Elkington was knocking on the door, but the finishing bogey
ended his chances. ``I think if I had made birdie at 18 that would
have forced Vijay to make par to win,'' said Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to hit a good drive. It's just a very hard tee shot
for me, because I fade the ball.'' He yanked a short putt to the
left for bogey. ``I wouldn't say I'm satisfied,'' said Elkington,
``but I think I'm over the hump.''

   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ For much of the week, the concession stands

   For de Swardt, it will be a dream because she was down, 1-5, in
the third set, with her opponent serving, and somehow won. For
Schett it will be a nightmare _ although she denied as much _
because she gave away her first WTA title as that 5-1 lead melted
with her game and her psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 5-1, I thought I was going to be in the showers soon,''
said de Swardt, the South African who suddenly was reborn, revived,
and resurgent as her opponent went soft. ``But when I was down,
5-1, I said, `I'm going to make her earn it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And when Schett's collapse was done, losing the match and the
title, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5, the Austrian had one more unfortunate
site and score to add to her litany of collapses. ``I was once up,
5-1, in Boston with my serve in the third set ...'' she now can add
to her blowing third-set leads to Jana Novotna and Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario in Berlin, and how she once had six match points against
Monica Seles in Madrid. Losing all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are leading, 5-1, with your serve in the third set of
the final in a tournament, yes, you are mad at yourself,'' said
Schett, a 22-year-old from Innsbruck. ``You are losing the match
that way and it is truly disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Comebacks from 5-1 in the third set of a title match are as rare
as a one-handed backhand on the women's tour, but given the
circumstances of what happened just before Schett took that 5-1
lead, such a comeback _ or collapse _ seemed well nigh impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game of the final set, Schett broke de Swardt's
serve when de Swardt double-faulted at 30-40, a line judge calling
the serve long. The South African was irate, hollered out to the
chair, threw her racket, and then fumed for the next several games
as Schett's lead grew to 5-1. De Swardt not only seemed physically
wiped out from the 90-degree heat, but emotionally spent. Schett
seemed in full control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was most upset,'' said de Swardt. ``It was a really big
point and I felt it could have been in. It could have touched the
line. I was really upset and it took me a game or two to get over
it. I was really fuming.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schett squandered her opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attacking at 5-1, Schett ``became more tentative and
tried going for shots she hadn't been trying,'' said de Swardt. She
never had played against Schett _ ``I'd never even seen her play''
_ but had heard that Schett had trouble finishing off foes in the
third set. So it was de Swardt who became the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   When she began her serve at 5-1, Schett recalled, ``I felt I was
concentrated still and I felt I was going to win this. No, I
wouldn't say it was nerves. No, I wouldn't say it was
overconfidence. I wasn't aggressive enough; that was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-1, Schett went on, ``I was thinking, `I am going to serve
next and I am going to win this game.' That's because one game
before I had won my serve pretty easily. `It's going to be my
title,' that's what I thought. I was pretty confident.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schett had no killer instinct, even though her coach, Tom
Prerovsky, kept hollering out to her in German to be more
aggressive. Instead, Schett was the opposite, visibly wilting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aggressive enough with my serve ... I was just
putting the ball into the court and she was aggressive,'' said
Schett. ``And that was the mistake. I would say she was more
aggressive then because she had nothing to lose then and playing
very powerful, especially her serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett gave away her serve, then could not break de Swardt and
next gave away another serve game to bring the score to 5-4. ``At
5-2, I still was confident,'' said Schett, ``and then she was
starting to serve better again and I had no chances when she was
serving. That's why she was able to put pressure on me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett's last chance came on de Swardt's serve at 5-4 when she
had a match point and de Swardt was down to her second serve. But a
hint of how much an emotional roller-coaster this match was for
both women came later when de Swardt could not remember that Schett
ever had a match point. ``I don't remember a match point for her,''
said de Swardt.
</P>
<P>
   Schett remembered the game well, ``because it was 5-4, 40-love
for her on her serve and I came back to have match point,'' she
said. ``But the match point I could not do anything ... she hit a
forehand winner and I had no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-5, Schett was down to a shell of herself and de Swardt
broke serve and won the game with a cross-court forehand winner.
Serving at 6-5, de Swardt blasted three aces and the agony _
mercifully _ was over for Schett and the ecstasy began for de
Swardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not thinking of past times,'' Schett said, when asked if
her past failures in similar situations were on her mind during
Sunday's slide. And she said she would not torture herself by
thinking about Sunday ``because there is another tournament
(Monday) where ... where? ... in Montreal, and I will think of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lesson from Boston, a hurt that even a $13,500 runner-up
check could not salve, is this, said the young Austrian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well ... yes, next time I am leading, 5-1, in the third set, I
am just trying to keep on playing aggressive. And be concentrated
until the last point is made.''
</P>

KHANNOUCHI LEAVES GRIEF, FIELD BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
 RACE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Mass. _ One week ago, Khalid Khannouchi wasn't much in
a running mood. He had just gotten word that his older brother,
Said, had died of a heart attack at his home in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife said, ``Go to Falmouth,'' and his family said, ``Do
it for him.'' So Khannouchi, the Moroccan native who now lives in
Ossining, N.Y., took a deep breath, drove to the Cape, and Sunday
successfully defended his title in the 26th annual Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care Falmouth Road Race. His time of 31 minutes 48 seconds
was 10 seconds better than last year's and third best in race
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two goals here,'' Khannouchi said. ``To win Falmouth and
to win it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 9,000 runners set out in front of Captain Kidd's bar in
Woods Hole at 10 in the morning, Khannouchi was just a face among
the pack of lead runners. The men ran a 4:37 first mile, and as the
7.1-mile course wound its way past the boats in the harbor and
along the beach, the elite runners pulled away from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the sun wasn't blazing, the 82-degree heat and
humidity took its toll. The lead pack of 24 dwindled to 20, then to
a dozen, and by the time the runners had hit the 6-mile mark only
seven were leading the way. And nobody seemed willing to break away
until Khannouchi decided to make his trademark kick.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the runners headed uphill, Khannouchi pulled away,
virtually leaving the others in the dust. Pumping his arms and
pushing his legs as fast and rhythmically as he had the entire
race, Khannouchi kept going until he saw the giant American flag
hanging over the road in Falmouth Heights. By then it was sealed _
the No. 1 he wore as last year's winner was his again.
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds behind was Kenyan John Korir, and two seconds
behind Korir was Kenyan Luka Cherono.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi said that even though the $10,000 prize was sweet, it
was a hard race to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was emotionally upset, because Said was the oldest and
smartest of the family,'' said Khannouchi, one of his family's six
children. ``I was almost going to cancel, but my wife and family
told me, `You've got to keep running normal and to keep up your
training.' They said, `Said wants to see you as a great runner, you
have to do it for him.' So I was running and his spirit was with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that spirit, not to mention Khannouchi's incredible surge
at the end, that pulled him through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident in my kick, and this year I've won several
races using that kick,'' Khannouchi said, noting that he sprinted
out Sunday sooner than he usually does. ``But I made the move early
to make sure I was going to win. I made a move then to secure the
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the race has a decidedly hometown flavor, from the
impromptu bands set up on the side of the road to the spectators
ringing cowbells or spraying hoses on the runners, the
international field is making its mark. The top 14 finishers were
from Africa, 11 from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jacobs, of Rockford, Ill., was the first American to cross
the line, which earned him $4,000. It was a move up the ladder for
Jacobs, 34, who was the third American in 1996, and the second last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he looks forward to the speedy Kenyan influence
``because I go to these races to push myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Khannouchi seemed to emerge from the shadows of the pack
Sunday, but the spotlight has been shining on him since last
October, when he ran his first marathon in Chicago. Not only did he
win with a time of 2 hours 7 minutes 10 seconds, but it was the
fastest marathon ever run in the United States, and just 20 seconds
off the world record.
</P>
<P>
   So it shoudn't have surprised him to hear chants of ``Go
Khalid'' from the thousands of fans lining the course.
</P>
<P>
   And he had his personal rooting section, his wife, Sandra.
</P>
<P>
   She said that even though she's run Falmouth before, a bout of
Achilles' tendinitis has sidelined her _ to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start the race, because I bring him good luck,'' she
said, standing behind her husband and rubbing his neck after the
race. ``So I ran about 400 meters, then got on a bike and rode to
the finish and got here three minutes before he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the good luck charm worked.

AVERY WEARING THIN IN ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Today's quiz: What Red Sox manager said the
following? ``I don't make decisions about the pitchers on my staff,
they make them for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If your first guess was current Boston skipper Jimy Williams,
you're wrong. One might have thought that after watching Steve
Avery suffer on the mound again Sunday at Fenway Park. But the man
who said it was Ralph Houk, who used the line almost daily when
evaluating his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Houk's thinking was that if a pitcher looked horrible, he might
just be horrible. If he showed flawed mechanics, and had more walks
than strikeouts, he just might not be very good. Houk was right
about a lot of things, and Williams may be wise to consider his
words of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he may, Avery can't seem to get off that roller-coaster
ride that is spoiling his bid to return to the successful form he
showed for years with Atlanta. Meanwhile, Pete Schourek, newly
acquired from Houston, is ready and waiting. He may get his chance
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner the better after seeing Avery give up six more earned
runs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ```We'll decide that later,'' said Williams after Boston's 6-3
loss to Minnesota. ``Whatever we decide is best for our staff is
what we'll do. If there is a change, we'll let you know in good
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the time is now, and not just because of what happened
Sunday. Yes, the Red Sox are 11-5 this season when Avery starts.
And yes, he had a nice streak after overhauling his mechanics,
which earned him the praise of teammates and fans. But recently
he's struggled, and how can a team fighting for a playoff spot
continue to go with a pitcher who after a year and a half in Boston
still is lacking the killer instinct that was part of his
personality in Atlanta. Sunday he had only 11 of 22 first-pitch
strikes in a 77-pitch outing. He fell behind hitters repeatedly,
walking three and striking out just one.
</P>
<P>
   That's no way to stay ahead of the pack in the American League
wild-card race. With 41 games left, the Sox need to be able to
count on their Nos. 4 and 5 starters as well as the big three of
Pedro Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, and Tim Wakefield. If they should
come up short, as was the case in the four-game split with the
lowly Twins, it puts tremendous pressure on the Red Sox' bullpen.
Boston's 6 1/2-game lead in the wild-card race is hardly
comfortable. The Rangers come to town for two games starting Monday
night. Anaheim, Seattle, Toronto, New York, and Baltimore remain on
the schedule. Should one be worried? Damn right.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're trying to do is go out and play for today,'' said
Williams before Sunday's loss. He was looking for innings from
Avery and didn't get them. ``You can't look back. You look for
today. You can't panic. Fans can look ahead. For us, it doesn't
matter. We just go out and play the schedule. At the end of the
season, you look around and see where we are. Our goals remain
small. You can't play 162 games in one day. You can only play
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery didn't stick around long enough to discuss his poor
outing, opting instead for a postgame party. Pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan didn't have the luxury of ducking the media. He merely
confirmed what they had all seen, calling it a bad outing by a
veteran lefthander who should be doing better. After all, the Twins
are not the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous three times, he pitched OK,'' said Kerrigan.
``But today he regressed. He went back to his old overhand
delivery. He couldn't find the slot from which to throw the ball,
and started wrapping it around his head. Instead of that good
sinking action, there was a cut to his pitches and they went into a
righthanded hitter. In his slot, the balls go away, usually.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was kinder. He put his neck on the line this year by
sticking with Avery. But two steps backward is hardly progress, and
he has to know this.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compete,'' he said, ``sometimes you revert back and
you don't realize you're in the same old slots. If he stays with
that new slot, he can be very consistent with his location and he
can stay ahead of the hitter. His pitches are located a little
better. His command is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek says he's ready if the call comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I can continue to throw and stay sharp, I'll be all
right,'' said Schourek. ``I was throwing decent in Houston. With
Randy Johnson, we had too many guys in the same slot. I'm working
out of the bullpen, and if that's where they want me, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Schourek as anything but a starter probably won't last
much longer, anyway, says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take care of it the best way we know how,'' he said.
``If you use him out of the bullpen too much, you have to rest him.
We'll try to do what we think is the best way for us to use him and
win as many games as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't be too surprised if nothing is done right away. Avery
still has a lot of respect and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard,'' said Martinez. ``We as pitchers understand
all the things he's going through, especially the mind game. At
this level, it's particularly hard. I think he deserves some credit
for the things he's done for himself and/or the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Saberhagen: ``I was very surprised he adapted so quickly.
He had to go from throwing all your career one way to trying to
change it to another. The thing that is hurting him now is pitching
from behind and the bases on balls and being a little wild. That's
all a part of mechanics, and the mechanics are what he's trying to
adjust to.''

MILTON THROWS RED SOX FOR LOOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ OK, so setting the '27 and '98 Yankees aside for a
moment, every team hits one of these stretches, maybe even two or
three of them, over the mind-altering, body-beating course of the
162-game season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were rubbed out by the Twins, 6-3, Sunday at the
Fens, done in by the sharp pitching of Minnesota starter Eric
Milton and the el-foldo show of their own Steve Avery (3 IP, 9 H, 6
ER, every pitch a battle).
</P>
<P>
   In and of itself, no big deal. But matched up with Saturday's
3-2 loss to the Twins, and considering how no one in the Sox'
rotation right now appears capable of turning off the shower (never
mind being sent there early), there's the doomsday inclination to
hang one giant ``Uh-oh'' over the Back Bay with six weeks still
left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be summer in this city without at least reaching for
the alarm. The Townies still own a 6 1/2-game lead over Texas in
their bid for a wild-card spot, which means they should clinch a
berth in the AL postseason if they play somewhere around .550 ball
the rest of the way. Lapse into .500 or less, keep breaking even as
they did in their four-game set with the Twins, and they'll just
disappear with the rest of their failed forefathers of the last 80
years. Oh, and Babe Ruth died 50 years ago Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's time now for the Sox to separate themselves from the rest
of the pack, or risk seeing the ghost of Bucky Dent tiptoe his way
down Ted Williams Way and stick his nose over the Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stay strong mentally,'' said Sox slugger Mo Vaughn,
stymied, like all his teammates, by Milton's no-hit pitching into
the sixth inning. ``We have to have a strong attitude, and we'll
break this thing (Monday night).''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 30,893 watched Avery retire leadoff hitter Otis Nixon
on a routine pop to start the afternoon, but it quickly turned into
three-plus innings of intense labor for the lefthander. Eight
hitters came to the plate in the first and two runs came across,
Marty Cordova trotting in with the 2-0 lead when Avery walked Alex
Ochoa with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, another pair came across, after it briefly
appeared a Matt Lawton double-play grounder would short-circuit the
inning for the Twins. No such luck. Pat Meares scored on the DP,
and the next hitter, Cordova, knocked in Nixon for the 4-0 lead
with a double past first base. The Twins weren't exactly hammering
Avery (8-5), but their squib hits and his lack of control proved a
lethal combination _ so deadly that the Sox brass soon might have
to bump Avery to the bullpen and give Pete Schourek a start.
</P>
<P>
   After some technical talk from pitching coach Joe Kerrigan after
the second inning _ a chat in the tunnel about release point in his
delivery _ Avery made short work of the third inning, allowing only
a Terry Steinbach single. But the Twins' fourth started this way:
Nixon single, Brent Gates double, wild pitch (scoring Nixon),
Lawton double. The Twins had a half-dozen runs in the bank and
Avery was cashiered for Carlos Reyes. Day done.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the masterful Milton, only 23 years old, wouldn't let
the Sox near a base after allowing a Darren Lewis leadoff walk in
the first. In fact, he set down the next 15 straight hitters,
mostly on strikeouts and fly balls, until Jason Varitek knocked him
for a leadoff single in the sixth. He made it into the seventh, at
which point the Twins' own parade of bullpen backups _ Mike
Trombley, Eddie Guardado, Hector Carrasco, and Rick Aguilera (think
'86 Mets, Bill Buckner, ... help!) _ carried it to the win column.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get back here (Monday night) with (Bret Saberhagen),''
said Vaughn, the Sox now 71-50 with about 25 percent (41 games) of
the season to go. ``We'll be all right ... everyone's going to have
their lapses.''
</P>
<P>
   They say that everywhere. Except New York. The question now is,
who'll stop the rain?

PATRIOTS HOPE TO FIND THEIR WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Amid the chaos of this city of nearly 17 million,
the Patriots are trying to find some peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Winless in two exhibition games, the Patriots not only are
trying to beat the Dallas Cowboys (also 0-2), but are trying to
look good before national television and international audiences.
</P>
<P>
   They will be trying to reaffirm to themselves, their fans, and
the pundits that they are one of the elite teams in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going there to get better,'' said free safety Willie
Clay. ``We're going to make progress. We want a situation where
every game we make some progress and then peak in time for the
start of the season. That's the goal of the preseason. We haven't
looked that good so far, but we've been practicing well and I think
we're ready to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams captain Larry Whigham said, ``I try to win every
game, preseason or regular season. We'd like something to show for
all the work we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp ended Saturday in Smithfield, R.I., with the
Patriots still not making noticeable progress on their two biggest
issues: the offense, especially the new timed passing game, and the
right cornerback spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to emphasize the run in this game,'' said coach
Pete Carroll. ``We're seeing things that we're very encouraged
about, but so far we haven't seen those things in the games. This
is a good opportunity for us to have success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team needs to get something out of this. It's not so much
winning, it's about getting our first unit some valuable experience
out there against the type of defense we haven't seen the past
couple of weeks. Dallas poses new problems for us. They're similar
to Miami, so this will be a big test for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will be playing at an elevation in Azteca Stadium
that will provide excellent practice for the season opener at
Denver in three weeks. Mexico City's elevation is 7,350 feet,
Denver's is 5,280. There's also a lot of smog in Mexico City, and
it's hot and muggy, so the conditions should be taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using the conditions as an excuse,'' said Carroll.
``It's the same for both teams. We're hoping our players adapt to
the conditions quickly and then forget about it and go out and
accomplish the things we're trying to get done this week. The crowd
(expected to be about 108,000) should be more of a Dallas crowd, so
we'll be in a hostile environment. We'll have to contend with all
of those things, so I think this is a great situation for us to
have to overcome some adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will also be an experimental one for instant replay.
When there's a call being questioned by the officials, play will
stop, the replay will be viewed, and the decision made by the
referee after consulting with the other officials. This should
prolong what could be a long night.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he will use his starting units on offense and
defense for at least the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots spent many more hours last week working on the
passing game. During Saturday's walk-through, Drew Bledsoe threw
the ball very well and the timing seemed OK. The Patriots hope
Bledsoe can get the ball into the hands of Terry Glenn and Ben
Coates often in the first half, while also giving a lot of carries
to running backs Sedrick and Harold Shaw and Derrick Cullors.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said there will be some substitutions on the first-team
offense and defense as he would like to see how some of the backups
perform with the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Troy Brown, who will do the bulk of the punt
returning, will be on the field on third down, as will Vincent
Brisby. The Patriots also hope to get rookie Tony Simmons some reps
with the first team.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are expected to continue to use their regular
defense and save their blitz packages for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   On the defensive line, Mark Wheeler and Chad Eaton will start
inside in the absence of Henry Thomas, who still is recovering from
a root canal that required nine stitches. Willie McGinest and
Ferric Collons will start at the ends, but former Boston College
star Chris Sullivan and rookie Greg Spires (if his ankle is better)
will also see time at end. Spires is expected to see some
third-down action with the first unit to test his pass rushing
skills.
</P>
<P>
   The key position, right corner, will be manned by Chris Canty,
the team's 1997 first-round draft pick. Canty needs to show
improvement. It doesn't appear that this year's No. 1 pick, Tebucky
Jones, will play the position because of turf toe. That will give
Steve Lofton, Mark Tate, Kato Serwanga, and Terry Billups plenty of
opportunity to earn backup spots.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a big night for players on the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Anthony Ladd, one of the stars of training camp and a
favorite of the coaching staff, could do wonders for his situation
with a good game. It's also prime time for Tony Gaiter, last year's
sixth-round pick out of Miami, who needs to show his moves and
speed on kickoffs, punts, and as a receiver quickly. Veteran
defensive lineman Mike Jones also appears to be on the bubble and
could help his cause with a big game.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a battle for the starting receiver job between
Brisby and Shawn Jefferson; on special teams between linebackers
Vernon Crawford and Bernard Russ; and at right guard between Todd
Rucci and Heath Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   The game also will pit Dallas coach Chan Gailey's new offense
against that of Ernie Zampese, who is now running the old Cowboys
offense in New England. Despite his public words, Zampese, who came
under fire in Dallas last year and was dismissed after coach Barry
Switzer was fired, undoubtedly would like a strong effort by his
offense to stick it to his old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our offense to do well because we need to start doing
well. For no other reason,'' said Zampese.

WINNER SERVES UP MEMORABLE FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-DE SWARDT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ She was trailing, 5-1, in the third set, one
game from losing the Boston Cup championship Sunday, and Mariaan de
Swardt wanted to make seventh seed Barbara Schett earn the title.
She didn't want to give up any free points.
</P>
<P>
   There was one match point for Schett, in the 10th game on de
Swardt's serve, but the unseeded de Swardt hit a forehand winner up
the line. Then came another forehand winner, followed by a service
winner to the forehand.
</P>
<P>
   Schett, with two service games for the match, never was able to
finish it off. In the 12th game, de Swardt hit three aces to the
backhand on the deuce side, capturing the match, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4),
7-5, before 1,700 at Babson College.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game, de Swardt put everything into her first
serves. ``I was going for it,'' she said. ``I think she was leaning
to the left. If she was going to break me, she was going to have to
come and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett was nervous, something de Swardt could tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she got a little tentative, a little nervous, and I
said, `Well, I'm going to see if I can try and hold my serve one
more time and go from there,''' said de Swardt, ranked No. 50 in
the world. ``I actually wanted to make her serve it out one more
time and she started going for shots that she didn't go for before.
When she was up, 5-1, she started going for too much and she made a
few errors and gave me a few free points. I just took my chances
from there on.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was going for a lot of shots and before she didn't. She
was going for a lot of lines and she made a few bad errors. I kind
of sensed she was a little anxious so I just tried to make her hit
the winners. I hung in there, just making her play.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, de Swardt held on to the fence to catch a
breather. That was in the 11th game of the third set, after she hit
a drop shot to go up, 6-5, on Schett's serve. It was 87 degrees,
with high humidity, and that played a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was running me all over the court, and I was so tired and
I was making some unforced errors,'' said de Swardt. ``I don't
think it was as much the heat as it was me being tired. I've played
a lot of tennis the last two or three days. I knew I'd do a lot of
running. I've played a lot of three-set (matches), but I dug it out
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone plays to de Swardt's backhand, on which she
usually slices, and that's what Schett did. De Swardt wasn't able
to get to the net, Schett keeping her deep near or behind the
baseline. Especially in the first set and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that I gave her too many free points on my
backhand,'' de Swardt said. ``I didn't make her work as much as I
would have liked her to. She made me work. I wasn't moving as well
as I have been the last two days. I wasn't hitting my backhand that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But she recovered, and now has $27,000 to spend for taking the
title.

ROCKING-CHAIR WIN FOR GRANNY 
</HEADLINE>
 DERBY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REVERE, Mass. _ It was the perfect match, a rail-runner and the
No. 1 box, and it led to a rapidly run victory by Granny in the
$100,000 Wonderland Derby Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A talented invader from Mile High in Colorado, Granny loves the
inside and the rest of the field was in trouble as early as
Thursday afternoon when trainer Rebecca Chamberlain, representing
the Pat Collins Kennel, pulled the No. 1 pill for Granny at the box
draw.
</P>
<P>
   Backed down to 8-5 ($5.20 to win), the favorite did not
disappoint, outdueling Greys Freckles, an 8-1 shot from box No. 5,
for the early lead, and drawing away along the fence to tally by 3
1/2 lengths. Greys Betsy Ross, an outstanding dog from St.
Petersburg, Fla., who had been the top Derby qualifier, broke last
from box No. 8 as the 5-2 second choice and fought her way clear to
nip Greys Freckles for second at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-8 quiniela paid $8.60, the 1-8-5 trifecta was worth
$72.80, and the 1-8-5-6 superfecta, with 38-1 Dornsife finishing a
distant fourth, returned $284. Rounding out the field, in order of
finish, were Jauss, Florida Sharp, Jimbo's Chelsie, and Glowing
Gem. The time of 38.10 over the 2,045 feet of the Revere Course was
the second-fastest in 64 runnings of the Derby, behind Bartie's
38.04 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in a race this size, when you're facing dogs of
this caliber, the No. 1 box is the box to have,'' said Larry
Chamberlain, who assists wife Rebecca. ``I don't care if the dog is
an inside runner or a wide runner, the one hole is the best hole.
That's just my opinion. If you've got the one hole, you've got the
lane if you can beat the box. And Granny's got good speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Granny is owned by Floyd Gibson of Denver, who flew in for the
occasion. When asked what he did for a living, Gibson said
something about ``a concrete mixer.'' A couple of writers initially
thought he owned a construction company, but further questioning
revealed he drives a concrete mixer and is a regular guy who grew
to love dog racing as a fan. Granny is Gibson's only active
greyhound, though he now owns eight puppies sired by Trojan
Episode, Granny's father.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who began attending races in 1978 and slowly developed a
desire to be an owner, was quietly emotional after accepting the
$60,000 winner's share. His eyes teared as he recalled how he had
named Granny, whom he personally picked out from her litter, for
his late mother, Della, because that's what the kids had called
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to fly, but I did it for Granny. This one is for
my mother,'' said Gibson. ``The only time I ever flew before was
when I went to Germany when I was in the army. I thought that was
enough. I'm not even going to get on the plane to go back if it's
raining.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gibson does get on the plane, his pockets will be a lot
heavier thanks to his very professional, and aggressive, greyhound.
``She's a great dog in the kennel,'' said Larry Chamberlain. ``She
does everything she's supposed to do. She doesn't cause any
trouble, she fits right in. There's one thing, though. We have to
feed her first.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Derby drew 1,892. The modest crowd was enthusiastic,
however, and there was a discernible buzz in the plant. The total
handle on the 19-race card was $466,735, the largest of the year,
with $228,314 bet on-track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Derby is more a race now for people who follow the
greyhounds,'' said Wonderland assistant general manger Ron Wohlen.
``One thing you get with a big race is they yell. They cheer on
their dogs. This race has an identity and the dogs in it have an
identity. The fans actually call the dogs by name instead of
yelling: `Come on, 1-8.'''

PRIVATE RYAN LESSONS HELPED SAVE JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Randy Johnson has become a temporary Texan, there is a
prevailing theory that the Big Ugly will soon be a permanent
resident of The Big State.
</P>
<P>
   As a free-agent-to-be, Johnson could stay in Houston, where he's
the hottest thing with the populace since mosquito repellent. Or
...
</P>
<P>
   How about Randy in Arlington? Even as we speak, Tom Hicks might
have some hip pocket plans for Johnson, come winter.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to describe Johnson _ best pitcher in ball;
miserable human being; head case; quitter in Seattle this season
while being paid $6 million. There is some truth in all of those.
Plus, Johnson will be 36 next season, and has a history of back
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Considering everything, would you want him on your team?
</P>
<P>
   ``Depends,'' answered Nolan Ryan. ``Depends on if you are
serious about wanting to win the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, of course, is the Rangers' part-time goodwill ambassador
and a full-time banker, rancher, and whatever-he-wants-to-be. But
ironically, Ryan is also the best thing to ever happen to Randy
Johnson, or so says Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan denies it, and tries to low-key the idea, partly because
he knows it's sort of a sore subject for past and present Rangers'
baseball people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to help a fellow pitcher, but my role wasn't
that large,'' said Ryan, laughing. This was late last week after
Nolan had paid a visit to the Astrodome to watch Johnson pitch.
Following that Thursday game, Randy spent more time with the media
talking about Nolan than himself.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Johnson's career has been resurrected in Houston.
Which is a nice tie-in to the fact that six years ago his career
was saved in Alvin, some 30 miles down the road from the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But it was under another baseball big top when the connection
between Randy Johnson and Nolan Ryan actually started. Ryan and the
Rangers were at the Kingdome in Seattle in 1992 when word came to
the visiting clubhouse that a Mariners' pitcher needed Ryan's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened a lot, and I always agreed to do it,'' said
Nolan, who would retire after the '93 season. ``I told Randy to
meet me in the outfield early in batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And they talked, and talked, and talked. Finally, it was time
for pregame infield. So they went into the clubhouse tunnel and
continued talking. Ryan even suggested Johnson also seek advice
from Tom House, the Rangers pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Johnson's career was going nowhere. He was in the
midst of an eight-game losing streak and after five years, wasn't
even a .500 pitcher in the majors. Immense talent has been
swallowed up by inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly when I'm asked to talk to other pitchers, it's like a
five-minute conversation,'' Ryan said. ``They come with questions,
but they have their own answers. They hear me, but they aren't
listening. Randy was totally different. He truly wanted a different
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan gave pitching pointers. So did House. ``Seattle had a bad
team and Randy was going bad ... I didn't think a thing about it,''
Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Johnson came into old Arlington Stadium and
struck out 18 Rangers. ``I'm catching hell from the hitters in the
dugout,'' remembered a grinning Ryan. `` `Way to go, Nolan,' ''
they kept telling me. And House stayed hidden down at the end of
the dugout. I got no support from him.''
</P>
<P>
   During that off-season, Ryan and House invited Johnson to Alvin
to participate in the filming of a how-to-pitch video for
youngsters. On the high school diamond (Nolan Ryan Field), Johnson
received a couple of days of private tutoring from Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   In the '93 season, Randy went 19-8 and his career began a
skyrocket ride. Only this season did it bottom out again in Seattle
as Johnson seemed to mentally fold due to unpleasant contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's ``bad guy'' reputation also grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that at all,'' Ryan said. ``People look at
Randy on the mound and see a dominator and an intimidator. They
think that's also the real-life Randy Johnson. But I see him as a
sensitive person, who can have his feelings hurt, and he takes a
lot of things personally. There are times when things boil over
inside, and he reacts. To me, however, Randy is a good guy, and one
of the true great pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember this _ Doug Melvin and Tom Hicks will be asking Ryan
for his opinion on free-agent Randy Johnson. Plus, Johnson might be
asking Ryan for more career advice. Such as living conditions in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers are interested this winter _ and they will be _
then Nolan could give them a quick inside track to Johnson's
signature.

UNTIL TYSON RETURNS TO RING, JOKES ARE ON BOXING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The satellite dish is out, so I can't get Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   But good news _ there's always boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is the comic relief of the sports scene. It is the
sporting world's peep show. Its 10-car collision. Its cousin Bluto.
It is the No. 1 reason why the civilized British believe this whole
New World thing was a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't all about Mike Tyson, though it could be. Tyson made
news last week by withdrawing his application for a New Jersey
boxing license, opting instead for reapplying in Nevada, where his
permit was revoked 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Finkel, serving as Tyson's spokesman, had told reporters
that his man was ``hungry to fight again.''
</P>
<P>
   Our ears immediately perked, so to speak. And I promise not to
tell any more bad biting jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, however, prompted more than curious speculation when he
suddenly withdrew his New Jersey application. Published reports
there suggest that Tyson felt his request was going to be denied
and didn't want to deal with the tidal wave of ``Tyson Rejected''
headlines. Or, then again, maybe he was afraid that if he got
reinstated, he'd be asked to appear on that Magic Johnson show.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't bode well when a Jersey state senator, William
Gormley, who happens to be the brother of one of the board members
considering the fighter's reinstatement, came out and publicly said
Tyson shouldn't be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   But this was supposed to be Atlantic City, N.J., which is sort
of like Vegas on Prozac. Boardwalk moneybags Donald Trump
reportedly was ready to roll out the red carpet for Tyson. Trump's
millions could have staged the next Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try to understand Mike Tyson. He is boxing's poster
child. He has been a childhood thug, nearly an Olympian (Fort
Worth, 1984), a car-crasher, head-basher, topless dancer fondler,
beauty contestant rapist, ex-convict and ex-champion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet _ and here's the scary part _ outside of Muhammad Ali, Tyson
owns the most recognized name and face in boxing on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The sport needs him. The current champ, Holyfield, had to cancel
a summer title defense against Henry Akinwande. The reason given
was that Akinwande contracted the hepatitis-B virus. Curiously,
that diagnosis came one day after reports said that pay-per-view
sales for the fight were pitifully lagging and that the fight
loomed as a financial bust.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same sport, of course, where Roberto Duran _ the
real one, not his grandson _ has signed on to fight William Joppy,
who was born in 1970, three years after Duran started boxing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same sport where George Foreman and Larry Holmes are
scheduled to fight in January. (Supply own joke here).
</P>
<P>
   And this is also the sport where Bonecrusher Smith, age 45,
squared off against Joe Bugner, age withheld pending carbon-dating,
last month in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Missed that one? Well, it didn't last long. On Bonecrusher's
first attempted punch of the night, he dislocated his shoulder and
the bout had to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week came word that Irish promoters had put up a purse
of one million British pounds ($1.65 million) for that ``Lord of
the Dance'' guy to fight. It seems that Michael Flatley claims to
have boxed when he was growing up in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   But the Irish matchmakers are serious. They think it would be
``good fun.'' And I'm not so sure I myself wouldn't pay to watch
Flatley get clogged and flogged around the ring. At least make him
button his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, boxing.
</P>
<P>
   It needs Tyson, because without him, there is only an abyss of
Andrew Gulotas, Michael Moorers, Bonecrusher Smiths and Vaughn
Beans to look forward to. Bean has been announced as the latest
opponent for Holyfield, with the bout set for Sept. 19 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bean _ Butterbean? Mr. Bean? _ showed up for the press
conference wearing a red turban. At the same event in Atlanta, an
executive from the Showtime network, Jay Larkin, took the
microphone and tried to make funny business of the imminent arrival
of the Holyfield family's next baby. Noting that the champ and his
wife were fond of names beginning in ``E,'' the Showtime exec
suggested they name the kid ``E-coli.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is where more than 20 children were stricken recently
with E-coli bacteria, leading to one death.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, boxing.
</P>
<P>
   When boxing is in the news, I'm all ears.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Couldn't resist.

YOUTH SPORTS ARE NO LONGER CHILD'S PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA AND ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Second in a series 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 16-year-old is piled in the locker room by his junior varsity
teammates for committing errors in a baseball game. A parent is
banned from watching his daughters at the state tennis tournament
for throwing orange peels at an opposing school's player. A
sixth-grade football game erupts into violence involving players,
coaches and parents.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, poor sportsmanship at the youth level appears to
be the rule, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches at the high-school level are expected to teach proper
conduct. But the seeds of sportsmanship, both good and bad, are
sown early, long before athletes get to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Little League fields, recreation gymnasiums and driveways are
often the learning grounds for young athletes. Combine that
training ground with what they learn from television highlights and
sound bites, and the message is often mixed as to the importance of
taunting, showmanship and sportsmanship vs. winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a handle on what youth sports is all about,''
says Dr. David Cook, a sports psychologist in Fort Worth, Texas.
``Yes, it's about learning how to compete, but under the guidelines
of sportsmanship and competing within the rules. Any time sports
become nothing more than a pursuit of championships, everything
else gets lost.''
</P>
<P>
   That message is being lost, according to the National Alliance
for Youth Sports, a Florida-based nonprofit organization that
claims to focus on providing youngsters with safe, fun and positive
experiences in organized sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   Its research says that 70 percent of children quit sports by age
13 because it isn't fun, 45 percent of children have been called
names and insulted while playing sports, 8 percent have been called
names with sexual connotations and 21.5 percent have been pressured
to play with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 43 and I can remember my days of playing ball and it
wasn't like this,'' says Jerry Johnson, a parent and coach of the
Devil Rays, a Fort Worth University Little League team of 11- and
12-year olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like winning is overemphasized, and it starts
with TV and moves on down the line from there. If you listen to the
boys talking about what's important, more and more you find that
winning is everything, more important than being good sports.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a bigger picture, coaches say. Once, Irving Nimitz
football coach Mike Farda says he was consumed with winning more
high school football games than the legendary Gordon Wood. That was
25 years ago. He knows more now, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us realize we are teaching,'' says Mike Fielder, the
former Haltom (Texas) softball coach. ``Whether we win or lose,
athletics is a microcosm of life. In a ballgame or a season, you're
having to deal with the roller-coaster that life provides: how to
deal with the downs and how not to get too up when things are
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all is lost, says Lance Van Auken, a spokesman for Little
League Baseball International in Williamsport, Pa. For every
alarming story you hear about bad conduct, he says there are
countless good ones that gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop to think about it, last night _ or on any given
night _ there were 10,000 Little League games in the United
States,'' Van Auken says. ``That happens day in and day out. And
with all those games, we'll have an incident reported to us maybe
once every three or four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while no tangible statistics or figures can back them up,
many coaches, parents and administrators say youths are arguing
more with umpires and referees than in the past, and are
confronting or taunting or even trying to injure each other with
increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent eight-week period, one area youth sports program
endured fights between a coach and the grandfather of a player, a
coach and a parent, two opposing coaches and two opposing players,
according to a league official.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's not just us,'' the official said. ``It's going on
nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The culprits?
</P>
<P>
   Television bears the brunt of the criticism. Youths are eager to
emulate the professionals they admire and begin to act like little
John McEnroes on the tennis court, little Dennis Rodmans on the
basketball court and little Bryan Coxes on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 5, and he already talks trash,'' says Rick Branum,
27, the coach of a 9- and 10-year old basketball team in the
Arlington Parks and Recreation league. ``I try to keep him from
that, but you see it everywhere and he copies it. You see that a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of Division I basketball coaches asked who they
consider to be coaching role models. Cook says that while most
named coaches like Roy Williams, Dean Smith or John Wooden, not a
single vote was cast for Indiana's Bobby Knight, who is known for
yelling at officials.
</P>
<P>
   But when those same coaches were asked whom they would like to
deliver a clinic teaching basketball theory and techniques, Knight
was the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is people saying `We love Bobby Knight and
admire him as one of the greatest basketball minds ever, but we
can't support his actions,' '' Cook says. ``The coaches can make
that distinction. But people just watching on TV, including kids,
just see the actions. And then they hear the announcers telling
them how great a coach he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't end with TV.
</P>
<P>
   There is a perception among many youth sports officials that
parents are pushing their kids at younger ages harder now, trying
to groom their sons and daughters to earn athletic scholarships and
professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assess the blame to everyone, including parents,''
says Roger Hancock, the president of the Grand Prairie Youth
Football Association. ``You get a parent in the stands yelling, `Go
kill them, Jimmy!' Well, wait a minute. We're not out there to kill
them. We're here to teach the fundamentals of football, and one of
them is teamwork. Scoring touchdowns is a side benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth leagues, however, have begun to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Many leagues now have rules to enforce sportsmanship, including
mandatory suspensions if a player, coach or parent is thrown out of
a game. Some try to remove the pressure from the youngest players
by not keeping score in T-ball, which generally includes 5- and
6-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, youth leagues pin their hopes on parents,
specifically on getting parents to not challenge referees and
direct their children toward fair play and having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average fan is very interested in wins and losses,'' Farda
says. ``The parents are the fans who are in there who really
understand what athletics is about. They're more concerned. But
even those are diminishing every year, in my opinion.''

ATHLETES PUSH LIMITS TO GAIN EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the unsportsmanlike acts exhibited on playing fields and
in arenas, probably none is more reviled than cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Call a Bryan Cox or an Albert Belle a dirty player or a bad
actor, and they're more likely to wear the criticism as a badge of
honor than to confess and repent. But call an athlete a cheater,
and it's clear they regard it as the greatest of sins, something
they can't bring themselves to admit doing.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, for instance, didn't back off his basepath bulldozing of
Milwaukee's Fernando Vina a couple years ago, but he never copped
to corking his bat, even when caught.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Olympic gold medal swimmer Michelle Smith proclaims her
innocence despite her recent four-year ban from international
competition for tampering with her drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of being caught cheating doesn't stop athletes from
trying to get an edge, though. And that has resulted in an
increased policing of the games athletes play, amateur and
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Bass tournament officials now administer polygraph tests to
competitors because suspected cheaters would never admit to having
weighted down a bass or imported a bigger catch to the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Motorsports officials are forced to check under the hoods of
race cars at every competition to make sure nobody's trying to get
a tiny technical advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has long fought a losing battle trying to compel
schools, and their boosters, to obey the rules.
</P>
<P>
   So ingrained is cheating that it is even being taught as an
accepted way to win a game, says John Mackovic, former football
coach at the University of Texas and chairman of the American
Football Coaches Association's ethics committee. Mackovic recalls
being incensed when, while watching a college bowl game last
December, he saw a team run a ``pick'' play. In that play, an
offensive player screened a defender trying to get across the field
to cover an offensive teammate who was supposed to get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an illegal play. It's against the rules. It's not
supposed to be taught,'' Mackovic said. ``And what has the player
learned from this? That it's OK to break the rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``That coach (who taught the play) should be run out of this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   A coach's sanction of cheating, either through tacit acceptance
or overt encouragement, is a powerful influence on young athletes
when combined with the societal pressure to win and the minimal
risk of being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Sports psychologists and sports ethicists say that more than
ever, winning is everything to competitors today, and that has a
profound impact on the likelihood of cheating. That's especially
true if money is involved, as in the case of professional athletes
and coaches, but it's also true when nothing but bragging rights
are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure to win today is almost insurmountable,'' said
William E. Shelton, president of Eastern Michigan University and
former chairman of the NCAA Committee on Sportsmanship and Ethical
Conduct in Intercollegiate Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Added Mackovic, ``We've canonized those who've won, regardless
of their means.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackovic knows firsthand the importance of winning. He was
reassigned at the University of Texas last fall after his team's
poor season _ only a year after his team's stunning upset of
Nebraska in the Big 12 Conference championship game. Coaches at all
levels are dismissed when they don't win at the rate expected by
administrators, owners, alumni or fans.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, sports ethicists ask, there is such pressure
to win _ pressure sufficient to provoke cheating?
</P>
<P>
   Cheating comes in many forms in sports, some modern and
technology-driven. Performance-enhancing drugs are the most common
abuse of the rules in major international competition today.
</P>
<P>
   While most instances of cheating are clear to all, some are less
obvious. Often, the intentions of the perpetrator can be debated:
Did the athlete or official or administrator intend to cheat, or
was the act unwitting or unintentional?
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the Ambassadors of Christ Academy in Fort Worth was
not allowed to compete in Texas' private school boys basketball
tournament because it improperly enrolled two players on its team.
The players were enrolled at another school at the same time and
also played before the completion of a mandatory 21-day waiting
period for transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a breakdown in communication and a failure to
understand the rules,'' said Edd Burleson, director of the Texas
Association of Private and Parochial Schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe they came out and were trying to be deceitful
or underhanded,'' board member Mark Bowles said.
</P>
<P>
   Questionable acts can be illegal according to the rules, or
legal simply because no rule has been written to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey players use sticks that are legally too long. Goalies use
pads determined to be too large. Wide receivers use sticky
substances on their hands and fingers and arms, hoping the ball
will better adhere to them. Offensive linemen use slippery
substances on their uniforms to prevent defensive linemen from
grabbing hold.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bat-corking and spitball-loading, baseball teams are
routinely accused of stealing signs _ from outposts behind the
outfield fence _ and relaying them.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of cheating often depends on the traditions of
the game, the precision of the ground rules and the observer's
philosophies of sport.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever form it takes, cheating has always been around in
sports, and some observers think it's a part of society that always
will be in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where you go, you're going to find bad people,''
said Debra Dean, who, with her husband, Jerry, operates bass
fishing tournaments in Texas. ``The polygraph tests have changed
the face of our tournaments. They've curbed some of the cheating.
But you're always going to have it because some people look at it
as a way to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could cheat at the Lotto, they'd do it, too.''

LOMBARDI-SPEAK PROVES PROPHETIC IN WORLD OF SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM PEDLEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saint Vincent, old man, what hath thou wrought?
</P>
<P>
   Some say nothing less than the institutionalization of poor
sportsmanship in America.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. A rather significant accusation.
</P>
<P>
   And all because of one rather closed-ended statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple statement you uttered some 30 years ago _ or,
supposedly uttered (as history is a tad muddy on origin and exact
wording of the statement).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, slick and catchy, but simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning isn't the most important thing. It's the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's lyrical, rhythmic and has just enough punch as to
incorporate a bit of 1960s shock value.
</P>
<P>
   It probably was not meant to be taken literally. And it
certainly wasn't offered up as a mantra. But it stuck. And how.
</P>
<P>
   Not just with those legendary Green Bay Packers teams of yours _
though probably, at least in part, because of them _ but with just
about every athlete who suits it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning isn't the most important thing. It's the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though you still hear it used on Sundays in 1998, you also hear
it on Saturday afternoons. And even on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   You hear it on national television and you hear it in city
parks.
</P>
<P>
   There are coaches and players and fans out there who don't
remember the Packers sweep or Fuzzy Thurston or who won the first
Super Bowl. But they know that winning isn't the most important
thing. They know it's the only thing.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, winning. The only thing. Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Poor sportsmanship wasn't invented the day you expressed those
sentiments. But on that day, suddenly, poor sportsmanship could be
rationalized, legitimatized.
</P>
<P>
   And, brother, has it become popularized.
</P>
<P>
   I think about Lombardi and those words:
</P>
<P>
   When I remember the scene of Pete Rose leveling Ray Fosse _ and,
in effect, ending the catcher's career _ in a play at the plate.
(In an All-Star Game, for God's sake.)
</P>
<P>
   When I think of Ohio State coach Woody Hayes punching an
opposing player on a college sideline.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear local players talk of what goes on under piles of
tacklers when playing against a certain Northeast Tarrant
high-school football team.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear of good, solid human beings driven out of
high-school coaching jobs because they spent more time instituting
a mentoring program than a win-at-all-costs mentality in their
football players.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear a mom yell ``kill him'' to her son during a youth
soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   When I answer my phone and am told that I should not be covering
this, that or the other team because ``they are a bunch of
losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, loser. It used to be a word.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saint Vincent, it has become a stigma, a persona.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a label to avoid at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Loser? Better to be called a racist or a thief or lazy or a liar
or a cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, a cheat. Especially a cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Diving at a quarterback's knees will cost you 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking a hockey stick between an opponent's legs will cost you
five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a performance-enhancing drug will cost you a year.
</P>
<P>
   An illegal carburetor will cost you a race.
</P>
<P>
   Not conforming to the NCAA's voluminous rule book will cost you
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But doing all of that, and risking the consequences, is OK. It's
acceptable because losing can cost you everything: job, happiness,
self esteem, dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning isn't the most important thing. It's the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   I worked with a sports columnist a couple of jobs ago who let
Saint Vince's words get to him. After several years of sports
reporting at the local and college levels, he had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   He stomped off the sports beat one day in favor of working in
the more straightforward and less hypocritical area of crime
reporting.
</P>

   His parting words to his readers could be construed as an
exasperated attempt at combating The Only Thingism: ``And
remember,'' he said in the column's final paragraph, ``it's only a
damn game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince, I love ya. Love what those Packers of yours did and for
what you did for a great game.
</P>
<P>
   But Vince, gotta tell you; that advice has proved less than
saintly.

WILLIAMS' BLAST DROPS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rangers right-hander Xavier Hernandez threw his
second-best pitch to the American League's No. 1 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams then hit home run No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' one-out, ninth-inning solo home run propelled New York
to a 6-5 victory Sunday at Yankee Stadium, yet the Rangers remain
only one-half game behind in the AL West after the Angels' 6-5 loss
to the Blue Jays Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers departed New York with their third loss in this
four-game series, despite two home runs and three runs batted in
from center fielder Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees joined the 1944 Cardinals as the only 90-game
winners through 120 games, and Williams made it possible by
depositing an 0-1 fastball from Hernandez (5-2) into the upper deck
of the right-field seats for a 401-foot exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who retired right fielder Paul O'Neill on strikes for
the inning's first out, entered the final at-bat limiting
left-handed hitters to a .186 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez threw his best pitch _ a split-fingered fastball _ to
get ahead of the switch-hitting Williams in the count before
delivering a fastball on the game's final delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two schools of thought there,'' Hernandez said.
``One says stick with your best pitch and get beat with your best
pitch if you're going to get beat. The other school of thought says
think while you're out there. I thought it was a good idea, but it
was poor execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez blamed the result on not getting the pitch high enough
in the strike zone. Hernandez often buries hitters by getting ahead
in the count and afterward pounds his opponents with a steady diet
of split-fingered fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez altered the pattern for Williams, whose .355 batting
average leads the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be looking down and in there,'' Hernandez said,
``but he whacked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday, Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of success this year throwing my fastball in
\Rsplit-fingered fastball\S counts,'' said Hernandez, who Sunday
celebrated his 33rd birthday. ``Guys are telling themselves, `Stay
back for the split,' and _ whoom! _ the fastball blows by them ...
well, except for today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly provided the Rangers' 5-4 lead with his fifth-inning solo
home run and second off left-hander David Wells. The Yankees,
though, tied the game in the bottom half of the inning when O'Neill
scored from third on a double-play ground ball off the bat of first
baseman Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers wasted their golden opportunity in the ninth inning
against closer Mariano Rivera (2-0). Second baseman Mark McLemore
collected a one-out single and advanced to second on the ensuing
walk to Tom Goodwin, who replaced Kelly as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera retired left fielder Rusty Greer on strikes, but the
right-hander then issued a walk to designated hitter Juan Gonzalez.
That brought first baseman Will Clark to the plate with the bases
loaded and two outs, but Rivera induced an inning-ending ground
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two good ballclubs going after each other,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said, ``until the final pitch of the game
decided it.''

DAVIS TAKES OWN APPROACH TO LIFE'S BATTLES (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ First things first: Dallas Cowboys receiver Billy
Davis is not Dennis Rodman in cleats.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Davis came into training camp this year with the blond
Demolition Man hairdo that the NBA badboy made famous, and he has a
horde of tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where the similarities stop. Rodman's outlandish
behavior is recently concocted public-relations schtick. Davis,
however, has been ``dancing to a different beat'' for most of ``my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as I've known me, I've always done things
strange, unbeknownst to me and everybody else,'' said Davis, who
wore blond dreadlocks in high school, quotes Zen philosophy,
meditates daily and dabbles in Tai Chi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always prided myself in my own individuality _ not to stand
out, but to stand apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who is battling eight-year veteran Ernie Mills for the
starting No. 2 receiver spot, will be counting on that lifelong
philosophy when the Cowboys meet the Patriots in the American Bowl
Monday night at Azteca Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After starting Mills opposite Michael Irvin in the first two
preseason games, the Cowboys will start Davis against the Patriots.
His goal is a stand-apart performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this for a long time,'' said Davis, who
primarily has been a special-teams star the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just going to deal with the opportunity that I have
and exploit it to the best of my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, while acknowledging he wants the No. 2 job ``real
bad,'' the 6-foot-1, 205-pound Davis stops himself from getting too
excited about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I would be doing is setting myself up for disappointment
if I did that,'' he said. ``What I'm going to do is go out and just
rely on my performance, my tenacity and my desire and let that
speak for itself. After that, whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' cautious approach is rooted in the fact that his football
career is considered as nontraditional as his personality. Being an
undrafted free agent who made the Cowboys as a rookie largely
because of special-teams skills has put Davis at the back of the
bus when it comes to NFL aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted players get more chances and more opportunities than
undrafted players _ even though the undrafted player might have
performed better. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said it's not fair, but
it is a fact of life in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story that Davis, who has seen his hopes of making
significant contributions on offense dashed repeatedly, knows all
too well.
</P>
<P>
   Last year proved to be the most difficult. Davis had
unquestionably the finest training camp of any Cowboys receiver,
topping all NFL pass catchers during the preseason with 23
receptions for 403 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the season started, Davis was relegated to the
fourth spot behind Irvin, free-agent pickup Anthony Miller and 1996
third-round pick Stepfret Williams. Davis caught only three passes
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt,'' said Davis, an El Paso native who played college
ball at the University of Pittsburgh. ``I wanted to do more than be
a Hall of Famer in the preseason. I was told I was going to get a
chance to compete for the third receiver job, so it was frustrating
and disappointing when I didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, an avid reader, got through the frustration largely
because of his expanded outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work hard in everything I do, and I expect to get the
residual of what I put into it,'' Davis said. ``I don't know if
this year will be different. All I can do is continue working. But
my life doesn't end and begin with the starting job. This is just a
brick into a long life foundation that I hope to build into a very
large house.''
</P>
<P>
   Several off-season moves by the Cowboys give Davis some
confidence that his house won't crumble this time.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Gailey and new receivers coach Dwain Painter
provided a fresh start, as neither came with any preconceived
notions about Davis' ability.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches believe that Davis has the skills to become a solid
NFL starter, and Gailey sees Davis' outcast background as positive.
He compared Davis to Yancey Thigpen, the former Steelers All-Pro
receiver who signed with the Oilers in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of got prior knowledge of a guy who made his name
playing special teams,'' said Gailey, a former Steelers receivers
coach and offensive coordinator. ``Yancey was our best cover guy
and ended up being an All-Pro receiver. When a guy like Billy is
fast and tough enough to play on special teams and showed skills
during the preseason last year, you'd think he has a great deal of
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who thought Davis should have been
the starter last season, agreed. He awarded Davis a three-year
contract extension worth $2 million and included a whopping $1
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appreciative of the Cowboys organization for doing
something like that,'' said Davis, who made $196,000 last season.
``There is a certain amount of pressure. But as long as I go and do
the things I can do, things will fall in place on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   And to Davis' distinct beat.

   1. PERMISSION GRANTED TO KILL A WHALE. NOW WHAT? For the Native
American Makah tribe, getting the green light for their first whale
hunt in two generations was the easy part. The environmentalists
protested; the tribal elders squabbled. And none of the living
Makah have ever hunted a whale before. By Robert Sullivan. From The
New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words. 2. RUSSIA NEEDS LEADERSHIP,
NOT IMF BAILOUTS Will the new IMF bailout affect the Russian
situation in a positive way? How can IMF money influence the course
of events in Russia? Mikhail Gorbachev writes that the new economic
policy is no more than a mirage. ``If Russia and its partners are
facing a dead end, this has strong implications for the West, for
Asia and for the rest of the world.'' 1,000 words. 3. FOR THE 21ST
CENTURY, A BEIGE AND BLACK AMERICA By the end of the next century,
experts predict, racial intermarriage will break down the colour
divide in America. The truth is a bit less black-and-white. By
Michael Lind. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,000 words.

STILL LIVING WITH '68 The worldwide youth revolutions of 30 years

MEDICAL ID FOR VIAGRA USERS RECOMMENDED Viagra may be a wonder drug
for men suffering from impotence, but it may also produce
undesirable consequences, especially for men who take heart
medication. By Dr. Charlotte Yeh. Medical Tribune News Service. 500
words. 8. From NATURE NEWS SERVICE (N/A France and Spain. Embargo :
1800 GMT Wednesday August 19)

   A. Climate : A Quest for Fire The memories of the pall of smoke
that hung over southeast Asia last year, caused by forest fires in
Indonesia, will be slow to fade. But forest fires happen all the
time through natural causes, so just how important are human-caused
forest fires to the global climate? By Henry Gee. 600 words. B.
Stretching the Limits of Hearing The discovery of an ancient
'earless' grasshopper shows how 'stretch' detectors on the body
formed the starting point for the evolution of hearing in insects.
Surprisingly, the hearing sensitivity of these primitive sound
sensors is better than almost any other insect living today. By
Helen Phillips. 600 words. 9. IS ETHNIC MARKETING ANOTHER KIND OF
BIAS? American Frank Wu was astonished to receive an early morning
phone call promoting a telephone long distance service - in
Chinese. Curious, he discovered that the company had 10 different
ethnic marketing campaigns. ``Ethnic marketing suffers the same
problems as any racial stereotyping, and it also compounds them,''
he writes. From New America News Service. 1,000 words. 10. From NEW
SCIENTIST magazine (N/A Australia, New Zealand, Brazil) A. HOW NOT
TO SAVE THE TIGER : Only 6,000 tigers survive in the world. The
battle to save them will be lost unless conservationists change
their tactics, warns a leading expert. By Oliver Tickell. 800

Holmes. 3,500 words.

world, foreign shareholders are going to have to fight very hard to
keep U.S.-style compensation practices from spreading with them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND LAKE, Colo. _ By now, no doubt, news has reached you of my
major indoor sports victory here at the edge of Rocky Mountain
National Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I specify ``indoor'' in case word also has trickled back of my
rather astonishing 9-hole golf outing in which I parred two
consecutive holes _ a 5 and a 3 _ and tied a much younger golfer
while simultaneously whipping both my first cousin and his wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I would do well to digress here in the midst of this
digression to explain that this particular cousin was Ron and his
wife Susan and not my cousins Carolyn or Steve, who also were here,
along with my three sisters _ all to attend what our T-shirts
called the BNR, for Big Nine Reunion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These would be the nine grndchildren of my Tammeus grandparents,
and we insisted on calling it the Big Nine Reunion although only
seven of the cousins could make it. To fill in, two of the children
of the cousins came along. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I recommend these family gatherings, by the way, for the reason
that if you play your cards right you can win actual money from
your relatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let me be clear: If it's illegal in Colorado to set up a
dollar-a-head bowling pool that goes to the person with the highest
score, I flatly deny we used actual money. And, beyond that, I have
never met or spent time alone in or near the Oval Office with
Monica Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor have my cousins, so leave them out of this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, see, I've already gone and revealed _ at least by
indirection _ that I won the bowling pool and pocketed $14, of
which $12 was spent immediately for bowling costs. You may not
consider $2 net winnings a major indoor sports victory, but in my
cheap family it amounts to serious dough. Besides, there was no
guarantee, based on my first stupid game of the night, that I would
recoup in the second game and trounce my nearest competitor by 22
pins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pin count, I believe, is the most serious thing people on
vacation should worry about. Lots of people go to the beach or the
mountains and spend time fretting over nuclear proliferation,
health care reform or Bill Clinton's pants. What a waste. Those
issues all will be there when vacation is over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I myself, up here in the Rockies, have given no thought at all
to campaign finance reform or the Asian monetary crisis or whether
the fall TV season will stink. (Of course it will. Duh.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I have been reading a new book called ``Nixon in Winter''
about Richard Nixon's last years of life and his belief that George
Bush was mostly clueless about good foreign policy. But Nixon, as
I've intimated, is dead. And my rule is that it's OK to spend some
vacation time pondering dead people and things. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me directly back to my startling bowling victory. I
thought my bowling game was _ like my canasta game _ long since
dead. When someone announed that we would gather to bowl a few
lines here in Grand Lake, I imagined how embarrassed I would be to
roll, say, a 78. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when I bowled two or six times a year, I could run up
a pretty regular 120 or so. At which I'd shake my head and gripe
and pretend I couldn't imagine where my usual 185 was. It was a
cheap trick, but I'd stoop to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that was years ago. So I was happy to throw a 117 in the
first game and beat my cousin Steve by four pins. But in the next
lane it looked as if other members of the betting pool were
knocking down strikes and picking up spares galore. So I had no
hope of winning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the second game I strung together three strikes in a
row plus several other good frames and recorded a rather lovely
167. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was as if George Bush had come out of retirement and won an
insignificant primary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I see now I've mentioned George Bush twice in a vacation column.
It's sad proof that even people like me who know how to vacation
well can't always get it right. But to ease my pain about that, at
least I'm $2 ahead. Which, I am convinced, is a much better legacy
than Dan Quayle. &QL;
</P>
<P>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The 750 people assembled here this week for the
founding convention of an organization called the Mars Society have
a vision _ and they're not about to wait for the US government, or
anybody else, to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is of humans exploring Mars and establishing a
permanent outpost there to conduct research on the most Earth-like
world known outside mankind's home planet. Robert Zubrin, the
society's founder, believes a full-scale human mission could get
people to Mars to begin building a permanent base within 10 years,
if President Clinton decides quickly to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Clinton administration or the one that takes office
in 2001 fails to declare that goal, Zubrin and his followers have a
backup plan. They hope to begin a series of privately funded
ventures concerning the red planet _ culminating, if need be, in a
completely independent mission to send the first humans to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin, a former engineer at Lockheed Martin who left to start
his own rocket company, said that sending humans to Mars is
inevitable, and that it is a crucial step toward revitalizing the
human spirit and imagination by opening up not just a new frontier
but, literally, a whole new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the society is going to be to push for the
human exploration of Mars, by both public and private means,'' he
said in an interview. But he acknowledged that a private mission
would, at best, take far longer to get going than a government
effort, so for now the society plans to push to get the United
States, or an international group, to go ahead with the first
effort to send people beyond Earth's orbit since the Apollo lunar
missions ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has done
preliminary planning for how to design an exploration program that
could get people to Mars by 2014, without spending more money than
the space program's present budget. But in the absence of a
presidential go-ahead, the agency can do little to move toward that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest in human Mars exploration may be at an all-time
high, Zubrin said, in the wake of the controversial but still not
disproved announcement in 1996 of possible signs of ancient life
inside a meteorite from Mars, and of last year's highly successful
and wildly popular robotic Mars Pathfinder mission. And the first
presidential administration of the new millennium would present a
uniquely opportune time for a Kennedy-like declaration of a
national push toward Mars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a time for new beginnings,'' Zubrin said. ``I think
people are going to be looking outward.''

   Zubrin, whose book ``The Case for Mars,'' co-authored by
Northampton-based freelance writer Richard Wagner, outlines a
scenario for getting people to Mars quickly and at much lower cost
than under NASA plans, sees the society as a way to educate the
public and to lobby political leaders. The society has already
enlisted a wide following of space enthusiasts, including most of
the members of an informal group who call themselves the ``Mars
Underground'' and who have been pressing for increased Mars
exploration for the last 20 years.

   Few seem to take seriously the idea that a private group like
this fledgling society could actually mount its own mission _
though some here are so firmly anti-NASA that they seem to hope

funding a scientific experiment that could be carried ``piggyback''
atop an existing robotic probe to Mars seem more likely to be
within the group's potential grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The society is actively looking into such possible payloads, as
well as the idea of funding a research base in the Canadian Arctic
that would simulate a human Mars base. It could provide a place to
test equipment and methods for eventual use on the planet, as well
as to learn about the psychological factors that might affect a
crew working in extreme isolation and harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And a private mission, while clearly a long shot, is not out of
the question, some analysts say. John Connoly, who works for NASA,
said a private mission is possible if wealthy individuals or
companies decided to provide the funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates could do it personally. And other people and
companies have the wealth to do private missions,'' he said. ``I
would love to see someone step forward and make that challenge.''

GROUP HAS OTHERWORLDLY GOAL: TO SEND HUMANS TO MARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The 750 people assembled here this week for the
founding convention of an organization called the Mars Society have
a vision _ and they're not about to wait for the US government, or
anybody else, to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   The vision is of humans exploring Mars and establishing a
permanent outpost there to conduct research on the most Earth-like
world known outside mankind's home planet. Robert Zubrin, the
society's founder, believes a full-scale human mission could get
people to Mars to begin building a permanent base within 10 years,
if President Clinton decides quickly to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Clinton administration or the one that takes office
in 2001 fails to declare that goal, Zubrin and his followers have a
backup plan. They hope to begin a series of privately funded
ventures concerning the red planet _ culminating, if need be, in a
completely independent mission to send the first humans to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin, a former engineer at Lockheed Martin who left to start
his own rocket company, said that sending humans to Mars is
inevitable, and that it is a crucial step toward revitalizing the
human spirit and imagination by opening up not just a new frontier
but, literally, a whole new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the society is going to be to push for the
human exploration of Mars, by both public and private means,'' he
said in an interview. But he acknowledged that a private mission
would, at best, take far longer to get going than a government
effort, so for now the society plans to push to get the United
States, or an international group, to go ahead with the first
effort to send people beyond Earth's orbit since the Apollo lunar
missions ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has done
preliminary planning for how to design an exploration program that
could get people to Mars by 2014, without spending more money than
the space program's present budget. But in the absence of a
presidential go-ahead, the agency can do little to move toward that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest in human Mars exploration may be at an all-time
high, Zubrin said, in the wake of the controversial but still not
disproved announcement in 1996 of possible signs of ancient life
inside a meteorite from Mars, and of last year's highly successful
and wildly popular robotic Mars Pathfinder mission. And the first
presidential administration of the new millennium would present a
uniquely opportune time for a Kennedy-like declaration of a
national push toward Mars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a time for new beginnings,'' Zubrin said. ``I think
people are going to be looking outward.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin, whose book ``The Case for Mars,'' co-authored by
Northampton-based freelance writer Richard Wagner, outlines a
scenario for getting people to Mars quickly and at much lower cost
than under NASA plans, sees the society as a way to educate the
public and to lobby political leaders. The society has already

 AFRICA: WHERE THE HUNGER SEASON IS PART OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In parts and pockets of Africa, there is an extra season every
year. It is called the hunger season. That is when, said Martha
Carey of Doctors Without Borders, ``people forage for food _ they
strip wild plants, they dig for fish in mud flats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sudan, it is the hunger season and they are slaughtering
their cows. ``Cows are their last insurance policy,'' she said.
``They cannot be replaced. After that, they have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's attention has been focused on Africa lately because
of the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and
because of the extreme suffering of the Sudanese, who are again on
the run from yet another cycle of war between a Muslim north and a
traditionalist and Christian south. But a million other stories of
deprivation and intractable hunger just a notch less severe never
get told because they are so common.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Guzman, a Roman Catholic priest from Colombia who
is a missionary in Africa, was riding the subway in New York
recently when he saw passengers looking at newspaper pictures from
the Sudan and expressing shock. ``Oh, my God,'' he said. ``If only
they could have seen the place where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The place where he lives and works is a barren stretch of
northern Kenya where, in the hunger season, people slit the throats
of cattle to draw enough blood to drink to sustain life. Then they
carefully heal the wound to save the cow, the most important of
capital goods, for the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government sometimes gives them maize,'' Guzman said, but
never enough. ``There is no electricity, no water supply, no
rivers, no hills, no food. This is a semi-arid place and you cannot
cultivate crops. The people are always sick. The health center is
300 kilometers away and there are no cars, no buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was on a lonely errand in New York, trying to get small
donations for water pumps and maybe a used ambulance. He toured
Catholic parishes after being shooed away by the church hierarchy
because the list of supplicants for official help is already too
long. In small churches, he tells his story of official
indifference, tribal warfare, natural disasters, relentless
diseases and other blows. ``Just when you think you are getting
somewhere, more bad things come,'' is how he describes it.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics tell the story. Of the 45 countries at the bottom
of the Human Development Index, a people-centered measure of
progress published annually by the United Nations Development
Program, 35 are African. Only Africa's Mediterranean fringe and the
southern tip of the continent escape the category. Elsewhere, life
expectancy hovers between 40 and 50 years, sometimes lower. Half or
fewer of the people in this vast area of disadvantage have access
to health care, clean water or toilets. Daily caloric intake is a
third or more below that of Mexico or China.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund, found in 1997 that while the
world average of deaths among children below age 5 was 89 in 1,000
births, the African average was 174 per 1,000. The children who
survive have to fend off pneumonia, tuberculosis, malaria and now
AIDS. Immunization rates for childhood diseases are often low in
sub-Saharan Africa, Unicef reported. Only South Asia, led by India,
has more childhood malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   It does not have to be that way, and was not always so, said
Thelma Awori, director for Africa of the U.N. Development Program.
Mrs. Awori, taking a long look back and searching for lessons that
could help in planning for a better future, is concentrating on
Africa's people rather than its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When independence came to Africa, people had a lot of hope
about what governments would do,'' she said. ``At that time
governments themselves were hopeful about what they could do. Then
we got into the '70s and the '80s _ the times of structural
adjustment _ when they had to shift their thinking. Governments
found they really could not do all they thought they could do. And
then people's hopes were more or less dashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Structural adjustment, a policy developed by international
lending organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, demanded that countries living beyond their means
reduce spending on public projects and cut subsidies that often
kept the cost of living down in poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in Uganda in the '60s, we had strong community
development,'' she said. ``Women knew how to feed their children.
They were taught how to wash their dishes. They were taught to make
tablecloths even though some people said, `We have no tables.' And
now?''
</P>
<P>
   In the same villages, Mrs. Awori said, she sees women unable to
feed their babies. Elsewhere, schooling has declined as tens of
thousands of children flee civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Africa is slipping back. Even where there is no
conflict, governments forced to make choices about what to cut from
their budgets often safeguard the official ``fat'' and slice away
the ``soft'' projects like literacy programs, agricultural
extension services and adult education. ``The people are on their
own again,'' Mrs. Awori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our argument with most governments is, `Why don't you cut the
military spending?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What has been lost is rapport between governments and the
people, Mrs. Awori said. Her agency is trying to rebuild that, but
from the bottom up, with grants to nongovernmental organizations
and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local development fund goes straight to grassroots
government,'' she said. ``The local authorities learn how to take
charge, they learn how to account for money. They learn how to
plan. They learn how to link themselves up with the communities.
That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Depending too much on outside help means focusing on where
people fail, she added. ``We are teaching people to use their own
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Awori also channels money and other support to women's
groups like the fast-growing Movement of African Women, founded by
a member of Zambia's Parliament, Inonge Lewanika. Millions of
African women have been set back by bad governance. Tens of
thousands have had to run from ethnic warfare and have suffered
rape and the brutal deaths of children, husbands and other family
members. Some are now saying they want to help put an end to this
perpetual horror and they are building computer networks to reach
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had to run,'' Mrs. Awori said. ``It is a very, very
humiliating experience. You are just running, You don't know where
you are running to. You could be running into the person who is
going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   In material terms, Africa is rich in resources, richer than many
Asian countries. But wealth and the political power out of which it
grows are rarely shared equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have monumental problems,'' said Legwaila Joseph Legwaila,
Botswana's representative at the United Nations. ``Sometimes we are
seen as the laughingstock of humanity. But we can be an organized
community, vast as the continent is, different as the cultures
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Legwaila points to the experience of the 14-nation Southern
African Development Community. A number of its members, including
Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, are similar to
nations like Russia, Peru and Turkey in human development terms.
SADC has a system of assigning areas of development to member
nations. Livestock and drought research is done by Botswana,
fisheries by Malawi, food security by Zimbabwe, water resources by
Lesotho and so on. Experts in these nations carry out studies and
share information. Grain stocks are stored regionally against
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SADC arrangement is unique in Africa,'' Legwaila said. But
its success also rests on peace, democracy and stability, he added,
attributes not found in many other regions of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace _ that is all that is required of Africa,'' Legwaila
said. ``My country is almost permanently drought-stricken, but
because there is so much peace, so much democracy _ and the
government is one of the most incorruptible on the continent _ no
one has ever died from starvation.''

15.) 
 BRIGHT, SHINING OR DARK: THE AMERICAN WAY OF LYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lying is bad. So Americans say. They tell pollsters they are no
good at it, it is difficult, they rarely lie. In the tradition of
Lake Wobegon (``where the women are strong, the men are good
looking and all of the children are above average''), they think
they are more honest than everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lying is everywhere: lies to children, lies to voters, lies
to the Internal Revenue Service, lies under oath. People lie to
avoid embarrassment, to spare feelings, to get their way. And, when
confronted with a lie, they justify it: The lie was harmless, the
truth would have hurt, the ends justified the means.
</P>
<P>
   They are even willing to overlook lying in others. Boston Globe
columnist Mike Barnicle still has his job, even after misleading
his readers or his editors or his viewers or all three. President
Clinton is widely believed to have lied about his sex life, yet
most Americans seem not to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone lies about sex,'' Jerry Seinfeld said during his
Broadway show when someone from the audience asked for a joke about
Clinton. ``People lie during sex. If it weren't for lies, there'd
be no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to tell the truth Monday in the grand jury
investigation of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But
responding honestly to a narrowly defined question may represent a
sin of omission that does not constitute honesty as most people
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Sex may be the all-time favorite exception to the rule that
honesty is the best policy, research on lying and anecdotal
evidence suggest. But there are other common situations where many
Americans think it may be all right not to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is okay to lie to hide something that will be used unfairly
against you or others, or to to conceal information that an
inquisitor has no right to have (the classic
Nazis-at-the-door-while-the-Jews-are-in-the-attic exception,
stretched in contemporary life to justify paying the baby sitter
off the books because the employer cannot afford child care
otherwise).
</P>
<P>
   _ Elected officials can lie in a national emergency to protect
hostages, mislead the enemy, win the war. (Though Americans tend
not to make a case for politicians lying, they take it for granted
that their elected officials do as a rule.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Little white lies are fine, many people insist, when the
intent is benign (``What a beautiful baby, necktie, salad bowl!'')
</P>
<P>
   _ Lies to help other people are more acceptable than those to
help oneself. A friend might lie to a friend, or a parent to a
child, when the truth could hurt and the deception would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle here, if there is a principle, is you must never
lie unless you must,'' said Alexander Nehamas, a professor of
philosophy at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, one of the most necessary lies we tell our
children is you must never lie. Then we turn around and, when it
suits us, pretend to believe the principle ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, little support for lying in religious
literature. St. Augustine opposed it absolutely. Christian and
Jewish traditions strongly discourage it. To the Catholic Church,
it is a sin against God's gift of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Honesty, on the other hand, is the foundation upon which
relationships and many societies are built. Without it, it is said,
there can be no trust. Widespread lying destroys the fabric of
democratic societies, in which the necessary assumption is that
people mostly tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to tell a lie, there had better be a serious
moral reason for it,'' said Joseph Hough, professor of Christian
ethics and dean of Vanderbilt Divinity School. ``Not every single
thing that's unpleasant is a moral reason. I think you can find
gentle ways to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the religious literature allows exceptions. In Catholic
moral tradition, there is the so-called principle of overriding
right, which recognizes that there are times when a more important
principle than truth-telling is at stake, such as the principle of
protecting human life.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Joel Roth, a professor of Talmud and rabbinic literature
at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, said that
while there is little tolerance in rabbinic literature for lying,
and while lying is always forbidden in a judicial proceeding, some
white lying may be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a passage in chapter 18 of the book of Genesis in which
God omits to mention to Abraham an unflattering comment by his
wife. From that passage and at least one other, Roth said, rabbis
deduce that some white lies may be acceptable in preserving family
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   There is little research on how and when Americans lie. But
Bella DePaulo, a professor of psychology at the University of
Virginia, recently studied everyday lying by 77 college students
and 70 individuals in a community. All kept weeklong diaries
detailing their interactions and the lies they told.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DePaulo found that virtually everyone lied. The students
averaged two lies a day, the others one. The vast majority of lies
were told to spare the liar embarrassment or to make him or her
look better. The benefit was psychic, not material.
</P>
<P>
   In her studies of serious lying, as opposed to everyday lying,
Dr. DePaulo has found that a quarter of all serious lies were told
to cover an affair. She said scholarly literature on lying suggests
that Americans also find lying more acceptable when the behavior it
is concealing was discreet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very important distinction between the
acceptability of the lie and the acceptability of the behavior that
the lie is covering up,'' she said. ``If someone says, `It's OK
with me that he lied about it,' they are not saying, `It's OK with
me that he had an affair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars, including Stephen Carter, a Yale law professor
and author of ``Integrity'' (Basic Books, 1996), suspect that lying
has increased. And when adults accept lying as natural, Carter
says, children learn the lesson that the adult world's rules are
unreliable and open to manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Boston University sociologist Alan Wolfe, who
is researching a book on moral freedom, contends that Americans are
simply learning to write their own moral rules, now that
institutions like the church no longer manage to do it for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are pretty savvy about this,'' said Amy Gutmann,
director of the Center for Human Values at Princeton University.
``They think that some kinds of lies are far less bad than others.
But they think that someone who can lie very well does not have
good character.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 16, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-REVIEW _ The world's attention has been focused on Africa
lately because of the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, and because of the extreme suffering of the Sudanese, who
are again on the run from yet another cycle of war between a Muslim
north and a traditionalist and Christian south. But a million other
stories of deprivation and intractable hunger just a notch less
severe never get told because they are so common. By Barbara
Crossette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HONESTY-REVIEW _ Lying is bad. So Americans say. They tell
pollsters they are no good at it, it is difficult, they rarely lie.
In the tradition of Lake Wobegon (``where the women are strong, the
men are good looking and all of the children are above average''),
they think they are more honest than everyone else. Yet lying is
everywhere: lies to children, lies to voters, lies to the Internal
Revenue Service, lies under oath. People lie to avoid
embarrassment, to spare feelings, to get their way. By Janny
Scott. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS-REVIEW _ If any place can engender a sense of being
permanently dissed, it's Arkansas. Even Mississippi, the nation's
poorest state, at least gets stereotyped in terms of both
Faulknerian complexity and abject redneckery. But dating from a
19th-century best-selling travelogue derisively titled ``On a Slow
Train Through Arkansas'' to H.L. Mencken's ridicule of ``the
miasmic jungles of Arkansas'' to Li'l Abner and Dogpatch, perhaps
no state has had such consistently dismal public relations. By
Peter Applebome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-REVIEW _ As the Clinton administration rushes to
prepare new budget requests to improve the security of American
embassies, officials and experts are increasingly discussing what
may be a more efficient response to terrorism, which is
retaliation. By Steven Erlanger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-REASON-REVIEW _ At the age of 7, a child is considered by
the Roman Catholic Church to have reached the ``age of reason'' and
is entitled to receive communion. Some evangelical churches hold
that a child of 7 can make an independent spiritual choice. In
Judaism and Islam, a boy of 7 is expected to begin his religious
studies and participate, to some degree, in adult rituals like
fasting and praying. Freud believed the super ego, or the
conscience, developed by age 4 or 5. But is a child of such tender
years a responsible being, capable of telling right from wrong and
accountable, not just legally but morally, for his actions? By
Susan Sachs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLACKS-REVIEW _ According to projections by the Census Bureau,
2005 will be the year that the number of Hispanics residing in the
United States surpasses the black population, the country's largest
minority group. By Steven A. Holmes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-SOCSEC-REVIEW _ Today a lot of conservatives are
proclaiming that a century of increasing government responsibility
for social welfare is over in the West, and aging populations and
dropping birth rates will make pay-as-you-go social security
impossible to sustain even in the United States. So they are
looking at the Chilean solution: privately managed, individually
owned retirement accounts based on the compounded magic of stocks
and bonds, as a replacement. By Clifford Krauss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEAFARING-BOOKS-REVIEW _ What is it about the siren call of the
sea that makes readers want to thumb through a ``cookery book''
like ``Lobscouse &AMP; Spotted Dog'' (Norton, 1998) for recipes for
sweetbreads in malmsey, spotted dog (an eggy custard tinged with
rosewater) and other 18th-century galley fare? Whatever the answer,
there is enough money in seafaring literature these days to prompt
a host of trade publishers to cash in. By Doreen Carvahal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UTILITIES-REVIEW _ States around the country are breaking up
utility monopolies, hoping to create a competitive marketplace for
electricity. But that does not mean the monopolies are
disappearing; some may just be turning sideways, moving away from
vertical operations that controlled coal mines, power stations and
meters and toward a horizontal business that manages huge groups of
generating stations. Leading the turn, some experts predict, will
be nuclear power. By Matthew L. Wald. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DUTY-FREE-REVIEW _ Duty free belongs with free lunch and free
love as another phantom freebie. As a phrase, it sounds as if it
sprang from the fertile mind of some marketing genius. As a
concept, it is in fact a morass where questions of import duties
are tangled with domestic luxury taxes, all of which may be undone
elsewhere by regulations to safeguard crops and livestock.

   As the Dow Trembles, Small Investors Stand Firm
</P>
<P>
   It's been a disconcerting summer for investors. Wild swings in
share prices sent the Dow Jones industrial average to 9,337.97 in
mid-July, but since then stocks have been plummeting on fears about
the worsening economic crisis in Asia and evidence that U.S.
corporate profits are on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Dow sank another 173 points, to 8,425 _ its
lowest level since February.
</P>
<P>
   Few investors can make sense of the recent whipsawing stock
prices, but a survey of market watchers suggests that large
institutional investors, like hedge funds, are behind most of the
summer's anxious selling, which has pushed volume up to record
levels in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors have been a nervous group, but also a quiet
one. They have not flooded telephone lines at mutual fund
companies, and their silence seems to suggest that they have not
yet called it quits.

   Swiss Banks Reach Accord
</P>
<P>
   After years of bitter dispute, Switzerland's leading banks
settled a lawsuit with victims of the Nazi era who had accused them
of improperly retaining their assets. The banks agreed to pay $1.25
billion to claimants in the class-action suit _ people who survived
the Holocaust and the heirs of those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which began as three separate lawsuits in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, involved assets that the plaintiffs
said had either been deposited in the banks by victims of Nazi
persecution or had been looted by the Nazis and stored in the
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many details remain to be worked out, including who is eligible
for the money _ estimates ranged last week from tens of thousands
to hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are UBS, recently formed by the merger of Union Bank
of Switzerland and Swiss Bank, and Credit Suisse.

   Bell Atlantic Workers Return
</P>
<P>
   Two days after walking off the job, 73,000 Bell Atlantic
employees returned to work on Tuesday after reaching a tentative
two-year agreement with management that guarantees that union
members will install and maintain the high-technology
communications systems now being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Facing intense competition from nonunionized telecommunications
companies, Bell Atlantic was under pressure to settle the strike,
which was already inconveniencing customers. The company also
agreed to phase out hundreds of customer service jobs now being
performed by nonunion personnel in Hampton, Va., and return them to
union workers.

   Internet Privacy Deal
</P>
<P>
   When new members fill out an online application form for the
popular World Wide Web site Geocities, they are asked to reveal
personal information about education, income, occupation and
personal interests.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Geocities promised on the site's registration
page: ``We will not share this information with anyone without your
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Trade Commission found that Geocities had misled
more than two million subscribers by passing the information to
advertisers and others. In the federal government's first
Internet-privacy enforcement action, the FTC approved a settlement
with Geocities under which the site has to disclose how it intends
to use the personal information it collects.

   No Caribbean Secession
</P>
<P>
   The principle of self-determination was tested on a tiny scale
when the 10,000 people who live on the Caribbean island of Nevis
voted on a proposal to secede from federation with their 36,000
neighbors on nearby St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   Although 62 percent voted to split from what is already the
smallest country in the Western Hemisphere, a two-thirds majority
was required to achieve independence. That means Nevisians will not
join the likes of Tuvalu and Nauru in the United Nations _ at least
not for the moment, since the country's constitution permits Nevis
to try again any time it wishes.

   Air Force Rocket Explodes
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks over Florida on Wednesday were spectacular but not
free. The fireball near Cape Canaveral that signaled the death of
an Air Force Titan 4A rocket and its spy satellite  &QL; 
cargo meant a loss of $1 billion or more and a setback for the
country's space-reconnaissance program.
</P>

   The Pentagon said it could still do its job with the satellites
already inorbit. But a crestfallen Air Force general captured the
mood best. ``We're hurt,'' he said. An inquiry has begun.

   New Help for Clinton
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is running the meter on his lawyers' clocks
this weekend by preparing for his grand jury testimony Monday. But
he can take comfort in knowing that his new legal defense fund has
raised more than $2 million in just six months.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Legal Expense Trust has far exceeded expectations,
enriched mostly by an increase in the annual limit from $1,000 to
$10,000 and anger among the president's supporters at Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife, Hillary, owe an estimated $6 million to
their private lawyers, and could owe as much as $10 million by
2001. ``There is a well-financed group of zealots who want to bring
down the president,'' said entertainment mogul David Geffen. ``And
this guy has no money. He's broke.''

   Young Killers Are Punished
</P>
<P>
   In the photographs, the two boys looked alarmingly normal _
except for the chains and handcuffs. But as an Arkansas judge
ordered Mitchell Johnson, 14, and Andrew Golden, 12, to a juvenile
detention center for killing four students and a teacher in a
school shooting spree in Jonesboro last March, a single question
seemed to scream out from those photos: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to shoot over their heads,'' Mitchell
said, while Andrew pleaded temporary insanity. Mitchell's father
said his son ``doesn't have an answer.'' The slain teacher's
husband will wait: he asked the boys to ``tell us why'' someday.

   Reprieve for Globe Columnist
</P>
<P>
   The columnist Mike Barnicle was granted a reprieve by the
management of The Boston Globe. Barnicle's original offense _ an
Aug. 2 column with jokes that paralleled those in a book by
comedian George Carlin _ was compounded when the columnist, who
told his editors that he had never read the book, was shown in a
videotape recommending it to television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The first offense drew a one-month suspension; after the
videotape surfaced, Globe editor Matthew Storin asked for
Barnicle's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   That decision prompted criticism from Barnicle's supporters,
including advertisers and subscribers. After meeting with the
columnist, Storin and publisher Benjamin Taylor decided instead on
a two-month suspension without pay.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was greeted with jubilation by some, but 50
employees in the newsroom of The Globe, which is owned by The New
York Times Co., sent a petition saying, ``Barnicle's reprieve gives
the appearance of a double standard that allows one individual to
ignore journalistic principles other reporters must follow.''

   Jagger &AMP; Co. Play Moscow, Finally
</P>
<P>
   Better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Russian rock-and-roll fans were saying last week as
they watched with awe and nostalgia as a middle-aged Mick Jagger
pranced and pirouetted across the stage of a Moscow sports arena,
playing the songs of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 30 years since Russians first heard hits by the
``Rollingi,'' as the Rolling Stones are known here.
</P>
<P>
   In those dys, back in the now-collapsed U.S.S.R, hits like
``Satisfaction'' and ``Jumping Jack Flash'' were furtive thrills
for Soviet teen-agers who had to engage in illegal ``speculation''
just to buy a smuggled LP. More likely, they listened to bad copies
made on reel-to-reel tapes, or on used X-ray film ingeniously
transformed into disposable records.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that Jagger's face is creased with wrinkles, or
that Charlie Watts' hair has gone white. After all, their loyal
fans didn't look like spring chickens either.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough just to see the group perform with all the gusto
those old records had conveyed, to watch them put on a world-class
show, full of colored lights, glitter and puffs of smoke. That was
all it took to make Russia's 30- and 40-somethings feel they had at
long last shared an experience that their generation the world over
has taken for granted: a chance to see the Stones, live and in
concert.
</P>
<P>
   So what's 30 years? Nothing if in the end you can get what you
want.

   Popcorn, Peanuts and Valentino
</P>
<P>
   Baseball traditionalists will tell you that fans come to ball
parks for the pastoral experience, the clout of a mighty home run,
an intense face-off between a flame-throwing righthander and a
Bunyanesque hitter or the work ethic of a player who never sits out
a game.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball owners have discovered yet another lure: Beanie
Babies. Teams that give away the cuddly bean-bag animals with names
like Peanut, Glory and Valentino have found that these little toys
possess the awesome power to produce sellouts nearly every time
they're offered.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc., the Beanies' manufacturer, never planned for its
animals, which are sold at specialty retailers, to become baseball
giveaways. A Chicago Cubs marketing executive, curious about one of
his daughter's Beanies, Cubbie the bear, persuaded Ty to plunge
into baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When 23,000 Valentinos (he's a bear) were given away at Yankee
Stadium in May, 49,820 people showed up. The Beanies, and their new
owners, watched the Yankees' David Wells pitch a perfect game. And
when Stretch the ostrich was given away last Sunday, the House that
Ruth Built drew 55,911.
</P>
<P>
   The Beanies have become so valuable _ collectors have priced
Peanut the blue elephant, now discontinued, as high as $5,200 _
that teams need extra security to guard them. Not even Mark
McGwire, who may break Roger Maris' single season home run record
of 61, is guarded as such precious cargo.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

15.) 
 IT'S NOT CALLED ARKANSAS FOR NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of Washington rolled its eyes last week when first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton came up with a novel explanation for her
husband's continuing travails.
</P>
<P>
   Having previously cited a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' she
told a reporter from The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the soggy
mass of scandal surrounding President Clinton was due to an
anti-Arkansas bias. ``They wouldn't be doing this if we were from
some other state,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With her Yale and Wellesley degrees, and her suburban Chicago
pedigree, Mrs. Clinton is oddly cast as a plain-folks defender of
Ozark pride. And it takes some doing to ascribe anti-Arkansas bias
to the Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan who
spent his first two years of college at Harding University in
Searcy, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a real context for Mrs. Clinton's remarks that
goes beyond Arkansas to one of the more pervasive, if
little-discussed, maladies of American life: rube-aphobia.
</P>
<P>
   The term, which was first bandied about in Texas in the 1980s,
does not refer to fear of bumpkins and hicks, but the opposite: the
fear that unless you have the approval of the media powers and
taste makers in Washington, New York and to a lesser extent Los
Angeles, you're treated like a bumpkin or a hick.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her husband, of course, are anything but rubes.
But if there's an underlying thought in her plaint, it's the
persistent divide between the masters of the universe in America's
three power and media centers and the rest of the country, with
Arkansas as subterranean rock bottom on the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly what she meant; she made a statement of fact
that the rest of us are defined by Washington and New York,'' said
Nathalie Dupree, an Atlantan who is the author of 10 books on
cooking and entertaining. Ms. Dupree says she is often amused at
the degree to which her professional certification depends on
someone in New York taking notice. ``It's like the way New York and
Washington seem to think this whole Clinton business is critical,
and we think it's a waste of time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If any place can engender a sense of being permanently dissed,
it's Arkansas. Even Mississippi, the nation's poorest state, at
least gets stereotyped in terms of both Faulknerian complexity and
abject redneckery.
</P>
<P>
   But dating from a 19th-century best-selling travelogue
derisively titled ``On a Slow Train Through Arkansas'' to H.L.
Mencken's ridicule of ``the miasmic jungles of Arkansas'' to Li'l
Abner and Dogpatch, perhaps no state has had such consistently
dismal public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lyons, an Arkansas journalist originally from New Jersey (a
state with image problems of its own), said Mrs. Clinton's
statement to The Democrat-Gazette, like her allegations of a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy,'' was a clumsy attempt at making a valid
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk for 15 minutes, you can say something
sensible,'' he said. ``If it's one line, you sound silly.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Mrs. Clinton was onto something if she was saying
that ignorance of the state, its players and political culture
colored much of the coverage of the all-but-forgotten original
Whitewater scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Jubilation T. Cornpone and Li'l Abner,'' Lyons said.
``Reporters expected a morally deranged world where the governor
makes love to his first cousin and then appoints the idiot spawn
securities commissioner while the hogs scratch their backs on the
front porch.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just because the rube-aphobic world view has some basis
in reality does not necessarily mean Mrs. Clinton's explanation for
her husband's problems is anything other than defensive pique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard pressed to buy the idea that Judge Starr is spending
$40 million of the taxpayers' money because he wants to take a
stick and poke it at the good people of Arkansas,'' said Richard
Bearden, executive director of the Arkansas Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And even many Arkansans have to wonder if the appearance of an
insular political culture and the seamy circus of the past few
years, from Gennifer Flowers to Paula Jones to Monica Lewinsky, is
providing enough gross-out fodder to update old stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmed rube-aphobics might say the fact that even a powerful,
Yale-educated first lady feels so aggrieved is evidence of how
pervasive the malady is. But, then again, maybe it just says
something about how tough it is to be from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the old gag that in the old days when you crossed the
Mississippi there was a sign that said `Texas left and Kansas
right,''' said John Shelton Reed, a University of North Carolina
sociologist. ``Those who couldn't read stayed in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that from someone from Arkansas. They have a nice
sense of humor if you don't provoke them.''

 PURSUING TERRORISTS: SLEUTHS VS. RAMBO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration rushes to prepare new
budget requests to improve the security of U.S. embassies,
officials and experts are increasingly discussing what may be a
more efficient response to terrorism, which is retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's failure to respond to the 1996 terrorist murder by
truck bomb of 19 U.S. soldiers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, sends a
message of vulnerability by scruple, the argument goes. In other
words, America's need to find irrefutable proof of who committed an
attack before acting against the culprits may only forestall the
kind of rapid and aggressive strike that could deter further
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message being sent all over the world is that we're
vulnerable, and our allies are vulnerable,'' said Anthony Cordesman
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``That won't
be solved by more conferences and more gates, but serious thought
about how you retaliate and punish.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who is engineering another
crisis with Washington and the United Nations over inspections of
his arms programs, is hardly the only one trying to gauge America's
will.
</P>
<P>
   William Odom, who was director of counterterrorism in the Carter
White House, says he has come to a fairly simple view. ``Terrorism
at home is a crime; terrorism abroad is war.'' And if war is the
issue, he asks, ``why not act militarily?''
</P>
<P>
   While retaliation must be founded on fact, some suggest that
America's threats to retaliate to attacks like the bombing of its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania this month lack credibility,
because U.S. standards of evidence are too high for this kind of
fight. For the war against terrorism is an increasingly irregular
war, with nihilism or cultural fury replacing political programs,
and sponsorship increasingly hidden.
</P>
<P>
   One principal suspect in the East Africa bombings, as well as in
the Dhahran attack, for example, is a renegade Saudi financier,
Osama bin Laden, who has been operating out of Afghanistan with a
fortune and a religious ideology, perhaps taking a role that states
used to take _ or shielding them from responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a Washington
policy institute, thinks there must be credible punishment for
terrorism and a lower standard of proof to trigger it. In a world
of sovereign nations, he says, ``I don't believe you need the same
level of proof as a court of law. If someone throws stones and
threatens to throw more, I don't think the level of proof has to be
too high. And if you punish the wrong guy for a particular act,
that's not even so terrible, if you know for sure that this is a
bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, looking back to humiliating excesses in Vietnam and
Central America, argue that Americans have never been particularly
good at irregular warfare, perhaps because they are so
uncomfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's Rambo aside, Americans get skittish about granting
broad authority to the covert guys who break the rules, even to get
the bad guys. After scandals at the CIA, President Gerald R. Ford
issued an executive order in 1974 banning assassination, a
stricture that Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, now questions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is urging both relentless
pursuit and patience. ``We are not a nation that retaliates just in
order to get vengeance,'' she told nearly 800 State Department
employees after the Africa bombings. Although ``we would all like
to go out right this instant and bomb somebody,'' she said, ``I
think that we've got to be careful about what we're doing and why
we're doing it and if we're doing the right thing so that we can be
true to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a middle ground, says Paul Goble, a former official
with the State Department and the CIA. ``If you have to make an
American legal case, it's hard to do anything. If you say no
standards are necessary, then you unleash worse problems. But you
have to prove you mean business, and even our courts require no
more than excluding reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others point to President Ronald Reagan's order to bomb
Moammar Gadhafi's residence after there was clear evidence of
Libyan complicity in attacks on U.S. soldiers in Berlin. The
then-assistant secretary of defense, Richard Perle, has said
Gadhafi understood the message and ``behaved differently for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   There are levels of deterrence, officials and experts say, and
America needs to improve its performance on all of them. Gates and
setbacks for embassies are vital, along with improved intelligence,
particularly by spies as opposed to devices, says Robert Oakley, a
former head of counterterrorism at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even with improvements in these matters, and a steady effort to
bring terrorists to justice, argues Steven Emerson, an authority on
radical Islam, the most important element in counterterrorism is
``preemptive strikes and covert action'' to ``disrupt the
operations of the terrorists on their home turf.'' In 1996, he
noted, the Clinton administration endorsed the idea of specialized
units to infiltrate terrorist operations and disrupt them.
``Unfortunately that has not been done,'' he said.

 A CHILLING CRIME AND A QUESTION: WHAT'S IN A CHILD'S MIND? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the age of 7, a child is considered by the Roman Catholic
Church to have reached the ``age of reason'' and is entitled to
receive communion. Some evangelical churches hold that a child of 7
can make an independent spiritual choice.
</P>
<P>
   In Judaism and Islam, a boy of 7 is expected to begin his
religious studies and participate, to some degree, in adult rituals
like fasting and praying. Freud believed the super ego, or the
conscience, develops by age 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   But is a child of such tender years a responsible being, capable
of telling right from wrong and accountable, not just legally but
morally, for his actions?
</P>
<P>
   Murder charges brought last week in Chicago against two boys,
ages 7 and 8, raised the issue as more than an abstraction. The
boys, according to the police, confessed to killing an 11-year-old
girl, Ryan Harris, then stealing her bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters kill _ that's been drilled into the national
consciousness by a succession of school shootings. In those cases,
the juvenile killers were adolescents. The two boys who were
convicted last week of gunning down classmates and a teacher in
their Jonesboro, Ark., schoolyard last March were then just 11 and
13. The boy charged in the school shootings in Springfield, Ore.,
last May is 15. Few would argue with the assumption that, at that
stage in their lives, they ought to be capable of understanding
their actions and the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   With a child of only 7, however, the assumptions are neither
clear nor particularly comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with children who may have arrived at the age
of reason but whose psychological life is such that neither
rationality nor moral reason operate in their behavior?'' asked Dr.
Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist at Harvard University who has
written several books on the moral development of children.
</P>
<P>
   No one, he said, is born bad. Yet, despite a lifetime of
studying and listening to children, he was utterly confounded by
the implications of the Chicago case. ``In the absence of that kind
of psychological life _ I mean the lack of controls to deal with
the impulses of their lives, the lack of an operative consciousness
_ I can only throw up my hands,'' Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   How society will deal with the boys is now a question for the
juvenile justice system, but there are no precedents; they are the
youngest children ever charged with murder in this country.
Thursday, they were released to their mothers and ordered to wear
electronic monitoring devices and stay in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, a source of society's notions of justice, has been
wrestling with moral codes for millennia. But cases of children
committing capital crimes are rare, so they represent something of
a black hole for theologians, a puzzle that neither faith nor
doctrine anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   Both Judaism and Islam, for example, set the age of majority,
when children are liable for their actions, at 13 for boys and 12
for girls. ``It's the age of full responsibility and therefore full
liability,'' said Dr. David Kraemer, a professor at the Jewish
Theological Seminary. Younger children are considered to have the
impulse to do good and evil, he added, ``but not the reason to
control the impulse.''
</P>
<P>
   One rabbinic teaching goes further. While rabbinical courts
consider a 13-year-old liable for his actions, in the court of
heaven the age of majority is 20. ``It was a recognition that the
teen-age years were very tumultuous and that, although they are
full-grown and can do damage, God recognizes that they can't really
be held responsible,'' Kraemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, too, holds that a prepubescent child is not ``fully in
control of his senses and doesn't have the power of reasoning to
really make an informed judgment,'' said Dr. Jamal Badawi, a Muslim
scholar and chairman of the Islamic Information Foundation in
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither religion has a concept of original sin. ``The human
being is neither satanic nor angelic by nature,'' said Badawi,
referring to the Koran. ``He simply has the potential to ascend to
a level even higher than the angels or descend to a level lower
than animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian theology on the nature of the child is more complex,
encompassing a belief that everyone is tainted by original sin as
well as accommodating the idea that everyone is made in the image
of God.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of Pope Pius X nearly a century ago, the Catholic
Church has attributed to children of 7 the capacity to understand
the consequences of their actions. That is a prerequisite for their
First Communion, when they are first given a wafer in the sacrament
of the Eucharist. But strict doctrine has given way to pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the context,'' said the Rev. Richard
McCormick, a theologian at the University of Notre Dame. ``One of
the criteria used in regard to the Eucharist is the ability to
understand, in some very, very primordial sense, the difference
between just plain bread and this bread that is really Jesus. As we
all grow older, we understand and penetrate that a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   But children who may be old enough to take communion, he added,
are not necessarily thought of as capable of understanding the
nature of sin as a break with God. ``It's the conviction of
virtually all people that children of that age are incapable of
serious sin,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas about the emergence of moral consciousness developed
differently in Protestant churches. The Calvinist view was that
``the image of God in each of us is radically destroyed or altered
by what is called original sin, that there is innate depravity in
human beings,'' said John McDargh, an associate professor of
theology at Boston College. Other Christian thinkers, he said,
argued that the image of God should be seen as the human capacity
for relationships and that original sin may obscure but not destroy
that image.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, those divergent views produced not only
the image of ``The Bad Seed,'' as popularized in William March's
1954 novel about a child who is simply born bad, but also the early
Puritan notion that adults should deploy a harsh hand to break the
will of the innately corrupted child.
</P>
<P>
   Later movements, in a backlash, leaned more toward the Mark
Twain view that the natural child, like the fictional Huckleberry
Finn, is untainted except by society, and prescribed a lighter
parental touch to nurture what was believed to be the child's
innate capacity for empathy and charity.
</P>
<P>
   Modern theorists of child development see children much as
parents like to think of their offspring _ works in progress, with
natural inclinations to empathize with others, to feel bad if
someone is hurt, to tell right from wrong. The tricky part is
figuring out how and when those values can be warped or enhanced by
interactions with family, peers and society.
</P>
<P>
   By an early age, any child will be tested. ``When you send a
child off to school at 6, the child becomes a social being,
responsible to society,'' said Coles, the child psychiatrist. And
that's where the danger lies. ``Children who grow up with no sense
of right and wrong are both vulnerable and dangerous _ vulnerable
to their impulses, dangerous to others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reason, then, is not really the issue with a child of 7 or 8.
``It's not like a 4-year-old who happens to pull a trigger on a gun
and doesn't understand that it kills, or doesn't understand what
killing is about altogether, or what death is about,'' said Dr.
Moshe Halbertal, a professor of Jewish thought at Hebrew University
in Jerusalem. ``Here, at 7 or 8 or 9, they understand. We don't
attribute to them responsibility, but we do attribute to them
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And by their very nature, he added, children bounce the question
back to their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say that children are not fully legally responsible,
one thing we mean by that is that they mirror the social life
around them,'' Halbertal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's so shattering about crimes done by children.
They are naive or, in some ways, transparent reflections of
something in society _ a certain violence, a certain cruelty.
Without filtering, they represent what the society is about.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like an armada of tall ships, tales of the sea are sailing onto
bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   There are salty soap operas featuring sensitive mariners drawn
to the high seas to heal marital heartbreak or cope with terminal
disease. There are manly memoirs and survival books by Alaskan crab
fishermen and Antarctic explorers. For hard-core nautical buffs
there are handsome books on maritime arcana and history, like the
recent ``Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain,
660-1649,'' by N.A.M. Rodger (W.W. Norton, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   And then there are recycled classics like C.S. Forester's
swashbuckling Horatio Hornblower adventures and more obscure novels
like ``The Black Ship,'' a 1963 work by Dudley Pope about a bloody
mutiny aboard the HMS Hermione in 1797.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the siren call of the sea that makes readers
want to thumb through a ``cookery book'' like ``Lobscouse &AMP; Spotted
Dog'' (Norton, 1998) for recipes for sweetbreads in malmsey,
spotted dog (an eggy custard tinged with rosewater) and other
18th-century galley fare?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer, there is enough money in seafaring
literature these days to prompt a host of trade publishers to cash
in. The boom has been driven mainly by Norton's success with
Patrick O'Brian's series of historical seafaring novels following
the exploits of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and ``The Perfect
Storm,'' Sebastian Junger's 1997 nonfiction best-seller about the
destruction of a swordfishing boat by a violent Atlantic
nor'easter.
</P>
<P>
   Such imitation in publishing is as basic as paper. Publishing
houses are simply observing a cherished and fundamental ritual of
the trade: Follow the wake of popular books with titles in every
possible permutation till the boom goes bust. Sometimes the
publishing pack is hungry for memoirs of dysfunction and anorexia;
in other cases it's mystery books mixed with cooking recipes or
titles by new-age authors with direct lines to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing follow the leader here,'' said Starling
Lawrence, editor in chief of Norton. There are more than 3 million
copies of the 18 Aubrey-Maturin books in print, Lawrence noted,
with the next installment, ``The Hundred Days,'' to be published in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence sees little evidence that the public hunger for naval
literature has been sated. He said several publishers were prepared
to pay a seven-figure advance this summer for a manuscript about
the 1820 wreck of a whaling ship by a whale. But before the auction
could take place, Penguin Putnam placed a preemptive bid of more
than $1 million for the book, ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' a
true-life adventure that inspired ``Moby Dick.'' (Penguin has also
found modest success with a more contemporary adventure, ``Sea
Change,'' which mixes memoir, wounded heart and Atlantic
adventure.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You had several publishers willing to take a huge bet,''
Lawrence said. ``This may represent some kind of high-water folly _
I don't know _ or it may just be the smart money chasing the next
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Other publishing houses are trolling for titles in used
bookstores. Merritt Communications _ a Connecticut company best
known for magazines like Tomorrow's Pharmacist _ has rolled out a
new imprint called Capstan Press, which will publish golden oldies
like Jack London's ``Cruise of the Snark'' and ``Northern Lights,''
a 1927 nonfiction account of a potato lugger that sailed into a
raging Atlantic storm.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Holt &AMP; Co., with its new Heart of Oaks Sea Classics
series, recently reissued ``Peter Simple,'' an 1832 novel by
Frederick Marryat, a former Royal Navy captain, and ``Dr. Dogbody's
Leg,'' a 1940 collection of short stories by James Norman Hall
featuring a peg-legged narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Dean King, editor of Heart of Oaks Sea Classics, said he got the
idea for the series when he found ``Dr. Dogbody's Leg'' at the
bottom of a pile of books in the Argosy bookstore in New York. He
had already written two successful companion guides for O'Brian's
series that together have sold more than 125,000 copies for Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, life is lived more vicariously these days,''
King said. ``We spend our time on computers and phone lines. We
have very specialized and narrowly focused skills that are often
far removed from our physical lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of sea literature is the conflict of ``man versus
nature,'' he added. ``I think we long for that interaction with our
natural world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the popularity of nautical literature has yet to lead
to full-scale sea battle reenactments, it has inspired readers to
develop some exotic pursuits. King, for example, took a voyage to
Bermuda in June with a group of other O'Brian fans aboard the HMS
Rose, a 30-gun frigate that is a replica of a 1750s British ship
that was stationed in North America. The same frigate had been used
earlier this summer to stage a sumptuous meal for sea literature
aficionados like William F. Buckley Jr. and Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's devoted following includes Paul LeClerc, president of
the New York Public Library, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy. LeClerc said O'Brian ``succeeds in creating a whole
world out of language that is exotic, mystifying and enthralling
and addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, like LeClerc, is not a sailor, but his reading material
has ranged from O'Brian's books to ``The Perfect Storm'' to ``The
Ordinary Seaman,'' a recent novel by Francisco Goldman about
Central American sailors stranded aboard a rat-infested cargo ship
docked outside New York. The appeal of such books, Kennedy said,
has to do with the ocean as a ``metaphor for our own existence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our liberty to succeed or fail, but in another sense
our fate is controlled by unseen sources,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sir Edmund Hillary, who conquered Mount Everest in 1953,
best understood the enduring fascination of sea literature.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1976 forward to ``Shackleton's Boat Journey,'' the memoir
of a frostbitten 1914-1916 Antarctica expedition that has just been
reissued by Norton, Hillary wondered how the ``hard men of today
with their fancy equipment and `instant rescue' by radio and
helicopter would have survived under such conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger is one thing,'' he wrote, ``but danger plus extreme
discomfort for long periods is quite another.''

 JAPAN'S FIRST-GRADERS: LEARNING TO LOVE SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When my son Gregory writes his ``What I did over my
summer vacation'' essay this fall, it will be pretty easy. He went
to school.
</P>
<P>
   We live in Japan, and his American-style international school
ended the school year at the beginning of June. But Japanese
elementary schools stay in session until late July, so we enrolled
him in the local elementary school for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings he set off in his yellow school cap, his black
backpack (girls have red backpacks, boys have black ones), his name
badge, his red ``tablecloth'' to cover his desk during lunch, his
miniature piano for music class, and a mountain of books. The
children are supposed to take all their schoolbooks home with them
each day, as an inducement to crack them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fundamental distinctions of Japanese life is ``soto''
versus ``uchi'' _ outside and inside, them and us, and one could
see the distinctions developing even in the first grade. The school
class is enormously tight-knit, and the children are constantly
taught to think of themselves as members of a larger unit. Indeed,
to encourage the sense of belonging, a school class typically stays
together for at least two years, with the same students and the
same teacher for two grades in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For Gregory, the entire universe revolved around Miss Ikeda's
first grade classroom. If one wants to find the roots of Japanese
business habits, where men wear uniforms of dark suits to work and
ignore their families and socialize entirely with their colleagues,
the schools are a good place to start. Children form the same kind
of bond with their peers, focusing their lives on school chums
rather than neighbors or families, and the cohesive force is as
much a presence in daily life as gravity: After a week, Gregory was
rummaging through his clothes drawer and saying that instead of
jeans he wanted to wear shorts like his school friends.
</P>
<P>
   This may indeed stunt individuality, as many Japanese
commentators believe, and it may exert pressure on kids who stick
out. One boy hassled and pinched Gregory, apparently in part
because he was different. On the other hand, the sense of teamwork
is very impressive, and the distrust of ``soto,'' or outside, did
not prevent first grade girls from forming a crush on Gregory,
probably because he was different.
</P>
<P>
   I was walking along the sidewalk once with Gregory and a car
driving by came to a screeching halt beside us. A little girl in
the back seat rolled down her window and yelled frantically,
``Gregory! Gregory! Hi there, Gregory!'' He looked at her as if she
had girl germs and marched on, probably breaking her heart _ and no
doubt leaving her mom, who was driving the car, thinking that
American education tends to stunt the friendliness of children.
</P>
<P>
   We were in for some surprises from the first day of Miss Ikeda's
class. Above all, despite all the talk about Japanese schools
stunting individuality, the Japanese system went to far greater
lengths to teach individual responsibility. When Gregory entered
his class for the first time, he had to stand in front and
introduce himself to the class. On the next day, he had to
introduce himself to the entire student body at the morning meeting
on the playground. The teacher coached him on how to bow and shout
out: ``My name is Gregory Kristof, and I am a first grader. I would
be grateful if you would help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been a terrifying experience, but it was not. The
atmosphere was gentle, so that it was obvious that if Gregory
messed up, that was fine too. When Gregory stepped into his first
grade class and looked around wide-eyed at 37 faces, his
self-introduction was little more than a whisper, without much of a
bow. Yet Miss Ikeda simply thanked him warmly and asked another
student to show him his seat and answer any questions that came up.
</P>
<P>
   That use of students to help others and fill adult-like roles is
also a hallmark of Japanese schools. There are no janitors, for the
students themselves have a daily cleaning time when they scrub the
floors and windows and toilets. There is no cafeteria, and students
themselves bring the food from a preparation room and serve it to
other children.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's proudest week was when he was on the ``lunch duty''
and he got to wear a white uniform and cap and was let out with a
few others to bring the food and serve it. While I raved about the
idea of kids cleaning the schools, however, Gregory was less
impressed by the ``Honorable Cleaning,'' as it is called in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring,'' he protested. ``I don't think it's a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, though, came when we asked what time we
should pick Gregory up after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the kids walk home by themselves,'' a teacher explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's only a first grader. Surely all the kids don't go
home by themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes. We encourage them to walk to and from school on their
own. It builds independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, all the Japanese children walk to and from school
by themselves, and a few even take buses or the subway if their
school is far away. Most go with friends, but many walk on their
own. This is of course possible only in a country with safe
streets, but still the sight of six-year-olds emerging from the
subway to go to school tended to undermine the stereotype of Japan
as a country where children are robots who are incapable of
individual activity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the notion that Japanese schools stifle creativity
took a blow when I saw that all the children learn to play the
piano. Music and art are a much more important part of the
curriculum in Japan than in the United States, and they are one
facet of creative expression.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the math teaching used story problems and other
methods to drive home the principles of what they were learning.
Instead of simply doing addition drills, for example, Miss Ikeda
would call out a number, and the children would have to shout out
how many more would equal ten. So if she called out six, the class
was supposed to answer with a chorus of ``four.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, my impression of Japanese elementary school was
excellent. There was far more teaching of math and of reading and
writing than would be the case in most American schools _ Gregory
now reads better in Japanese than in English _ and it seemed that
this was in part a function of Japan simply taking primary
education more seriously than America does.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, although Americans view themselves as modernists,
it is the United States that sticks with an anachronism like a
school year based on an agricultural society, in which children
take off for the summer to help with farmwork. Until recently Japan
was an agricultural country, but it saw its future in education
rather than fieldwork, and so children go to school in the summer.
They do have a month-long summer vacation, but during that time
they must write a daily journal and do other homework. The result
is that fall does not need to be spent repeating what was taught
the previous spring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, teachers in Japan are first rate, are paid
excellent wages and enjoy high prestige. Moreover, Japanese
children benefit from the gender discrimination that Japanese women
suffer: It is difficult for the smartest women to become doctors or
lawyers in Japan, so while brilliant American women become brain
surgeons or university professors, brilliant Japanese women often
become elementary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round school and first-rate teachers are expensive, of
course, but Japan views those as essentials and cuts corners in
other areas. Aside from the lack of cafeterias and janitors, there
is no air conditioning and buildings are old and rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, classes are large _ nearly 40 pupils in Gregory's
first grade class _ and they function only because so much of the
responsibility is assigned to the students themselves. Gregory's
Japanese is fluent but not native level, and so when he did not
understand something, a boy named Kubori-kun was detailed to
explain it to him, the idea being that this would help both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   All this school sounds as if it would be all work and no play,
and indeed the average child in Asia has had one to two more years
in a classroom by the time he or she enters junior high than the
average American child. But the saving grace was a boisterous
emphasis on fun in the classroom. Kids were always shouting and
clowning around, with none of the discipline that people assume is
drilled into them, and the student-teacher ratio was so large that
the classroom was mostly on the lip of chaos. That had
disadvantages, of course, but it seemed to mean lots of fun for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there was recess _ lots of it _ and most of the
children seemed to enjoy the recess with their friends so much that
they were willing to put up with the additional classroom time.
</P>
<P>
   So Gregory had a great time. In the end he prefers his
international school, because he feels more natural studying in
English, but he said that despite the long hours most of the pupils
had more fun in the Japanese school.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The recess,'' Gregory explained. ``There's lots of recess. And
that's the best thing about school.''

 BLACKS CRUNCH THE NUMBERS FIGURING OUT HISPANIC INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In seven years, according to the Census Bureau,
blacks will no longer be the nation's largest minority group, for
the first time since the federal government began keeping an
official count of the population.
</P>
<P>
   As the country hurtles toward this demographic Rubicon, the
ascendancy of Hispanic people as the leading minority, in terms of
their share of the population, is generating a range of reaction
among experts on the country's racial dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fearful, sensing a lessening of black influence and an
increase in tension as many black and Hispanic Americans compete to
move up the economic ladder. Some are optimistic that strong
alliances can be formed on issues like education, affirmative
action and reform of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that blacks will continue to set the pace with
regard to the racial climate. Still others suggest that this
dynamic depends not only on the increased Hispanic population and
whether the large proportion of it who are aliens _ legal and
illegal _ become citizens and vote, but also on the rate of
intermarriage with whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major demographic shift that's going to hit and it
will have some significant political ramifications,'' said Eddie
Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a research organization that studies racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among some liberals and some conservatives, there is surprising
agreement that the burgeoning Hispanic population and the
fast-growing Asian population _ both of which are much more diverse
and perhaps less strident on racial matters than are blacks _ will
alter racial dialogue that, as Jim Sleeper, author of ``Liberal
Racism'' (Viking, 1997) said, has been dominated by ``whites or
blacks who have been locked in a kind of psychic and physical
embrace for the last 300 years.''
</P>
<P>
   One liberal black civil rights leader, who asked not to be
identified, said that as a result of the increase in the Hispanic
and Asian populations ``the emergence of class interests has the
potential to be as significant to the next century as race was in
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of solidarity of people of color _ in part,
because both groups are disproportionately poor _ their interests
often diverge. According to exit polls conducted by The Los Angeles
Times, 47 percent of black voters in California supported a 1994
ballot initiative to restrict benefits to illegal aliens and 48
percent backed another voter initiative this year to curtail
bilingual education severely. The two groups have also squabbled
over control and jobs at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Hospital in
Los Angeles, access to public housing in Chicago and political
power in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats hold on to the White House, a flash point may
loom in the coming years over the next vacancy on the Supreme
Court. In the wake of the retirement or death of a justice,
Hispanic leaders will likely press for the appointment of the
country's first Hispanic justice. That demand may put them at odds
with blacks who feel poorly represented by Justice Clarence Thomas
and want a more liberal black justice on the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper's poll also showed that 74 percent of
California's blacks and 76 percent of its Hispanic citizens voted
against a ballot measure that ended affirmative action in state
hiring, contracting and public university admissions. And both
groups are jointly fighting Republicans, who want to prevent the
Census Bureau from using modern statistical methods for a more
accurate count in the 2000 Census, which would probably increase
minority numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that we can now begin to form alliances and it
need not be a zero sum game,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, president of
the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The changing racial dynamic may also depend on another
phenomenon. In the 1990 Census, 31.4 percent of Hispanic women who
were married reported that their husband was non-Hispanic, with the
overwhelming majority of these spouses being non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, only 6.3 percent of black women who were married
had husbands of another racial group. The census data
underrepresents the black intermarriage rate since it is based on
the woman's choice of partner and demographers note that black men
marry white women in greater numbers than black women marry white
men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that Hispanic people are far more likely to
marry outside their ethnic group than blacks are. No one knows what
this high rate of intermarriage between Hispanic and non-Hispanic
whites portends. The children of such unions could just as easily
identify with the larger Anglo society as with disadvantaged
``people of color,'' making the notion of solidarity with blacks
either a reality or a pipe dream depending on which way they go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could end up being honorary whites,'' said Ronald
Walters, a political scientist at the University of Maryland. ``We
could end up with a situation like they had in South Africa or
Brazil.''

   States around the country are breaking up utility monopolies,
hoping to create a competitive marketplace for electricity. But
that does not mean the monopolies are disappearing; some may just
be turning sideways, moving away from vertical operations that
controlled coal mines, power stations and meters and toward a
horizontal business that manages huge groups of generating
stations. Leading the turn, some experts predict, will be nuclear
power.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation has attracted suitors for the generating stations
and created an opportunity to operate them almost like McDonald's
franchises. Big regional utilities like Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric,
Duke Power Co. and Entergy have set up affiliates that build or buy
generating stations far from their home territory.
</P>
<P>
   Two nuclear power plants in Maine and Pennsylvania have recently
been cast out into the cold by owners facing deregulation and they
have tried to market themselves like middle-aged managers laid off
in corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will end up owned by people who can run them efficiently
and do well, not by all these mom-and-pop utilities,'' said one
utility shopper, Richard Bornemann, a former vice president of
United Illuminating, an electric company in southern Connecticut
that is part owner of several nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Few people think of a company running nuclear reactors as a
``mom and pop'' operation. But one of Bornemann's partners, Dr.
Shelby Brewer, a top executive of Combustion Engineering when that
company was an independent reactor manufacturer, predicted that the
industry would become so consolidated in a few years that only two
or three companies _ not scores of them _ would be running the
remaining reactors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Making the right decision about old reactors is important to
consumers' bills. In the 1970s and 1980s the utility industry
wasted tens of billions of dollars on more than 100 reactors that
were later abandoned before completion because they were
uneconomical. It spent tens of billions completing others that
should not have built. Now the industry must decide which plants
can continue to operate efficiently and at low risk.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of assembling reactors into chains is rather stunning.
In the late 1950s tiny utilities banded together to tackle the
giant new nuclear technology and the ``Yankee'' system began. The
26-year-old Maine Yankee reactor in Wiscasset has eight owners;
ownership of Vermont Yankee, Connecticut Yankee and Yankee Rowe in
Massachusetts was also shared. Now giant conglomerates want to
manage strings of tiny reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Bornemann and Brewer, together with Timothy Smith, a former
industry lobbyist, made a bid late last month for Maine Yankee,
which has been on the market two years. The three said they would
run it as a ``merchant'' plant, selling its power to whomever
wanted it that hour, that week or that month, like a taxi in a
field previously served only by private cars. Many companies have
built merchant plants that run on natural gas or coal. No one is
likely to build a nuclear plant, but existing reactors could be
sold by utilities and become merchant plants.
</P>
<P>
   Their bid came too late. The consortium that owns the plant
recently hired Stone &AMP; Webster, which built it, to tear it down.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's prediction might have sounded outlandish years ago. But
last month the first-ever sale of an operating reactor was
completed; the undamaged twin of the Three Mile Island reactor that
melted down near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979, was bought by
Amerigen, a consortium of Philadelphia Electric and British Energy.
</P>
<P>
   But it will have competition. ``We've said for a number of years
we'd like to be an operator,'' said Cyril Guerrera, a spokesman for
Entergy, which is based in New Orleans and supplied Maine Yankee's
most recent managers. It already owns five reactors, and Entergy
recently said it wanted to buy reactors, or at least shares in
them. Deregulation enables the companies to collect some of their
losses from their customers, and may spur them to sell cheap,
partly because the cost of decommissioning reactors is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long criticized the American nuclear program for
having too many companies, each running too few plants to get any
economies of scale or skill. Now the programs seem to face the kind
of consolidation that has transformed everything from grocery
stores to cable television companies. However it occurs,
consolidation could be good for consumers, say people inside the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Fontes, the assistant general manager at the Northern
California Power Agency, which represents 15 small utilities that
buy their power wholesale, disagreed. When one company owns most of
the generation in an area, he said, ``prices will reflect the
owners desires more than the market demand.''

 CLINTON AND SEX: THE DEVIL'S IN THE DEFINITION

<P>
   As the investigation into President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky heads toward a pivotal intersection Monday with the
president's testimony to a grand jury, a semantic wrinkle has
emerged. Just what ARE ``sexual relations?'' Whether the president
and Ms. Lewinsky had them depends on the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, a clip-and-save road map for the murky verbal terrain
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAULA JONES LAWSUIT. For the purposes of her dismissed
sexual harassment claim against the president, sexual relations
were defined as ``contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast,
inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person.'' By a literal reading,
that definition would not embrace the passive partner in oral sex,
who could say truthfully that he had not had sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   THE LEGAL VIEW. There is no generic legal definition of sexual
relations, the description of which depends on the context of a
given case _ civil or criminal, sexual harassment or rape _ and the
specific statutes wherever the case resides, according to Elizabeth
Schneider, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and expert on gender
and law.
</P>
<P>
   THE DICTIONARY. The third edition of Webster's New World
Dictionary does not include an entry for ``sexual relations,'' but
the definition of the noun ``sex'' includes ``anything connected
with sexual gratification or reproduction or the urge for these.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION. Bill Merrell, a spokesman for
the organization's executive committee, said participation in any
type of activity that involves the touching of one partner's
genitals for pleasure would qualify as sexual relations _ and would
be forbidden between the unmarried by Baptists. As for the
suggestion that the passive partner's experience could be
considered something other than sexual, Merrell said, ``It is
astounding to me that anyone of a rational mind and with any
experience as an adult could say that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY OF HUMAN SEXUALITY IN SAN
FRANCISCO. Dr. Ted McIlvenna, the institute's president, said
sexual relations encompass any part of the process through which an
individual, having experienced the stirrings of desire, negotiates
a satisfaction of that urge. The negotiation, he added, can be
solitary. ``You can have sexual relations with yourself,''
McIlvenna said.

 JAPAN'S FIRST-GRADERS: LEARNING TO LOVE SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, August (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When my son Gregory writes his ``What I did over my
summer vacation'' essay this fall, it will be pretty easy. He went
to school.
</P>
<P>
   We live in Japan, and his American-style international school
ended the school year at the beginning of June. But Japanese
elementary schools stay in session until late July, so we enrolled
him in the local elementary school for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings he set off in his yellow school cap, his black
backpack (girls have red backpacks, boys have black ones), his name
badge, his red ``tablecloth'' to cover his desk during lunch, his
miniature piano for music class, and a mountain of books. The
children are supposed to take all their schoolbooks home with them
each day, as an inducement to crack them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fundamental distinctions of Japanese life is ``soto''
versus ``uchi'' _ outside and inside, them and us, and one could
see the distinctions developing even in the first grade. The school
class is enormously tight-knit, and the children are constantly
taught to think of themselves as members of a larger unit. Indeed,
to encourage the sense of belonging, a school class typically stays
together for at least two years, with the same students and the
same teacher for two grades in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For Gregory, the entire universe revolved around Miss Ikeda's
first grade classroom. If one wants to find the roots of Japanese
business habits, where men wear uniforms of dark suits to work and
ignore their families and socialize entirely with their colleagues,
the schools are a good place to start. Children form the same kind
of bond with their peers, focusing their lives on school chums
rather than neighbors or families, and the cohesive force is as
much a presence in daily life as gravity: After a week, Gregory was
rummaging through his clothes drawer and saying that instead of
jeans he wanted to wear shorts like his school friends.
</P>
<P>
   This may indeed stunt individuality, as many Japanese
commentators believe, and it may exert pressure on kids who stick
out. One boy hassled and pinched Gregory, apparently in part
because he was different. On the other hand, the sense of teamwork
is very impressive, and the distrust of ``soto,'' or outside, did
not prevent first grade girls from forming a crush on Gregory,
probably because he was different.
</P>
<P>
   I was walking along the sidewalk once with Gregory and a car
driving by came to a screeching halt beside us. A little girl in
the back seat rolled down her window and yelled frantically,
``Gregory! Gregory! Hi there, Gregory!'' He looked at her as if she
had girl germs and marched on, probably breaking her heart _ and no
doubt leaving her mom, who was driving the car, thinking that
American education tends to stunt the friendliness of children.
</P>
<P>
   We were in for some surprises from the first day of Miss Ikeda's
class. Above all, despite all the talk about Japanese schools
stunting individuality, the Japanese system went to far greater
lengths to teach individual responsibility. When Gregory entered
his class for the first time, he had to stand in front and
introduce himself to the class. On the next day, he had to
introduce himself to the entire student body at the morning meeting
on the playground. The teacher coached him on how to bow and shout
out: ``My name is Gregory Kristof, and I am a first grader. I would
be grateful if you would help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been a terrifying experience, but it was not. The
atmosphere was gentle, so that it was obvious that if Gregory
messed up, that was fine too. When Gregory stepped into his first
grade class and looked around wide-eyed at 37 faces, his
self-introduction was little more than a whisper, without much of a
bow. Yet Miss Ikeda simply thanked him warmly and asked another
student to show him his seat and answer any questions that came up.
</P>
<P>
   That use of students to help others and fill adult-like roles is
also a hallmark of Japanese schools. There are no janitors, for the
students themselves have a daily cleaning time when they scrub the
floors and windows and toilets. There is no cafeteria, and students
themselves bring the food from a preparation room and serve it to
other children.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's proudest week was when he was on the ``lunch duty''
and he got to wear a white uniform and cap and was let out with a
few others to bring the food and serve it. While I raved about the
idea of kids cleaning the schools, however, Gregory was less
impressed by the ``Honorable Cleaning,'' as it is called in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring,'' he protested. ``I don't think it's a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, though, came when we asked what time we
should pick Gregory up after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the kids walk home by themselves,'' a teacher explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's only a first grader. Surely all the kids don't go
home by themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes. We encourage them to walk to and from school on their
own. It builds independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, all the Japanese children walk to and from school
by themselves, and a few even take buses or the subway if their
school is far away. Most go with friends, but many walk on their
own. This is of course possible only in a country with safe
streets, but still the sight of six-year-olds emerging from the
subway to go to school tended to undermine the stereotype of Japan
as a country where children are robots who are incapable of
individual activity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the notion that Japanese schools stifle creativity
took a blow when I saw that all the children learn to play the
piano. Music and art are a much more important part of the
curriculum in Japan than in the United States, and they are one
facet of creative expression.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the math teaching used story problems and other
methods to drive home the principles of what they were learning.
Instead of simply doing addition drills, for example, Miss Ikeda
would call out a number, and the children would have to shout out
how many more would equal ten. So if she called out six, the class
was supposed to answer with a chorus of ``four.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, my impression of Japanese elementary school was
excellent. There was far more teaching of math and of reading and
writing than would be the case in most American schools _ Gregory
now reads better in Japanese than in English _ and it seemed that
this was in part a function of Japan simply taking primary
education more seriously than America does.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, although Americans view themselves as modernists,
it is the United States that sticks with an anachronism like a
school year based on an agricultural society, in which children
take off for the summer to help with farmwork. Until recently Japan
was an agricultural country, but it saw its future in education
rather than fieldwork, and so children go to school in the summer.
They do have a month-long summer vacation, but during that time
they must write a daily journal and do other homework. The result
is that fall does not need to be spent repeating what was taught
the previous spring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, teachers in Japan are first rate, are paid
excellent wages and enjoy high prestige. Moreover, Japanese
children benefit from the gender discrimination that Japanese women
suffer: It is difficult for the smartest women to become doctors or
lawyers in Japan, so while brilliant American women become brain
surgeons or university professors, brilliant Japanese women often
become elementary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round school and first-rate teachers are expensive, of
course, but Japan views those as essentials and cuts corners in
other areas. Aside from the lack of cafeterias and janitors, there
is no air conditioning and buildings are old and rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, classes are large _ nearly 40 pupils in Gregory's
first grade class _ and they function only because so much of the
responsibility is assigned to the students themselves. Gregory's
Japanese is fluent but not native level, and so when he did not
understand something, a boy named Kubori-kun was detailed to
explain it to him, the idea being that this would help both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   All this school sounds as if it would be all work and no play,
and indeed the average child in Asia has had one to two more years
in a classroom by the time he or she enters junior high than the
average American child. But the saving grace was a boisterous
emphasis on fun in the classroom. Kids were always shouting and
clowning around, with none of the discipline that people assume is
drilled into them, and the student-teacher ratio was so large that
the classroom was mostly on the lip of chaos. That had
disadvantages, of course, but it seemed to mean lots of fun for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there was recess _ lots of it _ and most of the
children seemed to enjoy the recess with their friends so much that
they were willing to put up with the additional classroom time.
</P>
<P>
   So Gregory had a great time. In the end he prefers his
international school, because he feels more natural studying in
English, but he said that despite the long hours most of the pupils
had more fun in the Japanese school.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The recess,'' Gregory explained. ``There's lots of recess. And
that's the best thing about school.''

REPUBLICANS TRY TO PASS AS GREEN _ FOR VOTES

<P>
   Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House are sparring about
who is more environmentally friendly. It's a paper tussle _ carried
out with feuding reports during an election season. Their words are
really aimed at voters.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls consistently show that approximately 70
percent of Americans want the environment and wilderness areas
protected.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans began the public relations duel. On July 15, the
House Policy Committee, chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,
issued a report claiming that Republicans deserve recognition for
an ``historic record of environmental accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report gives the GOP credit for passing what it calls two
major environmental bills: the Tropical Forest Conservation Act
(H.R. 2870) and the Sonny Bono Memorial Salton Sea Reclamation Act
(H.R. 3267). The report states they are ``two new wins for the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   More spin than win. The self-congratulatory GOP report fudges on
both of its key boasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Tropical Forest Conservation Act allows developing countries
to swap portions of their debts to the United States in exchange
for tropical forest conservation. The bill won the endorsement of
the World Wildlife Fund and the Sierra Club and passed both houses
of Congress. On July 29, President Clinton signed the bill into
law.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good piece of environmental legislation _ trouble is,
the GOP can't really accept applause for its passage. Only 161
House Republicans voted for the bill with 60 against, while 194
House Democrats voted for passage with only one nay.
</P>
<P>
   The Salton Sea Reclamation Act, introduced by Duncan Hunter,
R-Calif., passed the House by a mere 21 votes and is stalled in the
Senate. For good reason. No major environmental group supported the
House version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hasty bill that short-cuts scientific research, the Clean
Water Act, and judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has its own version of the bill (S. 1716), introduced
by the two Democratic senators from California, Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein. Their bill is scientifically sensitive and gained
the endorsement of the National Audubon Society and other
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were designed to reclaim the Salton Sea which formed
in 1905 when a levee broke and the Colorado River flowed in the
Salton trough about 130 miles east of San Diego. It's a landlocked
body of water that is now threatened by gradually increasing
salinity and industrial pollutants. The briny sea is beginning to
take its toll of fish, birds and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is needed, but not the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the GOP issued its report, Democrats
fired back.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., and the Democratic
staff of the House Committee on Resources issued a response
entitled ``The Great Republican Environmental P.R. Campaign'' which
calls the report a publicity stunt ``designed to `greenwash' the
press and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller condemns the GOP report as a ``decoy for
anti-environmental riders'' that have been attached to recent
appropriations bills: ``Hidden in the VA-HUD, Interior, and
Commerce appropriations bills pending before Congress are riders
that will gut public health and environmental protections _ just
like the highly controversial Republican riders of the 104th
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic parry and thrust has its own false footing. The
Miller report criticizes the GOP for undercutting the National
Parks, but completely ignores ``Vision 2020 National Parks
Restoration Act'' authored by Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo. The
national parks bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent and is
now being considered in the House Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This bill would strengthen National Parks and provide means for
protecting these beloved natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Miller report is deadly accurate when it points to
the numerous anti-environmental riders attached to appropriations
bills by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Riders to both the House and the Senate version of the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
Appropriations Act (VA-HUD) severely limit the number of
toxicological profiles that can be taken at hazardous substance
Superfund sites. These profiles are used to gauge acceptable levels
of exposure to pollutants found at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   The VA-HUD appropriations bills delay cleanup of PCBs in the
Hudson River and other rivers around the nation and cut funding for
cleaning up old, vacated industrial urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   GOP riders to the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act
cut funding to the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land
Management, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. They subsidize more
logging and logging roads. They end the Interior Columbia Basin
Ecosystem Management Plan that was designed to improve the
management of 72 million acres of BLM and Forest Service lands and
allows projects that could jeopardize the ecosystem to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the Interior appropriations bill mandates a
road to be built through Alaska's Chugach National Forest and
across the Copper River Delta, one of the nation's largest wetlands
and waterfowl feeding areas. The GOP rider waives all environmental
review and public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP rider to the House version also opens 75 acres of
Florida's coastline to development and removes them from the
Coastal Barrier Resources System. These coastal barriers are
nesting areas for sea turtles and other threatened and endangered
species. The area is also prone to hurricane destruction.
Development in these 75 acres would now be eligible for federal
subsidies and taxpayer dollars when buildings and settlements are
destroyed by wind and sea.
</P>
<P>
   When amendments were offered to soften the worst
anti-environmental riders, the tally of votes told a sad tale.
According to the Miller report, of seven key pro-environmental
amendments, on average, only 17 percent of the Republicans in the
House voted for their passage.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party should blush red for pretending to be
green.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: You gotta believe _ not!
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 19, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever so slowly, at a steady but glacier-like pace, everything
seemingly believable becomes unbelievable. Even the stories that
render other stories implausible become implausible themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a psychologist in San Francisco made it known
that tape recordings that he stuffed into his desk 25 years ago and
forgot about show that the incredible 1973 book about the
multi-personality Sybil (she led 16 different existences at the
same time) was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   A susceptible Sybil was responding to suggestions by her
psychiatrist rather than inquiries, says Dr. Robin Rieber of the
John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Both the
psychiatrist and the author of the book are dead, so we can't hear
from them.
</P>
<P>
   Or can we?
</P>
<P>
   Anything is believable _ and unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   How many Americans will swear to you that Elvis is alive? Did
Shirley McLaine have anything to do with the French Revolution? And
was it really a hired actor, imitating Winston Churchill's voice,
who spoke the words over radio that stirred the British people
against overwhelming odds in the early days of WWII?
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget that despite the eyewitness accounts of
conquering armies, the surviving victims, and miles of newsreel
film and paperwork, there are some who don't believe there was a
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Another revision: Many years after the publication of Merle
Miller's ``Plain Speaking,'' the highly-regarded oral biography of
Harry Truman, it was termed a fraud by two Truman scholars. Truman
never said much of what Miller said he said, they contended. Of
course, this did not come out until after both Truman and Miller
were dead.
</P>
<P>
   So, there's no qualified debate, just as there can not be any on
the Sybil issue; that is, unless Ms. McLaine once was one of
Sybil's 16 personalities and can help us out.
</P>
<P>
   While Dr. Rieber would have us accept that the tapes he
possesses document that Sybil's story was infused with suggestions
by her psychiatrist _ thus creating the multiple personalities _
what are we to think of Dr. Rieber himself?
</P>
<P>
   Could he have been the inspiration for the Disney flick ``The
Absent-Minded Professor''? Do we accept at face value Dr. Rieber's
story that he had these tapes in his drawer for 25 years and simply
forgot about them?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rieber, who says he got the tapes from ``Sybil'' author
Flora Rheta Schreiber, contends there was no malice intended by
either Schreiber or the attending psychiatrist, Dr. Cornelia
Wilbur. They were not totally aware that the story they were
telling was wrong, Dr. Rieber said. ``Yet, at the same time, they
wished to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the way Aesop did things; also the columnist from the
Boston Globe. (No, not the George Carlin plagiarizer, the other
one.)
</P>
<P>
   Unearthing the Sybil tapes, and Dr. Rieber's interpretation of
them, also will renew skepticism about the 1950s reincarnation
story of Bridey Murphy. Unlike Sybil, who was living 16 lives
concurrently, Virginia Tighe _ under hypnosis _ conjured past
lives, including a 19th century Bridey Murphy of Cork, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   I say it can renew skepticism because ``The Skeptic's
Dictionary,'' by Robert Todd Carroll, a professor of philosophy at
Sacramento City College, already tagged it as a phony. Carroll says
the Chicago American (now deceased, but you never can be sure of
these things) found a Bridey Murphy Corkell lived in a house in
Chicago across from where Virginia Tighe lived as a child _ no past
life, just a confused childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, everyone is under the spotlight of revisionism and
rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   One only can imagine what will be the prevailing thoughts about
Clinton/Lewinsky 50 or so years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Someone probably will claim Monica was a Hammas operative, or
some vague medical evidence will appear that Clinton was impotent,
both inside and outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing should surprise us any more, or make us believe.

   BROWN-COMEBACK _ ATLANTA _ Throughout the 1980s, Georgia's own
T. Graham Brown was a rising star in Nashville, churning out Top-10
country hits and recording duets with the likes of Tanya Tucker. It
was a long way from his frat party days in Athens, where he got his
start as half of the popular house band Dirk and Tony. But by the
mid-'90s, Brown's world crumbled as he fought declining record
sales and escalating alcoholism. Now Brown's back with a new album
and a new, sober lifestyle. His new single debuts Tuesday.

   TV-SURFER _ Lifetime is debuting three series. As you'd expect,
they're strong on women: ``Maggie,'' ``Oh, Baby'' and ``Any Day

the big networks _ ``Oh, Baby'' is about a career woman who decides
artificial insemination is the way to go to be a mom. Men aren't
central to these women's lives _ and when it comes ``Oh, Baby,''
men are hardly essential. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 `SCOTTY' PRAISES SPIELBERG FOR `SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'

 Includes a color slide of James Doohan as Scotty in ``Star Trek.'' 
 By JERRY TALLMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    James Doohan can sympathize with the mother in ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' who collapses upon seeing a military car approaching her
house with apparent news of death.
 &HT;    Doohan, best known as ``Scotty'' in ``Star Trek,'' served in
D-Day with the Canadian forces and was injured so badly he was
shipped to England to recover. Watching the scene where the mother
learns the news, Doohan couldn't help but think of his own mother.
 &HT;    He was so moved he dropped a note to director Steven Spielberg
that began: ``Dear Mr. Spielberg, You know me as Scotty ... '' and
went on from there with a few words of praise and thanks for that
stunning motion picture. (Doohan is not alone. In its first 17
days, the film topped the $100 million mark.)
 &HT;    ``To tell the honest truth,'' Doohan says of the note some weeks
later, ``I suffered through the first 25 minutes of the movie'' _ a
ferocious re-enactment of the American landing on Omaha Beach, on
D-Day, June 6, 1944.
 &HT;    ``When I wrote Spielberg I told him I'd landed on Juno on
D-Day'' _ Juno Beach, the Canadian landing site _ ``which was
nothing as horrid as the Omaha disaster.'' Not horrid, perhaps, but
bad enough.
 &HT;    He and his men landed unscathed on Juno, and fought their way
successfully into the Normandy peninsula as far as the town of
Courseulles that first day. But Artillery Lt. James Doohan of D
Company, Winnipeg Rifles, 13th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Army,
ended up just before midnight plugged by eight German bullets.
 &HT;    Four hit his left knee, three took out the middle finger of his
right hand and one was deflected from killing him by the
Sterling-silver cigarette case in the breast pocket of his jacket.
``I still have that cigarette case today,'' the husky 78-year-old
Doohan says through his walrus moustache, shooting his eyebrows.
 &HT;    You know him as Scotty _ Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott of the
Federation starship ``U.S.S. Enterprise'' _ as does everybody who
went around saying: ``Beam me up, Scotty.'' Doohan portrayed the
character in the 79 episodes of tv's ``Star Trek'' from 1966 to
1969, and reprised the role in seven ``Star Trek'' movies.
 &HT;    Actually, he insists, the exact line was ```Beam me up, Mr.
Scott.' The fans made it `Beam me up, Scotty.'''
 &HT;    And the line that Scotty kept having to repeat to Capt. Kirk
(William Shatner) was: ``Captain, my engines just can't take it.''
 &HT;    Doohan is not a Scot. He was ``conceived in Northern Ireland,
born in Vancouver, British Columbia, grew up in Ioco, B.C., a town
named for the Imperial Oil Company,'' and his blood is mostly or
entirely Irish.
 &HT;    It was when, as an actor with 20 years' experience, he was
auditioning for ``Star Trek'' in 1965 _ ``reading a girl's part in
eight different accents, because I could do any accent'' _ that he
was asked by ``Star Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry which of those
accents he preferred.
 &HT;    ```Well,' I said, `if I'm to be an engineer, it had better be as
a Scotsman, because they make the best engineers,'' Doohan says.
``And then I named him Montgomery Scott, right off the top of my
head, in honor of my grandfather, my mother's father, James
Montgomery.''
 &HT;    On D-Day, the grandson of James Montgomery was in charge of an
LCA (Landing Craft, Assault) carrying 33 beach commandos, engineers
and signalmen.
 &HT;    ``We were supposed to hit the beach at 7 a.m.,'' Doohan says,
``but a torpedo boat cut across our bow saying by loudspeaker:
`H-Hour postponed 30 minutes,' because _ we didn't know it then _
the bombers were supposed to have decimated the shore, but the
clouds were too low for the bombers. So that didn't happen.
 &HT;    ``We landed safely, thank God, through those Y-shaped steel
barriers you see in the film, tracer bullets, all that, none of our
men hurt, and dashed 75 yards to the 7-foot-tall dunes,'' Doohan
says.
 &HT;    ``Crossed a minefield, found out about it later, it was meant to
blow up tanks and we weren't heavy enough. Moved up through a town
_ hardly a town, just a village _ called Graye sur mer, saw a
church tower that was a machine gun post, firing off to our left.''
 &HT;    Doohan took out the machine gun post with a couple of shots. ``I
don't know if they were killed or wounded, but it shut them up,''
he says. His unit brought up its artillery pieces, 24 American
105mm guns, and by then it was nightfall.
 &HT;    Early in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the scene that moved Doohan
was of the car approaching the house in which the four Ryan
brothers _ three of them already dead _ grew up.
 &HT;    We see the scene from behind the mother _ see it as she sees it
from her porch, knowing, as she knows, without having to be told,
that the car is carrying official news of death.
 &HT;    As an Army officer and a chaplain get out, she sinks to a squat
of misery on the porch. ``When my wife Wende and I saw the movie at
a theater in Redmond, Washington _ a Microsoft town _ near where we
live, that was the thing that brought tears to my eyes, a couple of
them,'' Doohan says.
 &HT;    ``That car coming toward the mother of those Ryan boys, and her
knees giving way. All I could think of was my own mother.''
 &HT;    His mother was told that German bullets had hit him at 11:30
p.m. on D-Day as he was returning from a forward gun position. He
walked a quarter-mile _ ``the adrenaline lets you do it'' _ to the
regimental aid post, Doohan says.
 &HT;    He knew about his right hand and the whack on his chest against
that cigarette case, but that was all. ``The medic said: `You also
have four bullets in your left knee.' I said: `Well, I walked
here.'''
 &HT;    He didn't walk much more. They shot him full of morphine,
transported him to an landing ship tank that took him to a ship
``with 15 layers of bunks, and medics acting like Tarzan, swinging
from one layer to another.''
 &HT;    Patched back together in Britain at a Canadian wartime hospital,
he ended the war as a budding air-observation officer with 93 hours
flight training in a tiny Tiger Moth.
 &HT;    You might even call it sort of a rough preparation for ``Star
Trek,'' in as much as ``at a little aerdrome in Holland I got the
reputation as the craziest pilot in the Canadian Air Force,
slaloming an Auster monoplane under telephone wires at 55 miles an
hour _ I'm talking about dipping my wings into wheat!'' Doohan
says.
 &HT;    He got into acting in 1946 by way of listening to ``the worst
radio drama I had ever heard,'' on station CFPL, London, Ontario.
``So I got some Shakespeare and other stuff and went down to CFPL
to make a recording,'' Doohan says. ``When I played it back, I
thought it was awful, but the guy there said: `No, that was
good.'''
 &HT;    Doohan's first professional performance was Jan. 12, 1946, ``a
50-minute show between me and a taxi driver, for which we each got
$12.'' Two years of acting school followed at New York City's
Neighborhood Playhouse _ in classes with such actors as Tony
Randall and Richard Boone.
 &HT;    The break into tv was as a detective on William Gargan's
``Martin Kane, Private Eye.'' Doohan, considered ``Canada's busiest
actor'' by the time he auditioned for ``Star Trek,'' has done a lot
of acting since.
 &HT;    His next role is in Canada starring as an English butler in a
movie called ``Duke.'' But before that, he's been touring the
United States this summer in a promotional role ``Scotty'' would no
doubt find suited for the next generation.
 &HT;    He's been spokesperson for Philips Electronics in its
sponsorship of a Harris Corp./PBS road show touting the future of
High Definition Television.
 &HT;    Beam me up, Scotty ... I mean, Mr. Scott.

 Includes a color slide of Katie Holmes in a scene from ``Disturbing
Behavior.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 TV Guide (Canada)  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katie Holmes and Kevin Williamson apparently just can't get
enough of one another.
</P>
<P>
   They're gearing up for a second season as star and creator,
respectively, of ``Dawson's Creek,'' the much-discussed WB Network
hit teen drama in which Holmes plays precocious tomboy Joey, the
lifelong chum to young heart throb Dawson (James Van Der Beek), but
wishes she was something more.
</P>
<P>
   The two also spent the summer working on ``Killing Mrs.
Tingle,'' a comedy-thriller which marks Williamson's directing
debut. They're even competing against one another in movie theaters
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes stars in ``Disturbing Behavior,'' directed by ``X-Files''
veteran David Nutter, about outcast teens who find themselves in a
sinister town filled with Stepford kids. Meanwhile, Williamson,
Hollywood's hottest screenwriter, has left his fingerprints
(although sans credit) all over the highly anticipated ``Halloween:
H20.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Scream'' king developed the story line with its star, once
and future scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, then polished the script
four days before shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a favor, do you know what I mean? I wanted to be a part
of it,'' Williamson explains as to why he worked on the film
without getting his name in the credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna be kicking myself when I don't get residuals, but
currently, I'm very happy with the fact that it turned out
awesome,'' he says. ``It's a great movie.''
</P>
<P>
   So great, in fact, that when it was announced the film would
open July 24 _ the same week ``Disturbing Behavior'' was to debut _
Holmes' film's studio moved up its release date so as not to become
another victim of psycho slasher Michael Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually not speaking right now,'' Holmes says of
Williamson and the scheduling fracas. ``He's got issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're getting along fine on the set of ``Killing
Mrs. Tingle,'' in which Holmes stars as a good student with bad
luck who tries to alleviate a contentious relationship with a
difficult teacher by kidnapping her.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, does not work out as planned. ``I did the pilot
for Dawson, and he was talking about all the movies that he had in
mind and he always said, `I wanna have you in all my movies,'''
Holmes recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my manager sent me this script in the fall, and I wanted
to be as professional as I could be and not go, `Oh, Kevin, I just
read the script,''' she says. ``Because we have such a nice
relationship and I didn't want to be, (imitating a whiny kid,) `Can
I be in your movie?'''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Dawson's Creek'' hit the air _ and hit big _
earlier this year, the first season had already finished shooting.
Holmes appreciated working without the hoopla hanging over her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all definitely new to television and so it was nice to
just concentrate on working and not be distracted with reviews and
all that pressure,'' says Holmes, whose prior acting experience was
a small role in ``The Ice Storm'' and productions in her prep
school in Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing all the publicity in the fall,'' Holmes says,
``but it never really registered that, `We'll be in all the
magazines.' And it just hit and it's crazy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have one season under our belts, we'll be able to
accept the distractions ... I think we'll do OK.''
</P>
<P>
   When the show debuted in America, she was shooting ``Disturbing
Behavior'' in Vancouver, where the show had yet to premiere. ``My
parents had this huge party in Ohio, and invited 100 people. So I
listened to it on the phone and talked to everybody there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first season, Dawson emerged as the dimmest guy along the
Eastern seaboard, seemingly oblivious to Joey's yearnings. ``I
spent 13 episodes just longing. I hope I don't have to do it
again,'' Holmes says. ``Fortunately, Joey is going to become a
stronger girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, for his part, has become a one-man industry. In
addition to season two of ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Halloween ''and
``Tingle,'' he is working on ``Wasteland,'' a pilot he's developing
for ABC; an animated half-hour series he'll executive-produce;
``The Faculty,'' a film shot this summer by director Robert
Rodriguez (``Desperado''); another film he's producing, ``Her
Leading Man,'' which begins production this fall; and _ oh, yes, a
little thing called ``Scream 3.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing he doesn't have on his plate is the sequel
to ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' made without his
participation (he wrote the first one). And yet, he opines, only
half-joking after some frustrating times on the set, ``My writing
sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the director in him talking _ he's not sure the story's
coming together the way he'd like. ``It just drives me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is just one of the many who would disagree. ``He's very
in tune, he just knows,'' she says, explaining why young audiences
relate so strongly to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real person, and he knows what's going on inside kids'
minds and he remembers that,'' Holmes says, ``along with describing
those feelings, he incorporates the whole pop culture and
everything in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His use of references and dialogue is unique. He's very aware
of kids today, and I don't know how or where that came from, but
he's just very gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Williamson cuts himself some slack when it comes to the
upcoming year of ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about the second season,'' he says. ``I
think we've all jelled. The characters are all flourishing,
evolving and the writers have gotten it together.'
</P>
<P>
   In the first season, he says, his biggest achievement was simply
figuring out ``just what the hell I was doing. The first six
(episodes) were sort of well-plotted out, but you know, there was
probably some unevenness, some inconsistencies .... Probably little
things, which people don't notice, but I did, and a lot of it is
attributable to me just getting my feet wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, the second half of the season I think we lost
Pacey _ the character played by Vancouver native Joshua Jackson _
what happened to Pacey's story line?'' Williamson says. ``We were
so centralized on Dawson and Joey. Now, Pacey has a huge story this
coming season.''
</P>
<P>
   And Williamson has his 101 projects. ``He just doesn't stop,''
Holmes says of her boss. ``He's so focused and in tune to what he's
doing that he's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always asks me, `How do you do it?' and I don't
know,'' Williamson says. ``The bottom line is I'm spread a little
too thin, but that's just the reality and I'm changing all that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This fall I have to commit myself to editing this movie,
getting it ready and getting it perfect.'' He pauses. ``And work on
`Wasteland' and `Her Leading Man.' That's the rest of my year.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses again. ``And `Dawson's Creek,' of course.'' He sighs,
and draws a bold line in the sand. ``And I'm not bringing anything
else to my plate.''

WESLEY SNIPES HOPES TO `GET THEM' NEXT TIME

 Includes a color slide of Wesley Snipes in a scene from ``Blade.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Look in the Hollywood dictionary next to up-and-down careers and
there's a head shot of Wesley Snipes.
 &HT;    It's hard to fathom that the same guy who scored with ``New Jack
City'' (1991), ``Jungle Fever'' (1991), ``White Men Can't Jump''
(1992) and ``To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar''
(1995), crashed and burned in ``Drop Zone'' (1994), ``Money Train''
(1995), ``The Fan'' (1996) and ``U.S. Marshals'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``Some of the earlier films were surprises to people,'' Snipes
says. ``They were smaller-budget films, and I wasn't as well known
then, so there wasn't as much riding on them.
 &HT;    ``The later films had lots of other things going on that were
beyond my control. (Columbia) thought `Money Train' would be a
blockbuster, and everyone was so concerned with the fluff and puff
that nobody realized it was missing the substance that might
interest the audience,'' he says. ``That showed up in the sales.
 &HT;    ``I liked `U.S. Marshals,' and the other ones missed for a whole
lot of reasons. So many things have to go right for a film to be
good, so many things have to go right for a film to make money, and
what's scary is that you can have one without the other.
 &HT;    ``You just never know until you make the movie and put it out
exactly what you've got and what will happen,'' the 36-year-old
actor adds. ``My attitude is if you don't get them this time, get
them next time.''
 &HT;    Next time is Aug. 21 with ``Blade,'' a thriller based on the
adventures of the title character, a low-profile Marvel Comics
creation who's half-human/half-vampire. Taking no chances, Snipes
not only stars as Blade, but produced the film via his production
company, Amen Ra Films.
 &HT;    ``I don't produce for the art of it or the love of it,'' Snipes
says during a phone conversation. ``It's really about control, the
ability to put your ideas into action.
 &HT;    ``That makes all the difference in the world. In the past, I
didn't have the juice or clout to effect the script, the story's
flow, the editing or what the final product turned out to be.
 &HT;    ``When people say some of my films were not so good, I agree,
man,'' he says. ``A couple of them were not the movies I thought I
was making.
 &HT;    ``I'm trying to change that with Amen Ra. If I'm making the
film, if I'm active in everything about a film, I can't blame
anyone else if people say, `That film wasn't so good.'''
 &HT;    Snipes chose ``Blade'' for a variety of reasons. He gets a kick
out of comic books and horror films, plus he could show off his
well-honed body and martial arts expertise.
 &HT;    ``I'm not pulling a whole lot of that Jackie Chan stuff where,
in real-life, I'm jumping off buildings and dodging knives, but I
am giving it that uptown New York, raw attitude feeling,'' Snipes
says. (Though born in Florida, he was reared on the tough streets
of the Bronx, N.Y.)
 &HT;    ``We've got a great story that got better and better as we went
along,'' he says. ``It starts with a woman who's pregnant. A
vampire comes along, takes a bite out of her neck, and that
genetically alters the unborn child.
 &HT;    ``The mother goes into premature labor and is dead by the time
the baby, me, comes out. I eventually hook up with Abraham Whistler
(Kris Kristofferson), who becomes my sage-
counselor-guide-friend-father figure, and helps me take on the
quest of ridding the world of bloodsuckers,'' Snipes says.
 &HT;    ``Part of that is to help humanity and part of it is for
personal reasons, to avenge my mother's death,'' Snipes says. ``It
gets complicated on the personal level, because I'm a tormented
soul whose human and vampire halves are fighting an internal
battle.
 &HT;    ``None of that is too far removed from the basic premise of the
comic.''
 &HT;    Co-starring in the film are Steven Dorff as Deacon Frost, who
seeks to summon ``The Blood Tide,'' a sort of vampire doomsday, and
N'bushe Wright as Dr. Karen Jansen, who races against time to save
herself and Blade from the lethal effects of a vampire virus.
 &HT;    Snipes promises that audiences are in for a bloody good treat.
 &HT;    ``There's a whole lot of humor in it, situational humor as
opposed to straight-up slapstick,'' he says. ``We've definitely got
some scary elements and an adventure side, and on top of all that,
there are elements of drama that'll make you say, `Wow, this is
heavy.'
 &HT;    ``I'd call `Blade' a suspense-action-comedy-drama. It's my kind
of movie, man.''
 &HT;    Following ``Blade,'' the workaholic Snipes dived right into a
batch of other projects. He produced and co-starred with Dean Cain
and Vanessa Williams in ``Futuresport,'' a sci-fi TV movie intended
as a series pilot for ABC. The network nixed the notion of going to
series and has yet to schedule an airdate for the movie.
 &HT;    Also completed is ``Down in the Delta,'' a low-budget feature
film produced by Snipes, directed by poet Maya Angelou and due for
release at Christmas.
 &HT;    ``I play the son of a man (Al Freeman) who runs an old chicken
farm where they make chicken sausage,'' Snipes says. ``It's a film
about family, about relationships, about the clash of traditional
and modern values and ideas.
 &HT;    ``It's a heartfelt, loving movie and, in a different way, it's
got as much of my kind of energy and voice in it as ``The Big Hit'
(also produced by Amen Ra) and `Blade.'''
 &HT;    Yet another project on the Amen Ra agenda is ``African
Scholars,'' a series of documentaries that Snipes financed and
narrates. ``Scholars'' realizes Snipes' dream of building an easily
accessible video and CD-ROM archive of information about esteemed,
modern-day African artists, scholars and thinkers.
 &HT;    ``There are a number of great African minds who are never
mentioned in the mainstream, and some of them are working in the
mainstream, '' Snipes says, referring to the likes of Dr. John
Henrik Clarke and Dr. Yosef ben-Jochannan. ``I want everyone to
know these people exist because the voices of these people should
be heard when we're looking for alternative ideas for some of our
social, political, economic, philosophical and spiritual problems
and differences.
 &HT;    ``For me, part of doing this is a matter of giving back and part
of it is a matter of necessity. It's long, long overdue.''
 &HT;    Overdue, too, is some rest for the weary multi-talented Snipes.
 &HT;    ``Between the acting and producing, I've been working non stop
for two years,'' he says. ``I've got to slow down a little after
`Blade' is out and enjoy life.
 &HT;    ``I'm into the club scene, computers, the motorcycle and my
martial arts,'' says Snipes, who also just opened China One, a
Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles, with girlfriend Donna Wong.
 &HT;    ``What's funny is we've got so many things going on at Amen Ra
that I'm not sure I'll be able to take a real break.
 &HT;    ``I haven't shot a film since February, but it's almost like I'm
working anyway.''

JASON PATRIC, THE ANTI-STAR, REBOUNDS FROM `SPEED 2: CRUISE
CONTROL' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or

 Includes a color slide of Jason Patric with Nastassja Kinski in a
scene from ``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jason Patric is not ready for his close-up. He is never ready
for star treatment, even though he is Jackie Gleason's grandson.
 &HT;    Being a star bothers him. Actually, he would much rather see
someone else's name in lights.
 &HT;    ``I've always respected the ballplayer who threw the touchdown
and then walked to the sidelines instead of doing the dance,'' the
actor says.
 &HT;    Right now, doing an interview makes him nervous. Patric isn't a
typical young actor who carries a banner proclaiming, ``Look at
me.'' On an early Saturday morning, he slips into the Four Seasons
Hotel in Los Angeles virtually unnoticed.
 &HT;    That's how he likes it.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of people in this business use glamour and lust
for attention to fill the other holes in their lives,'' Patric
says.
 &HT;    ``I know from growing up with my parents that the bright lights
aren't the answer,'' says the son of Linda Miller, the daughter of
Gleason. His father is Jason Miller, a Pulitzer Prize winning
playwright who penned ``That Championship Season'' (1982) and acted
in ``The Exorcist'' (1973) as the priest.
 &HT;    Patric admits, ``I was never some Okie thinking, `Wow, everybody
loves me because my movie made $30 million its opening weekend.'''
 &HT;    For Patric the wows have mostly been about romance. We've heard,
``Wow, he's dating Robin Wright (pre-Sean Penn).'' There was also,
``Wow, he's snuggling with Julia Roberts (post-Kiefer
Sutherland).'' Now it's supermodel Christy Turlington, with whom
Patric has been for two years.
 &HT;    He doesn't get angry when asked about his personal life. He just
won't use it to push his career.
 &HT;    ``I always thought acting was about surprising people, so I
decided a long time ago to save those bits of myself for the screen
instead of for People magazine,'' he says.
 &HT;    Finally, it might be about the work.
 &HT;    Patric turns in some of his best work in ``Your Friends and
Neighbors,'' the most sexually provocative film of 1998, which also
stars Catherine Kenner, Nastassja Kinski, Ben Stiller, Amy
Brennerman and Aaron Eckhart. It opens Aug. 28.
 &HT;    It's a modern immorality tale about three couples who examine
the intimacy between husband and wives and friends and neighbors.
In the film, an afternoon brunch with friends is the perfect time
to put the make on your pal's wife.
 &HT;    Vigorous sex with your lover? It's the time to voice your
contempt of the opposite sex. Patric, who also serves as producer,
says there is a moral to this story.
 &HT;    ``On one hand, these six characters just want to be fulfilled.
But, in the movie, we see the downfall of that kind of selfishness
when its at the expense of something or someone else.'' The lesson?
``It's about how we all want to be loved or at least feel
self-love, which is so hard in the '90s.''
 &HT;    Patric plays Cary, a man who tapes himself during solo sex to
study and improve his performance. He is matter of fact in contempt
of both sexes. ``I've played a lot of characters with dark edges
before,'' Patric says, ``but nothing compares to this guy.''
 &HT;    Patric teamed up with director-writer Neil LaBute after admiring
his work in the independent hit ``In the Company of Men'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I guess I wanted to work with Neil the same way that a young
DeNiro wanted to work with a young Scorsese,'' Patric says. ``I
also wanted to act with Aaron Eckhart whose performance in `In the
Company of Men' was the best performance of last year.''
 &HT;    LaBute returns the compliment. ``I knew I needed a really good
actor because I wanted to work in really long takes,'' he says. ``I
was glad that Jason was on board as a producer, too. He was able to
create a safe space for the rest of the actors.''
 &HT;    Patric was cast for other reasons.
 &HT;    ``I really wanted a good looking guy to play Cary,'' LaBute
says. ``We have this tendency to allow beautiful people to get away
with murder. I like the idea of having a really good looking guy
like Jason saying terrible things.''
 &HT;    What appealed to Patric is that Cary has a method to his
madness, including a rape in high school. Patric says that his
character ``has created his own morality. He's vicious, but he's
specific.''
 &HT;    Patric laughs when asked about his redeeming qualities. ``He's
not some macho, God's-gift-to-women type. He never brags about his
conquests. He's the only character in the movie who never lies.''
 &HT;    Some have wondered if Cary is a closeted homosexual who brings
his hatred of women to bed with him. ``It's possible,'' Patric
says. ``He's definitely not happy with women ... He's just
chillingly scary.''
 &HT;    Patric admits that the role left him with some trepidation.
``It's chilling to think, `Can I play this guy realistically?' You
know to do that you have to draw on yourself.'' Patric isn't about
to list his best and worst dates but admits that he drew on others
to shape Cary.
 &HT;    Patric is more upfront about Hollywood, recently telling Vogue
you couldn't pay him enough to see ``Titanic.'' He also vowed that
he would never attend the Academy Awards.
 &HT;    He regularly turns down huge paychecks. ``Look, I've been
offered big money before and turned it down,'' he says. ``I was
making movies long before the Brad Pitts and the Matthew
McConaugheys. And if a big paycheck doesn't affect you at 21 when
you're trying to get girls and a cool car, it's not going to affect
you at 30.''
 &HT;    His choices have left Hollywood perplexed. With his looks,
Patric could have easily gone the hunk route.
 &HT;    ``I don't make movies, so I can wind up on magazine covers. I
don't choose scripts so I'll end up at the Oscars,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``That just epitomizes what's wrong with movies today. Everybody
does a role thinking of their next step, whether it's to win an
Oscar or get a bigger, more expensive movie.''
 &HT;    Of course, Patric has strayed a bit. Last summer's dud ``Speed
2: Cruise Control'' comes to mind. He was literally like a fish out
of water playing a by-the-books cop stuck on a speeding boat.
 &HT;    ``It was unsuccessful and rightly so,'' Patric says. ``Of
course, there were other movies last year which were successful
that were much worse than `Speed 2.'''
 &HT;    Patric says that he signed for ``Speed 2'' as a way ``to enter
into the global marketplace. It helped me make something harder
edged like this movie.''
 &HT;    He also got on board for more practical reasons. ``I wanted to
show that I am a physical guy. I thought if I did `Speed 2,' it
would allow me to show that side of myself.''
 &HT;    Perhaps Patric also wanted to lighten up.
 &HT;    Critics have said his work is usually so dark. ``The funny thing
is that I've never made movies that were darker than the movies
Pacino and DeNiro made in the '70s,'' he says. ``And those were the
movies that made these guys kings.''
 &HT;    Patric could be in their position. With his family ties he could
have had an easier ride as a young actor.
 &HT;    Even as a kid, fame didn't interest Patric. ``Somebody once said
to me, `Oh, you don't want to be a movie star?' I never said that.
I said, `I'll never pick roles to become a movie star.'''
 &HT;    His choices _ nothing if not eclectic _ include ``Sleepers''
(1996), ``The Beast'' (1988), ``After Dark, My Sweet'' (1990),
``Rush'' (1991) and ``The Journey of August King'' (1995).
 &HT;    When asked about his best work, he cites the early 1990s.
``Stuff like `After Dark, My Sweet' and `Rush,' when all I cared
about was the material,'' Patric says. ``I think I was ahead of the
dark curve that all of a sudden happened with Quentin Tarantino and
all these edgy Miramax movies.
 &HT;    ``At 32, it's nice to get back to doing this kind of stuff
again,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``I remember reading `Your Friends and Neighbors' and just
thinking, `Wow! No punches were pulled, but it wasn't extreme for
extreme's sake. I was affected by all six of the characters.''
 &HT;    For his part, Patric just examines his characters. ``You can't
make judgments about the characters you play. You can make
assessments. But I have to believe what Cary believes. I have to
find Cary in me. He is created his own world. I have to live in it.
 &HT;    ``But only for a couple of months,'' he says and smiles.

   ATLANTA _ How much does a handgun cost?
</P>
<P>
   The price tag in the store might say $250. But the true cost can
run well into the millions. This month, two multimillion-dollar
guns were fired in metro Atlanta. Taxpayers, retailers and property
owners will be paying for those guns for years.

   One of the weapons was used to kill a young man in the food
court at Greenbriar Mall in southwest Atlanta. The ultimate cost of
that single crime could be staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbriar is a 33-year-old mall struggling to compete with much
newer shopping centers. Two years ago, basketball hero Magic
Johnson gave Greenbriar a boost by opening a 12-screen movie
theater there. That addition spurred a $1.5 million renovation of
the mall's exterior.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements have led to higher retail sales and better
property values. Homeowners become wealthier when their
neighborhood is perceived as having access to a lively, safe
shopping mecca.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, mall customers saw a man slam to the floor of
the food court and die from a bullet wound. The next sound after
the gunshot was the roar of car engines as patrons fled.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbriar is not a dangerous place. Still, its image has
suffered from the murder. If the shooting leaves some customers
leery about the mall, sales and property values could decline.
</P>
<P>
   And that's to say nothing of the cost of capturing, convicting
and jailing the shooter. In Georgia, taxpayers spend about $54 per
day to maintain each state inmate. Assuming the murderer spends 20
years in jail, taxpayers will have to pay nearly $400,000 for his
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the loss of life. The 25-year-old victim could
have spent another 40 years in the work force. Now, his family has
lost a loved one and society has lost a man just entering his
prime.
</P>
<P>
   The other gun that carried an enormous price tag was fired in a
suburban Atlanta subdivision. Levi Simon III, 17, was shot as he
was leaving a friend's birthday party. Simon was just a week away
from moving to college when he caught a bullet fired by a
party-crasher. Police have arrested three suspects.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much Simon, a trumpet player with a music
scholarship, might have earned in his lifetime. But the
college-bound young man with an excellent reputation almost
certainly would have become a taxpaying contributor to society.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his talents are lost to us. Meanwhile, we'll pay
heavily to jail his murderers. Property values in the DeKalb County
subdivision can't be helped by this.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many people believed that poverty caused crime. But
the reality is the opposite: Crime causes poverty. Crime squanders
tax dollars, drives down real estate values, discourages commerce
and prompts property owners to spend vast sums on alarm systems,
security guards and door locks.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that in 1997, the nation's prison
population grew by 5.2 percent, up to 1.73 million. At $54 per
prisoner per day, the annual direct cost to taxpayers just for
operating jail cells would exceed $34 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's astonishing that Americans tolerate such waste. Even if we
spent $100 billion on programs to prevent young people from
becoming criminals, we would still come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year's election season will surely bring us more ads
from politicians assuring us they'll be spitting razor wire and
firing up the electric chairs. But few will discuss the fantastic
savings that could come from improving education, upgrading foster
care, funding drug treatment programs, preventing teen pregnancy,
expanding job training and improving the juvenile court system. The
U.S. economy would surge if we ever got serious about preventing
crime.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Riding down Memory Lane with Hot Rod Hairy
 &HT;    (EDS: Hairy is cq)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``Don't turn around,'' I tell my companion,
``but there's a man standing behind you with a huge sign pinned to
his hat that reads: `Need outside sun visor for '39 Chevy.' '' My
friend chuckles and aims me toward the nearest lemonade stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see it?'' I ask. ``The sign?'' Guess I'm looking for
reassurance that my brains haven't fried in the relentless heat
cooking up from the acres of pavement here at the Kentucky
Fairgrounds. Got to be 110 degrees in the shade _ only there isn't
any.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 29th Annual Street Rod Nationals and there are 15,000
vehicles from all over the country here, cruising the parking lots
and strutting their shiny stuff. I had no idea there were this many
old cars left in the whole world, much less in mint condition and
driveable.
</P>
<P>
   Street rods, I learned, have been messed with. Unlike the
antique auto folks who go in for faithful restoration, ``rodders''
don't mind chopping a top or dropping a Corvette engine into a '40
Ford coupe. And tell me, when was the last time you took a spin in
a '37 Chevy with air-conditioning and cruise control?
</P>
<P>
   My friend hands me a sweaty cup of lemonade, my third in less
than an hour, and we set out to do some cruising of our own, on
foot, through the endless rows of iron. He's checking out engines.
I focus on interiors and memories.
</P>
<P>
   A boxy '37 Chevy sedan catches my eye. My folks had one of those
when I was a little girl. I remember riding out into the country
with my mother at the wheel and wishing I were grown up enough to
see out the window. I was tiring of treetops. And I remember being
carsick in the
</P>
<P>
   back seat _ often. So often in fact, that my father used to
wonder about the next owner. Said it'd have to be someone with a
chronic head cold.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows down, right across from the bratwurst stand, is a '40
Super Deluxe Chevy sedan, just like the one my father gave my
mother for Christmas that year before Pearl Harbor. I recognize the
body shape and the grille, but that's about all.
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Bessie (the name she gave all of her cars as a payback
to her mother-in-law of the same name) was a dignified two-tone
gray and dark blue. This buggy is dandelion yellow with candy-blue
flames licking over the hood.
</P>
<P>
   As I peek through the windows, careful not to touch or lean on
anything (the biggest social blunder in the rodder's book of
etiquette), I can't help wondering; could this possibly be the same
car that saw our family through the war with a ``B'' sticker on the
windshield that limited the gallons of gas the man at the Gulf
station was allowed to pump into our tank? Is there a chance it's
the same flivver that dropped a rusted-through fender in downtown
Cleveland's rush hour traffic back in the winter of '44?
</P>
<P>
   My friend leans over for a better look and chuckles. ``Remember
those things?'' he asks, pointing to a glassy knob clamped onto the
steering wheel. ``We called them `hairy knobs' because we thought
they made us look like real hotrods. Man,'' he sighs with a
nostalgic grin, ``we could whip around corners with our left hand
and never have to move our right arm, which, of course, was around
our date.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he kidding? Do I remember? Harry, my first boyfriend, had one
of those on his old Chevy. We put in plenty of driving time under
just such conditions. That was in the good old days before bucket
seats, when a date could scootch up under her boyfriend's arm and
stay there all the way to the drive-in. It was one of the ways
girls measured a guy's affection. ``We drove all the way to Crandon
Park and he never took his arm down,'' was a familiar gloat at
Saturday night slumber parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Rod Hairy'' was what we called a guy who drove fast, dug
out and squealed corners. Girls thought it was kind of dumb, but we
giggled and ogled all the same. ``Big hairy deal,'' we'd yell in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, we used that expression a lot. It was the label we
pinned on anything we felt was not all it was cracked up to be.
Like the night a bunch of us rumbled into the Big Wheel Drive-In
for burgers after seeing the sci-fi thriller ``The Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big hairy deal!'' Burton Craig groaned as he leaned up against
the side of his coupe. ``I can't believe I paid 75 cents to watch a
giant carrot eat its way through the North Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   And I can't believe those days are gone forever. But ``Hot Rod
Hairy'' is still around. He hands me another lemonade and steers me
toward a '34 Packard. A real beauty.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Windows 98 imperfect, but you can do a few things
to make it better
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's start by agreeing that Windows 98 is not as good
as it could be. But danged little is.
</P>
<P>
   If I insisted on pure excellence in my life, I'd have to stop
eating in the cafeteria here at work, would give my golf clubs away
and would never again sing in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   And Windows 98, despite its quirks and problems, is better than
earlier versions and one heck of a lot better than cafeteria
Salisbury steak. So instead of sulking, let's spend today talking
about some of the ways you can get the most performance out of
Windows 98. The good news is there are simple ways you can improve
the speed and reliability of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The first item is the only one on my list that costs money, but
it's probably the best way to get more out of Windows 98: Add more
RAM. If you now have 16 megabytes or less, you'll get a noticeable
performance increase.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend I upgraded a friend's machine by adding 32
megabytes of RAM. I didn't shop around to get the best price, and
yet I paid just $60 for two 16-megabyte chips. Installing them
amounted to poking the chips into two vacant slots. After five
minutes' work, the computer was noticeably faster.
</P>
<P>
   For most home users, 64 megabytes is about all the RAM needed.
There are some speed increases after that, but if you were graphing
the improvement, the slope would level off dramatically there.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have that much RAM, there's a second adjustment you
should make. Double-click on the System icon in the Control Panel,
select the tab labeled Performance, and then select File System
under Advanced Settings. Take a look at the box that says: Typical
Role of This Computer. Yours probably says ``Desktop Computer.'' If
you have 64 megabytes or more of memory, change that setting to
``Network Server.'' Without going into a long explanation, that
setting will help your PC use that new memory most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Next, let's remove a Windows 98 feature that slows your computer
down. Right-click on a blank space on your computer desktop. Then
take a look at the item called Active Desktop. If there's a check
box by the item labeled View as Web Page, then click to remove the
check mark. Now click on the desktop again and select the tab
called Web. Click on the Folder Options button. You'll be asked if
you want to save the settings and view Folder Options; click on
Yes. Now you'll see three choices for the way folders are
displayed. Select ``Classic Style.''
</P>
<P>
   What you've just accomplished is to remove the much-touted
Windows feature of navigating the program in the same way you
navigate the Web. That feature works just fine but _ when all is
said and done _ isn't all that helpful and slows most computers
down dramatically. Since it's easy to switch back and forth, at
least give both methods a try and decide for yourself. It's my
guess you'll end up deciding you like the speed gain of removing
the Web-like navigation. After all, you probably spent $2,000 or so
for that fast computer. It seems dumb to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   Next make sure you've switched your hard disk to the new FAT32
system. You can check by selecting Drive Converter (FAT32) from the
System Tools group under the Start button. If the disk has already
been converted, you'll get a message that tells you that. If it
hasn't been converted, do so. Once you've done that, make sure to
run the Disk Defragmenter program at least once a week. Unlike
earlier versions of the defrag program, this one has enough
built-in intelligence to arrange your programs on the hard disk so
the ones you use most frequently load faster.
</P>
<P>
   These tune-up steps won't make Windows 98 into a perfect
program. But they will give it the opportunity to run as fast as
possible on your machine.

 &HT;    Tech Report: With help from computer, Lego robots leap to life
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many products that had their beginnings in the
low-tech days when vacuum tubes ruled have withstood the test of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most successful have been Lego plastic building
bricks. They've been around in their present form since 1958, and
kids have spent hours having fun with them without realizing they
were learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Group began dabbling with computer-controlled products
in 1986 in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and the latest creation to spring from that fertile
alliance blends old and new into a cutting-edge toy that will usher
children _ and a lot of adults _ into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, which should hit
store shelves in the fall and retail for about $200, lets kids 11
and up design and program real robots that can move, think and act
on their own. Gort, the blank-faced metal man in the 1950s sci-fi
classic ``The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' would approve.
</P>
<P>
   The brain is the RCX, a microcomputer that can be programmed
with a PC. The RCX's sensors gather input from its environment,
processes it and signals small motors to turn on and off.
</P>
<P>
   Users build their robot with the RCX, Constructopedia guide and
700 Lego pieces included. Next, they create a program using RCX
code, a simple but powerful programming language. The program is
downloaded to the RCX with a special infrared transmitter that
comes with the kit. The robot then can interact with the
environment, independent from the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Children can build a working robot in under an hour, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming out in the fall are three expansion sets for the
RCX. The Extreme Creatures set lets kids build virtually any
animal, real or fantasized. Included are fiber-optic strands, a
snapping claw, a working pincer and a tail-wagging mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   With the Robo-Sports set, the robots can shoot hoops, flick
pucks or negotiate an obstacle course. The Exploration Mars set
lets young explorers build a Mars rover and control it from their
own PC.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion sets will retail for $50. Each has its own
Constructopedia building guide and a CD-ROM with 12 challenges.
More challenges can be found at the Mindstorms Web site,
http://www.legomindstorms.com. The CDs are for Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   A little something for your pocket
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. has come out with a new personal
organizer that will store a megabyte of data in a 5-ounce package
small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-sized SE-300 includes software and a docking station
that allows for two-way transfer of information from a desktop
computer. The software is set up to work with Microsoft's Outlook
97, ACT 3.07 and Lotus Organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The device has a backlit LCD display screen and an infrared port
to exchange data with other Sharp products or the infrared port on
a notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   The unit runs for 60 hours on one AA battery. Retail price is
$180.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that!
</P>

   Compaq Computer Corp. has joined forces with the magicians at
Walt Disney World in Orlando, providing hardware for DisneyQuest,
an interactive entertainment experience that opened in June.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computing power is concentrated in the ``Create
Zone,'' where kids of any age can combine their own imaginations
with Disney characters to create unique images and animation and
even become a part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   While in the ``Create Zone,'' visitors can learn the secrets of
animation, create a toy to take home, get a virtual makeover in the
Magic Mirror or create a painting on a Living Easel.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq provided workstations, PCs, servers and flat-panel
monitors to help fun seekers turn fantasy into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Seek and ye shall find
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a treasure trove of useful and useless
information, but finding the nugget you want in a pile of fool's
gold can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   A search string that isn't specific enough can turn up hundreds
of categories and thousands of Web sites that have irrelevancy in
common.
</P>
<P>
   A new search engine, GoTo.com, aims to streamline the process by
getting back to basics. There are no ad banners on the home page,
letting the page build quicker. Or a user can add the search string
right after the ``www'' in the engine's address and go immediately
on the search results page.
</P>
<P>
   Give the engine a try at http://www.goto.com. Maybe you'll
strike it rich.

 &HT;    Honoring the geniuses that got it all started
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us now remember famous men, those stalwarts of old
who made computers what they are, or perhaps what they are not,
today.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is George Morrow. Chairman George, as he was known,
was once the Bill Gates of the computer industry back in the days
when Bill Gates was still filing his teeth into points and getting
MS-DOS ready to take over the world.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Bill didn't have to push Chairman George off
the top of the mountain; George fell off by himself.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose George Morrow is my favorite because I owned one of
his computers, a Morrow Micro Decision. Morrow computers were based
on the CP/M operating system. CP/M stood for Control
Program/Monitor, but it might better have been called Control
Program/From Hell. It made MS-DOS look like Ned in the First
Reader.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drives were in their infancy in those days; almost no one
had one. If I remember right, adding a 10-megabyte hard drive to a
system would kick the cost up by several thousand dollars. Instead,
you had a floppy drive into which you inserted a 200k disk, and
held onto your hat as the 4 (that's right, four) MHz microprocessor
screamed up to full speed. CP/M allowed no graphics, and would look
at no more than 64k of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he cast his fortune with this obviously doomed
operating system, Morrow was considered a great leader and man of
deep insight. If his choice of operating systems is not enough to
give you an idea of his insight, perhaps his final word on Local
Area Networks will be an indication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best LAN,'' Chairman George decided, ``is a guy walking
down the hall with a floppy disk in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a little red book called ``The Sayings of Chairman
George'' became a fairly hot item in the fledgling industry, Morrow
and his computer company faded rapidly from view. The last move I
can recall Morrow making was the dismantling of his customer
support operation on the simple, and probably accurate, theory that
his customers were too expensive to support.
</P>
<P>
   Other great names in computing actually predated the industry,
which may be why they remain great names.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, George Boole. Boole was an English mathematician
150 years ago who invented a kind of algebra that deals in logic
rather than in mathematics, which of course puts him right in the
philosophical lineage of George Morrow _ mathless math.
</P>
<P>
   Boole's concept was based on the simple idea that propositions
are either true or false _ no maybes _ and relationships between
these two variables can be expressed with ``operators'' such as
AND, OR and NOT.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see how Boole was really a programmer in search of a
computer, and his entire system fit perfectly into the demands of
digital computing, which deals in ones and zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   And finally we have another Briton, Alan Turing, inventor of the
Turing machine and the Turing test. The Turing machine, which he
proposed in 1936 (I am unsure whether one was actually made) was a
logical device that would scan a tape, one square at a time. The
square could contain a symbol, or it could be blank, and based on
the contents of each square the machine would make some limited
response.
</P>
<P>
   Turing's test is much more interesting, since we have yet to put
it to practical use. It is intended to reveal the point at which we
have invented an intelligent machine, and it is quite simple. It
involves one person asking a series of questions of two entities
he/she cannot see _ another person and a computer. When the time
comes that the interrogator can no longer tell which is which, we
have an intelligent machine.
</P>
<P>
   I have just one reservation about the Turing test. Who picks the
human respondent?

 &HT;    Skillful use of search engines eases your quest
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The real miracle of the Internet's World Wide Web is
that _ with so much information squirreled away in so many
different Web sites _ we find anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the mission of the search engine. It's the
cyber-equivalent of a research librarian that takes your request to
find _ for instance _ some information on kidney transplants for
cats and then bustles around the Web and comes back with
recommended sites.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines generally work fine when you are looking for the
obvious. No matter how you search, or which engine you use, you
won't have much problem finding Web sites that contain information
about cats or medicine or even transplants. The real trouble starts
when you're looking for something very specific or a topic that is
a bit obscure.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to approach a search like the one we're using
as an example. You can take the shotgun approach and use one of the
excellent services that combine a multitude of search engines. That
way you can simply type in your search and _ in seconds _ see the
results of the search from a variety of search engines. You'll wade
through a lot of Web sites that way, and chances are many of them
will be way off the mark, but some helpful sites are likely to be
found as well.
</P>
<P>
   My two favorites, when it comes to this type of search engine,
are Dogpile at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.dogpile/index.html and the All-in-One Search Page at
http://www.albany.net
</P>
<P>
   /allinone/all1www.html. Let's take a quick look at each service.
</P>
<P>
   Dogpile can be set to search the Web, Usenet newsgroups, FTP
(file transfer protocol) sites that often contain software you can
download, business news sites and news wires. That covers a
staggering amount of cyber-territory. A complete listing of the
sites searched would fill this column with no room for commas, but
it includes Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, AltaVista, WebCrawler, DejaNews,
Agence France, Business Wire, UPI and Infoseek NewsWires.
</P>
<P>
   Since the search is so broad, you're likely to wade through a
lot of material that has nothing obvious to do with your search
topic. However, that can be interesting, too, since you're likely
to find some nifty new Web sites in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-One Search Page works a little differently. Instead
of using all the search engines simultaneously, it simply puts most
of the common ones (and several that aren't so common) all on one
page. This site is an excellent one to bookmark, since almost any
search you can imagine can be accomplished from here.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the page is that there are some
special-purpose search engines here you may never have encountered.
Again, there are way too many to list, but here's a partial
listing: Lowest Price Search, an engine that browses the Web for
the best prices on everything from toys to hardware; 411 Locate,
which helps you find e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and Web
sites; Ahoy!, an engine that finds personal Web pages; eBlast, the
Encyclopaedia Britannica's Internet guide; EuroSeek, which searches
European Web sites; GovBot, a database of government and military
Web sites; and YPN _ Your Personal Network, which searches more
than 30,000 reviews of Internet service providers and Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget the many specialized search engines
devoted to a single topic. Since there seem to be as many of these
search engines as there are hobbies and interests, they can't be
listed here. Finding them is fairly easy, however. Just use one of
the general-purpose search engines and include the name of the
topic along with search words such as ``search'' and ``engine'' and
``online,'' and you're likely to hit pay dirt.

 &HT;    Market testing investor staying power
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alan Greenspan warned us about the bull market,
fretting at one point about the ``irrational exuberance'' he
thought was pushing stock prices to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the chairman of the Federal Reserve is worried
about the money investors might lose in a bear market. That's a
risk every investor takes.
</P>
<P>
   But he is concerned about what might happen to the economy if a
sharp and sustained drop in the market robs consumers of a
substantial part of the enormous wealth they have accumulated
during the bull run.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in stock prices has added about $12.5 trillion to the
value of household assets just since the end of 1994, according to
the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent consumer spending is driving the economy, anything
that threatens that threatens the economy, the thinking is.
</P>
<P>
   What happens depends on how serious and lengthy the current
stock market sell-off becomes. Analysts are deeply divided on both
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a routine correction, in which stock indexes drop 10
percent or 15 percent from their highs, or is it the beginning of a
bear market with losses of 20 percent or more?
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average already is down 9.8 percent
from its July 17 record, and broader and secondary stock indexes
are down even more.
</P>
<P>
   Bearish analysts contend a major stock market sell-off is not
only long overdue but that this year's slowdown in corporate profit
growth makes the prospect even more likely.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged sell-off would be especially damaging to the
economy, given the amount of household wealth Americans have
accumulated in the 1990s. The stock market ``wealth effect'' has
given middle-class Americans enough confidence _ and money _ to go
on an almost decadelong spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has produced more than seven years of uninterrupted
economic growth since the end of the 1990-91 recession, propelled
by feel-good consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Consumer Confidence Index rose from 59.40 in
February 1991, at the bottom of the recession, to 135.40 in July, a
rise of 128 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Disposable personal income _ the money available for consumers
to spend on whims as well as necessities _ rose over the same
period from $4.3 trillion to $6 trillion, a gain of almost 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And during that period, consumers have showed little inclination
to save for a rainy day while new cars, houses, wardrobes and other
products beckoned. Home sales, for instance, which are a major
driver of the economy, averaged about 4 million dwellings per year
from 1991 through 1997, and a combination of lower mortgage rates
and upbeat consumers kicked the 1998 annual rate to 4.8 million
units.
</P>
<P>
   The savings rate, meanwhile, has dropped from 5.5 percent of
gross domestic product in 1991 to only 0.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow advanced from 2,882.18 in February 1991 to an
all-time high of 9,337.97 on July 17, 1998 _ a rise of 224 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The climb was propelled in part by the flood of money from whole
new classes of investors: individuals forced by employers to manage
their own pension funds via 401(k) plans, baby boomers reaching
middle age and investing for retirement, and the proliferation of
mutual funds beating the drums for new clients.
</P>
<P>
   Just since 1990, total assets in mutual funds rose from $245.8
billion to $2.4 trillion last year _ an increase of 876 percent,
the Investment Company Institute reports.
</P>
<P>
   And the percentage of households owning stocks has risen from
about 25 percent in 1982 to 45 percent last year, government
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   The wealth thus accumulated in the market has translated into
economic growth that, while fluctuating, has trended steadily
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Annualized gross domestic product growth was a robust 5.5
percent in the first quarter of 1998. While it dropped to 1.4
percent in the second quarter, it was still better than most
analysts anticipated, given the impact of Asia's economic crisis
and the early round of the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, optimism about jobs, incomes and profits, rising
wealth-to-income ratios, low financing costs and falling prices for
high-tech goods fed the appetites of households and businesses for
consumer durables and capital equipment,'' Greenspan told Congress
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's worries about stock prices aside, investors have
shown no inclination so far to stop investing.
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since the latest market decline began, small
investors trading fewer than 10,000 shares added about $731 million
to the market, according to Birinyi Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street professionals, meanwhile, making block trades of
more than 10,000 shares, accounted for $3.47 billion in selling,
The New York Times said in reporting the Birinyi Associates
results.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a sign of small investor panic, and if it continues,
bullish analysts say it would put a floor under the latest
correction and recharge the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   And presumably, this would also settle the question of whether
consumers will continue to fuel the economy with their spending _
which is a big unknown at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't predict how people will spend money in the future,''
said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist for Edward Jones in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safest thing to forecast is that the economy is going to
experience slower growth in the second half, not only due to the
stock market but because manufacturers are being hit hard by
Asia,'' said Skrainka.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence, while down slightly in July, is still
upbeat for the year, which bodes well for continued spending.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say this is due in part to an unemployment rate that
seems to have leveled off at 4.5 percent, accompanied by benign
inflation and interest rates that are trending lower _ conditions
that helped to produce the bull market.

 &HT;    Hate those fastballs on the fists? Swing away with an `electric'
bat
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology is putting a charge into the grand old game
of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first ``electric bat,'' the aluminum Copperhead ACX
by Worth Inc., hit store shelves Aug. 1, billed as having a nearly
unlimited sweet spot and promising to reduce or eliminate the sting
that results from hitting the ball near the handle or close to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Copperhead ACX's competitors are at the cutting
edge, too. The Easton Z-Core SC500 alloys aluminum with scandium _
used in the former Soviet Union for MiG fighters _ to make a thin,
super-hard shell around a ``high-strain inner core.'' The
pressurized Louisville Slugger Air Attack 2 has a nitrogen-filled
bladder running the length of the inside of the thin-walled bat.
All range from $275 to $300 in price.
</P>
<P>
   But these advances have caused some to worry that bats have
become too dangerous, and that it's just a matter of time before a
screaming line drive seriously injures or even kills a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   What increases the potential danger, most experts agree, is that
aluminum bats are much lighter for a given length than their wooden
counterparts. The lighter the bat, the greater a hitter's bat speed
and the speed at which the ball rebounds off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   For high school and college play, a minus-5 _ 5 ounces less than
the length in inches _ is the lowest weight allowable, said Jess
Heald, chairman of Worth Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ball comes off a wooden bat at 93 to 95 mph,'' Bill
Thurston, the baseball coach at Amherst College in Massachusetts,
told Newhouse News Service. ``With aluminum, it goes up to 110 to
115 mph, sometimes as high as 120 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the concerns, the NCAA announced last week that
the baseball rules committee will recommend a maximum batted-ball
exit velocity of 93 mph and a change in the size and weight specs
of non-wood bats beginning with the 1999 season. The lower limit
may be changed to minus-3, which should slow bat speed.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sansing, baseball coach at Kennesaw State University,
favors the move. ``If we go to a minus-2 or minus-3 bat, it'll
bring back more of the traditional game,'' he said. Right now,
Sansing said, ``Every guy who goes up to the plate has the
potential of knocking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The risks don't seem to be as great in lower levels of ball. A
Little League study of injury data in all its baseball and softball
divisions showed a decrease in injuries to pitchers from batted
balls between 1992 and 1997. In 1992, 145 pitchers were injured by
batted balls; in 1997, only 53 got hurt. Annually, only a fraction
of 1 percent of U.S. Little Leaguers are injured to the point of
requiring medical treatment, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Easton Z-Core and Louisville Slugger Air Attack bats are
available in Little League models. A Little League version of the
Copperhead ACX may be available next season, Heald said.
</P>
<P>
   BOX: Device takes away the sting by neutralizing the vibration
</P>
<P>
   Made by 88-year-old Worth Inc., of Tullahoma, Tenn., the
Copperhead ACX aluminum bat uses the same ``piezoelectric''
vibration control technology used in the twin tails of F-18 Hornet
fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Worth combined with Active Control experts of Cambridge, Mass.,
to develop this latest wrinkle in the national pastime. The ACX
technology previously had been used in snowboards, skis and
mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens when a ball is hit:
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bat is a piezoceramic damper that takes the
vibrations created by off-center hits and turns them into
electrical energy. That energy is applied across a ``shunt''
circuit, which dissipates it as heat, removing the energy from the
bat and reducing vibration. An LED in the knob of the bat lights
when the bat is vibrating, so a batter knows the damper is working.
</P>
<P>
   It works, says Wayne Vickery, baseball coach of the Gainesville
Red Elephants, the state Class AA champions in 1995, '96 and '97.
Vickery saw the bat in action at the Sun Belt Classic tournament in
Shawnee, Okla., this summer. Worth, one of the sponsors, furnished
bats to all competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lights up when you hit the sweet spot,'' Vickery said.
``All the players just love it.''

 &HT;    Anglers and athletes are getting hooked on electronic gadgets
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Americans are taking their microchips out to play with
increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a golfer, hiker, angler, ballplayer or
participant in any of a dozen other sports, there's a device to
help you get closer, walk smarter, find fish deeper or hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Take golf. Perhaps no other sport offers as many gizmos to buy.
The nation's 25 million golfers spend nearly $4 billion annually on
equipment and training aids alone, according to the National Golf
Foundation. Close to $2 billion more is spent on apparel and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the royal and ancient pastime's history,
distances to the flag were measured by shoe-leather express: The
golfer or caddy paced it off. Many courses have distance markers,
but they aren't always reliable.
</P>
<P>
   That just won't do in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Now the nation's duffers and hackers with disposable income have
access to binocular-like laser range finders _ hand-me-down
military technology that was beyond the dreams of grizzled
artillerymen just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A quality device provides a distance reading to a target _ the
flagstick, a house just off the green, or just about anything that
will reflect the laser beam _ accurate to within a yard. The lasers
are illegal for tournaments, but pros find them a great help for
practice rounds on unfamiliar courses, said Rick McCall, a pro at
the private TPC at Sugarloaf golf course in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell, a longtime maker of optical devices based in Overland
Park, Kan., offers a line of range finders optimized for a variety
of distances. All run on a 9-volt battery. The Yardage Pro 400
($300) ranges 400 yards; others cover 600 and 800 yards. The
Compact 600 runs about $400 at The Sports Authority. The 800's
suggested retail price is $449. A compact range finder from DME in
a bright yellow, high-impact case is available at Golf Warehouse
stores for $300.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an incredibly bad hook or slice that sends your ball
to faraway places, and money is no object, for $3,000 you can get
Leica's Geovid, which gives an accurate reading to 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers aren't the only ones who lay out big bucks for the
latest technology. There are 83 million hikers, campers and hunters
in the nation, according to the National Sporting Goods
Association. For those who want to get away from it all while
knowing exactly where they are, or for the directionally
challenged, another legacy has filtered down from the military:
hand-held Global Positioning System receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers range from about $100 to $600, and tap into a ring
of 24 U.S. government satellites encircling the Earth. After
calculating its relative position to at least three of the
satellites and the travel time of the radio signal from the
satellite, the GPS receiver uses triangulation to figure out where
on Earth it is.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy for civilian GPS receivers is to within about 150
to 300 feet. Military versions get a lot closer, but for security
reasons, the Department of Defense restricts the civilian results.
</P>
<P>
   The brands most readily available at sporting goods and outdoors
stores are from Magellan, Garmin and Eagle. Some, such as Garmin's
GPS 48 ($417), will track up to 12 satellites at a time. Others,
such as Eagle's Explorer ($180), also handle 12, but trade the
number of functions for a lower price. Many of the receivers
feature moving maps for navigation in a car; most can be connected
to a laptop and used with mapping software for real-time
navigation. Some even include e-mail capability, though at a steep
price. Figure to spend $300 to $400 for a full-featured, backlit
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 44 million anglers spend more than $106 billion on
their sport each year, according to Field &AMP; Stream magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing electronics have evolved in a few years from relatively
crude sonar depth finders to combination GPS receivers that include
split screens with zoom, speed, distance and water temperature
readings, fish-finding sonar, and bottom composition and contour
readouts. Some models include sensors that can be dropped into the
water to determine the amount of light available at a certain depth
and where the temperature changes.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $100 for a basic Humminbird depth finder to
$1,000 or more for a Lowrance Global Map 2000 that does it all and
includes a map of the entire world. Also included is a MapLink
reader that scans postage-stamp-sized cartridges containing
detailed information on regions in both hemispheres. For most
anglers, spending about $400 to $500 will bring a solid mix of
useful functions. Garmin, Magellan and Eagle all offer lines of
fishing electronics. Most are available in combination form or as
separate devices.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling left out if you're a baseball or softball player? Don't.
The latest king of swing is the Copperhead ACX from Tullahoma,
Tenn.-based Worth Inc. _ the world's first ``electric'' bat (see
related story, Page P3). The bat uses ``piezoelectric'' dampers to
lessen vibrations. The net result is less sting in the hands from
mis-hit balls and a larger sweet spot. An LED in the knob of the
bat blinks to let you know the dampers are working correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The bat doesn't guarantee that every hit will be a frozen-rope
liner, but should help a player make the most of even an off-center
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Copperhead ACX reached store shelves Aug. 1, and retails for
$299.

 &HT;    NetW(at)tch: Online bookstore designed to cater to college crowd
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For many students, August is the cruelest month.
There's the fun of enjoying the last remaining days of summer _ but
you know school is looming right around the corner. For students
with PCs and laptops filled with bookmarks for the Lillith Fair,
``The X-Files'' and ``South Park,'' it might be time to add a few
Web sites to your list that might actually help you once you're off
the beach and back at the books.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tuition, textbooks are probably the college student's
biggest course-related expenditure. Seasoned students know the ins
and outs of the used textbook market, but it might be worth paying
an online visit to VarsityBooks.com (http://www.varsitybooks.com),
an online bookstore specializing in textbooks, textbooks and more
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   While VarsityBooks claims to offer discounts of 15 percent to 40
percent off prices at the campus bookstore, that's just a bonus
compared with the real advantage of avoiding the endless lines.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Maryland, the University of
Virginia, Georgetown University, George Washington University and
George Mason University have the extra bonus of being able to
search for textbooks by course and even by professor, but students
in other parts of the country can look up books by title, author,
keyword or ISBN number. The search engine is a little quirky, but
if you know what you want, you can probably find it here. Express
shipping is also offered, and even though the toolbar doesn't list
English or Literature text, a search for titles in both Victorian
and modern literature turned up a wealth of key titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elements of Style'' is a slim grammar handbook written by
William Strunk Jr. with a forward by noted writer E.B. White.
There's hardly an English teacher in the country who doesn't begin
the semester by waving a copy of this book in the air and
encouraging every student to get a copy. And as English language
reference books go, it really is one of the best around, and you
really should have a hard copy sitting on your bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are in the middle of cranking out a history
paper at 1 a.m., you can save some time by checking out Stunk and
White's rules of grammar on the Web at
http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis
</P>
<P>
   /bartleby/strunk. Maintained by Columbia University, this clean,
smooth, easy-to-navigate site explains the English language clearly
to even the most linguistically challenged. As Martha Stewart might
say, it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   While sites like Yahoo! and AltaVista will help you search for
almost anything your heart desires, a more student-oriented portal
is My Virtual Reference Desk (http://www.refdesk.com). The site is
an excellent Web pit stop for students, with links to news wires
(for current events and sports scores), magazines ranging from
Scientific American to Rolling Stone and a reference list that just
boggles the mind. Want an atlas? You'll find one here. Looking for
a law dictionary? Not a problem. Want to send away for some free
software? You can do that here, too. My Virtual Reference Desk is
organized Yahoo! style and is pretty easy to navigate. The
combination of educational and reference links with sites that are
just plain fun make it a worthwhile bookmark for anyone's list.

 &HT;    Paying off high debt a good investment
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What are consumers learning from the stock market
correction? Or what should they be learning? What dangers lie
ahead?
</P>
<P>
   It is dangerous to carry too much debt at any time. An
unexpected problem, such as divorce or a major medical expense, can
quickly lead to calls from debt collectors and even result in
personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially dangerous to carry too much debt when the
economy is uncertain. And U.S. consumers are carrying the highest
debt level in history.
</P>
<P>
   In May, it appeared that consumers might have had a sixth sense
about this. Total consumer debt outstanding declined two-tenths of
1 percent and revolving credit, which is mainly credit cards,
declined 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also this spring, the American Bankers Association said that
delinquent payments on consumer credit accounts _ including credit
cards, auto loans and home equity loans _ had fallen slightly in
the first quarter of 1998, after rising steadily during the past
two years. It appeared that consumers were catching up on their
debts.
</P>
<P>
   But last month brought bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve said total consumer credit had risen 6.4
percent in June to $1.256 trillion, and revolving credit had risen
5.5 percent to $542.4 billion. The Consumer Federation of America
reported that about 60 percent of all U.S. households carry credit
card debt, with an average balance of $7,000. And last week, the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court said 1.42 million bankruptcies had been filed
in the year ended June 30, a record high for a 12-month period,
spurred by a 9.2 percent jump in personal bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   All this, added to the stock market uncertainty, might suggest a
need for concern for consumers and the economy. But Jeffrey
Humphreys, a University of Georgia economist who specializes in
economic forecasting, doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most household balance sheets are not in disarray,'' he said.
``Debt levels are up but also are households' net worth,'' thanks
in major part to the bull market of recent years _ a bull market he
expects to continue for several more years despite the current
correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Households are generally thrilled with the market, because
they have made more in the market than they ever expected,'' he
said. ``They currently are probably ahead of the market for the
year, and surely well ahead for the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Because so many baby boomers have begun preparing for
retirement, they are ``socking away thousands of dollars in the
market and I expect that to continue for several years to come,''
said Humphreys. He predicted that consumers will not cut back on
spending because of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumer spending amounts to about two-thirds of the
economy, ``and if the correction doesn't recover reasonably quickly
and consumer confidence falters, then we could have some
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative sign of a consumer confidence slowdown came last
week when the Conference Board reported that its Consumer
Confidence Index fell to 135.4 in July, down from its record high
of 138.2 in June, before the market correction began.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service of Metropolitan Atlanta, said there's a better
investment right now than the stock market: paying down credit card
debt. ``You get a great return getting rid of that double-digit
interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerri Detweiler, author of ``The Ultimate Credit Handbook'' and
an adviser to Debt Counselors of America, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should do what they always should have been doing _
pay off high-interest debt, save three to six months' salary for
emergencies, and live below your means to avoid future debt,''
Detweiler said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation
of America, said the irony of the ups and downs of the stock market
is that they have little direct effect on many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a small percentage of people with heavy debt has any
substantial investment in the stock market,'' he said. ``They live
close to the financial edge, and what they have to worry about is a
correction leading to an economic slowdown that might cost them
their jobs.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Riding down Memory Lane with Hot Rod Hairy
 &HT;    (EDS: Hairy is cq)
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``Don't turn around,'' I tell my companion,
``but there's a man standing behind you with a huge sign pinned to
his hat that reads: `Need outside sun visor for '39 Chevy.' '' My
friend chuckles and aims me toward the nearest lemonade stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see it?'' I ask. ``The sign?'' Guess I'm looking for
reassurance that my brains haven't fried in the relentless heat
cooking up from the acres of pavement here at the Kentucky
Fairgrounds. Got to be 110 degrees in the shade _ only there isn't
any.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 29th Annual Street Rod Nationals and there are 15,000
vehicles from all over the country here, cruising the parking lots
and strutting their shiny stuff. I had no idea there were this many
old cars left in the whole world, much less in mint condition and
driveable.
</P>
<P>
   Street rods, I learned, have been messed with. Unlike the
antique auto folks who go in for faithful restoration, ``rodders''
don't mind chopping a top or dropping a Corvette engine into a '40
Ford coupe. And tell me, when was the last time you took a spin in
a '37 Chevy with air-conditioning and cruise control?
</P>
<P>
   My friend hands me a sweaty cup of lemonade, my third in less
than an hour, and we set out to do some cruising of our own, on
foot, through the endless rows of iron. He's checking out engines.
I focus on interiors and memories.
</P>
<P>
   A boxy '37 Chevy sedan catches my eye. My folks had one of those
when I was a little girl. I remember riding out into the country
with my mother at the wheel and wishing I were grown up enough to
see out the window. I was tiring of treetops. And I remember being
carsick in the
</P>
<P>
   back seat _ often. So often in fact, that my father used to
wonder about the next owner. Said it'd have to be someone with a
chronic head cold.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows down, right across from the bratwurst stand, is a '40
Super Deluxe Chevy sedan, just like the one my father gave my
mother for Christmas that year before Pearl Harbor. I recognize the
body shape and the grille, but that's about all.
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Bessie (the name she gave all of her cars as a payback
to her mother-in-law of the same name) was a dignified two-tone
gray and dark blue. This buggy is dandelion yellow with candy-blue
flames licking over the hood.
</P>
<P>
   As I peek through the windows, careful not to touch or lean on
anything (the biggest social blunder in the rodder's book of
etiquette), I can't help wondering; could this possibly be the same
car that saw our family through the war with a ``B'' sticker on the
windshield that limited the gallons of gas the man at the Gulf
station was allowed to pump into our tank? Is there a chance it's
the same flivver that dropped a rusted-through fender in downtown
Cleveland's rush hour traffic back in the winter of '44?
</P>
<P>
   My friend leans over for a better look and chuckles. ``Remember
those things?'' he asks, pointing to a glassy knob clamped onto the
steering wheel. ``We called them `hairy knobs' because we thought
they made us look like real hotrods. Man,'' he sighs with a
nostalgic grin, ``we could whip around corners with our left hand
and never have to move our right arm, which, of course, was around
our date.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he kidding? Do I remember? Harry, my first boyfriend, had one
of those on his old Chevy. We put in plenty of driving time under
just such conditions. That was in the good old days before bucket
seats, when a date could scootch up under her boyfriend's arm and
stay there all the way to the drive-in. It was one of the ways
girls measured a guy's affection. ``We drove all the way to Crandon
Park and he never took his arm down,'' was a familiar gloat at
Saturday night slumber parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Rod Hairy'' was what we called a guy who drove fast, dug
out and squealed corners. Girls thought it was kind of dumb, but we
giggled and ogled all the same. ``Big hairy deal,'' we'd yell in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, we used that expression a lot. It was the label we
pinned on anything we felt was not all it was cracked up to be.
Like the night a bunch of us rumbled into the Big Wheel Drive-In
for burgers after seeing the sci-fi thriller ``The Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big hairy deal!'' Burton Craig groaned as he leaned up against
the side of his coupe. ``I can't believe I paid 75 cents to watch a
giant carrot eat its way through the North Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   And I can't believe those days are gone forever. But ``Hot Rod
Hairy'' is still around. He hands me another lemonade and steers me
toward a '34 Packard. A real beauty.

 &HT;    Tech Report: With help from computer, Lego robots leap to life
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many products that had their beginnings in the
low-tech days when vacuum tubes ruled have withstood the test of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most successful have been Lego plastic building
bricks. They've been around in their present form since 1958, and
kids have spent hours having fun with them without realizing they
were learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Group began dabbling with computer-controlled products
in 1986 in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and the latest creation to spring from that fertile
alliance blends old and new into a cutting-edge toy that will usher
children _ and a lot of adults _ into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, which should hit
store shelves in the fall and retail for about $200, lets kids 11
and up design and program real robots that can move, think and act
on their own. Gort, the blank-faced metal man in the 1950s sci-fi
classic ``The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' would approve.
</P>
<P>
   The brain is the RCX, a microcomputer that can be programmed
with a PC. The RCX's sensors gather input from its environment,
processes it and signals small motors to turn on and off.
</P>
<P>
   Users build their robot with the RCX, Constructopedia guide and
700 Lego pieces included. Next, they create a program using RCX
code, a simple but powerful programming language. The program is
downloaded to the RCX with a special infrared transmitter that
comes with the kit. The robot then can interact with the
environment, independent from the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Children can build a working robot in under an hour, the company
says.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming out in the fall are three expansion sets for the
RCX. The Extreme Creatures set lets kids build virtually any
animal, real or fantasized. Included are fiber-optic strands, a
snapping claw, a working pincer and a tail-wagging mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   With the Robo-Sports set, the robots can shoot hoops, flick
pucks or negotiate an obstacle course. The Exploration Mars set
lets young explorers build a Mars rover and control it from their
own PC.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion sets will retail for $50. Each has its own
Constructopedia building guide and a CD-ROM with 12 challenges.
More challenges can be found at the Mindstorms Web site,
http://www.legomindstorms.com. The CDs are for Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   A little something for your pocket
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics Corp. has come out with a new personal
organizer that will store a megabyte of data in a 5-ounce package
small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The palm-sized SE-300 includes software and a docking station
that allows for two-way transfer of information from a desktop
computer. The software is set up to work with Microsoft's Outlook
97, ACT 3.07 and Lotus Organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The device has a backlit LCD display screen and an infrared port
to exchange data with other Sharp products or the infrared port on
a notebook computer.
</P>
<P>
   The unit runs for 60 hours on one AA battery. Retail price is
$180.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that!
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. has joined forces with the magicians at
Walt Disney World in Orlando, providing hardware for DisneyQuest,
an interactive entertainment experience that opened in June.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computing power is concentrated in the ``Create
Zone,'' where kids of any age can combine their own imaginations
with Disney characters to create unique images and animation and
even become a part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   While in the ``Create Zone,'' visitors can learn the secrets of
animation, create a toy to take home, get a virtual makeover in the
Magic Mirror or create a painting on a Living Easel.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq provided workstations, PCs, servers and flat-panel
monitors to help fun seekers turn fantasy into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Seek and ye shall find
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a treasure trove of useful and useless
information, but finding the nugget you want in a pile of fool's
gold can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   A search string that isn't specific enough can turn up hundreds
of categories and thousands of Web sites that have irrelevancy in
common.
</P>
<P>
   A new search engine, GoTo.com, aims to streamline the process by
getting back to basics. There are no ad banners on the home page,
letting the page build quicker. Or a user can add the search string
right after the ``www'' in the engine's address and go immediately
on the search results page.
</P>
<P>
   Give the engine a try at http://www.goto.com. Maybe you'll
strike it rich.

 &HT;    Skillful use of search engines eases your quest
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The real miracle of the Internet's World Wide Web is
that _ with so much information squirreled away in so many
different Web sites _ we find anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, the mission of the search engine. It's the
cyber-equivalent of a research librarian that takes your request to
find _ for instance _ some information on kidney transplants for
cats and then bustles around the Web and comes back with
recommended sites.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines generally work fine when you are looking for the
obvious. No matter how you search, or which engine you use, you
won't have much problem finding Web sites that contain information
about cats or medicine or even transplants. The real trouble starts
when you're looking for something very specific or a topic that is
a bit obscure.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to approach a search like the one we're using
as an example. You can take the shotgun approach and use one of the
excellent services that combine a multitude of search engines. That
way you can simply type in your search and _ in seconds _ see the
results of the search from a variety of search engines. You'll wade
through a lot of Web sites that way, and chances are many of them
will be way off the mark, but some helpful sites are likely to be
found as well.
</P>
<P>
   My two favorites, when it comes to this type of search engine,
are Dogpile at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.dogpile/index.html and the All-in-One Search Page at
http://www.albany.net
</P>
<P>
   /allinone/all1www.html. Let's take a quick look at each service.
</P>
<P>
   Dogpile can be set to search the Web, Usenet newsgroups, FTP
(file transfer protocol) sites that often contain software you can
download, business news sites and news wires. That covers a
staggering amount of cyber-territory. A complete listing of the
sites searched would fill this column with no room for commas, but
it includes Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, AltaVista, WebCrawler, DejaNews,
Agence France, Business Wire, UPI and Infoseek NewsWires.
</P>
<P>
   Since the search is so broad, you're likely to wade through a
lot of material that has nothing obvious to do with your search
topic. However, that can be interesting, too, since you're likely
to find some nifty new Web sites in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The All-in-One Search Page works a little differently. Instead
of using all the search engines simultaneously, it simply puts most
of the common ones (and several that aren't so common) all on one
page. This site is an excellent one to bookmark, since almost any
search you can imagine can be accomplished from here.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the page is that there are some
special-purpose search engines here you may never have encountered.
Again, there are way too many to list, but here's a partial
listing: Lowest Price Search, an engine that browses the Web for
the best prices on everything from toys to hardware; 411 Locate,
which helps you find e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and Web
sites; Ahoy!, an engine that finds personal Web pages; eBlast, the
Encyclopaedia Britannica's Internet guide; EuroSeek, which searches
European Web sites; GovBot, a database of government and military
Web sites; and YPN _ Your Personal Network, which searches more
than 30,000 reviews of Internet service providers and Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget the many specialized search engines
devoted to a single topic. Since there seem to be as many of these
search engines as there are hobbies and interests, they can't be
listed here. Finding them is fairly easy, however. Just use one of
the general-purpose search engines and include the name of the
topic along with search words such as ``search'' and ``engine'' and
``online,'' and you're likely to hit pay dirt.

 &HT;    Hate those fastballs on the fists? Swing away with an `electric'
bat
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Technology is putting a charge into the grand old game
of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first ``electric bat,'' the aluminum Copperhead ACX
by Worth Inc., hit store shelves Aug. 1, billed as having a nearly
unlimited sweet spot and promising to reduce or eliminate the sting
that results from hitting the ball near the handle or close to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Copperhead ACX's competitors are at the cutting
edge, too. The Easton Z-Core SC500 alloys aluminum with scandium _
used in the former Soviet Union for MiG fighters _ to make a thin,
super-hard shell around a ``high-strain inner core.'' The
pressurized Louisville Slugger Air Attack 2 has a nitrogen-filled
bladder running the length of the inside of the thin-walled bat.
All range from $275 to $300 in price.
</P>
<P>
   But these advances have caused some to worry that bats have
become too dangerous, and that it's just a matter of time before a
screaming line drive seriously injures or even kills a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   What increases the potential danger, most experts agree, is that
aluminum bats are much lighter for a given length than their wooden
counterparts. The lighter the bat, the greater a hitter's bat speed
and the speed at which the ball rebounds off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   For high school and college play, a minus-5 _ 5 ounces less than
the length in inches _ is the lowest weight allowable, said Jess
Heald, chairman of Worth Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ball comes off a wooden bat at 93 to 95 mph,'' Bill
Thurston, the baseball coach at Amherst College in Massachusetts,
told Newhouse News Service. ``With aluminum, it goes up to 110 to
115 mph, sometimes as high as 120 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the concerns, the NCAA announced last week that
the baseball rules committee will recommend a maximum batted-ball
exit velocity of 93 mph and a change in the size and weight specs
of non-wood bats beginning with the 1999 season. The lower limit
may be changed to minus-3, which should slow bat speed.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sansing, baseball coach at Kennesaw State University,
favors the move. ``If we go to a minus-2 or minus-3 bat, it'll
bring back more of the traditional game,'' he said. Right now,
Sansing said, ``Every guy who goes up to the plate has the
potential of knocking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The risks don't seem to be as great in lower levels of ball. A
Little League study of injury data in all its baseball and softball
divisions showed a decrease in injuries to pitchers from batted
balls between 1992 and 1997. In 1992, 145 pitchers were injured by
batted balls; in 1997, only 53 got hurt. Annually, only a fraction
of 1 percent of U.S. Little Leaguers are injured to the point of
requiring medical treatment, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Easton Z-Core and Louisville Slugger Air Attack bats are
available in Little League models. A Little League version of the
Copperhead ACX may be available next season, Heald said.
</P>
<P>
   BOX: Device takes away the sting by neutralizing the vibration
</P>
<P>
   Made by 88-year-old Worth Inc., of Tullahoma, Tenn., the
Copperhead ACX aluminum bat uses the same ``piezoelectric''
vibration control technology used in the twin tails of F-18 Hornet
fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Worth combined with Active Control experts of Cambridge, Mass.,
to develop this latest wrinkle in the national pastime. The ACX
technology previously had been used in snowboards, skis and
mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens when a ball is hit:
</P>
<P>
   Inside the bat is a piezoceramic damper that takes the
vibrations created by off-center hits and turns them into
electrical energy. That energy is applied across a ``shunt''
circuit, which dissipates it as heat, removing the energy from the
bat and reducing vibration. An LED in the knob of the bat lights
when the bat is vibrating, so a batter knows the damper is working.
</P>
<P>
   It works, says Wayne Vickery, baseball coach of the Gainesville
Red Elephants, the state Class AA champions in 1995, '96 and '97.
Vickery saw the bat in action at the Sun Belt Classic tournament in
Shawnee, Okla., this summer. Worth, one of the sponsors, furnished
bats to all competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lights up when you hit the sweet spot,'' Vickery said.
``All the players just love it.''

 &HT;    Anglers and athletes are getting hooked on electronic gadgets
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Americans are taking their microchips out to play with
increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a golfer, hiker, angler, ballplayer or
participant in any of a dozen other sports, there's a device to
help you get closer, walk smarter, find fish deeper or hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Take golf. Perhaps no other sport offers as many gizmos to buy.
The nation's 25 million golfers spend nearly $4 billion annually on
equipment and training aids alone, according to the National Golf
Foundation. Close to $2 billion more is spent on apparel and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the royal and ancient pastime's history,
distances to the flag were measured by shoe-leather express: The
golfer or caddy paced it off. Many courses have distance markers,
but they aren't always reliable.
</P>
<P>
   That just won't do in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Now the nation's duffers and hackers with disposable income have
access to binocular-like laser range finders _ hand-me-down
military technology that was beyond the dreams of grizzled
artillerymen just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A quality device provides a distance reading to a target _ the
flagstick, a house just off the green, or just about anything that
will reflect the laser beam _ accurate to within a yard. The lasers
are illegal for tournaments, but pros find them a great help for
practice rounds on unfamiliar courses, said Rick McCall, a pro at
the private TPC at Sugarloaf golf course in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bushnell, a longtime maker of optical devices based in Overland
Park, Kan., offers a line of range finders optimized for a variety
of distances. All run on a 9-volt battery. The Yardage Pro 400
($300) ranges 400 yards; others cover 600 and 800 yards. The
Compact 600 runs about $400 at The Sports Authority. The 800's
suggested retail price is $449. A compact range finder from DME in
a bright yellow, high-impact case is available at Golf Warehouse
stores for $300.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an incredibly bad hook or slice that sends your ball
to faraway places, and money is no object, for $3,000 you can get
Leica's Geovid, which gives an accurate reading to 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers aren't the only ones who lay out big bucks for the
latest technology. There are 83 million hikers, campers and hunters
in the nation, according to the National Sporting Goods
Association. For those who want to get away from it all while
knowing exactly where they are, or for the directionally
challenged, another legacy has filtered down from the military:
hand-held Global Positioning System receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers range from about $100 to $600, and tap into a ring
of 24 U.S. government satellites encircling the Earth. After
calculating its relative position to at least three of the
satellites and the travel time of the radio signal from the
satellite, the GPS receiver uses triangulation to figure out where
on Earth it is.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy for civilian GPS receivers is to within about 150
to 300 feet. Military versions get a lot closer, but for security
reasons, the Department of Defense restricts the civilian results.
</P>
<P>
   The brands most readily available at sporting goods and outdoors
stores are from Magellan, Garmin and Eagle. Some, such as Garmin's
GPS 48 ($417), will track up to 12 satellites at a time. Others,
such as Eagle's Explorer ($180), also handle 12, but trade the
number of functions for a lower price. Many of the receivers
feature moving maps for navigation in a car; most can be connected
to a laptop and used with mapping software for real-time
navigation. Some even include e-mail capability, though at a steep
price. Figure to spend $300 to $400 for a full-featured, backlit
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 44 million anglers spend more than $106 billion on
their sport each year, according to Field &AMP; Stream magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing electronics have evolved in a few years from relatively
crude sonar depth finders to combination GPS receivers that include
split screens with zoom, speed, distance and water temperature
readings, fish-finding sonar, and bottom composition and contour
readouts. Some models include sensors that can be dropped into the
water to determine the amount of light available at a certain depth
and where the temperature changes.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $100 for a basic Humminbird depth finder to
$1,000 or more for a Lowrance Global Map 2000 that does it all and
includes a map of the entire world. Also included is a MapLink
reader that scans postage-stamp-sized cartridges containing
detailed information on regions in both hemispheres. For most
anglers, spending about $400 to $500 will bring a solid mix of
useful functions. Garmin, Magellan and Eagle all offer lines of
fishing electronics. Most are available in combination form or as
separate devices.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling left out if you're a baseball or softball player? Don't.
The latest king of swing is the Copperhead ACX from Tullahoma,
Tenn.-based Worth Inc. _ the world's first ``electric'' bat (see
related story, Page P3). The bat uses ``piezoelectric'' dampers to
lessen vibrations. The net result is less sting in the hands from
mis-hit balls and a larger sweet spot. An LED in the knob of the
bat blinks to let you know the dampers are working correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The bat doesn't guarantee that every hit will be a frozen-rope
liner, but should help a player make the most of even an off-center
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Copperhead ACX reached store shelves Aug. 1, and retails for
$299.

 &HT;    Tyson to keep his license in a money belt
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ New Jersey doesn't seem to want him.
Nevada's opinion will be the result of a rematch with state boxing
commissioners who already have expressed their distaste for one
athlete tasting another in the course of a championship bout.
</P>
<P>
   If Mike Tyson studied geography in addition to the teachings of
ancient Chinese philosophers during his incarceration for rape, he
knows that no matter what happens in Las Vegas, 48 states and a
handful of U.S. protectorates remain to be petitioned for a boxing
license.
</P>
<P>
   There's South Dakota, for instance, where Jay Leno recently won
a professional wrestling match against Hulk Hogan before an
enormous outdoor crowd. If suspension of belief is a necessity for
putting on a Tyson fight, the good and gentle citizens of that
state appear receptive. They might even accept the notion that Iron
Mike is regretful for anything other than his loss of earning
power.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana might work, too, particularly if a bout were put
together in a remote bayou village on a moonshine-soaked Saturday
night. Cockfighting and alligator wrestling would make a great
undercard, followed by the main event of Tyson roughing up some
palooka as the local sheriff holds everybody's bets. By the end of
that evening, the matter of the world's most dangerous individual,
pound for pound and bite for bite, should be settled to everyone's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Indiana wants him, but Lord he can't go back there. Rhode
Island? Too small to accommodate Mike's entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness dictates that New Hampshire be left out of this boxing
business, too. After, all, they've got the opening presidential
primary up there. Isn't one mass invasion of crooks and clowns
every four years enough?
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's infatuation with automobiles _ he reportedly has bought
110 over the years either for himself or as gifts _ would seem to
suggest Michigan. Come to think of it, though, Mike's always had a
thing for Mercedes and Lamborghini and Rolls Royce and BMW. That
might not go over too big in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico is still up and running after absorbing enough
underground nuclear tests to turn the toilet water eternally blue.
Can't say that a Tyson comeback fight would necessarily contaminate
the atmosphere there.
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails, there's always Montana. When folks there
don't like the rules of their state or the federal government or
even the basic guidelines of civilized society, they simply build a
fence around their property and declare it a distinct and inviable
political entity. Tyson could buy 100 acres of ranchland somewhere
out there, name the place Ironland and elect himself as boxing
commissioner, promoter, exclusive parking vendor and, why not, Earl
of Ears, too. Goodbye, licensing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Never wonder if all these logistical problems are worth it for
boxing to sort out. After you get past Evander Holyfield's upcoming
WBA and IBF title fight with Vaughn (or is it Orson?) Bean, the
only things left on the heavyweight landscape are Lennox Lewis
defending the WBC title against some unknown Croatian and, sadly,
George Foreman fighting Larry Holmes for the WXL (World's Extra
Largest) belt.
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be made here. For this purpose the
all-consuming machine known as Mike Tyson was created. For this
purpose he will be licensed to fight again. Somewhere.

 &HT;    NetW(at)tch: Online bookstore designed to cater to college crowd
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For many students, August is the cruelest month.
There's the fun of enjoying the last remaining days of summer _ but
you know school is looming right around the corner. For students
with PCs and laptops filled with bookmarks for the Lillith Fair,
``The X-Files'' and ``South Park,'' it might be time to add a few
Web sites to your list that might actually help you once you're off
the beach and back at the books.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tuition, textbooks are probably the college student's
biggest course-related expenditure. Seasoned students know the ins
and outs of the used textbook market, but it might be worth paying
an online visit to VarsityBooks.com (http://www.varsitybooks.com),
an online bookstore specializing in textbooks, textbooks and more
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   While VarsityBooks claims to offer discounts of 15 percent to 40
percent off prices at the campus bookstore, that's just a bonus
compared with the real advantage of avoiding the endless lines.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Maryland, the University of
Virginia, Georgetown University, George Washington University and
George Mason University have the extra bonus of being able to
search for textbooks by course and even by professor, but students
in other parts of the country can look up books by title, author,
keyword or ISBN number. The search engine is a little quirky, but
if you know what you want, you can probably find it here. Express
shipping is also offered, and even though the toolbar doesn't list
English or Literature text, a search for titles in both Victorian
and modern literature turned up a wealth of key titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Elements of Style'' is a slim grammar handbook written by
William Strunk Jr. with a forward by noted writer E.B. White.
There's hardly an English teacher in the country who doesn't begin
the semester by waving a copy of this book in the air and
encouraging every student to get a copy. And as English language
reference books go, it really is one of the best around, and you
really should have a hard copy sitting on your bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are in the middle of cranking out a history
paper at 1 a.m., you can save some time by checking out Stunk and
White's rules of grammar on the Web at
http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis
</P>
<P>
   /bartleby/strunk. Maintained by Columbia University, this clean,
smooth, easy-to-navigate site explains the English language clearly
to even the most linguistically challenged. As Martha Stewart might
say, it's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   While sites like Yahoo! and AltaVista will help you search for
almost anything your heart desires, a more student-oriented portal
is My Virtual Reference Desk (http://www.refdesk.com). The site is
an excellent Web pit stop for students, with links to news wires
(for current events and sports scores), magazines ranging from
Scientific American to Rolling Stone and a reference list that just
boggles the mind. Want an atlas? You'll find one here. Looking for
a law dictionary? Not a problem. Want to send away for some free
software? You can do that here, too. My Virtual Reference Desk is
organized Yahoo! style and is pretty easy to navigate. The
combination of educational and reference links with sites that are
just plain fun make it a worthwhile bookmark for anyone's list.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Windows 98 imperfect, but you can do a few things
to make it better
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's start by agreeing that Windows 98 is not as good
as it could be. But danged little is.
</P>
<P>
   If I insisted on pure excellence in my life, I'd have to stop
eating in the cafeteria here at work, would give my golf clubs away
and would never again sing in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   And Windows 98, despite its quirks and problems, is better than
earlier versions and one heck of a lot better than cafeteria
Salisbury steak. So instead of sulking, let's spend today talking
about some of the ways you can get the most performance out of
Windows 98. The good news is there are simple ways you can improve
the speed and reliability of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The first item is the only one on my list that costs money, but
it's probably the best way to get more out of Windows 98: Add more
RAM. If you now have 16 megabytes or less, you'll get a noticeable
performance increase.
</P>
<P>
   Just last weekend I upgraded a friend's machine by adding 32
megabytes of RAM. I didn't shop around to get the best price, and
yet I paid just $60 for two 16-megabyte chips. Installing them
amounted to poking the chips into two vacant slots. After five
minutes' work, the computer was noticeably faster.
</P>
<P>
   For most home users, 64 megabytes is about all the RAM needed.
There are some speed increases after that, but if you were graphing
the improvement, the slope would level off dramatically there.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have that much RAM, there's a second adjustment you
should make. Double-click on the System icon in the Control Panel,
select the tab labeled Performance, and then select File System
under Advanced Settings. Take a look at the box that says: Typical
Role of This Computer. Yours probably says ``Desktop Computer.'' If
you have 64 megabytes or more of memory, change that setting to
``Network Server.'' Without going into a long explanation, that
setting will help your PC use that new memory most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Next, let's remove a Windows 98 feature that slows your computer
down. Right-click on a blank space on your computer desktop. Then
take a look at the item called Active Desktop. If there's a check
box by the item labeled View as Web Page, then click to remove the
check mark. Now click on the desktop again and select the tab
called Web. Click on the Folder Options button. You'll be asked if
you want to save the settings and view Folder Options; click on
Yes. Now you'll see three choices for the way folders are
displayed. Select ``Classic Style.''
</P>
<P>
   What you've just accomplished is to remove the much-touted
Windows feature of navigating the program in the same way you
navigate the Web. That feature works just fine but _ when all is
said and done _ isn't all that helpful and slows most computers
down dramatically. Since it's easy to switch back and forth, at
least give both methods a try and decide for yourself. It's my
guess you'll end up deciding you like the speed gain of removing
the Web-like navigation. After all, you probably spent $2,000 or so
for that fast computer. It seems dumb to slow it down.
</P>
<P>
   Next make sure you've switched your hard disk to the new FAT32
system. You can check by selecting Drive Converter (FAT32) from the
System Tools group under the Start button. If the disk has already
been converted, you'll get a message that tells you that. If it
hasn't been converted, do so. Once you've done that, make sure to
run the Disk Defragmenter program at least once a week. Unlike
earlier versions of the defrag program, this one has enough
built-in intelligence to arrange your programs on the hard disk so
the ones you use most frequently load faster.

   These tune-up steps won't make Windows 98 into a perfect
program. But they will give it the opportunity to run as fast as
possible on your machine.

 &HT;    Honoring the geniuses that got it all started
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let us now remember famous men, those stalwarts of old
who made computers what they are, or perhaps what they are not,
today.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is George Morrow. Chairman George, as he was known,
was once the Bill Gates of the computer industry back in the days
when Bill Gates was still filing his teeth into points and getting
MS-DOS ready to take over the world.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Bill didn't have to push Chairman George off
the top of the mountain; George fell off by himself.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose George Morrow is my favorite because I owned one of
his computers, a Morrow Micro Decision. Morrow computers were based
on the CP/M operating system. CP/M stood for Control
Program/Monitor, but it might better have been called Control
Program/From Hell. It made MS-DOS look like Ned in the First
Reader.
</P>
<P>
   Hard drives were in their infancy in those days; almost no one
had one. If I remember right, adding a 10-megabyte hard drive to a
system would kick the cost up by several thousand dollars. Instead,
you had a floppy drive into which you inserted a 200k disk, and
held onto your hat as the 4 (that's right, four) MHz microprocessor
screamed up to full speed. CP/M allowed no graphics, and would look
at no more than 64k of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he cast his fortune with this obviously doomed
operating system, Morrow was considered a great leader and man of
deep insight. If his choice of operating systems is not enough to
give you an idea of his insight, perhaps his final word on Local
Area Networks will be an indication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best LAN,'' Chairman George decided, ``is a guy walking
down the hall with a floppy disk in his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a little red book called ``The Sayings of Chairman
George'' became a fairly hot item in the fledgling industry, Morrow
and his computer company faded rapidly from view. The last move I
can recall Morrow making was the dismantling of his customer
support operation on the simple, and probably accurate, theory that
his customers were too expensive to support.
</P>
<P>
   Other great names in computing actually predated the industry,
which may be why they remain great names.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, George Boole. Boole was an English mathematician
150 years ago who invented a kind of algebra that deals in logic
rather than in mathematics, which of course puts him right in the
philosophical lineage of George Morrow _ mathless math.
</P>
<P>
   Boole's concept was based on the simple idea that propositions
are either true or false _ no maybes _ and relationships between
these two variables can be expressed with ``operators'' such as
AND, OR and NOT.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see how Boole was really a programmer in search of a
computer, and his entire system fit perfectly into the demands of
digital computing, which deals in ones and zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   And finally we have another Briton, Alan Turing, inventor of the
Turing machine and the Turing test. The Turing machine, which he
proposed in 1936 (I am unsure whether one was actually made) was a
logical device that would scan a tape, one square at a time. The
square could contain a symbol, or it could be blank, and based on
the contents of each square the machine would make some limited
response.
</P>
<P>
   Turing's test is much more interesting, since we have yet to put
it to practical use. It is intended to reveal the point at which we
have invented an intelligent machine, and it is quite simple. It
involves one person asking a series of questions of two entities
he/she cannot see _ another person and a computer. When the time
comes that the interrogator can no longer tell which is which, we
have an intelligent machine.
</P>
<P>
   I have just one reservation about the Turing test. Who picks the
human respondent?

   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thursday morning, wearing a dark suit and a grave
expression, President Clinton did what numbers of his predecessors
have been called upon to do: he presided over the bleak ceremonial
that attends the return of Americans killed in service overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was as it should be: the Stars and Stripes at
half-mast, the precision of the military rite; the president and
the first lady. As on each such occasion in the past, Clinton's
words and demeanor were the very model of what Americans expect
from their president.
</P>
<P>
   For a Briton, the uncynical awe in which Americans hold the
president has something innocent and archaic about it, something
perhaps of the way we once regarded the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism and national leadership, like religion, are more
intact here in the New World. Ordinary people fly the national flag
in their gardens. They respect the president and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the resignation of Richard Nixon, under threat of
impeachment, is widely seen even now not just as comeuppance, but
as a national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why the fall of Bill Clinton _ who has never
pretended to perfection _ would be so hard for America to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Cut now to ``that dress.'' Is it really possible that a
president who meets so many of the requirements of his office so
admirably could be brought down by something so tawdry, so
distasteful as a stain on a young woman's dress?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Clinton testifies on today, it is not only
possible, but _ especially if the stain turns out to be what it is
alleged to be _ inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington, and still more in the country at large,
refuse even to entertain the possibility. They engage in some of
the mental compartmentalizing at which Clinton so excels and say
that ``sex'' is different.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have ``sinned,'' they say, he has
committed no crime. Lying about sex should not count as perjury.
</P>
<P>
   At the further reaches of that view is the flagrantly primitive
line that the more demonstrably virile the president, the more
respected his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who would condemn the president, the most timid _ so
far - are the moralists on the political right, for whom unrepented
sin would constitute a bar to the highest office. Such a view might
have disqualified many of the more distinguished American
presidents, but it has a certain consistency.
</P>
<P>
   More vociferous are the legalists who insist that perjury is
perjury, one and indivisible. If the president lied under oath, he
should go.
</P>
<P>
   It is immaterial whether the lie came in a civil suit (as was
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit), whether it came in
evidence that was judged ``immaterial'' (as was Clinton's in the
Paula Jones case), whether the suit was dismissed (as the Paula
Jones suit was), whether the subject was sex (as it arguably is).
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, ask the legalists, if everyone took the oath
so lightly? The whole foundation of the legal system would founder.
That way lies impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most compelling, however, as Clinton prepares to become the
first president to testify before a grand jury in defense of his
own conduct, are the constitutionalists.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that whatever happens, whether or not a sin was
committed, whether or not the law was broken, Clinton has
diminished the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Their contention is that, partly through his own fault, partly
not, Clinton bears responsibility before his successors for
curtailing the power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The rot set in, they say, with the Supreme Court ruling in the
Paula Jones case last year, that a sitting president could be sued
in a civil case. That one decision, fought by the president's
lawyers to no avail, drove the whole legal juggernaut that has
compelled the president's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Clinton's lawyers have fought and lost a succession
of legal contests that define the extent of presidential power _
downwards. What was hitherto ambiguous, and deliberately left that
way by previous presidents, is now marked out.
</P>
<P>
   A president's bodyguards may be required to testify against him
if he is suspected of breaking the law. Lawyers employed by the
White House rather than the president himself owe their first duty
to the taxpayers who technically pay them: their advice to the
president may not be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A president may be subject to subpoena (compulsory court
summons), and the principle of ``executive privilege,'' which
allows a president's conversations with advisers to remain
confidential, extends no further than the requirements of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a president who has a state salary, a house of
majestic proportions, a private plane, a staff of hundreds and the
power to blow up the world has no more legal privileges than a
private citizen if he is suspected of breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his position is worse, because political
considerations limit his options further. If, on Monday, he were to
exercise the citizen's right to remain silent rather than
incriminate himself (take the Fifth Amendment), the world would
know, and he would be universally regarded as guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven months of the Monica Lewinsky saga, Bill
Clinton has tested the limits of the presidency, morally, legally
and constitutionally, and Americans have been generous to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   They like the man; he is charming, engaging, and ``one of
them.'' He retains the aura of office, and they respect that.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, America seems torn between these two views of the
presidency, and two views of Bill Clinton: is the president just
like them, fallible, forgivable, but subject to the law; or is he
above judgment?
</P>
<P>
   The courts have decreed that the president is a citizen, no more
and no less. Where Clinton is concerned, however, the people so far
think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While bosses are summarily dismissed for dalliances with office
juniors, the President of the United States may entertain a young
woman trainee in his office and further her career with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   While officers in the armed forces are liable to discharge for
adultery, the Commander in Chief may pursue a relationship that was
temporarily discouraged by the woman's transfer to _ of all places
_ the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it seems, can get away with it. Americans are treating
their president as a superior being, a superman, to whom man-made
rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   They respect his handling of the office, and he reciprocates, as
he did Thursday, with some fine presidential performances in which
America takes pride.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the popular mood and the state of the law are out of
kilter, Clinton is probably safe. But if public opinion once
catches up with the law, as it could do after his testimony, Bill
Clinton will be vulnerable, if not completely done for.
</P>
<P>
   He may not, in the end, have lied under oath or broken the law.
But he has flouted the rules, rules which ordinary Americans are
expected to observe, rules he has publicly embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Were I an American voter and a Clintonite, it is this personal
double standard that would test my loyalty _ not the diminishing of
the presidency or the toying with the law, but the selfsame
question that has dogged Bill Clinton's presidency from the start:
character. &QL;

president who meets so many of the requirements of his office so
admirably could be brought down by something so tawdry, so
distasteful as a stain on a young woman's dress?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Clinton testifies on today, it is not only
possible, but _ especially if the stain turns out to be what it is
alleged to be _ inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington, and still more in the country at large,
refuse even to entertain the possibility. They engage in some of
the mental compartmentalizing at which Clinton so excels and say
that ``sex'' is different.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have ``sinned,'' they say, he has
committed no crime. Lying about sex should not count as perjury.
</P>
<P>
   At the further reaches of that view is the flagrantly primitive
line that the more demonstrably virile the president, the more
respected his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who would condemn the president, the most timid _ so
far - are the moralists on the political right, for whom unrepented
sin would constitute a bar to the highest office. Such a view might
have disqualified many of the more distinguished American
presidents, but it has a certain consistency.
</P>
<P>
   More vociferous are the legalists who insist that perjury is
perjury, one and indivisible. If the president lied under oath, he
should go.
</P>
<P>
   It is immaterial whether the lie came in a civil suit (as was
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit), whether it came in
evidence that was judged ``immaterial'' (as was Clinton's in the
Paula Jones case), whether the suit was dismissed (as the Paula
Jones suit was), whether the subject was sex (as it arguably is).
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, ask the legalists, if everyone took the oath
so lightly? The whole foundation of the legal system would founder.
That way lies impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most compelling, however, as Clinton prepares to become the
first president to testify before a grand jury in defense of his
own conduct, are the constitutionalists.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that whatever happens, whether or not a sin was
committed, whether or not the law was broken, Clinton has
diminished the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Their contention is that, partly through his own fault, partly
not, Clinton bears responsibility before his successors for
curtailing the power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The rot set in, they say, with the Supreme Court ruling in the
Paula Jones case last year, that a sitting president could be sued
in a civil case. That one decision, fought by the president's
lawyers to no avail, drove the whole legal juggernaut that has
compelled the president's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Clinton's lawyers have fought and lost a succession
of legal contests that define the extent of presidential power _
downwards. What was hitherto ambiguous, and deliberately left that
way by previous presidents, is now marked out.
</P>
<P>
   A president's bodyguards may be required to testify against him
if he is suspected of breaking the law. Lawyers employed by the
White House rather than the president himself owe their first duty
to the taxpayers who technically pay them: their advice to the
president may not be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A president may be subject to subpoena (compulsory court
summons), and the principle of ``executive privilege,'' which
allows a president's conversations with advisers to remain
confidential, extends no further than the requirements of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a president who has a state salary, a house of
majestic proportions, a private plane, a staff of hundreds and the
power to blow up the world has no more legal privileges than a
private citizen if he is suspected of breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his position is worse, because political
considerations limit his options further. If, on Monday, he were to
exercise the citizen's right to remain silent rather than
incriminate himself (take the Fifth Amendment), the world would
know, and he would be universally regarded as guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven months of the Monica Lewinsky saga, Bill
Clinton has tested the limits of the presidency, morally, legally
and constitutionally, and Americans have been generous to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   They like the man; he is charming, engaging, and ``one of
them.'' He retains the aura of office, and they respect that.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, America seems torn between these two views of the
presidency, and two views of Bill Clinton: is the president just
like them, fallible, forgivable, but subject to the law; or is he
above judgment?
</P>
<P>
   The courts have decreed that the president is a citizen, no more
and no less. Where Clinton is concerned, however, the people so far
think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While bosses are summarily dismissed for dalliances with office
juniors, the President of the United States may entertain a young
woman trainee in his office and further her career with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   While officers in the armed forces are liable to discharge for
adultery, the Commander in Chief may pursue a relationship that was
temporarily discouraged by the woman's transfer to _ of all places
_ the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it seems, can get away with it. Americans are treating
their president as a superior being, a superman, to whom man-made
rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   They respect his handling of the office, and he reciprocates, as
he did Thursday, with some fine presidential performances in which
America takes pride.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the popular mood and the state of the law are out of
kilter, Clinton is probably safe. But if public opinion once
catches up with the law, as it could do after his testimony, Bill
Clinton will be vulnerable, if not completely done for.
</P>
<P>
   He may not, in the end, have lied under oath or broken the law.
But he has flouted the rules, rules which ordinary Americans are
expected to observe, rules he has publicly embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Were I an American voter and a Clintonite, it is this personal
double standard that would test my loyalty _ not the diminishing of
the presidency or the toying with the law, but the selfsame
question that has dogged Bill Clinton's presidency from the start:
character. &QL;

<P>
   Who did it?
</P>
<P>
   The usual Islamist suspects are being laid out for inspection.
Since some of these ``suspects'' are truly suspect, they could well
include the criminal mind or minds behind the twin car bomb
explosions at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
which on Aug. 7 killed more than 200 people, including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment _ which could turn out to be quite a long
moment, as the United States embarks on arduous investigations _
their identity, arrests in Tanzania and sightings in Kenya
notwithstanding, is speculation only.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the message the terrorists delivered, unsigned and amorphous
though it was, is unmistakable: they set out to hurt America and
Americans, although the result was mainly to kill Africans.
</P>
<P>
   This strengthens the general supposition that the guilty
individuals have some Islamist or Middle Eastern connection _ with
the rider that nobody should forget the false leap to Islamist
judgment after the Oklahoma bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   East Africa is unaccustomed to this particular form of violence.
Although there are sub-Saharan Africans who hold strong grudges
against America (Somalis, for instance, in whose country America
carried out a clumsy intervention, or Rwandans, whose rescue it
stood back from), it seems improbable that such people would be
prepared or equipped to exact so coordinated a revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, where America has been trying, through Sudan's African
neighbors, to undermine the Islamist regime, links Africa to the
Middle East. In a Middle Eastern context, this kind of terrorism is
slightly less baffling _ and certainly less uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   America is by no means the only victim of international terror,
but it is a particularly attractive target for a new sort of
anti-West, anti-everything terrorist group, which typically lacks a
clear agenda but harbors a deep grudge.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, however, a butt for grudge-bearers with an agenda,
especially in the Middle East. And it is here that it has from time
to time _ in the past in Lebanon, recently in Saudi Arabia _ been
an outstanding target for terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Middle Easterners be suspected of bearing hostility
to the United States so bitter that it encompasses mass,
indiscriminate murder?
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has
toiled assiduously to further peace between Israel and the Arabs,
it offers a way of life that most find enviable.
</P>
<P>
   Good things, all of them, to have done or to have. Yet all can
be, and frequently are, turned against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror image of the credits look like debits to many Arabs.
America, these critics argue, has ruthlessly pursued a personal
vendetta against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, the presence of its troops
on Arab land has become an offense to their hosts, it has been
jelly-soft with Israel, its liberal culture corrupts devout
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar accusations, often trotted out, and surely no murdering
matter. There is more to it.
</P>
<P>
   America's vulnerability is an adjunct of its peculiar strength.
As sole surviving superpower, without benefit of false modesty, it
stands out distinctly from the crowd, a potential target for
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America discreetly masks its preeminence in collective
action. Sometimes it chooses to push ahead on its own, not hanging
around to gather a consensus from fellow members of the U.N.
Security Council or from the European Union. It boldly takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Its trouble, particularly on Middle Eastern issues, is that it
often remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between America and its allies on Middle Eastern
issues tend to be crudely interpreted in the region. The result, in
Arab and Iranian ledgers, is that the United States is entered on
the ``wrong'' side, most of the rest of the world on the ``right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iran, for instance, America has pursued a much harsher line
than other westerners (and remains the Great Satan to hard-line
Iranians who, involved in political civil war with their own
government, are at least as determined as some Americans that the
inter-state hostility should persist).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, America, with virtually only Britain in full support,
has refused to countenance the idea that the time is coming to
remove sanctions which are torturing a people but have so far left
the ruling regime untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, America has exerted itself to help the authorities
catch Islamist militants, apparently aiding in the extradition of
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, America's diffidence towards the Israeli government
contrasts with almost everybody else's impatience at Israeli
obduracy _ and with its own rigor towards the states it regards as
``pariahs'': Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of step on Middle Eastern issues is not the same as
being wrong: it can be vigorously argued, and often is, that
America's line is the right one and that others, sometimes guided
by a narrower self-interest, are at fault for not following
America's lead.
</P>
<P>
   True, that lead may well lead nowhere but this, its advocates
would say, does not necessarily invalidate the argument: if America
had had more support, its policies would have had a better chance
of working, and America itself would have been less exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism, if you cannot do anything about it, is a powerful
disincentive. America's temptation to withdraw into an isolationist
shell could be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it would please a great many Americans who see
little point in enduring the grief that comes with a busy foreign
policy. So far this retreat has not taken place, despite the
shrinking of official appetite for foreign activism since the
Somalia mess in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the truck bomb that killed 19 American servicemen
in Dhahran in 1996 was an anonymous bloodstained order to the
Americans to take their 5,000 or so troops out of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not do so _ though the troops were
tactfully withdrawn to an air base deep in the desert, where their
presence, particularly that of women soldiers, is less alarming to
Islamist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all governments have the right to make up their own
minds; they certainly should not be sheep to America's shepherd.
Collective action, nearly always preferable to the unilateral
version, should entail America deferring to its allies as well as
the allies deferring to America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all that said, the world can still be mightily
relieved that its richest and most powerful nation is prepared,
despite adverse consequences to itself, to take a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling a way through the maze that still persists long after
the end of the Cold War, dithery countries need someone or
something out front. The greatest disaster would be for terrorist
bombs to create an isolationist or cowering America. &QL;

neighbors, to undermine the Islamist regime, links Africa to the
Middle East. In a Middle Eastern context, this kind of terrorism is
slightly less baffling _ and certainly less uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   America is by no means the only victim of international terror,
but it is a particularly attractive target for a new sort of
anti-West, anti-everything terrorist group, which typically lacks a
clear agenda but harbors a deep grudge.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, however, a butt for grudge-bearers with an agenda,
especially in the Middle East. And it is here that it has from time
to time _ in the past in Lebanon, recently in Saudi Arabia _ been
an outstanding target for terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Middle Easterners be suspected of bearing hostility
to the United States so bitter that it encompasses mass,
indiscriminate murder?
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has
toiled assiduously to further peace between Israel and the Arabs,
it offers a way of life that most find enviable.
</P>
<P>
   Good things, all of them, to have done or to have. Yet all can
be, and frequently are, turned against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror image of the credits look like debits to many Arabs.
America, these critics argue, has ruthlessly pursued a personal
vendetta against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, the presence of its troops
on Arab land has become an offense to their hosts, it has been
jelly-soft with Israel, its liberal culture corrupts devout
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar accusations, often trotted out, and surely no murdering
matter. There is more to it.
</P>
<P>
   America's vulnerability is an adjunct of its peculiar strength.
As sole surviving superpower, without benefit of false modesty, it
stands out distinctly from the crowd, a potential target for
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America discreetly masks its preeminence in collective
action. Sometimes it chooses to push ahead on its own, not hanging
around to gather a consensus from fellow members of the U.N.
Security Council or from the European Union. It boldly takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Its trouble, particularly on Middle Eastern issues, is that it
often remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between America and its allies on Middle Eastern
issues tend to be crudely interpreted in the region. The result, in
Arab and Iranian ledgers, is that the United States is entered on
the ``wrong'' side, most of the rest of the world on the ``right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iran, for instance, America has pursued a much harsher line
than other westerners (and remains the Great Satan to hard-line
Iranians who, involved in political civil war with their own
government, are at least as determined as some Americans that the
inter-state hostility should persist).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, America, with virtually only Britain in full support,
has refused to countenance the idea that the time is coming to
remove sanctions which are torturing a people but have so far left
the ruling regime untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, America has exerted itself to help the authorities
catch Islamist militants, apparently aiding in the extradition of
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, America's diffidence towards the Israeli government
contrasts with almost everybody else's impatience at Israeli
obduracy _ and with its own rigor towards the states it regards as
``pariahs'': Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of step on Middle Eastern issues is not the same as
being wrong: it can be vigorously argued, and often is, that
America's line is the right one and that others, sometimes guided
by a narrower self-interest, are at fault for not following
America's lead.
</P>
<P>
   True, that lead may well lead nowhere but this, its advocates
would say, does not necessarily invalidate the argument: if America
had had more support, its policies would have had a better chance
of working, and America itself would have been less exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism, if you cannot do anything about it, is a powerful
disincentive. America's temptation to withdraw into an isolationist
shell could be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it would please a great many Americans who see
little point in enduring the grief that comes with a busy foreign
policy. So far this retreat has not taken place, despite the
shrinking of official appetite for foreign activism since the
Somalia mess in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the truck bomb that killed 19 American servicemen
in Dhahran in 1996 was an anonymous bloodstained order to the
Americans to take their 5,000 or so troops out of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not do so _ though the troops were
tactfully withdrawn to an air base deep in the desert, where their
presence, particularly that of women soldiers, is less alarming to
Islamist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all governments have the right to make up their own
minds; they certainly should not be sheep to America's shepherd.
Collective action, nearly always preferable to the unilateral
version, should entail America deferring to its allies as well as
the allies deferring to America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all that said, the world can still be mightily
relieved that its richest and most powerful nation is prepared,
despite adverse consequences to itself, to take a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling a way through the maze that still persists long after
the end of the Cold War, dithery countries need someone or
something out front. The greatest disaster would be for terrorist
bombs to create an isolationist or cowering America. &QL;

<P>
   Many a patriotic Englishman would no doubt this week be tempted
to urge the queen to dub Sir Darren Gough or ennoble Lord Fraser of
Stout Bowling, to mark the astonishing fact that England has at
last won a top international cricket series.
</P>
<P>
   Such titles would at least have the merit of clarity: everyone
would know, at least while the memory lasted, why they had been
granted and what they signified. That is more than can be said for
most _ perhaps all _ of Britain's plethora of faux-aristocratic
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Who can say what Sir Reggie Bloggins actually did to get his
gong, or whether Lady Rhubarb is so-called on her own merit or that
of her husband's checkbook, or what the difference is between a
Viscount Bogtrotter and a Marquess of Bidet?
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for all this. Partly, it is a quaint British
reminder of its feudal history, partly, perhaps, a fairly cheap
system of incentives and rewards for political and public service
that may help restrain the nastier forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides pleasure to recipients and their relatives,
ample cause for gossip for others, and a source of pride to the
three people alive who know what all the titles mean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is where the problem lies. Apart from an admirable
fondness for history and tradition, other qualities commonly
associated with Britons include understatement and an instinct for
clarity rather than obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, although attempts have been made to retire some
knightly orders and to hand out awards for merit rather than
timeserving, the mishmash of British titles suggests a rather
vulgar boastfulness while being almost wholly bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Into this bewilderment has strode a voice of more-or-less
clarity, an ennobled one, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Jay, a life peer who has just been made leader of the
House of Lords, floated in an interview with the Daily Telegraph
the idea that once hereditary peers have been stripped of their
voting rights in the upper house, as Labour plans, the remaining
voting (i.e., life) peers should lose their titles and simply
attach ML, meaning member of the Lords, to their names.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is welcome, as far as it goes. Admittedly, it would
leave the top titles as exclusively a feudal relic rather than
sometimes a badge of actual distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the point of a title should be to convey some information
to others, saving them from embarrassment or hours of research,
this would be something of an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On meeting Lord This or Baron That you would at least know they
were not a political has-been or a businessman being lured into
government, but rather that at some point in a past century they
had a notable ancestor, that it is best not to ask after their sons
or daughters because you will surely get those titles wrong, and
that they can probably afford to pay for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it leaves many questions unanswered. How can you be a member
of the House of Lords if you are not a lord and if all the real
ones are excluded? This de-nobled house will need a new, suitably
clear, name.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those sirs, ladies and dames. The
quickest way to restore British modesty and clarity would be to
abolish the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But if British incrementalism wins out, a compromise could be to
scrap the titles but restrict the users to the sets of initials
which already come attached to the titles (indicating chivalric
orders, if you must know). The GCMGs, KCVOs and DCBs would still be
bewildering, but at least they wouldn't get in the way. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Madeleine Albright is enough to make a strong heart
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   When she became U.S. secretary of state 18 months ago, things
seemed splendid. She was the first woman in the job; she had an
appealing personal story, as a childhood refugee from Hitler and
Stalin; she exuded the charm and fluency so important in the age of
television.
</P>
<P>
   She had more star power than any secretary of state since Henry
Kissinger, a fact especially noticeable because she succeeded
plodding Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days almost nobody speaks well of her. And this raises
painful questions about America's capacity for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   People said that Mrs. Albright's charm would invigorate foreign
policy. She knew how to get the rest of the administration on her
side. She knew how to persuade voters not to be bored by abroad.
She knew how to coax the chivalrous Southerner out of Jesse Helms,
the usually cantankerous chairman of the Senate foreign-relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And she sounded bold. She described America as the
``indispensable nation.'' She said her mindset was formed by Munich
rather than Vietnam, meaning that she would not shrink from using
force against tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Mrs. Albright's clout within the administration
helped to keep America engaged in Bosnia. But then her clout seemed
to wane.
</P>
<P>
   In May she delivered an ultimatum to Israel: cooperate on a new
peace plan, or America will be rough on you. Israel refused to
cooperate, but Clinton refused to get rough: Mrs. Albright seemed
to have less leverage at the White House than Israel's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline this point, the president recently appointed
her rival, Richard Holbrooke, as ambassador to the United Nations:
the word is that the secretary of state was informed rather than
consulted about this.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's reputation for connecting with Middle America
has faded, too. In February, in a college gymnasium in Ohio, she
and two other top administration officials made the case for
containing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to win over their audience, and this debacle helps
to explain why America's response to Iraq's current defiance of
U.N. sanctions has so far been mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's courtship of Helms has also delivered less than
had been hoped. It eased the passage of NATO enlargement in the
Senate, and helped get the chemical-weapons treaty through: both
considerable achievements. But Congress still refuses to pay
America's past U.N. dues, and jerks its knee at administration
policies from freeing trade to engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Albright has not always won the backing of the
president, voters and Congress, she has failed to deliver on her
bold rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She promised a Munich mind-set; but NATO still shrinks from
deterring Serbian attacks on Kosovo. She promised that the
indispensable nation would make its influence felt; but Israel has
shown it can dispense with her advice quite cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Mrs. Albright promises that the terrorists who blew up
American embassies in Africa will be found and punished,
Washington's commentariat raises its eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this humiliation? Some say it shows that charm
and sound bites are no substitute for geopolitical grasp, or
(depending on the critic's point of view) for attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Mrs. Albright, a former academic, grasps
geopolitics as well as the next wonk; and she has deputies to worry
about detail.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Mrs. Albright has been undermined by a
president who thinks about scandals more than foreign policy. But
Clinton has actually made foreign policy a feature of his second
term, so this is not the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   The better explanation for Mrs. Albright's comedown lies not in
scandals or in her personal failings, but in the nature of her job.
Hence the painful possibility that whoever comes next will also
have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, America's foreign ministers have
been in a bind. If they speak in vague and cautious tones, their
countrymen will be confirmed in their suspicion that foreign policy
is a hopeless muddle and may anyway no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in Clinton's first term: Christopher was
grey, so Congress slashed the foreign-policy budget and other bits
of the administration grabbed juicy issues (Japan policy was run
first by the trade negotiators and then by the Pentagon).
</P>
<P>
   If foreign ministers speak boldly, on the other hand, they may
fall into Mrs. Albright's trap. They will command admiring
attention for a while. But they may fail to deliver on their bold
words, in which case humiliation will follow.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a general problem of America's divided
government: each power center is tempted to proclaim a vision in
order to stay ahead of its rivals, but at the same time the
division of power tends to block the action needed to deliver on
the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is especially acute in foreign policy. For one
thing, the temptation to proclaim vision is uncommonly powerful:
you can get away with vision-free steadiness on transport policy,
but if you propose to risk soldiers' lives you need a
grand-sounding reason.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the task of living up to a vision is uncommonly
tough. Unlike roads, the myriad trouble spots of the post-Cold-War
world do not lie quietly there while you wonder how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the predicament of America's secretary of
state is hopeless? No: just difficult. It is possible, after all,
to imagine a set of conditions under which Mrs. Albright might have
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   If she had enjoyed a stronger personal relationship with
Clinton, she might have avoided the boomerang ultimatum to Israel.
If she had chosen a friendlier setting than a gym full of students,
she might have avoided the public relations debacle on what to do
about Saddam Hussein. If Clinton had been undistracted by scandal,
he might have backed her more vigorously in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next secretary of state will succeed famously;
perhaps this one, as she probably deserves, will recover from her
woes. Alas, the odds are daunting. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Madeleine Albright is enough to make a strong heart
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   When she became U.S. secretary of state 18 months ago, things
seemed splendid. She was the first woman in the job; she had an
appealing personal story, as a childhood refugee from Hitler and
Stalin; she exuded the charm and fluency so important in the age of
television.
</P>
<P>
   She had more star power than any secretary of state since Henry
Kissinger, a fact especially noticeable because she succeeded
plodding Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days almost nobody speaks well of her. And this raises
painful questions about America's capacity for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   People said that Mrs. Albright's charm would invigorate foreign
policy. She knew how to get the rest of the administration on her
side. She knew how to persuade voters not to be bored by abroad.
She knew how to coax the chivalrous Southerner out of Jesse Helms,
the usually cantankerous chairman of the Senate foreign-relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And she sounded bold. She described America as the
``indispensable nation.'' She said her mindset was formed by Munich
rather than Vietnam, meaning that she would not shrink from using
force against tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Mrs. Albright's clout within the administration
helped to keep America engaged in Bosnia. But then her clout seemed
to wane.
</P>
<P>
   In May she delivered an ultimatum to Israel: cooperate on a new
peace plan, or America will be rough on you. Israel refused to
cooperate, but Clinton refused to get rough: Mrs. Albright seemed
to have less leverage at the White House than Israel's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline this point, the president recently appointed
her rival, Richard Holbrooke, as ambassador to the United Nations:
the word is that the secretary of state was informed rather than
consulted about this.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's reputation for connecting with Middle America
has faded, too. In February, in a college gymnasium in Ohio, she
and two other top administration officials made the case for
containing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to win over their audience, and this debacle helps
to explain why America's response to Iraq's current defiance of
U.N. sanctions has so far been mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's courtship of Helms has also delivered less than
had been hoped. It eased the passage of NATO enlargement in the
Senate, and helped get the chemical-weapons treaty through: both
considerable achievements. But Congress still refuses to pay
America's past U.N. dues, and jerks its knee at administration
policies from freeing trade to engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Albright has not always won the backing of the
president, voters and Congress, she has failed to deliver on her
bold rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She promised a Munich mind-set; but NATO still shrinks from
deterring Serbian attacks on Kosovo. She promised that the
indispensable nation would make its influence felt; but Israel has
shown it can dispense with her advice quite cheerfully.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the grime and misery of Baghdad, it is a strange sight: a
brand-new bright green shop front, full of sleek Italian clothes
and posters of wide-eyed African and Asian faces.
</P>
<P>
   As idle taxi drivers and peanut hawkers look on in envy, a
handful of well-to-do Iraqis rummage through racks of linen suits,
pick over piles of plaid shirts and try on designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation left by the Gulf war and the war with
Iran, and the economic paralysis that has been brought on by United
Nations sanctions, Benetton has made it to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought it there is also an unexpected sight.
Slight, short and shy, Ahmad Samha does not look like a daredevil
entrepreneur. In fact, it is hard to imagine how he manages to do
any business at all.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years and in the teeth of fearsome bureaucracy,
corruption and an instinctive suspicion of private enterprise, he
has built up a chain of 32 stores in Syria, all of which are
supplied from his own modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. embargo notwithstanding, Samha has managed to expand
into Iraq. By the end of the year he plans to open his first outlet
in Algeria. Iran is next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is not obviously a land of opportunity. It is
internationally isolated and economically troubled. Garment imports
are banned; and few foreign companies are interested in its small,
unstable market _ even though, thanks to a recent opening to
outside investment, foreign firms can set up joint ventures with
Syrian partners.
</P>
<P>
   If they bother with Syria at all, they tend to sell franchises
to local businessmen. Such is the deal that Benetton has done with
Samha, even though its international outlets normally sell only
stuff made in its Italian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's state-controlled banks do not lend to entrepreneurs.
Private banks do not exist. So finding the money to start a
business is a struggle. Private companies labor under murky and
sometimes contradictory regulations designed to leave them
vulnerable to governmental whim.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, almost every successful businessman in Syria is
related, or at least closely connected, to a senior government
figure. Local partners or franchise-holders of foreign firms are
typically middlemen who oil cogs and grease palms so that the
outsiders can get on with selling their goods.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of doing business in Syria is Samha's challenge;
but it is also his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue states have rich people too, and rich people long for
foreign fashions. Fraught trade relations and off-putting
investment climates (to say the least) normally prevent them from
getting hold of the fancy imported goods they covet; which only
sharpens the desire.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, preferential trade agreements between Syria and other
Middle Eastern countries closed to western imports provide Samha's
company, Amal Samha, with a wide and sheltered market.
</P>
<P>
   Samha did not start with the political connections more usual
among successful businessmen. His father is not a minister, but a
carpenter. And he is a clothes maker, not a fixer.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11, he had already settled on his future career
when he took an after-school job at a tailor's. In 1977, aged 15,
he dropped out of school to work full-time on the four sewing
machines he had bought with his savings. (He still speaks only
Arabic.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Benetton came to Syria to scout for a franchisee in
the mid-1990s, Samha owned a factory exporting clothes to Europe.
He knew the local shopkeepers, so was able to accelerate Benetton's
expansion in Syria by signing sub-franchises for individual stores.
With his own factory already running, it proved relatively easy to
set up the Benetton lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterparts in Syria, who keep fingers in as many
pies as possible to spread the risk and distract the taxman, Samha
puts all his energy and earnings into a single trade.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a revolution in local retailing. Never before have
Syrians or Iraqis seen a chain of stores selling clothes of uniform
quality at fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, clean, spacious shops, which are all designed to
Benetton's specifications, delight customers used to cluttered,
dimly-lit bazaars. The posters from Benetton's international
advertising campaigns, which concentrate on attractive foreign
faces rather than the company's clothes, shine out on the streets
of Aleppo and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Few local firms spend anything like the 5 percent of turnover
stipulated by Benetton on advertising. Amal _ the Arabic for hope _
is introducing the concept of a brand for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But western marketing techniques carry risks. The Syrian
authorities hate the idea of western consumerism conquering their
semi-socialist society.
</P>
<P>
   They recently forced Damascus's first KFC outlet, which boasted
of its chicken from Kentucky, to change to something that smacked
less of cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kuwaiti Food Company (still KFC) is also having trouble
competing with the city's countless roast-chicken stands, despite
fancy advertising and clean counters.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Amal has kept a low enough profile to avoid
unwanted attention from the authorities. Its prices are just high
enough to seem exclusive without being prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But Samha is stuck in a tight corner. As it is, he believes he
has saturated the Syrian market. His two stores in Baghdad are
patronized only by the tiny government elite that can still afford
such frivolities.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran, he will even have run out of rogue states
(Benetton's Egyptian franchisee has snapped up Libya).
</P>
<P>
   As long as the countries where Samha sells his clothes remain
politically unpredictable and economically stagnant, his potential
customer base will never expand much. But if they reform, they will
attract competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Samha may have found a niche, but it will never be a comfortable
one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the grime and misery of Baghdad, it is a strange sight: a
brand-new bright green shop front, full of sleek Italian clothes
and posters of wide-eyed African and Asian faces.
</P>
<P>
   As idle taxi drivers and peanut hawkers look on in envy, a
handful of well-to-do Iraqis rummage through racks of linen suits,
pick over piles of plaid shirts and try on designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation left by the Gulf war and the war with
Iran, and the economic paralysis that has been brought on by United
Nations sanctions, Benetton has made it to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought it there is also an unexpected sight.
Slight, short and shy, Ahmad Samha does not look like a daredevil
entrepreneur. In fact, it is hard to imagine how he manages to do
any business at all.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years and in the teeth of fearsome bureaucracy,
corruption and an instinctive suspicion of private enterprise, he
has built up a chain of 32 stores in Syria, all of which are
supplied from his own modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. embargo notwithstanding, Samha has managed to expand
into Iraq. By the end of the year he plans to open his first outlet
in Algeria. Iran is next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is not obviously a land of opportunity. It is
internationally isolated and economically troubled. Garment imports
are banned; and few foreign companies are interested in its small,
unstable market _ even though, thanks to a recent opening to
outside investment, foreign firms can set up joint ventures with
Syrian partners.
</P>
<P>
   If they bother with Syria at all, they tend to sell franchises
to local businessmen. Such is the deal that Benetton has done with
Samha, even though its international outlets normally sell only
stuff made in its Italian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's state-controlled banks do not lend to entrepreneurs.
Private banks do not exist. So finding the money to start a
business is a struggle. Private companies labor under murky and
sometimes contradictory regulations designed to leave them
vulnerable to governmental whim.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, almost every successful businessman in Syria is
related, or at least closely connected, to a senior government
figure. Local partners or franchise-holders of foreign firms are
typically middlemen who oil cogs and grease palms so that the
outsiders can get on with selling their goods.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of doing business in Syria is Samha's challenge;
but it is also his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue states have rich people too, and rich people long for
foreign fashions. Fraught trade relations and off-putting
investment climates (to say the least) normally prevent them from
getting hold of the fancy imported goods they covet; which only
sharpens the desire.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, preferential trade agreements between Syria and other
Middle Eastern countries closed to western imports provide Samha's
company, Amal Samha, with a wide and sheltered market.
</P>
<P>
   Samha did not start with the political connections more usual
among successful businessmen. His father is not a minister, but a
carpenter. And he is a clothes maker, not a fixer.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11, he had already settled on his future career
when he took an after-school job at a tailor's. In 1977, aged 15,
he dropped out of school to work full-time on the four sewing
machines he had bought with his savings. (He still speaks only
Arabic.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Benetton came to Syria to scout for a franchisee in
the mid-1990s, Samha owned a factory exporting clothes to Europe.
He knew the local shopkeepers, so was able to accelerate Benetton's
expansion in Syria by signing sub-franchises for individual stores.
With his own factory already running, it proved relatively easy to
set up the Benetton lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterparts in Syria, who keep fingers in as many
pies as possible to spread the risk and distract the taxman, Samha
puts all his energy and earnings into a single trade.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a revolution in local retailing. Never before have
Syrians or Iraqis seen a chain of stores selling clothes of uniform
quality at fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, clean, spacious shops, which are all designed to
Benetton's specifications, delight customers used to cluttered,
dimly-lit bazaars. The posters from Benetton's international
advertising campaigns, which concentrate on attractive foreign
faces rather than the company's clothes, shine out on the streets
of Aleppo and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Few local firms spend anything like the 5 percent of turnover
stipulated by Benetton on advertising. Amal _ the Arabic for hope _
is introducing the concept of a brand for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But western marketing techniques carry risks. The Syrian
authorities hate the idea of western consumerism conquering their
semi-socialist society.
</P>
<P>
   They recently forced Damascus's first KFC outlet, which boasted
of its chicken from Kentucky, to change to something that smacked
less of cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kuwaiti Food Company (still KFC) is also having trouble
competing with the city's countless roast-chicken stands, despite
fancy advertising and clean counters.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Amal has kept a low enough profile to avoid
unwanted attention from the authorities. Its prices are just high
enough to seem exclusive without being prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But Samha is stuck in a tight corner. As it is, he believes he
has saturated the Syrian market. His two stores in Baghdad are
patronized only by the tiny government elite that can still afford
such frivolities.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran, he will even have run out of rogue states
(Benetton's Egyptian franchisee has snapped up Libya).
</P>
<P>
   As long as the countries where Samha sells his clothes remain
politically unpredictable and economically stagnant, his potential
customer base will never expand much. But if they reform, they will
attract competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Samha may have found a niche, but it will never be a comfortable
one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ Dismissively, John D. Rockefeller once
referred to the early days of the American oil industry as
``harvest time'': anybody could get rich simply by digging a hole
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   His generation, he maintained, lived through harsher times, and
got rich through their organizational flair, or not at all. He
turned his genius to consolidation, and it made him very rich
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of Brent Crude at its lowest level in real terms
for 25 years, harsh times are here again _ and so, it appears, is
the Rockefeller vision.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industrial merger ever, between British Petroleum
and Amoco, may herald a new era of consolidation in an industry
where mergers have been scarce of late.
</P>
<P>
   BP, whose American wing is based around the Ohio part of
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, is paying $48 billion to acquire
Amoco, which was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a steepish 15 percent premium over
Amoco's pre-bid value, the merger has been applauded as a good fit:
BP is generally better at the upstream part of the business
(finding and extracting oil); Amoco at the downstream business of
refining, distributing and marketing the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's stronghold is the United States _ hitherto a weak spot
for BP. And the Chicago-based firm beefs up BP's gas and
petrochemicals divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As these empires are meshed together, there should be plenty of
savings. Sir John Browne, BP's boss, who will also head the new
company, has a flair for cutting costs that Rockefeller might have
appreciated: BP's work force now has fewer than half the 112,000
people it had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 of the 99,000 jobs at the new BP Amoco are already
earmarked to go; managers' bonuses will be tied to producing $2
billion in annual pre-tax savings by the end of 2000. Businesses
that are not number one or two in their segments are likely to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sir John promises much more than mere
cost-cutting. He describes both BP and Amoco as being ``at the top
of the second division.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the new BP Amoco in a first division of
``super majors,'' alongside Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The new
firm will on some counts be these firms' equal: it will, for
instance, have more oil and gas reserves than Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Having been hustled out of the Middle East long ago, all the
majors are heavily dependent on giant fields that were discovered
decades ago, many of which (particularly those in North America and
Europe) are starting to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The great task for today's oil firms is to replace these ``crown
jewels.'' In recent years a mere handful of fields containing more
than 500 million barrels have been discovered, in contrast with
dozens of big new discoveries in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-water reserves, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and off
the coast of West Africa, are expensive to extract. Russia, which
sits on 5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BP took a 10 percent stake in Russia's Sidanco; it
recently reported a $20 million loss due to problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian, where both BP and Amoco have struck deals, is stuck
in a tortuous geopolitical argument over the route of pipelines
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there is natural gas: demand for the stuff is growing
more rapidly than demand for oil, in part because burning it
produces less pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has large reserves of gas. In 1988 it bought Dome
Petroleum, a Canadian gas firm, for $4.2 billion. But transporting
gas is difficult and it has no international spot market, forcing
producers to find long-term buyers before any big investment in a
gas field, which can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   BP thinks the merger will help it deal with these difficulties.
Simply by having a broader range of countries, it should be less
vulnerable than most to upsets in any one place: Shell's problems
in Nigeria made only a small dent in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your appetite for risk is a function of how much capital you
have,'' one senior figure stresses. ``Now we can afford to make
bigger bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BP and Amoco have often had to go into partnership on big
oil deals; now they can bid alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing tendency by governments to demand that
oil companies do more than just extract oil; they have to build
infrastructure as well _ once again pushing up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   BP and Amoco also say that they will reconsider the liquefied
natural gas industry that they have shied away from in the past. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In all this, Sir John is careful to talk about size being an
``outcome, not an aim'' and stresses his willingness to sell
businesses as well as enter them. He is adamant, however, that
scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from
transferring expertise (in drilling technology, for instance)
around the company; now these skills, built at great expense, can
be put to work across a much wider group at little extra cost. The
same logic would presumably apply to Amoco's flair for retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is an intriguing vision. But the case for size and
creativity within a super major remains unproven. BP's return on
capital employed _ the main benchmark of profitability amongst big
oil firms _ was 14 percent in the 12 months to the end of June,
well above Shell's figure of 10 percent (Amoco scored even lower at
9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Shell is even now starting a restructuring drive that may clamp
back on investment. As for Exxon, its 14.5 percent return has been
achieved more by returning its capital to investors through share
buybacks than by using it to grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry's future may turn on two things where
nimbleness may count for more than size.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the long-awaited introduction of other forms of
energy _ a development where large reserves of oil may actually
prove a handicap. The other, more immediate possibility is the
reentry of western firms to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real prize in the oil industry, both because of the
Middle East's reserves and because it still costs less than $2 a
barrel to extract oil there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while OPEC, which is dominated by Middle Eastern
producers, owns three-quarters of the world's proven reserves, it
currently produces only 41 percent of the world's annual oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
   This means that as non-OPEC supplies begin to dwindle, or are
made uncompetitive because of the low oil price, the importance of
the Middle East is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, winning deals in the Middle East seems to depend in
larger part on the political astuteness and lobbying skills of oil
bosses than on the size of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
   French oil firms, such as Total and Elf, have had a head start
in negotiating deals in Iran and Iraq because their government is
more friendly to these regimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller discovered, even the best-organized oil firms can
be undermined by politicking. &QL;

scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from
transferring expertise (in drilling technology, for instance)
around the company; now these skills, built at great expense, can
be put to work across a much wider group at little extra cost. The
same logic would presumably apply to Amoco's flair for retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is an intriguing vision. But the case for size and
creativity within a super major remains unproven. BP's return on
capital employed _ the main benchmark of profitability amongst big
oil firms _ was 14 percent in the 12 months to the end of June,
well above Shell's figure of 10 percent (Amoco scored even lower at
9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Shell is even now starting a restructuring drive that may clamp
back on investment. As for Exxon, its 14.5 percent return has been
achieved more by returning its capital to investors through share
buybacks than by using it to grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry's future may turn on two things where
nimbleness may count for more than size.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the long-awaited introduction of other forms of
energy _ a development where large reserves of oil may actually
prove a handicap. The other, more immediate possibility is the
reentry of western firms to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real prize in the oil industry, both because of the
Middle East's reserves and because it still costs less than $2 a
barrel to extract oil there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while OPEC, which is dominated by Middle Eastern
producers, owns three-quarters of the world's proven reserves, it
currently produces only 41 percent of the world's annual oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
   This means that as non-OPEC supplies begin to dwindle, or are
made uncompetitive because of the low oil price, the importance of
the Middle East is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, winning deals in the Middle East seems to depend in
larger part on the political astuteness and lobbying skills of oil
bosses than on the size of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
   French oil firms, such as Total and Elf, have had a head start
in negotiating deals in Iran and Iraq because their government is
more friendly to these regimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller discovered, even the best-organized oil firms can
be undermined by politicking. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ Dismissively, John D. Rockefeller once
referred to the early days of the American oil industry as
``harvest time'': anybody could get rich simply by digging a hole
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   His generation, he maintained, lived through harsher times, and
got rich through their organizational flair, or not at all. He
turned his genius to consolidation, and it made him very rich
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of Brent Crude at its lowest level in real terms
for 25 years, harsh times are here again _ and so, it appears, is
the Rockefeller vision.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industrial merger ever, between British Petroleum
and Amoco, may herald a new era of consolidation in an industry
where mergers have been scarce of late.
</P>
<P>
   BP, whose American wing is based around the Ohio part of
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, is paying $48 billion to acquire
Amoco, which was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a steepish 15 percent premium over
Amoco's pre-bid value, the merger has been applauded as a good fit:
BP is generally better at the upstream part of the business
(finding and extracting oil); Amoco at the downstream business of
refining, distributing and marketing the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's stronghold is the United States _ hitherto a weak spot
for BP. And the Chicago-based firm beefs up BP's gas and
petrochemicals divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As these empires are meshed together, there should be plenty of
savings. Sir John Browne, BP's boss, who will also head the new
company, has a flair for cutting costs that Rockefeller might have
appreciated: BP's work force now has fewer than half the 112,000
people it had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 of the 99,000 jobs at the new BP Amoco are already
earmarked to go; managers' bonuses will be tied to producing $2
billion in annual pre-tax savings by the end of 2000. Businesses
that are not number one or two in their segments are likely to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sir John promises much more than mere
cost-cutting. He describes both BP and Amoco as being ``at the top
of the second division.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the new BP Amoco in a first division of
``super majors,'' alongside Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The new
firm will on some counts be these firms' equal: it will, for
instance, have more oil and gas reserves than Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Having been hustled out of the Middle East long ago, all the
majors are heavily dependent on giant fields that were discovered
decades ago, many of which (particularly those in North America and
Europe) are starting to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The great task for today's oil firms is to replace these ``crown
jewels.'' In recent years a mere handful of fields containing more
than 500 million barrels have been discovered, in contrast with
dozens of big new discoveries in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-water reserves, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and off
the coast of West Africa, are expensive to extract. Russia, which
sits on 5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BP took a 10 percent stake in Russia's Sidanco; it
recently reported a $20 million loss due to problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian, where both BP and Amoco have struck deals, is stuck
in a tortuous geopolitical argument over the route of pipelines
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there is natural gas: demand for the stuff is growing
more rapidly than demand for oil, in part because burning it
produces less pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has large reserves of gas. In 1988 it bought Dome
Petroleum, a Canadian gas firm, for $4.2 billion. But transporting
gas is difficult and it has no international spot market, forcing
producers to find long-term buyers before any big investment in a
gas field, which can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   BP thinks the merger will help it deal with these difficulties.
Simply by having a broader range of countries, it should be less
vulnerable than most to upsets in any one place: Shell's problems
in Nigeria made only a small dent in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your appetite for risk is a function of how much capital you
have,'' one senior figure stresses. ``Now we can afford to make
bigger bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BP and Amoco have often had to go into partnership on big
oil deals; now they can bid alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing tendency by governments to demand that
oil companies do more than just extract oil; they have to build
infrastructure as well _ once again pushing up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   BP and Amoco also say that they will reconsider the liquefied
natural gas industry that they have shied away from in the past. &QL;

   In all this, Sir John is careful to talk about size being an
``outcome, not an aim'' and stresses his willingness to sell
businesses as well as enter them. He is adamant, however, that
scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from

THE CRUCIAL CHALLENGE OF DIVERSITY

   OTTAWA _ The new Canadian census shows that minorities now make
up about a third of the population of Toronto and Vancouver. French
speakers in Quebec continue to argue about whether they have a
place in Canada. The grand chief of the Crees is arguing that the
Indian band has a right to secede from Quebec if the province
leaves Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity debate is raging in Canada. But not only there.
Turkish students are protesting the ban against head scarfs at
secular Istanbul University. President Clinton has spent much of
his second term trying to cultivate a conversation on race.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of the last years of the century _ and,
undoubtedly, the early years of the next century _ may be simple to
express but difficult to achieve: how to manage diversity.
</P>
<P>
   It is a challenge in Israel, which at age 50 is struggling to
integrate black Jews, Jews of different philosophies, and Arabs
into a nation that was founded as something of a utopian society.
It is a challenge in Great Britain and France, which for centuries
had colonies abroad but only now are struggling to make a home for
large numbers of nonwhites. It is a challenge in Asia, where Cold
War tensions have given way to ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges are especially vivid in North America, which
only two centuries ago was colonized by Europeans, who pushed the
native people to the far fringes and who seeded the fertile land of
the continent with thousands of settlers, most of them white but
some of them, portentiously, slaves.
</P>
<P>
   And so Americans have wrestled with questions of diversity _
though often described by a different name _ for centuries. It is
one of the signature struggles of the American story. Even the
founders grappled with this problem. ``Perhaps I am partial to the
complexion of my country,'' Benjamin Franklin said, ``for such kind
of partiality is natural to mankind.'' Today, of course, there is
no one complexion to Benjamin Franklin's country.
</P>
<P>
   But now the United States' northern neighbor _ beset with
centuries-old language tensions rooted in European rivalries and
with a flood of new immigrants, more than half of whom come from
Asia and the Pacific islands _ is wrangling with the problem.
Indeed, the debate here over diversity reveals as much about the
United States as it does about Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian debate is being conducted in a nation whose
boundaries are so uncertain that executives' contracts sometimes
include a clause setting out how their jobs and compensation would
change if Canada split up. The American debate is being conducted
in a nation whose boundaries are more or less fixed, though the
admission of Puerto Rico as the 51st state is a topic that is far
from settled.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian debate is being conducted primarily on language
lines, with race as a subtheme. The American debate is being
conducted primarily on racial lines, with language as a subtheme.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian debate is being conducted in a nation that reveres
its sense of civility and whose cities are filled with ethnic
neighborhoods. The American debate is being conducted in a nation
that is pockmarked with violence and punctuated with ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians talk about a mosaic. Americans talk about a melting
pot.
</P>
<P>
   These discussions define the two nations. They may also define
the future of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must understand that in the next century we will have to
learn to live in peace within states,'' says Stephane Dion, a
Montreal intellectual who has become the governing Liberal Party's
point man on the Quebec question. ``Different populations are
worrying about their own identities. That's an American challenge,
too _ and with the responsibilities you have, you cannot afford for
there to be too many Yugo-slavias. This is a big universal
challenge. It is not a Canadian matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the American struggle on race lies beneath many other
political and cultural conflicts, it does not threaten to break up
the nation geographically, as it does in Canada. Sometime in the
next several years, Quebec will hold another referendum on
independence. The campaign to separate from Canada lost the last
referendum by the narrowest of margins, and the Parti Quebecois,
with its slogans ready, hopes that the province will vote for a new
country for a new century.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal government of Jean Chretien has been arguing that
Quebeckers benefit from being in Canada, and, with an eye toward
pointing out the crisis that would be prompted by a declaration of
independence, has sought a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of
separation. Its opposition rivals, the western-based Reform Party,
argues that mere reason is not enough to save the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are fighting a guy with a dream, you've got to have a
better dream,'' Reform leader Preston Manning said in an interview.
``Quebeckers want heart and emotionalism, not a cold calculation of
how things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when census takers asked Canadians their ethnic
backgrounds, nearly 38 percent of Quebeckers responded by saying
that they were of ``Canadian'' origin. That's double the national
average, and more Quebeckers responded that way than did any other
group.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United States, a survey released early this spring
showed that the children of immigrants overwhelmingly prefer
English to their parents' language. The Children of Immigrants
Longitudinal Study also showed that these new Americans have higher
grades and lower dropout rates than other children.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the diversity debate is prompting Canadians
and Americans to learn more about each other, and to learn more
about what it is to be a nation.
</P>
<P>
   John Whyte, Saskatechewan's deputy minister of justice and a
constitutional scholar, made a plea this year for a multiracial,
multiethnic, multicultural society. ``The threads of a thousand
acts of accommodation,'' said Whyte, who might have been talking to
Americans as well as Canadians, ``are the fabric of a nation.''

   ROCKPORT, Maine _ In a remote corner of the Sea View Cemetery is
a jarring reminder of the way we treat children in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unknown, Unwanted, Baby Boy. Body Found In Rockport Quarry,
April 20, 1940, Age About Five Mos.'' reads the tombstone
inscription. The infant was discovered floating in the quarry
waters near the town dump by a passerby. His identity was never
discovered and the case remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   The grave has carved a place in the hearts of visitors who place
flowers, toys, coins, baseballs, and teddy bears at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have asked to be buried next to the infant, but the
town has ruled against that because the paupers' section of the
cemetery is closed. Others pull up sleeping bags and spend the
night. Years ago, the townspeople took up a collection and bought
the tombstone, along with a small statue of an angel. ``It's pretty
moving,'' said Town Manager Don Willard. ``People have strong
reactions to it. It's such a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of the ``unknown, unwanted'' baby is from a past
generation, but the tragedy it speaks echoes today in this nation's
continuing refusal to support basic children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is one of only two countries that has not
ratified the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child, which guarantees adequate health care and education, as well
as protection from violence, exploitation, and hazardous
employment. It also promises equal treatment regardless of gender
or race.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia, which has no legal government, is the only other
country that has refused to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified human rights
treaty in history, with 191 participating countries. But currently
it is as unknown and unwanted as the tiny 5-month-old who lies so
lonely in the Maine woods.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: a resolution by 19 conservative senators, led by
Senator Jessie Helms, says that the ``UN Convention on the Rights
of the Child is incompatible with the God-given right and
responsibility of parents to raise their children,'' and that ``the
convention has the potential to severely restrict states and the
federal government in their efforts to protect children and to
enhance family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms, a North Carolina Republican, along with 26 cosponsors,
introduced a Senate Resolution in 1995 urging the president not to
send the bill to the Foreign Relations Committee, which Helms
chairs. ``He doesn't want to be seen as anti-child,'' said Joe
Mettimano, an assistant director at the US committee for UNICEF.
``He would rather the thing just die in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Helms talks about states' rights, but what about children's
rights?
</P>
<P>
   According to UNICEF, nearly three-quarters of all the murders of
children in the industrialized world occur in the United States,
where, on average, three children die every day of abuse and
neglect. The United States has one of the highest rates of poverty
and hunger among children, and one of the highest infant mortality
rates among industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   And the Convention on the Rights of the Child is not even next
in line for consideration in Congress. That honor goes to the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Woman, which was launched 17 years ago and still is not
ratified, according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what some critics call Helms's misinformation campaign,
the Convention on the Rights of the Child neither threatens a
parent's authority or national sovereignty, nor does it give
children the right to sue their parents. It is neutral on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should ratify this bill immediately and designate the
``unknown, unwanted'' gravesite as a national monument, complete
with eternal flame. Then this little baby whose life was
extinquished before it began would finally know there is a flicker
of hope for the future.

BIOLOGISTS POINT TO WEIGHTED NETS IN SEABED DESTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great clouds of mud billow up from the ocean floor as the metal
``doors'' of a fishing net strike bottom, startling fish from their
hiding places among the rocks and plants. Between them, a long
metal chain scrapes across the sediment, sweeping everything in its
path up into the gaping 200-foot-wide net.
</P>
<P>
   That is the modern way of fishing _ called dragging _ and its
ruthless efficiency goes a long way toward explaining why fish
populations off New England's shores have plummeted. In 1994,
fishermen and scallopers towed their gear across once-bountiful
Georges Bank enough to scour every square inch at least three
times.
</P>
<P>
   But the full damage from dragging is only now emerging as
scientists begin to focus on the seafloor that draggers leave
behind, stripped of the blanket of fragile creatures such as
sponges and worms that form a vital link in the marine food chain.
Not only do the nets take fish, some scientists fear, but they may
be damaging the very foundation of life in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this has been sort of an ignored problem is that
nobody can see it,'' said biological oceanographer Les Watling of
the University of Maine, who compares the effects of dragging to
stumps left after a forest is cleared. ``One pass of a (dragger)
smashes the big things like sponges and large communities... The
net acts like sandpaper when it goes over the rocks and that just
chews everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   Draggermen, already pummeled by five years of regulations that
have cut their effort nearly in half, believe that more rules to
protect the sea floor are premature. They say there is no proof
that their work has permanently damaged fish nurseries anyway,
noting that cod populations have begun to rebound since parts of
Georges Bank closed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trend toward more damaging equipment continues as
draggers try to compensate for new regulatory limits. ``Street
sweepers,'' big wheels of bristles that are attached to the bottom
of nets, allow draggers to tow their nets over parts of the sea
floor once considered too rocky, thoroughly churning up the bottom
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Though the New England Fishery Management Council has proposed a
ban on street sweepers, fishermen who don't use dragging gear
already are fed up with the council's slow pace of action. The Cape
Cod Commercial Hook Fishermen's Association has filed a lawsuit in
Boston against the federal government to force it to take action
against destructive fishing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious the council wasn't going to address
destruction of habitat by fishing methods,'' says Mark Leach,
leader of the Cape Cod fishermen who use baited hooks to catch
fish. He noted that several council &UR;  &LR; members are draggers
themselves, adding, ``It struck too close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the federal lawsuit as well as law
changes that require protection of fish habitat, the Conservation
Law Foundation of Boston last week published a book that for the
first time takes a comprehensive look at the impact of dragging on
the seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on presentations by both scientists and fishermen,
``Effects of Fishing Gear on the Sea Floor of New England''
describes an astonishingly widespread fishing practice _ more than
35,000 square miles were dragged in the Gulf of Maine and Georges
Bank annually in the early 1990s _ and concludes that it appears to
be reducing the variety of plants and animals in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone believes that the long term impact is to reduce
what's living on the bottom,'' says Eleanor Dorsey at &UR;  &LR; the
foundation, who edited the book. ``It's a persistent loss of
diversity and of complexity,'' both characteristics that are vital
to nurturing commercially important fish, such as the cod.
</P>
<P>
   When fishermen started dragging nets across New England's sea
floor in the early 20th century, cod was a cornerstone of the New
England economy and few thought much about the impact of the new
way of fishing the ocean bottom. Fishermen called the sea
cucumbers, sponges and other organisms that came up in their nets
``trash,'' and a 1914 scientific study concluded that dragging did
``not seriously disturb the bottom,'' says University of Rhode
Island oceanographer Jeremy Collie.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, dragging was limited to a handful of small boats
_ compared to the hundreds of larger draggers today _ and
scientists had no way to see what was happening on the bottom. Only
with the advent of underwater video cameras, sonar, manned
submersibles and other equipment have researchers been able to see
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Today, researchers know that the ocean floor is a world unto
itself, an array of undersea peaks and valleys, mud and rock, that
supports a wide array of life: starfish and sponges, dense beds of
horse mussels, anemones that look like little palm trees, worms
peaking out of delicate calcium towers, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Far from ``trash,'' the plants and animals at the bottom of the
sea, known as the benthic community, are a major fraction of life
in the ocean and a key source of food for commercially valuable
fish such as flounder and cod. Just as important, certain types of
sea bottom serve as nurseries for the next generation. Juvenile
cod, scallops and haddock, for example, thrive in sediment with the
consistency of a gravel driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater photographs of a gravel seabed taken by the US
Geological Survey reveal that repeated dragging strips away the
worms, hydrozoans, and other creatures, leaving the bare stones
behind. ``There are lots of attached organisms in gravel,''
explained the survey's Page Valentine. Draggers ``knock them off
and they don't come back right away,'' though there are signs of
recovery two and a half years after dragging ceases.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the saving grace for bait-and-hook fishermen was
limiting where the draggers could go. When Mark Leach, now 41,
started fishing in the 1970s, the rocky and uneven seabed off the
elbow of Cape Cod was too treacherous for the draggers. If they
tried, their nets would often snag on boulders, tearing the net and
taxing the boat's engine.
</P>
<P>
   So cod fishermen out of Chatham and Harwich continued to catch
fish much the way it was done by the 19th century dorymen made
famous by painter Winslow Homer, using long lines with hundreds of
baited hooks attached. Though they couldn't catch as many fish as
their dragging counterparts, the long liners could work in rich
fishing areas where the draggers couldn't go.
</P>
<P>
   But the march of technology swept across the fishing industry in
the 1970s and 1980s, bringing bigger, more powerful boats and
innovations in the nets that allowed draggers to catch more fish or
scallops and go just about anywhere. They attached rubber wheels or
disks called cookies or rockhoppers to their chains, allowing nets
to jump over rocks up to three feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Leach and other long linemen protested the draggers' intrusion
to their fishing grounds, arguing that they were doing irreversible
damage. They said that ``sea lemons,'' lemon-shaped invertebrates
that congregate in the same areas as cod, were fast disappearing,
suggesting that the draggers were taking both the cod and their
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Long liner Fred Bennett dropped a 100-pound roller onto a vase
of flowers to demonstrate the damage done by dragging at a 1995
hearing of the New England Fishery Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   But draggers accused Bennett and other long liners of playing
into the hands of regulators who were trying to crack down on
over-fishing, and they called for unity among fishermen. ``I
thought I came to a public hearing, not a public hanging,'' said
Jim Kendall of the New Bedford Seafood Coalition, according to the
Cape Cod Chronicle's account of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Draggers still argue that the impact of their gear has been
exaggerated by people who don't understand. Frank Mirarchi, a
Scituate dragger, explains that, although dragging of New England
waters is extensive, dragging is concentrated in certain areas
rather than blanketing the entire seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mirarchi has found that the best fishing areas are
ones that he drags the most, suggesting that dragging doesn't do
long-term harm, at least on soft surfaces where he drags. Likewise,
scallopers believe that periodic disturbances from their dredges
actually improve scallop habitat, a view that Dorsey of the
Conservation Law Foundation says may have merit.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, however, repeated dragging or dredging for scallops
is like a force of evolution, scientists say, eliminating softer
organisms such as shrimp and sponges, and favoring the survival of
tough scavengers such as hermit crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Watling of the University of Maine suggests that, even when the
dragging stops, the recovering seafloor is less diverse _ and less
life-sustaining _ than it was before, much like a prairie after the
land has been converted to growing wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prairie produces wheat, but it doesn't have very much
biodiveristy compared to what it was like before people grew
wheat,'' said Watling. ``It's the same thing with the sea. Are we
interested in those kinds of monocultures in the sea?''
</P>
<P>
   That question is squarely before the Fishery Management Council
as it grapples with changes in federal fisheries law that require
them to protect ``essential fish habitat.'' The 17-member council
just finished mapping these sensitive areas, but has not decided
how to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston has delayed the Cape
Cod long &UR;  &LR; line fishermen's suit until fall to give the council time
to take action on gear damage, but the long liners' lawyer says he
will press the suit if the council doesn't do better than it has so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Draggers and scallop dredgers ``are stripmining the seafloor,''
declared attorney David Farrell, Jr. of Chatham. ``Who's surprised
that the fisheries are depleted?''

A SCULPTOR FOR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ At 97, just one year younger than the 20th
century, Walker Hancock is pale, slim, and incandescent _ a bit
like the flames he has occasionally used in his sculptures, flames
from which noble warriors rise.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has spent his life ennobling the human figure. He has
sculpted the great and the good, Robert Frost to Thomas Jefferson,
along with the kids in his neighborhood and the gods of ancient
myth. He gave equal dignity to all. He has spent most of his career
in the Boston area. Yet his work is not as well-known here as in
some other American cities, whose fortunate citizens see his
majestic monuments _ in a train station or a city hall, a post
office or a school _ on a daily basis. Alas, Boston has no
large-scale public work by Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   However, a plaster model for the 1990 ``Flight Memorial''
Hancock made for the US Military Academy at West Point is one of
the highlights of ``Art of the Spirit,'' a temporary exhibition at
the Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing this small work of exceptional merit made me want to see
Hancock. Meeting him was magical from the moment I started down the
long dirt road to his house and studio, a storybook complex of
slate, stone, and shingles, built beside the quarry Hancock bought
in 1930 for $1,800 _ precisely the sum he was being paid for the
``Dancing Naiads'' fountain he was making for a Long Island garden.
</P>
<P>
   The quarry waters are as still as the seas in the paintings of
an earlier Gloucester artist _ Fitz Hugh Lane. Lane's pictures are
rooted in reality yet transcend it: An almost mystical calm
pervades the best of them. The best of Hancock's figurative
sculptures also transcend the ordinary, and, like Lane's paintings,
some of them create a quiet that rivets you when you stand before
them. But in other works, Hancock creates a sense of movement so
true yet so inventive that I suspect he could have been a fine
choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock himself seems as serene as the most hushed of his
sculptures. Sitting in his parlor, an enchanting room with window
seats and a commanding stone fireplace, we pass a pleasant hour
talking about the course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   No, he says, he never wanted to be anything other than a
sculptor. Growing up in St. Louis, he started modeling clay while
still a small child. At age 9, he constructed a cardboard Parthenon
and made clay figures for its pediment. This, writes Louise Todd
Ambler in the catalog of a 1989 Hancock show at the Cape Ann
Historical Museum, was indication not only of Hancock's early
interest in sculpture, but also in sculpture in the context of
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock studied art at Central High School in St. Louis and at
Washington University there. He was something of a prodigy,
receiving his first commission at 18 _ for a World War I memorial
for Central High, in the form of a bronze tablet. In the summer of
1920, the 19-year-old made a pilgrimage to Gloucester to meet his
idol, portrait sculptor Charles Grafly. He lost his nerve on
Grafly's doorstep, an attack of shyness causing him to bolt. In the
fall, though, he went to Philadelphia to enroll in Grafly's classes
at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the next summer,
Grafly invited Hancock to share his Gloucester studio. After
Grafly's untimely death in 1929, Hancock took over his mentor's
teaching duties.
</P>
<P>
   He fell so in love with Gloucester that he commuted from Cape
Ann to Philadelphia by bus, train, and boat. The long dirt road to
his home wasn't always plowed. ``There were times,'' he recalls,
``when I had to get out of here on skis, which I'd leave at the
drugstore.''
</P>
<P>
   About the drugstore. It was in Lanesville, Hancock emphasizes.
Technically, Lanesville is part of Gloucester. To its residents, it
is a separate town _ possibly even a separate country. ``It used to
be completely self-sufficient,'' Hancock recalls, ticking off its
amenities: barbers, grocery stores, pharmacy. ``It was also almost
a Finnish colony,'' he adds. ``The Finns had come to work in the
quarries.'' Hancock married the daughter of a local Finnish family,
Saima Natti, whose brothers were among the boys who regularly went
skinny-dipping in Hancock's quarry. (Saima Hancock died in 1984;
she and her husband had one daughter, Deane, who lives in western
Massachusetts.) The muscular youths also served as models for the
sculptor's warriors and mythical creatures, who tend to have the
high cheekbones of Finns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to sing in Finnish,'' Hancock says, ``and to
pronounce it, but not to speak it.'' The foreign languages he does
speak are French and Italian, the latter learned from listening to
opera recordings. Both languages stood him in good stead in his
travels, which included a three-year stint in Italy after winning
the Prix de Rome in 1925 for his head of a boy named Toivo Helberg,
an orphaned Finnish refugee. The boy's expression is as delicate as
the traditional embroidery on the shirt he wears. He is grave and
composed, his stillness more telling than any histrionic gesture
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Both in intimately scaled works like the head of Helberg and in
his large-scale monuments, Hancock is heir to a tradition of
academic, realist sculpture, the tradition of Augustus
Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French. Hancock was friends with
French, who died in 1931. ``He always said how much he hated
trousers,'' Hancock recalls _ not wearing them, but sculpting them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course a sculptor of nonrepresentational subjects needn't
grapple with the drape of a pant leg. Hancock came of age along
with abstraction, but the style was not for him. ``I had good
friends among abstract sculptors,'' he says, ``and found myself in
agreement with them intellectually. But my heart wasn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart'' is what his sculpture has that much other contemporary
realist work lacks. Figurative sculpture is currently at a low
point. And Cape Ann has become as much a magnet for second-rate
derivative sculpture as Monet's Giverny was _ and still is _ for
second-rate derivative painting. Lane himself is the subject of an
appalling sculpture recently installed in Gloucester, a clumsy,
smarmy bronze portrait parked right beside Lane's hilltop house.
The bronzed Birkenstocks of the statue's maker, the late Alfred
Duca, are placed nearby, along with the inscribed suggestion that
you ``Step into my shoes and become inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, in both modesty and grace, is Hancock's
own ``Triton,'' in the corner of Glouces-ter's Stage Fort Park that
is dedicated to the late Elizabeth Gordon Smith, the much-loved
founder of the Gloucester Civic and Garden Council. The whole
sculpture is one smooth arc, from the triton's upturned flippers to
the conch shell he blows to make sounds that, according to myth,
can control the wild movements of the sea. ``Triton'' is hardly
radical _ Hancock's work has never been about aesthetic revolution
_ but it's beautiful and believable.

SOFTWARE LACKS ABILITY TO TRACK SMALL PORTFOLIOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Can you write something about software available to small
investors? I would like to have a better understanding of the math
involved when you discuss returns on investments. What spreadsheets
do you use to keep track of your investments?
</P>
<P>
   L.S., Colton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have touched on one of my great frustrations _ the
inability to find computer software that suits me to track small
portfolios. I now use Quicken Version 4.0 for Windows _ and I am
underwhelmed. Some of my complaints are minor _ for example, the
process of deleting old market price figures is clumsy and
time-consuming. But, more important, Quicken wants its program to
monitor my entire financial life, not just a few portfolios, and I
am continually required to compensate for its desires to balance a
stock portfolio with other accounts and functions I am not using.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried a number of other portfolio-tracking software
packages, but they have all been tied to market quote services that
I would have to buy; to assure that cheapskates like me don't
ignore the service, the only way to enter market prices is through
the automatic download over the Internet. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   For a time some years back, I subscribed to America Online,
which offered an easy, albeit superficial, portfolio tracking
system. To me, that one strong feature was insufficient to
compensate for other frustrations I encountered with AOL, so I
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   I would be delighted to hear if some reader knows of an elegant
software package that allows you to track an investment portfolio
without paying for an on-line quote service or being a part of a
more complex package.
</P>
<P>
   My most indispensable tool for financial projections is a
program called Interest Vision from Parsons Technology (available
for $24.95 at www.parsonstech.com). I usually use an old edition
called Interest Vision Special Edition, which came free with an
income tax software package years ago. Last year I bought Interest
Vision 2.0, which is the one they're now selling, and the
improvements seem to be minimal. The program does save me hours
over the time I once spent with a hand-held financial analysis
calculator.
</P>
<P>
   For calculations involving effects of projected inflation, I go
on line to a site at www.hetherman.com/tools/
</P>
<P>
   inflatnc.html. Another site provides a record of historical
inflation and its effects on money during historical periods:
www.westegg.com/inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For market quotes, trading histories, and general information on
individual stocks, I use the Infoseek Financial Channel, but almost
any search engine will have a prominent source for such market
information.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for spreadsheets, I use the spreadsheet function that
came with Microsoft Works of many years ago. I know it's probably
similar to a quill pen when compared to more modern programs, but
it works.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are both 43, and our combined yearly income
is $160,000. We have no children and have not focused on our
retirement until recently. I have a 403(b) account through my
employer, which provides a menu of Fidelity funds for investment. I
have $22,000 in Fidelity Contrafund, $12,000 in Fidelity Growth and
Income, $5,000 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, and $5,000 in Fidelity
Select Health Care. My husband is self-employed and has just opened
a SEP account, putting $4,000 in Oakmark fund. In addition, we have
IRAs of $13,000 in Fidelity Contrafund, $18,000 in Fidelity Growth
and Income, and $4,000 in the Schwab 1000 fund.
</P>
<P>
   Could you comment on our assortment of funds. My employer adds
$90 a week to my 403(b) account, and we can add a further $100 a
week to these investments. We expect to retire in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   B.N., Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's no major problem with your fund selections, but there
is a different problem _ you're not putting enough in them. It's
not clear from your letter whether you expect to add a total of
$100 a week to your savings and whether you plan to maintain annual
contributions of $4,000 to your husband's SEP account.
</P>
<P>
   Using the best case, I combined $100 weekly from you, $90 a week
from your employer, and $4,000 annually for your husband's SEP
account _ for a total of $1,156.66 a month. Over the course of 25
years, an investment program starting at $83,000 with these
contributions would grow to $2,326,821, presuming 10 percent
average annual growth.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound OK _ although not terrific for people whose
living standard is based on $160,000 annual income. But it gets
worse. During each of those 25 years you can count on inflation
gnawing away at the buying power of your nest egg. If we presume 3
percent average annual inflation for that period, your buying power
shrinks to $1,111,302 in today's money; if we presume 4 percent
inflation, the figure falls to $872,829. You might expect that
latter number to produce an income stream of about $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this is simply that you need to save more _ at
least twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   Now, getting back to your fund choices, they're all good funds.
But like many current investors, you have a portfolio heavily
dominated by the large caps _ Fidelity's Contrafund, Growth and
Income, Oakmark, and Schwab 1000 fund all concentrate their
investments in the large-cap area. Fidelity Low-Priced Stock and
Health Care represent a good start at diversification, but you need
to go further, building each of those holdings to 10 percent of the
portfolio and adding funds such as Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock and
Fidelity Overseas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I have approximately $34,000 in Franklin US
Government Securities fund. We also have a $7,500 CD, which earns
6.1 percent interest and which matures in December of 2000. Would
it be better to cash out the CD now, adding the amount to the
Franklin account, or just leave it alone? The early withdrawal
penalty is 90 days' interest, which doesn't seem like much compared
to the increased yield.
</P>
<P>
   K.D., Poway, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's not much to gain. Ignoring sales changes for the
mutual fund, let's just do the math. Morningstar Mutual Funds lists
the yield on Franklin US Government Securities fund at 6.9 percent.
If you left your $7,500 in the CD for 28 months, it would grow to
$8,615.03. If you cashed out, paying $114.38 in penalties, you
would have $7,385.62 to put in the Franklin fund. At 6.9 percent
interest, that would grow to $8,634.63 over the course of 28
months, giving you a theoretical gain of $19.60.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even if there were no issue of a sales charge, it seems to
me that when you compare the federal deposit insurance that stands
behind the CD with the market uncertainty that applies to a mutual
fund, the loss of $19.60 is immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, of course, there is the sales load. Franklin tells me
that the effective yield on a new purchase _ which means that the
yield adjusted for the 4.5 percent sales charge _ is 6.17 percent.
If you invested $7,385.62 for 28 months at 6.17 percent, you would
end up with $8,496.79 _ $118.24 less than you'd have by holding the
CD.

GONE, BABY, GONE 
By Dennis Lehane 
Morrow, 374 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isaac Asimov once said that writing a mystery is simple: Devise
a situation that can be explained in more than one way, build a
case for one of those ways, and at the end, reveal the ``truth'' to
be different.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, perhaps, but not easy, because each scenario, especially
the feint, has to be believable, or there's no sale. Therein lies
the difficulty in Boston writer Dennis Lehane's fourth novel.
Lehane is clever with words, and can paint a good scene, but too
often in ``Gone, Baby, Gone,'' the reader is left with the sense
that it wouldn't have gone that way.
</P>
<P>
   When private detectives Angie Gennaro and Patrick Kenzie want to
review every local TV station's coverage of the kidnapping they
have just agreed to investigate, for example, they ring up a guy
Angie dated at New England Cable News, and he sends them by
overnight express. Not just NECN's tape, but all eight stations'.
He just had them. ``Don't ask me how he pulled this off,'' narrator
Kenzie says, anticipating the obvious question _ but, well, how
else are they going to get their first lead?
</P>
<P>
   Amanda McCready is the girl who has been kidnapped, snatched
from her bed one night while her mother is over at a friend's
watching television, or out stealing $200,000 from drug dealers.
It's the highest-profile case around here since the abortion-clinic
shootings: vows from the mayor, bulletins every hour, squads of
police pulling overtime trying to rescue the 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such intense investigating, Amanda's aunt and uncle come
to Kenzie and Gennaro, undeterred by the detectives' ``pretty steep
rates,'' even though Uncle Lionel's just a blue-collar guy
delivering for UPS and living in Dorchester. The private eyes are
reluctant, not wanting to bankrupt them, and not wanting to find a
dead child.
</P>
<P>
   While deliberating, they encounter the cop leading the chase.
Ordinarily, as any mystery reader knows, the police despise
meddling by outsiders, especially private detectives, but this
one's different. He not only registers merely the mildest of
objections, he assigns a couple of liaison officers. (They'll come
to you, he tells our heroes!) From then on, Kenzie and Gennaro
function as if on the force, brandishing their guns, holding
discovered loot in their own private evidence lock-up, even
conducting an illegal black-bag operation with police involvement.
Yeah right, you might think _ but, well, how else will they, and
the reader, keep up with the case?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions keep arising, and they're particularly
disappointing because ``Gone, Baby, Gone'' is otherwise delightful
reading. Lehane describes a leading bad guy, for example, as a
freak of nurture. And when a policeman removes a stick of gum from
its foil wrapper, the sound is ``like teeth on my spine,'' a fresh
allusion that elicits a shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane is adept not only describing situations but at creating
them. It's amusing to see Amanda's mother plop down in front of the
TV at a crime scene, zoning out to Jerry Springer while two expired
pieces of white trash rot away in the next room. Just outside, a
neighbor is beating a rug with the shaft of a hockey stick, its
blade no longer attached. The image has the feel of Charlestown,
exemplifying Lehane's thorough grasp on his backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Insider references abound, such as when Kenzie, while bragging
on the Old Colony housing project in Southie, mentions its
teen-suicide problem. A local cop justifies not bringing the FBI
into the kidnapping because they're such screw-ups, like when they
``cut insane deals with the Boston mob.'' And then there's this
pithy offering to the Chamber of Commerce: ``Boston: We're small,
we're cold, but we'll kill for a good parking space. Come on up.
Bring the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Such touchstones are fun, even if they sometimes give pause.
Lehane says up front in an author's note that he has deliberately
taken liberties while describing local particulars. So when the
scene shifts to the Granite Rail Quarry in Quincy, for instance,
some local readers might ask if that's one of the real places, or
one of the made-up ones. (It's real.) And you have to wonder when
Lehane refers to John Salvi's abortion-clinic bombings, when
practically everyone knows he used a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   If your disbelief is easily suspended, there's enough in ``Gone,
Baby, Gone'' to warrant staying up late with it on a summer's
evening. Ultimately, though, the mystery of a mystery ought to be
in the story, not in why the author thought the story was
believable.

SUIT TARGETS NYC CHILD WELFARE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two-and-a-half years ago, at age 63, Nicholas
Scoppetta quit his $400,000-a-year law practice to take one of the
most harrowing jobs in New York City government _ head of the
child-welfare agency, a bureaucratic maze responsible for
protecting 42,000 children in foster care and an additional 53,000
allegedly neglected or abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of friends who say, `Why are you taking this
on?''' Scoppetta acknowledged, sitting at his desk in an aptly
ramshackle building in lower Manhattan. ``I'm not saying it's not
wearing, but it feels so right doing this. It does feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to these feelings is a 5- by 8-inch file card, framed
and tucked away in a corner of his office. Dated March 18, 1938,
and marked ``Case No. 1,145,155,'' it's the Rosebud sled of
Nicholas Scoppetta's life _ the official documentation of his own
time as a foster child.
</P>
<P>
   From age 4 1/2 to 12, the entirety of his formative years,
Scoppetta lived with 120 other boys in an orphanage-like foster
home in the Bronx called Woodycrest. Clearly, his taking this job
now, and the passion with which he pursues it, stem from that
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my wife the therapist often says,'' Scoppetta remarked with
a smile, ``what I'm feeling is _ I'm feeling very sorry for that
little 5-year-old who went into Woodycrest. Obviously, there's some
personal identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next month, his mission of self-redemption could be
derailed. Marcia Robinson Lowry, executive director of Children's
Rights Inc., is suing Scoppetta's agency _ charging it with
incurable mismanagement _ and demanding that its work be turned
over to a new director appointed and monitored by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A trial is scheduled for Sept. 16, though the two sides are
discussing a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Both Scoppetta's appointment and Lowry's lawsuit were brought on
by the same little girl _ 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, who in
November 1995 was murdered by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Elisa's death shocked the city. A bright, charming girl who had
just won a scholarship to a private school, she was repeatedly
brutalized by her mother. The city's child-welfare inspector, who
visited her home regularly because of past complaints, did not
notice the warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dealt with the shock by removing child
welfare from the city's labyrinthine Human Resources Department,
and creating an independent agency to be headed by Scoppetta _ whom
he knew from their years as prosecutors in the US attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry dealt with the Izquierdo case by suing the city, as she
had sued several other cities for poor child-welfare practices.
</P>
<P>
   Like Scoppetta, Lowry has been involved in New York's
foster-care system, but from the other side of the table, working
as special assistant to Barbara Blum, the child-welfare
commissioner in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was called a `reform commissioner,' too,'' Lowry recalled.
``I got quite an eyeful. Very depressing but extremely educational.
... There was very little I could really do _ anyone can really do
_ on the inside, so I moved to a position where I could exert
pressure from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a '60s liberal,'' she said with a smile. ``I went to law
school to help people. I believe courts are the last refuge of the
powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoppetta wants the lawsuit dismissed, arguing that his new
agency has just initiated a package of reforms. He has hired 1,200
new caseworkers, improved training, computerized the filing system,
and will soon decentralize the system so foster children are kept
in the same neighborhoods as their parents' homes, to minimize the
trauma of disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry waves aside his reform plan, saying it has no provisions
for measuring success or failure. She also cites official
documents, complaining that the new computer system is a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he's a good person,'' Lowry said of Scoppetta. ``But
I don't think that matters. It may even be a problem _ because he
can lull people into thinking, `Well, he's a good person, so things
must be getting better.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the city's own records, deaths of children being
monitored by the agency went up last year _ from 26 to 33 _ and, to
Lowry, that's what matters.
</P>
<P>
   However, some other children's advocates hesitate to put the
blame entirely on the city agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice Manshel of the New Jersey Juvenile Justice Commission,
and a former director of that state's child-welfare agency, said:
``Social problems aren't going to be solved by a child-welfare
agency. All a child-welfare agency can try to do is pick up the
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Scoppetta was a foster child in a very
different time. Woodycrest, he recalled in a wistful, even
nostalgic tone, ``was a big Gothic structure with a big courtyard.
We had a gym, a swimming pool, lived in dorms. It was an immaculate
facility. Every Saturday, the older kids did this housekeeping that
you wouldn't believe _ waxed and buffed, scrubbed down the
bathrooms. I went to school in Woodycrest, played in the courtyard.
Yankee Stadium was right across the street and you could hear the
sounds of the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he often wonders if such institutions _ which have been
abandoned, in favor of placing foster children into families _
might work today. ``It might be easier to have 15 to 20 excellent
staff to take care of 120 kids,'' he said, ``than to find 120
excellent foster homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he quickly added, ``my advisers shoot me down on this.
There's absolutely no support for large institutions as an
approach, philosophically.''
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between now and then, as he sees it, is
social. ``We were kids of the Depression,'' he said of his
generation of foster children. ``We were kids who, for economic
reasons, needed someone to feed them and take care of them. Today,
75 percent of our foster kids come from families with substance
abuse. That complicates matters enormously. These kids come from
much more troubled backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The population of foster children in New York City nearly
tripled in the late 1980s, the era of the crack epidemic, and
agencies shuffled them into homes with more speed than care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though many children's advocates agree with Lowry's
critique of Scoppetta's agency, they question her solution of
turning everything over to a court-appointed receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of a receiver,'' said Carolyn Kubitschek, president
of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, ``is that
the boss is doing a bad job and there's somebody you can put there
who can do a better job. The problem is, it's just a terrible
agency, they do a terrible job. Nobody who's put there does a
particularly good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubitschek noted that in Washington, D.C., where Lowry won a
similar lawsuit, ``the child-welfare system hasn't improved by
being put under a receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover some of Scoppetta's new ideas have won the concurrence
even of pessimistic reformers.
</P>
<P>
   Manshel recently attended a workshop where a private company,
hired by Scoppetta, demonstrated new techniques they are using to
train New York City child-welfare case workers. ``The training
sounded great,'' Manshel said. ``They were dealing with very
concrete, insightful ways of how to see danger signs in the homes
they're inspecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' she added, ``someone asked when they'd be training
the foster-care staff _ the people who make the decisions on when
kids go back to their parents. And they said, `Oh, we're not
getting to that level for three years.'''
</P>
<P>
   Manshel let out something between a laugh and a sigh. ``They're
trying real hard,'' she said. ``Meanwhile, terrible things are
happening. It takes a long time to do anything right in this
field.''

WHAT KEEPS HEARTS BEATING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do hearts beat?
</P>
<P>
   B.D., Dublin, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That simple question requires a detailed answer.
</P>
<P>
   Let's let Dr. Peter Friedman, electrophysiologist in the cardiac
department of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, give us a
tour of the heart and explain its vital mechanism:
</P>
<P>
   The heart beat starts in a clump of special cells called the
sinoatrial (SA) node in the top right corner of your heart.
</P>
<P>
   These pacemaker cells are special because they leak. One leak in
the cell membrane lets positively-charged sodium ions (atoms of
sodium that have lost one or more of their electrons) flow in. Just
down the cell wall, another lets positively-charged potassium ions
flow out.
</P>
<P>
   The outer membranes of most of the cells in your body, including
these pacemaker cells, are like whiffle balls, perforated with
passageways specialized to let certain things in and out. But those
passageways are usually closed. They open only when triggered to do
so by some chemical signal.
</P>
<P>
   Pacemaker cells are different. Their passageways for sodium and
potassium open on their own, with no `external' commands. And they
do it all the time; they're built to leak. That's the key.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the pacemaker cell, where the positively-charged sodium
ions leak in, the electrical charge gets more positive. Think of it
as a group of little plus signs, with more and more plus signs
joining in. Right next to that, where the potassium is leaking out,
plus signs are leaving and the charge gets less positive.
Eventually the difference between the more positively-charged spot
with extra plus signs, and the less positively-charged spot with
fewer plus signs, gets big enough that, in essence, it creates a
spark. That's called an action potential. And then things are off
to the races.
</P>
<P>
   The action potential spreads throughout rest of the cell. All
over the cell wall, more sodium and potassium channels rapidly
open. That causes the whole cell to put out an even bigger
``spark,'' triggering neighboring pacemaker cells to do the same
thing. Almost instantaneously, the whole SA node is sending out a
strong electrical charge.
</P>
<P>
   The charge travels in milliseconds to the heart's muscle cells,
where it tell proteins to make the muscle contract. Special tight
connections between all heart muscle cells let the electrical
charge flow through at pretty much at the same instant. Which is
why they all contract in unison.
</P>
<P>
   But why, if everything happens at once, is the heart beat a
``lub-dub?'' Why not just a ``lub'' or a ``dub?''
</P>
<P>
   The heart has two chambers on the top, a right and left atrium,
and two larger ones below, a right and left ventricle. The
electrical charge racing down from the SA node hits the atria
first, and they contract, squeezing the oxygen-depleted blood
entering the right atrium from elsewhere in the body, and the
freshly-oxygenated blood entering the left atrium from the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   But the signal runs into a little roadblock on its way down to
trigger the ventricles. It has to go through some special relay
cells that are designed to hold things up. They take a tiny
fraction of a second longer to reach their action potential, fire,
and send the signal down to the lower half of the heart. That delay
gives the muscles up in the atrium a moment to squeeze the blood
that's come in and build up pressure. Finally that pressure forces
valves open and the blood rushes down into the ventricles. The
``lub'' is the sound of those valves closing.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same time, the electrical charge, having triggered
those relay cells, gets sent along to the ventricles. But though
the charge comes in at the top, it doesn't hit any muscle cells in
the upper part of the ventricles. Instead, special nerves carry it
straight to the bottom. The charge then starts spreading up, and
the muscles of the large ventricles contract, bottom-to-top, like
rolling up a tube of toothpaste starting at the end.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; That squeezes the oxygenated blood from the top of the left
ventricle out to the body, and the oxygen-depleted blood from the
top of the right ventricle on toward the lungs to freshen up. When
the blood's gone and the ventricular valves close, that's ``dub.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on an average adult heart beat of 72 per minute, that
whole incredible process happened about 200 times while you were
reading this!

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although they pack little of the fast-moving drama of tornadoes,
blizzards or hurricanes, floods are America's deadliest weather
disasters, killing on average 141 people a year _ more than all the
violent windstorms combined.
</P>
<P>
   And though inundations can usually be predicted many hours or
even days ahead of time, unlike tornadoes and some other freak
weather events, flooding forecasts have sometimes fallen short _
most spectacularly in last year's deluge that wiped out Grand
Forks, N.D. Better warnings, experts agree, would offer enormous
benefits to residents, farmers and business owners in low-lying
riverfront lands.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, an elaborate new model for forecasting river floods
developed by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor has
drawn considerable interest from federal officials, who think it
could yield much timelier, more accurate flood alerts.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael L. Bras, chairman of MIT's civil and environmental
engineering department, will receive a substantial NASA grant next
month to test and perfect his model, which crunches hundreds of
times more data than standard models and also factors in hilliness
and local soil composition to determine when and where river basins
might flood.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service is also planning to compare it to
current models and see what aspects could be incorporated in them.
</P>
<P>
   Driven in part by wild El Nino-related weather, 1998 has proven
a devastating year for floods in the US. Two Wisconsin boys were
swept into a creek and drowned this month. Flooding in June storms
left 23 dead or missing around the country, including a
four-month-old and a blind man in a wheelchair swept away in West
Virginia. March storms claimed five lives in Alabama, and floods
after torrential February rains in California were blamed for seven
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Flood deaths are much less frequent in New England than the
South or Midwest, but in the last two years, Massachusetts has been
hit by two major inundations that sent raw sewage pouring into the
Charles and other rivers, including this past June's storms.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, the Weather Service operates 13 river
forecast centers that monitor river levels at about 4,000 places,
including about 30 in southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the predictions treat river basins as the
equivalent of one big sponge whose water content depends on the
last 10 days of rain. New rainfall is measured in six-hour chunks
to evaluate when and if rivers might start to flood.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious drawbacks, Weather Service officials
acknowledge. Their standard model does not differentiate, for
example, between six hours of steady drizzle or a sudden downpour,
which might be much more likely to trigger a flood.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it consider where the rain is falling _ on a steep
hillside, a heavily developed urban area with non-porous streets
and parking lots, or sandy fields that drain quickly.
</P>
<P>
   All of those shortcomings can be addressed, however, in Bras's
model, which he has tested in Italy's Sieve River basin near
Florence. He hopes to evaluate it in several US river basins over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bras's model can get into much finer detail by taking readings
from the Weather Service's new NEXRAD high-resolution radar to
estimate rainfall in each 1.5-square-mile region within a river
basin every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then it correlates that rain data to digital maps showing the
prevailing topography, soil types, and soil saturation within each
region. High-powered computers crunch all the numbers to determine
how much rain is likely to be running off those regions into the
river, and even forecast where within a basin flooding is
likeliest.
</P>
<P>
   In technical terms, Bras's approach is known as a ``distributed
model,'' taking lots of observations in space and time, as opposed
to the ``lumped parameter'' models the Weather Service uses that
treat a river basin as one big spot getting one big splash of rain
every six hours. The government of Italy, the Weather Service, and
the US Army have all provided research grants over the last six
years to help him develop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting project that will help guide the types of
models we do in the future,'' said Michael Smith, a research
hydrologist at the US Weather Service's Silver Spring, Md., office,
who has collaborated with Bras. ``It runs all the equations on a
much finer scale than we are able to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   A major open question, as Bras agrees, is whether the Weather
Service could run the enormously complicated calculations quickly
enough to warn residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a computational cost, and the potential for
overwhelming a computer system or slowing it down,'' Smith said.
Agreed Robert Shedd of the Northeast River Forecast Center &UR;  &LR; in
Taunton, Mass.: ``Being able to implement it in an operational
setting becomes a much bigger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service does not get a lot of criticism for
bad flood forecasting _ though it understandably becomes a whipping
boy after dramatic, once-in-a-lifetime disaster such as the North
Dakota floods of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As early as February, two full months before the flooding Red
River of the North wiped out Grand Forks, N.D., and sister city
East Grand Forks, Minn., sending 59,000 residents fleeing, the
Weather Service was warning of record floods as the snow melted.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota governor Ed Schafer promptly declared a statewide
emergency and urged residents of low-lying areas to buy flood
insurance. Through March and April, Minneapolis-based hydrologists
predicted the river would crest at 49 feet and spread far out into
the cookie-sheet flat terrain.
</P>
<P>
   By April 14, after a blizzard dumped major rain and snow on the
region, the Weather Service began ramping its predictions upward.
By April 18, it was predicting a 54-foot flood crest, which indeed
came three days later, but contradicted the 49-foot prediction
local officials had been counting on for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The angry mayor of East Grand Forks, Lynn Stauss, told a crowd
of evacuees: ``They missed it, and they not only missed it, they
blew it big.'' Stauss later backed off those harsh charges.
</P>
<P>
   What Weather Service forecasters learned from the Red River
disaster was that submerged bridges will act as dams, aggravating
flooding, and the piling of sandbags on levees actually made the
river rise higher still and flow faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the computer could not calculate was the impact of
sandbags and bridges on the flow,'' Minnesota-based Weather Service
hydrologist Dean Braatz said. ``Neither had ever been factors
before (because) we've never had water that high before.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar complaints followed unexpectedly bad floods near
Pittsburgh in January 1996 and Los Angeles's Sepulveda Basin in
February 1992. And, of course, the Weather Service gets blasted for
forecasts that later prove too dire as well.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in February 1997, Van Buren, Ark., port officials
complained that a forecast led them to scramble to bring in crews
to spend four feverish hours raising levees along the Arkansas
River before forecasters dropped their predictions of the flood
crest by 3 1/2 feet. Two soybean farmers complained that they had
ruined a combine harvester they tried to drive through flooded
roads to escape a flood that never came.
</P>
<P>
   Without more testing, it is not clear whether Bras's model would
avoid failings such as those, but Weather Service and other
officials think it has major promise.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, flood forecast complaints have been rare. ``At
least here in southern New England, we've got a great track record,
an excellent model,'' said David R. Vallee, a senior hydrologist at
the Weather Service's Taunton office, which includes a forecast
center covering New England and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times we get behind the 8-ball are when we have very
heavy, very hard hitting, and very long-lasting rains, or heavy
snow melt. That's very hard to predict,'' Vallee said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Weather Service can offer only limited predictions along
Massachusetts rivers. For example, flood warnings for the Assabet,
Concord, Charles, and Neponset are based on readings from single
flood gauges in Maynard, Lowell, Dover, and Norwood, which may not
reflect the possibility of localized floods in other communities.
</P>
<P>
   Bras, who won a $50,000 National Water Research Institute prize
earlier this year for his work in hydrology and has published two
textbooks and more than 100 journal articles, said as interested as
he is in improving forecasts, he hopes he can also get better media
publicity for existing flood warnings.

PLEASE NOTE, PARK'S THEME IS POLITENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLAUS, Ind. _ Even in howdy Hoosier land, the Koch family
does not take good manners for granted.
</P>
<P>
   At orientation sessions each spring, the Koches' employees spend
an hour on politeness. They practice saying please and thank you,
hello and goodbye. They work on their smiles. By midsummer, the
``bless you'' offered sneezing customers is automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The Koch family prides itself on owning the friendliest
amusement park in the nation. Now it's official. The latest issue
of Amusement Today, a trade publication, awarded Holiday World and
Splashin' Safari a ``Golden Ticket'' for having a staff even
friendlier than the Disney folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a rural area, so I think people are naturally more
relaxed, less jaded,'' said Will Koch, Holiday World president,
whose family has owned and operated the park for three generations.
``Plus we work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who has 850 employees, most of them 14 to 19 years old,
said the honor is especially gratifying. Teenagers will be
teenagers, even in rural southern Indiana. They can be moody or
unintentionally mean. The other day one insisted on counting a
little girl's dropped ball as an official toss at one of the park's
games. Her father complained. Koch refunded his money with a smile
and made a mental note to talk to the teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through the park, Koch pointed to an older woman as an
example of the kind of employee who makes the park hum.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a broom with a dustpan, and laden with cleaning
supplies, the woman was sweeping trash with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, mom,'' Koch said to her.
</P>
<P>
   Six days a week, sometimes seven, Pat Koch is at Holiday World.
She figures that her young employees will be more willing to work
for their money, about $5.50 an hour, when they see that menial
chores are not beneath the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to be in the Midwest, where people still wave
at each other and say `hi' to strangers,'' said Pat Koch. ``But
even we, well ... this is the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   At that she laughed warmly, implying that her patience can be
worn thin by crying children and complaining parents. Not that she
would ever show it in the park. As her son explained, ``When you
deal with the public, you have to make a decision that whatever
they dish out, you'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Koch family has been dealing with the public since 1946,
when it opened the nation's first theme park and called it Santa
Claus Land, after the rides celebrating Christmas and the town
where children still send their postcards filled with wishes every
December. In 1984, they added Halloween and the Fourth of July,
with rides to match, and renamed the place Holiday World. Six years
ago, Surfin' Safari, a water park packed with slides and
interactive adventures, went up beside it.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion has paid off in customers. More than 500,000
people a year visit the 100-acre park, which is surrounded by
forest and farmland and not visible from any major highway. Will
Koch said five times more people visit the park now than in 1975.
Most of them come by car, from within a three-hour radius. The
season runs from May to October.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the park has added more restaurants, concert
dates, and rides to help keep the waiting times short, usually
under 15 minutes. One of the new rides is a $2 million roller
coaster that Amusement Today named the second-best in the world.
Monsoon Lagoon, a tree house of sorts that offers 60 ways to get
wet, was added this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Inside Track, a newspaper for roller coaster
enthusiasts, named Holiday World's staff second friendliest in its
annual poll. Now Amusement Today has made them No. 1 for the first
time. The Koch family, which has resisted selling their business to
a corporation, takes the kudos personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who hires teenagers knows how tough it can be to find
the right ones,'' said Will Koch. ``But kids like it here because
it's a real social environment. It's better than sitting on a
lawnmower all day. Hopefully, that shows in their attitude.''

INDEPENDENT VOTE IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM FOR CELLUCCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Instead of looking ahead toward his November election
battle with Democratic gubernatorial front-runner Scott
Harshbarger, it might be more prudent for Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci to look back over his shoulder at GOP primary rival Joseph
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Cellucci is having a harder-than-expected time
against Malone is Cellucci's recent budget cuts. They may be
appealing to some conservative GOP voters, but they have alienated
those voters who, while often voting Democratic in the past, this
year were considing backing the GOP candidate. Anger over the
budget cuts has sent them scurrying back to the Democratic fold.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the likelihood that independent voters _ upon
whom Cellucci depends _ are going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   These are the voters who are largely responsible for former
governor William Weld's election victories over the years, and
Cellucci needs them in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   But many independent voters this year are attracted to other hot
primary contests _ sucn as the 8th Congressional District seat that
is being vacated this year by US Representative Joseph P. Kennedy
II.
</P>
<P>
   The winner among the 10 Democrats in the primary is likely to be
victorious in November.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who decide to cast ballots in the Democratic primary will
not be able to vote for any GOP candidate in the primary, be it in
the gubernatorial or congressional contests.
</P>
<P>
   Another race that could pull Cellucci's potential independent
vote away from the GOP side of the primary ballot is the bitter
battle for state attorney general between District Attorney Thomas
Reilly and State Senator Lois Pines. Many independent voters have
strong feelings toward each candidate, and they may decide to vote
in the Democratic primary for their choice, leaving them out of the
GOP gubernatorial primary.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hotly contested Democratic primary for Middlesex County
district attorney is attracting the interest of independent voters,
further enhancing the possibility that Cellucci's potential base of
support will instead vote in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just hot Democratic primary contests that are
responsible for Cellucci's apparent voter emigration problems.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, sentiment in Lynn is any indication, Cellucci's
budget cuts have created more for himself than he realizes.
</P>
<P>
   The reading of political tea leaves in Lynn goes like this:
Several elected officials in Lynn openly supported Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Patricia McGovern at the party's June
convention. Presuming she loses to Harshbarger in the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, at least some of those voters would have
likely gone over to Cellucci in November, rather than align
themselves with Harshbarger, McGovern's primary foe.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario is now less likely because Lynn residents are
irritated at Cellucci over his budget cuts. Those cuts cost the
city $400,000 to repair a popular ball field in Lynn and $1.5
million to fix a seawall in the city. The cuts also robbed Lynn
lawmakers of the ability to get political mileage out of the money
they brought home to the city. In short, Cellucci's cuts alienated
both Democratic officials and independent voters in the city.
</P>
<P>
   All Harshbarger has to do, noted one political strategist, is go
into cities such as Lynn and remind voters that Cellucci took away
their field, their seawall, and other important amenities simply
for his own political self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   As for Malone, he has continued to blast Cellucci in recent
advertisements, suggesting that Cellucci's appointments are
evidence that he is more Democratic than Republican. Malone is
hoping that these ads resonate with the hard-core GOP electorate
that may be a decisive factor in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   While he would be wise to focus on his battle with Malone for
the GOP nomination, Cellucci cannot afford to totally ignore
Harshbarger's candidacy. In a recent poll that included, among
other issues, questions of voter preference toward Harshbarger and
Cellucci, Harshbarger had 37 percent and Cellucci 35, a virtual
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   For an incumbent governor to be in a tie with a challenger at
this stage of the election does not bode well for Cellucci. Worse,
any time an incumbent is below 50 percent in voter support in the
polls, he is at least politically vulnerable. If the polls have
Cellucci under 40 percent, as does this one, he has real problems
to solve before November.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next four weeks, Cellucci had better focus on
defeating his GOP challenger running hard behind him, or he may be
seeing Malone's back as they sprint to the finish line in the
Republican primary.

 UNDATED: ... of my own.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a punk I must have seemed to him, with my moral indignation
and my college allowance! I knew young men who fled to Canada; from
the antiwar hotbed of Austin, Texas, I counseled others on how to
avoid the draft, then flew home for the holidays to embarrass my
father by bringing up Vietnam in front of guests. While my own
position about US involvement in Vietnam was flushed with both
dovish sentiment and youthful political analysis, my father's
defense of our presence there was simple old-school patriotism and
old-style manliness. You went where you were told; you fought the
good fight (it was good because it was American); then you came
home and never mentioned it again.
</P>
<P>
   Some three decades later, I doubt either of our stances has
softened much. I only partly regret my naivete and incendiary
anger, not at all my idealism; he, less introspective than I, is
content if the stock market holds and his tax bill stays the same.
Nowadays the phone calls and visits are sweet with memories and an
old love unshaken by any war. We are the retired master sergeant
and his pacifist daughter, remembering not the fury between us, but
the spelling bees and sixth-grade pageants that preceded them.
</P>
<P>
   That is the twilight blessing of parental aging, and so now my
heart can swell at the photos of my father in uniform, going off to
a war where _ I have only just learned _ he slept with a knife
under his pillow every night, where every night he said the same
simple prayer before he went to sleep: ``Dear Lord, thank thee for
letting me be alive today.'' Three years ago, he told me that
sometimes the helmets of dead soldiers wound up at the supply depot
in Blackpool, where it was his unit's job to clean them up; to
clean off the blood and sometimes brains and send them out again.
That same night, he said he had opted for a slow boat home at the
end of the war, even though the choice kept him in England for an
extra month. He had become afraid to fly: ``That'll happen to you,
after you've seen a test pilot jump from a burning plane with his
arm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   My imagination's passion about war has grown out of a more
sheltered existence, cemented in the past two decades by the
cultural iconography that followed Vietnam: books by Robert Stone
and Michael Herr and Tim O'Brien, movies like ``Apocalypse Now''
and ``Full Metal Jacket,'' like ``Platoon'' and ``Casualties of
War.'' And though I've seen and read what must be hundreds of
depictions of World War II, never have those dual sensibilities so
emotionally merged for me as they did that afternoon in ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' If Spielberg has created in many ways an
old-fashioned, sentimental war movie, he's nonetheless done so with
his signature stamp of the immensity of history. Thanks to those
first 28 minutes alone, the nobility of the film is far greater
than the sum of its cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the power of cinema is that it does our creative work
for us: Unlike the case in prose, where the journey realized is one
of intensely personal interpretation, we're bombarded in the movies
with visual fanfare that often overwhelms the imagination. At its
best, the medium has the magnitude to deliver myth from 3 feet
away. That's the way I felt during the opening minutes of
Spielberg's reenactment of Omaha Beach, when the men in the landing
craft are simply trying to outlive their fear. The dread I felt
(``I wanted the audience to be fairly uneasy,'' Spielberg has said
about this sequence, in grand understatement) is endemic to all
war; even as I was overcome with that knowledge, I was glimpsing my
younger self's limited comprehension of it _ a girl-woman's
presumption that walking point in an unjust war in Vietnam was
somehow worse than gaining 50 feet of ground on a beach swimming in
seawater and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, youth is stunning in its solipsistic sense of
originality: Strutting around 30 years ago in an old flight jacket
that alarmingly resembled the one Tom Hanks wears in the movie, I
must have believed my generation was the first to discover
individual terror and unfair sacrifice. Perhaps I am being too hard
on myself: These are, after all, the insights that come with having
outlived your earlier, coltish self. But if ``Saving Private Ryan''
forced such fleeting wisdom from me that afternoon, it's partly
because Spielberg (who is roughly my age) has made a World War II
movie with a post-Vietnam sensibility. Not the ironic, death-knell
cynicism that accompanied that war, but instead the somber, graphic
instruction that the cost of war cannot be allayed by principle or
heroic oratory. That, as George C. Marshall and Abraham Lincoln
knew so well, no words of consolation are possible for a torso
lying on a beach in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg could not have known this, or at least filmed it, at
any earlier point in American history. And while it's true that the
rest of ``Saving Private Ryan'' can't live up to its first
half-hour, that round-trip ticket to Normandy, for much of its
audience, may have given us access to a world of courage and
suffering we would otherwise never have _ one our fathers couldn't
really talk about, cannot but would just as soon forget. That
night, after seeing the movie and calling my father in Texas, I
remembered a letter I'd received years ago, in response to a piece
I'd written about Vietnam movies. It was from a retired Air Force
captain who had served in both the Second World War and Korea, and
he admonished me for mourning the comparatively slight losses of
Vietnam. He went on at some length, told me I didn't know what I
was talking about, and called me, among other things, a Young Turk.
I didn't agree with him, but I wrote him back. And I kept the
letter.

   OTTAWA _ The new Canadian census shows that minorities now make
up about a third of the population of Toronto and Vancouver. French
speakers in Quebec continue to argue about whether they have a
place in Canada. The grand chief of the Crees is arguing that the
Indian band has a right to secede from Quebec if the province
leaves Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity debate is raging in Canada. But not only there.
Turkish students are protesting the ban against head scarfs at
secular Istanbul University. President Clinton has spent much of
his second term trying to cultivate a conversation on race.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of the last years of the century _ and,
undoubtedly, the early years of the next century _ may be simple to
express but difficult to achieve: how to manage diversity.

   It is a challenge in Israel, which at age 50 is struggling to
integrate black Jews, Jews of different philosophies, and Arabs
into a nation that was founded as something of a utopian society.
It is a challenge in Great Britain and France, which for centuries
had colonies abroad but only now are struggling to make a home for
large numbers of nonwhites. It is a challenge in Asia, where Cold
War tensions have given way to ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges are especially vivid in North America, which
only two centuries ago was colonized by Europeans, who pushed the
native people to the far fringes and who seeded the fertile land of
the continent with thousands of settlers, most of them white but
some of them, portentiously, slaves.
</P>
<P>
   And so Americans have wrestled with questions of diversity _
though often described by a different name _ for centuries. It is
one of the signature struggles of the American story. Even the
founders grappled with this problem. ``Perhaps I am partial to the
complexion of my country,'' Benjamin Franklin said, ``for such kind
of partiality is natural to mankind.'' Today, of course, there is
no one complexion to Benjamin Franklin's country.
</P>
<P>
   But now the United States' northern neighbor _ beset with
centuries-old language tensions rooted in European rivalries and
with a flood of new immigrants, more than half of whom come from
Asia and the Pacific islands _ is wrangling with the problem.
Indeed, the debate here over diversity reveals as much about the
United States as it does about Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian debate is being conducted in a nation whose
boundaries are so uncertain that executives' contracts sometimes
include a clause setting out how their jobs and compensation would
change if Canada split up. The American debate is being conducted
in a nation whose boundaries are more or less fixed, though the
admission of Puerto Rico as the 51st state is a topic that is far
from settled.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian debate is being conducted primarily on language
lines, with race as a subtheme. The American debate is being
conducted primarily on racial lines, with language as a subtheme.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian debate is being conducted in a nation that reveres
its sense of civility and whose cities are filled with ethnic
neighborhoods. The American debate is being conducted in a nation
that is pockmarked with violence and punctuated with ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians talk about a mosaic. Americans talk about a melting
pot.
</P>
<P>
   These discussions define the two nations. They may also define
the future of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must understand that in the next century we will have to
learn to live in peace within states,'' says Stephane Dion, a
Montreal intellectual who has become the governing Liberal Party's
point man on the Quebec question. ``Different populations are
worrying about their own identities. That's an American challenge,
too _ and with the responsibilities you have, you cannot afford for
there to be too many Yugo-slavias. This is a big universal
challenge. It is not a Canadian matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the American struggle on race lies beneath many other
political and cultural conflicts, it does not threaten to break up
the nation geographically, as it does in Canada. Sometime in the
next several years, Quebec will hold another referendum on
independence. The campaign to separate from Canada lost the last
referendum by the narrowest of margins, and the Parti Quebecois,
with its slogans ready, hopes that the province will vote for a new
country for a new century.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal government of Jean Chretien has been arguing that
Quebeckers benefit from being in Canada, and, with an eye toward
pointing out the crisis that would be prompted by a declaration of
independence, has sought a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of
separation. Its opposition rivals, the western-based Reform Party,
argues that mere reason is not enough to save the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are fighting a guy with a dream, you've got to have a
better dream,'' Reform leader Preston Manning said in an interview.
``Quebeckers want heart and emotionalism, not a cold calculation of
how things are going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when census takers asked Canadians their ethnic
backgrounds, nearly 38 percent of Quebeckers responded by saying
that they were of ``Canadian'' origin. That's double the national
average, and more Quebeckers responded that way than did any other
group.
</P>
<P>
   And in the United States, a survey released early this spring
showed that the children of immigrants overwhelmingly prefer
English to their parents' language. The Children of Immigrants
Longitudinal Study also showed that these new Americans have higher
grades and lower dropout rates than other children.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the diversity debate is prompting Canadians
and Americans to learn more about each other, and to learn more
about what it is to be a nation.
</P>
<P>
   John Whyte, Saskatechewan's deputy minister of justice and a
constitutional scholar, made a plea this year for a multiracial,
multiethnic, multicultural society. ``The threads of a thousand
acts of accommodation,'' said Whyte, who might have been talking to
Americans as well as Canadians, ``are the fabric of a nation.''

 GLOUCESTER, Mass.: ... and believable.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous revival of interest in figurative
sculpture,'' Hancock says, ``so tremendous that there is a lot of
extremely poor work being produced by people who don't know how to
do anything but copy what they see. But you have to design
sculpture, compose it. And you have to avoid mawkishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day,'' he says, ``sculptors were taught to solve
problems, to make a thing fit a situation.'' A fine example is the
heroic ``Pegasus and Warrior'' Hancock expressly designed to suit
its setting outside an Art Deco structure in St. Louis. (There's a
maquette for ``Pegasus'' in the Cape Ann museum.) He's called this
work ``almost Assyrian in its formality,'' and it does indeed have
the blunt rhythms of Assyrian reliefs. Hancock made the horse's
wings a series of jazzy horizontals finished with a scalloped edge:
On a less majestic scale, these stylized wings could be a hood
ornament for a streamlined 1930s car.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest design challenges was the epic ``Pennsylvania
Railroad War Memorial'' for Philadelphia's 30th Street Station, a
36-foot vertical sculpture that echoes the giant columns nearby. An
angel tenderly lifts a fallen soldier out of the flames of battle;
the angel's wings aim straight up, their lines repeating those of
the columns' fluting. ``I tried to make the angel's face represent
all of humanity, not just one race,'' Hancock says, adding that the
angel is neither male nor female.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stages of the design, ``the angel was lifting the
soldier without any real feeling,'' Hancock says. ``What you have
to do in a case like that, to get the emotion, is act the thing out
in your own imagination, putting your own feelings into the
action.'' The angel's hands are an illustration. In their first
incarnation, they were straight, flat, and formal; by the final
version, they'd become eloquent, gently pressing the soldier's
flesh so you can feel his weight.
</P>
<P>
   Gentleness, not an attribute usually associated with war, is
nonetheless a hallmark of the war memorials that occupied a good
chunk of Hancock's career. (The president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad had requested grenades hanging from the soldier's belt,
which Hancock managed to avoid.) Gentleness also seems a hallmark
of Hancock himself.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent of his military memorials is the one for West
Point, and it, too, is poignant rather than bellicose. The generals
in charge of it were ``leery of the idea of nudity at first. But
I've never worked with any committee as receptive and
appreciative,'' Hancock says, describing ``a convoy of stretch
limousines filled with generals and colonels,'' driving down his
dirt road to check on the memorial's progress. Hancock himself
served as an army captain in World War II, his talents put to use
as a member of a team who rescued art the Nazis had looted and
hidden, often in places where dampness threatened the works'
existence.
</P>
<P>
   While best known for public monuments, Hancock also made
delightful little bronzes of wrestlers, swimmers, and basketball
players, as ``a relief from the big commissions,'' he says. He
lured local youngsters with a basketball court on his property.
When he was struck by a particular gesture, he'd have them repeat
it. And repeat it. Dozens of the nimble little figures that
resulted are in the Cape Ann museum, their fleeting movements _
reaching, jumping, lunging, colliding, falling over backward _
forever frozen. They remind me of Degas's little bronzes of
ballerinas. Hancock says he was urged to sculpt dancers by none
other than Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the New York City
Ballet, who took him to watch George Balanchine rehearse. ``But I
resisted doing dancers,'' Hancock says, ``because I felt an art out
of an art wasn't as interesting as art out of life, with all its
accidents. That's why I enjoyed those high school basketball
players. They made so many fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock invites me to visit his studio, just up the steps from
his parlor. ``I have to go with you to defend myself,'' he says,
smiling. The studio is a gathering of sculptural friends and
family: heads of Booth Tarkington, Robert Frost, and Hancock's
daughter among them. There's also a model for ``Air,'' a 1979
commission for Philadelphia's Civic Center. How to turn bronze into
ether? ``At first I thought it should be something wispy,'' Hancock
says. ``But air can be anything from a breeze to a hurricane.
Eventually, I found the answer in Shakespeare, in a line from
`Hamlet' _ `This most excellent canopy, the air ... this brave
o'erhanging firmament.' I thought I'd make the sculpture as much a
canopy as possible.'' So Hancock's ``Air'' is a male figure who
hovers horizontally over a globe, his arms and legs swimming
through the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's view of public sculpture as problem solving met its
biggest test in the gigantic Stone Mountain Memorial, a
69-foot-high granite bas-relief depicting Confederate heroes,
carved into a rocky hill outside Atlanta. The project had dragged
on since 1915; two other sculptors had tackled it and ultimately
given up. (The first, Gutzon Borglum, went on to sculpt Mount
Rushmore.) Hancock saw the troublesome saga through to its 1970
completion, though the two great bronze towers he'd designed to
complement the figures were never cast; models of these cylinders
of flames sit in a corner of his studio.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's public sculpture seems more a public service than an
excuse to flaunt a personal style, and though he's won all manner
of awards and even a presidential medal, he remains a reticent man.
While he didn't want to sculpt Balanchine's dancers, he probably
would agree with the choreographer's famous comment on
``creativity'': ``Creation happened once.'' Hancock, too, has a
workmanlike attitude toward art. On the matter of his aesthetic
signature, Walker Hancock notes simply that ``if you work
sincerely, the result shows whose work it is.''

A WAR IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On my desk is an old photograph of him from 1943, taken a few
weeks before he shipped out to England for the next three years.
He's in dress uniform, standing on a downtown street in Amarillo,
Texas, holding the eternal unfiltered cigarette between his
fingers, wearing what my mother still calls ``that devil-may-care
look'' in his eyes. My father was a master sergeant in the Eighth
Air Force in the Second World War, stationed in a supply-command
base in Blackpool, England. In April or May of 1944, he wrote to my
mother _ by then, his wife of barely a year _ and told her he
believed it would all be over soon, sometime around his birthday.
His birthday was June 3, three days before D-Day, and the letter,
for obvious reasons, never made it past the censors. Not that it
needed to: Its content (magical prophecy, to a child) has lived on
in the family narrative, legend replacing what mere paper and ink
could only suggest.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years my father, when he would even address the subject,
has insisted that he had it easy during the war, that he never saw
combat, that the worst casualties his 110 men suffered could be
treated with a healthy dose of penicillin. He is 84 now, and the
arthritis he brought home from England (it kept him out of Korea)
keeps him close to his old leather chair. For reasons that have as
much to do with time as with love, he has told me more about the
war in the last three years than he ever told anyone, including my
mother, in the five previous decades. And as with so many veterans
of his age, the memories of Blackpool are far more crystalline than
his ordinary recollections about the past year. This week, when I
came home from seeing ``Saving Private Ryan,'' I called him to talk
about the war. We played the game of bluff and bluster that has
always symbolized the intimacy between us; then I asked if he
remembered D-Day. ``Oh, yes,'' he said instantly, and there was a
long pause, and I thought, My God, he's finally going to start
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, honey,'' he said, ``I was a hell of a poker player
in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer may seem incongruous and, to the uninitiated,
frustrating. But those of us who came of age in the years after
World War II _ the sons and daughters who grew up playing war games
in our backyards, before the fences went up _ have long known that
this was the way our fathers spoke about the war. They bantered and
joked and told tall tales and buddy stories; if they were lucky
enough to return without wounds you could see, they came side-angle
at their pain, when they came near it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, was I weeping within 30 seconds of the opening shots
of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' wherein a white-haired American my
father's age is making his way toward a grave in a French cemetery?
Some of it was the wrenching ordinariness of the man: Harrison
Young's old soldier, wearing sport shirt and trousers, his eyes
misting with the private heartbreak of a million other vets.
Certainly I had been forewarned about the 28 minutes of Omaha Beach
I was about to witness _ Spielberg's virtuoso homage to war-is-hell
realism, intent upon showing the spilled intestines along with the
desperate valor. But an older gentleman on the long flight of
stairs into the theater had already rattled me: When I made a
friendly comment about the climb, he looked distressed, as though I
had interrupted him at a funeral. By the time the lights had dimmed
and that silent cemetery walk had begun, I had dissolved. This was
my father's war, and though I believed I had steeped myself in it
for most of my life, I was staggered in the next few hours and days
by what I hadn't understood.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage and heroism that was the Second World War came home
to us in in its aftermath in sweet waves of diffused history:
corrective myth and bearable memories and ticker-tape parades that
allowed us, as a country, to go on. The War Department's propaganda
division, which for years had employed the likes of Frank Capra and
Walt Disney to crank out GI boosterism, was no longer needed: We
had taken over the job of producing our own necessary fictions,
invented in the toy bombers and suburban fantasies of a victory
that always went to the better man. If ``The Best Years of Our
Lives'' or ``The Naked and the Dead'' told a particular truth about
the war, a less melancholy version was there to be had in the ethos
of the postwar Westerns, or on the baseball fields where fathers
showed their Little League teams how to fight and how to win. Our
dads were heroes _ all of them were heroes, it seemed _ and it was
our tender burden to be the little soldiers they'd come home to
raise.
</P>
<P>
   For me, that duty took the form of reading. My barracks was in
the basement of the public library, where I crouched on the floor
of the adult reading section, a place I wasn't yet allowed. I
remember camping out there for most of a summer when I was 10 or
11, immersed in my field manuals of Leon Uris's ``Battle Cry'' and
``Mila 18,'' thrilled and aghast at the horrors of war, trying to
steel myself for even tougher stuff. In the next several years, as
the 1960s broke out, I would graduate from that child's Valhalla,
of course, somehow finding my way to Dalton Trumbo's underground
anti-war classic, ``Johnny Get Your Gun.'' And by then, the Office
of Propaganda would have loved to get ahold of me and a million
others like me. My generation had been handed a different kind of
war, and I rejected the master sergeant who headed my family (he
was known by the neighborhood boys as ``Wild Bill Caldwell'') for a
cast-off Army jacket of my own.

JOYRIDING ECONOMY HITS A FEW BUMPS 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the mid-1990s, analysts have been peering into
the humming engine of the American economy and looking up agog: It
was all running so perfectly. Barely a knock or a ping to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Asia's economies careened off the road last year and
some analysts warned they could drag the United States with them,
events seemed to turn out happily: Foreigners pumped money into the
safe haven of US markets, which drove interest rates down and sent
stocks and the economy flying.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, especially in recent weeks, economists and
investors have begun to identify the first tentative signs of
trouble at home. Corporate profits no longer climb the way they
once did; consumer spending seems likely to run out of steam
because of exhausted savings; and the investigation of President
Clinton could have significant and unpredictable effects on the
administration and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have begun to wonder anew how long the nation's economy
can continue unscathed as countries all around flounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dawning on us that we're just about the only ones left
standing, and that makes people nervous,'' said Robert E. Litan,
the economic studies director at the Brookings Institution in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the new worries are no surprise. Everybody knew
that economic conditions here were too good to last forever.
Forecasters and policy makers have been predicting _ in fact,
hoping for _ some letup in growth to help ease pressures like the
tight labor market's upward push on wages. Even if that easing
occurs, almost no one is predicting a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by measures like inflation, interest rates, and consumer
confidence, the economy is still purring. Most economists dismiss
such warning signs as the recent slumps in industrial production
and retail sales as flukes _ statistical aberrations attributed to
the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a heck of a good economy,'' said David Wyss,
research director for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a rawness to analysts' worries that has
been almost entirely absent in recent years _ a nagging sense that
the number of economic trouble spots around the world has risen too
high and too fast for comfort, an uneasy concern that the nation's
economic machinery may have become so finely tuned that if anything
goes seriously wrong, it could begin to throw rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four or five miserable scenarios out there that may
only have odds of 5 or 10 or 15 percent, but are ones that a year
ago we wouldn't even have been thinking about,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief global economist with Primark Decision Economics in Boston
and, until recently, one of the country's most upbeat forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, the big worry is Wall Street. That, according to
analysts, is because how the economy fares depends largely on
whether Americans keep spending, and whether they keep spending
depends to a remarkable degree on how their investments do. And the
last few months have not been kind to investments.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average on Friday fell 35 points to
8425, down almost 10 percent from its highs of mid-July and up a
mere 6.5 percent for the year. Other market measures, like the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the computer-heavy Nasdaq Composite, are
also well below their peaks. And even these declines may not
properly represent the extent of the market's slide because the
averages have been held up in recent months by the strong
performance of a few large stocks, which has masked the deeper
dives of many other companies' shares.
</P>
<P>
   To most people, the idea of bad investment news affecting
economic performance seems obvious because they assume that the
stock market and the economy have always been linked. But analysts
believe that, for better or worse, the two have never been as wired
to each other as they are today because so many more Americans are
investing.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, the wiring has carried a strikingly
clear message: Stocks are up. Times are flush. The chance to
consume is now. The extent to which Americans have responded is
only beginning to become clear, most recently in the government's
new household savings statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The figures show that millions of American families have
apparently decided that their expanding stock portfolios will cover
such big costs as college education and retirement, so they have
all but given up on the idea of saving money. As a result, the
nation's already paltry savings rate of about 4 percent of
after-tax income has fallen to just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person is feeling pretty flush so he's spending
every dollar he makes,'' said Litan.
</P>
<P>
   All that spending has been great for economic growth. But
analysts wonder whether with so little in reserve beyond the paper
profits of the stock market, Americans can continue buying at their
current pace. And even more important, many worry how Americans
will respond if the markets take a prolonged dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what life would be like in the slow lane,'' said
Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist with Fleet Financial Group in
Boston. ``We know that when &UR;  &LR; the market is up, consumers are
exuberant. But what happens when it's down, maybe way down? Do they
get morose'' and stop buying?
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, the big worry is Japan. That, according to
analysts, is because as the world's second-largest economy and by
far the largest in the Pacific Rim, Japan is the only country with
the resources to help pull its Asian neighbors out of their crises.
But so far, it has only succeeded in making its own problems, and
those of its neighbors, worse.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for many Americans to view the Asian crisis as a
serious threat, since virtually all its early effects seemed
positive. But analysts said that the crisis has finally begun to
catch up with US economy in two ways: through a slow, uneven, and
hard-to-track squeeze on corporate profits _ a key engine of the
stock market _ and through abrupt, across-the-board stock routs.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an Asia-related falloff in US exports and an increase in
the value of the dollar in international currency markets, which
shrinks the value of overseas earnings, analysts now say that
corporate America will be able to boost profits only slightly this
year.
</P>
<P>
   While that means companies will still make money, and in many
cases more than they made last year, the profit growth will pale
beside the double-digit growth rates that investors have become
accustomed to. And some observers say the profit damage is far from
over.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Hill, research director for First Call Corp., a
Boston firm that follows earnings projections, said analysts will
have to ``bring their forecast down a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors are having to learn to cope with the
stomach-churning experience of sudden market tumbles like the
round-the-world rout on Aug. 4 that trimmed nearly 300 points from
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the potential for a global financial meltdown,''
said Perna. ``I don't think it will happen, but it's a lot more
likely than six months ago.''

`KUNDUM' IS MAGNIFICENT; `THE APOSTLE' OFF KILTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Kundun''  &LR; _ Martin Scorsese's elegiac tribute
to Tibet and the boy Dalai Lama, featuring an all-Tibetan cast, is
a remarkable departure for one of the only filmmakers worthy of the
name. Beautiful cinematography reinforces the film's idyllic view;
it's pacifist theme made all the stronger by Scorsese's previous
meditations on violence. The sheer exhilaration of this magnificent
film should be seen on the DVD format, which is letterboxed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Apostle'' &LR;  _ &UR;  &LR; For more than a decade, Robert Duvall
tirelessly worked to get this film about a Southern evangelist
made. As writer, director, and star, he's created a magnificently
complex character, but the star's brilliance throws the rest of his
movie off kilter. Great performance, middling movie.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn''  &LR; _ By the time
they got through with this one, no one wanted their name on it. A
parody turned self-parody that isn't very funny. And who designated
Joe Ezsterhaus the greatest screenwriter of the 20th century? He
stinks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Man in the Iron Mask''  &LR; _ Leonardo DiCaprio couldn't
transfer his star power from the hull of the Titanic to this
hulking period piece even though he gives a fine performance. The
plot wanders, and the rest of the cast overacts. (After all those
years in an iron mask in a dungeon, how does Leonardo come out with
such a fabulous complexion?)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Senseless''  &LR; _ Remember a few months ago when everyone was
saying that comedian David Spade couldn't miss? He was hot, hot,
hot. But then this stupid movie came out and died at the box
office. Cold, cold, cold. A few funny slapstick moments do not a
movie make.

BARBARA DELINSKY FINALLY MAKES HER MARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEEDHAM, Mass. _ Over the past 18 years, Barbara Delinsky has
written 66 books, with 25 million copies published in two dozen
languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those numbers are mind-boggling,'' Delinsky said. ``And
when I go through an airport or a hotel lobby and see someone with
one of my books, I'm stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only two Sundays ago that a Barbara Delinsky novel,
``Coast Road,'' finally crashed the New York Times bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that most of the 66 were romance novels. And
while copies of ``genre books,'' as they are called, sell in the
millions, they aren't considered for the prestigious bestseller
lists. Recent novels by her that have sold well in paperback made
separate lists.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past half-dozen years, as she has become more
confident in her ability to tell more complex stories, Delinsky has
been edging across the line into what the trade regards as
mainstream women's fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coast Road'' involves a divorced couple on the California
coast. When the woman is critically injured in an autombile
accident, lying in a coma, her ex-husband returns to take care of
their two young daughters _ and answer the question of whether he
can recapture his marriage and his family.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Coast Road,'' Delinsky has a new publisher, Simon &AMP;
Schuster, ``not so much because I needed to change my image,'' she
said, ``but because I wanted my numbers to grow in hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I want to get the numbers up?'' Delinsky asks, a bit
defensively. ``Because I've always wanted to reach as many people
as I can. I think my books are good, intelligent entertainment. I
think they touch chords in people.''
</P>
<P>
   But if ``getting the numbers up'' also makes Delinsky sound more
like business than literature, she would be the first to agree _
softly, as is her way of speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing better illustrates the difference between
Delinsky from the women writers of ``literary fiction'' who are
familiar figures on the Boston literary scene. She's a
genre-turned-mainstream writer, and they read each other's work as
members of editor Sally Brady's writers' group meetings, have
animated conversations at PEN/New England gatherings, and meet over
lunch at each other's houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're literary writers,'' said Delinsky without the
slightest bit of animosity _ or jealousy. ``They'll write a book
every three years, while a genre writer has to have three new books
in the stores every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, she said, ``I know some writers, but there's no close
circle of friends. It helps me remember that this is a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a working stiff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky, 53, went into the business of writing 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Newton and went to Tufts University, where she
met her future husband, Stephen Delinsky, the former chief of staff
for Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti and now in private
practice. They live in a rambling Cape house surrounded by woods
and fields, which they built 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Delinsky speaks of the town with affection, she has kept
involvement in local activities to a minimum. One of the few
outside commitments is to the breast cancer advisory committee at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky's mother died there, of breast cancer, at the age of 45
when Delinsky was 8 years old. ``I feel very strongly about this,''
she said. Strongly enough to use one character in ``Coast Road,''
the injured ex-wife's closest friend, to stress the importance of
early detection and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one reader takes away from this book the importance of a
yearly mammogram,'' she said, ``I'll have been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky has a large office-sitting room over the garage,
separated enough from the rest of the house, she said, ``so that I
feel that I'm going to work.'' The computer, she said, ``is always
on, and sometimes I'll come in at 9:30 at night when I have an
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a master's degree in sociology from Boston
University, Delinsky worked as a researcher with the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. She never took a
writing course _ was even asked to drop out of a sixth-grade
advanced placement English class ``because I couldn't keep up with
the work,'' she said _ though she wrote a bit as a reporter and
photographer for the Belmont Herald.
</P>
<P>
   After taking several years off after the birth of her son, Eric,
who is now 28, and her twin sons five years younger, Delinsky
started looking around to return to work, but found nothing
particularly appealing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a story in the Boston Globe about women genre writers
that turned Delinsky to what became her business. She wrote the
first book, ``Hills of Eden,'' in 3 1/2 weeks. ``The glove fit,''
she said. ``And by the time it sold,'' she added, ``I was in the
middle of the next book.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, she said, ``it's been a very steady progression.
There's been no miraculous breakthrough in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Delinsky said, there were years when she wrote six
books. ``There were even a couple of times I'd spend a month
writing, then take a week off to cleanse the palate, then start in
on another one.''
</P>
<P>
   There was indeed a ``formula'' at first _ although Delinsky
perfers to use the word ``structure'' _ 10 chapters of 20 pages
each, the first one to introduce the characters, the last one to
bring resolution. ``And in between, various thing happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the arithmetic of 66 books in 18 years makes clear, she
said, ``that's a lot of books and a lot of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   And not a lot of vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky and her husband took their customary week this summer
in Big Sur on the California coast _ the setting for ``Coast Road''
_ hiking every day into the mountains and out to the ocean. They
will take their customary winter week ``somewhere warm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next book will take place in a setting similar to New
Hampshire's Squam Lake. There is a map of the lake and photographs
of the surrounding countryside tacked on a bulletin board facing
Delinsky's computer.
</P>
<P>
   In time, she said, ``we'd like to get a place in New Hampshire,
even though that means we'd have to start taking long weekends. No
more five-day work weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, there is spending time with friends, working
out _ ``at our age we have to be into physical fitness,'' she said
_ and relaxing with crossword puzzles. ``An enjoyable weekend for
us,'' she said, ``is spending time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky belongs to a reading group _ but there are writers in
it, she said. ``It's where I rub elbows with people and hear what's
on their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own reading runs to ``what's on the bestseller list _ to see
what the competition is.'' She took Wally Lamb's 900-page chart
topper ``I Know This Much Is True'' _ an Oprah television book club
selection _ on the Big Sur trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm as competitive as any man,'' Delinsky said. ``But
this is a business I'm in. Make no mistake about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And noting that she broke onto the New York Times bestseller
list at No.14 and would be moving up a notch the second week,
Delinsky said bluntly: ``I'd like to be No.1 on that list.''

CELINE DION TALKS ABOUT NEW ALBUMS, TOURING, A CERTAIN SONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Titanic'' soundtrack: 25 million copies sold and still
counting. It's the top-selling soundtrack of all time and the
best-selling record of the year. It's the fuel that has propelled
Canadian singer Celine Dion into a Streisand-like stratosphere,
from which she'll mount a two-year world tour that starts next
weekend in Boston (``my lucky city,'' she says) and will find her
using an in-the-round concert stage similar to those employed by
Neil Diamond and Stev-ie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   And the song the crowds will most want to hear?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy: ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the Oscar-winning pop
ballad from ``Titanic'' and its soundtrack. (In case you've worn
out your copy, a slightly altered version, with some added dialogue
from the movie, will also appear on a sequel CD, ``Back to
Titanic,'' due Aug. 25.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very happy that this newborn pleased a lot of
hearts,'' Dion says of the hit tune. ``Now it's time for me to
deliver it on stage, do a great tour, and do the best I can. It was
a big thrill to be associated with such a beautiful song. It's just
a gift of show business.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotion-drenched ``My Heart Will Go On'' was recorded in
just one take, Dion said in an interview last week from her new
Florida home, where she lives with her husband and manager, Rene
Angelil. Dion had enjoyed previous soundtrack success with ``Beauty
and the Beast'' (a hit duet with Peabo Bryson), but no one knew how
big ``My Heart Will Go On'' would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that James Horner,'' the movie's music
supervisor, ``talked to me about the story before I sang the song.
He got me into it,'' Dion says. ``He put me into the mood and I was
in tears by that time. I was very emotional, and that is when I
went to sing the song. And it's actually the demo. I went to sing
it for the first time and I never re-sang it. They built the
orchestra around it afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was no thought of doing more takes of the song?
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically I could have done it better, but emotionally, it
was there,'' says Dion. ``Everybody was crying (in the studio) and
I think there's something good in that. Sometimes you can't push
your luck and say, `Oh, let me do it again, I know I can do
better.' If it's all there, don't push it. You can always work on
something and refine it and make it better, but sometimes it takes
away a lot of things. So just do it and let it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion let it out, all right, but surprisingly, she didn't track
it on radio once it became a runaway hit. ``I don't listen to
radio, because I'm often too busy,'' she says, somewhat sheepishly.
``But I would hear it in restaurants and shopping malls, things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers are worried about the possibility of overkill
with the ``Back to Titanic'' sequel (which will have some
previously unreleased music, including the jig that Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslow danced to before becoming lovers). But
Dion is not bothered by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real fans are going to be happy about it,'' says Dion, the
youngest of 14 children from a Montreal family. ``Because if you're
a real fan of the movie and the song, you can never be tired of it,
especially if (the record) is different, and dialogue and things
like that are included.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie itself: ``I've seen it two times and we just
built a cinema room in our new home. We have the tape and can't
wait to watch it again on our new big screen.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, even while preparing for her world tour, Dion is
recording a Christmas album. ``It's about 102 degrees out and I'm
recording a Christmas album!'' she says with a laugh. ``And I just
finished a French album that will come out before the end of the
year.'' (The release date for the French disc is Sept. 3; Nov. 3
for the Christmas disc.)
</P>
<P>
   Where other artists (like Mariah Carey) bring Christmas
decorations into the studio to simulate a holiday air for such
projects, Dion says she doesn't need them. ``It's more inside for
me. ... When I go into the studio to sing a Christmas song or a
regular ballad, it comes from the inside out. Just decorating the
outside doesn't interest me. Maybe I should try it to feel the
difference, but I don't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas album will have ``a few original songs written
especially for this album. And there will be some Christmas
classics, too,'' adds Dion. One new song comes from R&AMP;B star R.
Kelly, who will join her on it for a duet.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is the tour, which starts at Boston's FleetCenter with
sold-out shows this Friday and Saturday. It's the third straight
Celine tour that will have started in the Boston market. ``We're
very superstitious people, Celine and me,'' says her
husband/manager, Angelil. ``Boston is a city we love and it brings
us luck. It's the closest city to Montreal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's our lucky city. We're neighbors!'' adds Dion.
</P>
<P>
   The in-the-round format, however, is something new for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great if you can do it, but it's harder to do,'' says
Angelil, ``because the artist can never relax. You're always on _
and you have to think 360 degrees instead of just in front of you.
So she's going to have to make some adjustments. The first show is
going to be something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it scares me, but there's so much more energy
involved,'' says Dion. ``There are people all around the stage.
It's just a new way of performing for me. I'm just a little nervous
about it. ... But with this stage, we're going to have the chance
to do different things. And it looks fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion first got turned on by the in-the-round format when, as a
young girl, she saw Stevie Wonder perform in Montreal. ``It was a
long time ago when I saw his show, but it was very spectacular,''
says Dion, who is now 30.
</P>
<P>
   As for the set list on the tour: ``I'm going to definitely sing
the new songs and a few French ones and definitely people's
favorite songs from the last few years,'' she says. ``I can't do
them all, unfortunately, because I have to do a two-hour show. It
would take a long time to sing all my songs. I hope we have chosen
the right ones for people to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect a healthy smattering from her latest studio album,
``Let's Talk About Love,'' which includes collaborations with
Barbra Streisand and the Bee Gees. Dion also hopes to work with her
idol Streisand again. Perhaps if Streisand will agree to direct her
in a movie role, though that will have to wait at least two years
for the tour to finish. ``Nothing has been planned with Barbra, but
if it's a good thing for both of us, I would love to do it,'' says
Dion.
</P>
<P>
   And though she's busier than ever, Dion will take some time soon
to visit the recently paralyzed Chinese gymnast Sang Lan in New
York. The gymnast expressed the wish to meet two celebrities:
DiCaprio (who just visited her) and Dion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a fan,'' says Dion, who is known for greeting fans with
special needs, such as the woman with cystic fibrosis she met
before her last Boston tour opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad what happened,'' Dion says of the gymnast, who
suffered an accident during a warm-up drill at the Goodwill Games.
``And it's the least we can do to cheer her up and give her some
hope. If she wants to see us, I think we have to go. And it will be
a pleasure and an honor to meet her. I hope I can just give her
some strength and some hope.''

NEXT STOP, BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brad Anderson was raised in Connecticut, and now lives in New
York, but he considers himself a Boston filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days a lot of people are calling themselves Boston
filmmakers, but we're the real thing,'' said Anderson, referring to
himself and Lyn Vaus, co-writers of ``Next Stop, Wonderland,''
which Anderson also directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did we make a film imbued with the spirit of Boston,
but we know this town inside and out,'' Anderson said. ``I've
probably shot on every street in this city, so I really do feel
like a Boston filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' arrives in theaters Friday still
riding the wave of buzz it generated at this year's Sundance Film
Festival. The charming comedy about the eternal search for true
love was snapped up by Hollywood heavyweight Miramax for a whopping
$6 million at the prestigious filmfest in January.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Shot entirely in the Boston area, ``Next Stop, Wonderland''
serves as yet another harbinger of Massachusetts's flourishing film
industry. A state once best known for its clam chowder, eccentric
drivers, and lovably accursed Red Sox is now garnering attention
for its ability to attract Hollywood and independent filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very exciting time to be working with the film industry
here,'' said Robin Dawson, director of the Massachusetts Film
Office. ``What's really exciting is in addition to the large
features, independent filmmakers have really embraced this
region.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Massachusetts pulled in a record $101.2 million in
revenue from film and television productions, Dawson said. That's a
huge increase from the second most lucrative year, $73 million in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Recently, the state has supplied locations for such movies as
``The Matchmaker'' starring Janeane Garofalo and Denis Leary, David
Mamet's ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' Steven Spielberg's ``Amistad,''
and Tom Keenan's memorable comedy ``Enough Already,'' which was
released earlier this year. Upcoming films with Massachusetts
locales include ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta, Robert
Duvall, and Kathleen Quinlan; ``In Dreams,'' with Annette Bening,
Aidan Quinn, and Robert Downey Jr.; and ``The Love Letter,'' now
shooting in Rockport with Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck, and Ellen
Degeneres.
</P>
<P>
   Other films have been swept up in the momentum like the quirky
thriller, ``pi.'' It was not filmed in Boston, but writer-director
Darren Aronofsky is a Harvard University graduate and star Sean
Gullette is from Newton, Mass. These days, that's enough of a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston's kind of funny that way,'' said Vaus, who once worked
as a security guard at Massachusetts General Hospital before
success as a screenwriter led him to New York. ``They will embrace
people and things with even a slight connection, but I think that's
really kind of touching actually.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, when acting Gov. Paul Cellucci announced that three
North Shore communities _ Rockport, Gloucester, and
Manchester-by-the-Sea _ had been selected as sites for the upcoming
DreamWorks film ``The Love Letter,'' he recognized ``the enormous
economic benefits that the big screen brings to our towns and
cities. Movies and TV shows filmed here in the Bay State have had
blockbuster success in bringing dollars, jobs, and tourists into
the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these days the best-known film with its heart in
Boston is ``Good Will Hunting,'' the 1997 film that turned
Cambridge natives Matt Damon and Ben Affleck into stars and Academy
Award winners for best original screenplay (Miramax also financed
that film, which went on the become the highest-grossing movie in
the studio's history.) But the state's film fortunes were on the
rise before Damon's character, Will Hunting, hoisted a cold one in
South Boston's L Street Tavern, Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Good Will Hunting' definitely brought prominence to the
Boston area, but we had already been creating incentives to attract
filmmakers,'' she said. One of those incentives is the ``fee-free
locations'' that allow filmmakers access to state-owned facilities
at no cost. Studios are also offered cut rates at hotels and
restaurants. So far, the program has paid off, and the budget for
the film office has increased from $450,000 to $650,000. The larger
allocation allows Massachusetts to compete better with about 300
worldwide film commissions, Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some filmmakers have long been convinced of the
state's virtues a backdrop. Shortly before ``Good Will Hunting''
opened last year, Damon said he and Affleck always knew that if
they wrote a film it would have to be set in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Boston isn't Brad Anderson's hometown, but both his
feature-length films (the first was ``The Darien Gap'' in 1996)
were set in the city where he lived for eight years. He also taught
filmmaking at Tufts University, Emerson College, Boston University,
and the Boston Film/Video Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely wanted to make another movie in Boston,'' said
Anderson during a recent visit to his former home. ``We wanted to
weave together a story where we could capitalize on Boston _ not
only as a location, but also as a character in the movie. There's a
melancholy tone to the movie and I think Boston has a bit of that.
It's a sweet, charming city, but there's a sort of pensiveness,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' _ as in the Blue Line stop adjacent to
Revere's dog track _ is a fanciful story about modern love and
romance. Hope Davis plays Erin, a nurse living in Boston's South
End who has been jilted by her longtime boyfriend, Nathan (Paul
Wagner). Her sudden singlehood leaves her cynical and mistrustful
of men in general and of relationships in particular. Her pushy but
well-meaning mother (Holland Taylor) places a personal ad for Erin
in a local newspaper, and though Erin is at first offended, her
curiosity leads her to listen to some of the voice responses,
mostly from a string of losers and poseurs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of town, in East Boston, there's Alan (Alan
Gelfant), a sweet, decent guy who also emerged bloodied and bruised
from his last relationship. Believing he's destined to be alone, he
pours all his time and energy into becoming a marine biologist at
the Boston (read New England) Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which features such local celebrities as comedian
Jimmy Tingle and radio personality Charles Laquidara in small
roles, becomes a series of near-misses between Erin and Alan, who
are perfect for one another. The tension hinges on whether the two
will ever actually meet, though their paths almost cross several
times. Such a device might seem contrived if the film were set in
New York or Los Angeles, but not in a city with Boston's intimacy,
Vaus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had a line in the movie where a character said, `In
Boston's it's nothing to bump into the same person eight or nine
times in a month.' That's conceivable here, and that was something
we could capitalize on for dramatic purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's next film is a horror-mystery project that will take
him away from romantic comedy and from Boston. But he would never
rule out a return to the state where he first made his name as a
filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that Boston is being heralded as a new
venue for film,'' he said. ``Even though I don't live here anymore,
I love Boston. It has a look, a tone, and a feel unlike any other
city. In a way, with this film, we wanted to make a valentine to
Boston.''

LET'S HAVE DEBATE ON WHEN TO START SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ever wonder what became of the Grinch who stole
Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   Although that question probably hasn't been weighing heavily on
your mind, it has become obvious in recent days that the Grinch and
some of his offspring have been elected to a number of school
boards around Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And, now, they've stolen a large chunk of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Summer may have another month to run _ according to the calendar
and the thermometer _ but it has effectively ended for millions of
Texas children and their parents because school bells already are
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Independent School District, the state's largest,
begins classes this week. They began last week in Austin and kicked
off _ believe it or not _ on Aug. 3 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 3! The dog days of summer, which many Texas families used
to think of as prime vacation time, had barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the school year has been creeping earlier
and earlier into summer, and some people are beginning to think
that there ought to be a law.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature punted on the issue last year but will be asked
to take another look when it convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   My own feelings are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, I think it is ridiculous to start the school year
on Aug. 12, as the Austin Independent School District did. I
question whether finishing the first semester before the Christmas
break _ the purported reason for the early start _ is worth the
sacrifice of family recreational time and putting children on
un-air conditioned school buses during the hottest time of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   As a taxpayer, I wonder how much of my money AISD will have to
spend on the huge electricity bill that it will receive for
cranking up the air conditioners in its schools at the peak of
summer. Unlike most school buses, most Texas classrooms _
fortunately for students and teachers _ are air conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   But, also as a taxpayer and a parent, I would like to hear more
debate.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of effect, if any, does the school year's schedule
have on a child's ability to learn? Is a youngster more distracted
in the middle of August? Is it unfair _ and shortsighted _ to
shorten the summer work season for teen-agers who need summer jobs
to earn money for college and family expenses?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Christmas holidays too long? AISD classes will be shut
down for almost two and one-half weeks. The teachers and students
will certainly welcome the long respite, and I don't want to be
labeled a Grinch myself. But most working parents have to save
vacation days to take that much time off, or, if they have
grade-school children, have to scramble to find day care, which can
be an expensive proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Do school districts really need a weeklong spring break? This
has become a tradition in the public schools but was virtually
unheard of not too many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Does state government have any business telling local school
districts when they can begin classes, or should parents who don't
like to hear school bells in August simply run for their school
board? Maybe the issue could even generate some voter interest in
school board elections for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Current state law dictates that districts have to provide 180
instructional days a year plus a certain number of days for staff
development. Five of those teaching days were added in a 1993 law,
which doubtlessly contributed to the pressure for an early start to
the school year.
</P>
<P>
   But local school officials are otherwise free to set their own
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, plans to promote debate
in Austin by introducing another bill next session to prohibit
public schools from starting classes before Sept. 1. That would
return the schools to what used to be a traditional starting date
after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio sponsored a similar bill last year. It was approved 25-6
by the Senate but died in the House Public Education Committee, at
least partly because of opposition from school board members and
administrators, who value whatever ``local control'' they can
salvage from the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio acknowledged that his bill is important to the tourist
industry, which has a strong presence in his coastal South Texas
district. But he said he also has other concerns, including the
effects of the heat on children riding buses or walking to and from
school.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he also was concerned about the plight of
migrant children, many of whom live in his district. These children
are among the poorest in the state and are already at high risk of
dropping out before completing school.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said that many of these students don't start school until
late September, after they finish helping their parents harvest
crops. The earlier school starts, the more they miss and the
greater their chance of giving up on an education that is their
only hope for a better life.

AVOID TEMPTATION OF POPULAR STOCKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these times of stock market turmoil, the inclination is to go
for what is the greatest, hottest stock _ a brand-name stock with a
kick-butt track record.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the urge, particularly now that the market is in a bad
mood. The popularity of those hot stocks is usually what ends up
doing them in.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that you should avoid all really large,
well-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, it's very sensible to be concentrated in the
large companies because they have the best odds of success in terms
of earnings growth, but there are times when they are overpriced
and turn out to be poor investments for a while,'' said Bradlee
Perry, an investment manager at David L. Babson &AMP; Co. in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out if a stock is overpriced is the hard part. One of
the ways to gauge a stock's popularity is its price/earnings ratio,
which is the measure of how much investors are willing to pay for a
company's earning power. The higher the ratio, the more investors
expect out of a company.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that price/earnings ratios _ also known as the
P/E _ for many big-name companies are perilously high now.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the P/E for the benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index for current earnings is 26, Perry said. That's
almost twice the historical average of 14 to 14.5 for current
earnings for the large companies in this index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excessive optimism that gets reflected in the prices of
such shares makes it virtually impossible for the companies
concerned to meet the euphoric expectations of investors,'' Perry
said. ``This is why so many popular stocks turn out to be
unrewarding investments, and some really disastrous holdings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's especially risky to go after the hottest big names now
because only a small number of stocks have accounted for the
market's gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of the gain through June of the S&AMP;P 500 came
from 25 stocks, said Brendan Connaughton, a portfolio manager at
Wells Fargo Bank in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's scary because it's too narrow,'' he said. ``What you
want to see is a market that's broad-based.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the perils of popularity, Perry, who oversees $20
billion in assets, conducted a study over the last 16 years tracing
what happens to the company on the New York Stock Exchange that
ranks as the most popular in the spring of each year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock with the highest P/E on the exchange in April
typically carried a price/earnings ratio that was about triple the
one for the average S&AMP;P 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   Perry found that, on average, the most popular stocks
appreciated less than half as much as the S&AMP;P if held from their
peak of popularity through June of this year _ 141 percent vs. 328
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exciting new markets often fail to keep growing as rapidly and
profitably as investors expect,'' Perry said. ``The second problem
often encountered by popular companies is that when a business
achieves great success, competitors are attracted into the field,
sometimes very powerful ones. This slows growth and shrinks profit
margins for the early leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Advanced Micro Devices as archrival
Intel Corp. and some smaller companies developed superior
microprocessor chips for personal computers, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta-own stocks are very likely to be losers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you seek big names, find the ones that don't carry the
bloated expectations of investors but still have strong earnings
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for fallen angels _ big-name stocks whose stock prices
have dropped a lot,'' Perry said. ``Look for good, strong companies
whose prices have come off because of a minor disappointment
because they're no longer popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Connaughton is looking for companies in an industry with high
barriers to competition, such as aviation. He also likes ones whose
stocks are at bargain prices but that have strong growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be going into names that have underperformed and therefore
don't have the high P/E, like GM,'' he said. ``GM was under the
strike cloud for a while and it's really cheap. This one has a
catalyst for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   If you own big-name stocks that you bought at a decent price,
don't sell them in a panic or you could be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is smart enough and nimble enough to hop off the
fastest horse on the track when he starts to slow down and hop on
another horse when he's speeding up,'' Perry said.

TASTE THE CULTUREAT DIET'S EXPENSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am frequently amused by travel-related survey findings that
cross my desk.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how else would I know that more men than women locked
themselves out of their Novotel New York hotel rooms in a state of
undress last year?
</P>
<P>
   Or that 67 percent of travelers to Las Vegas consider shopping a
priority while only 18 percent cite gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the most popular mall is attached to a casino.
</P>
<P>
   If those studies offer food for thought, FITNESS Magazine's
newly released survey of ``diet-damaging regional delicacies''
really _ ahem _ takes the cake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine's September issue, ``By and large, the
most popular dishes in the nation's top cities are also the most
likely to wreck your diet. Whether it's the Baltimore mainstay of
Maryland crab cakes (340 calories, 14 grams of fat) or Chicago's
deep dish pizza (280 calories, 13 fat grams), hometown favorites
are unhealthy fat traps.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia cheese steak (887 calories, 46 fat grams) is deemed
so threatening that the magazine suggests the town change its motto
from ``The City of Brotherly Love'' to ``The City of Brotherly Love
Handles.''
</P>
<P>
   So what else should we avoid while traveling? The following
regional delicacies round out FITNESS' ``fat city list.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Louisville, Ky.: Southern fried chicken (590 calories, 30
grams fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Los Angeles: California burrito (550 calories, 22 grams fat).
</P>
<P>
   _ Dallas: Texas rib-eye steak (510 calories, 27 grams fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Orleans: gumbo (477 calories, 32 grams fat).
</P>
<P>
   _ Juneau: baked Alaska (380 calories, 12 grams fat).
</P>
<P>
   _ New York: bagel with cream cheese (340 calories, 11 grams
fat).

<P>
   _ Boston: cream pie (280 calories, 13 grams fat).
</P>
<P>
   Whew! For a moment there I was afraid the magazine was going to
shoo me away from chicken-fried steak and sliced beef po-boys. Or
tell me to keep the lid on Blue Bell key lime ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it's OK to sample lobster in Boston. But beware the
drawn butter. As for Boston baked beans ...
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the findings, FITNESS editor-in-chief Sally Lee does
offer a caveat: ``That's not to say you shouldn't try the Boston
cream pie or enjoy the New Orleans gumbo,'' she says. ``Just think
twice before indulging in seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   If we live long enough for seconds, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message you can take away from this survey is that
when in Rome, don't do as the Romans do,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me. I'm sure that from a fitness standpoint Lee is right.
And certainly I should be the first to heed the magazine's
cautions; I've sampled every regional delicacy on the list.
</P>
<P>
   But what's the point of traveling _ especially for those whose
trip to New Orleans or Boston or Rome is a once-in-a-lifetime
adventure _ if we can't fully immerse ourselves in a destination's
culture? Cuisine included. Isn't sourdough bread as much a part of
San Francisco tradition as the Golden Gate Bridge?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what future surveys might tell us:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay away from the mountains; the high altitude can cause
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid national parks and other woodlands; the bugs bite.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't bother with museums; something old may break and fall on
you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cancel that next cruise; the salty air may damage your hair.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to rely on a separate fitness survey conducted by the
Shattuck Unscientific Institute: It discovered that more travelers
suffer broken bones _ even jawbones _ on hiking and biking tours
than while chomping on a juicy steak. Despite exhaustive research,
it also unearthed not one report of arm stress incurred spooning up
crawfish gumbo. And if you put enough hot sauce on a good burrito,
it's almost guaranteed to clear out your sinuses. Among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   But acknowledging a need to become more fitness-conscious and
seeking a compromise that appeases those dedicated both to healthy
living and savoring local cuisine, I consulted one of my favorite
little books, ``All Over the Map'' (Ten Speed Press, $9.95) by
David Jouris, and pinpointed these fitness-conscious vacation
destinations:
</P>
<P>
   Celeryville, Ohio; Honeydew, Calif.; Greens, Tenn.; Tomato,
Ark.; and Cereal, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   And for anyone on a high-protein diet: Noodle, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   No fair stopping in Sugar City, Colo., though.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we could just eliminate food from our vacation
activities. And proceed instead to Bourbon, Miss.; Scotch Village,
Nova Scotia; Gin City, Ark.; Beersville, Pa.; or Whiskeytown,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Cayman Islands pose a real problem, though: Rum cake is the
regional specialty.

LIKABLE, PRECOCIOUS SCHOOLBOY MULLS A DISAPPEARANCE, LOVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  `THE WAY I FOUND HER'; By Rose Tremain; (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$25) 
 
By BARBARA LISS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Lewis Little, the narrator of Rose Tremain's
stylish new novel, is going to steal your heart. The speed with
which this happens depends on how you feel about books narrated by
adolescents, especially precocious adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   But trust Tremain, the author of seven imaginative novels,
including the highly praised ``Restoration,'' to put us in the
hands of a 13-year-old boy who knows how to tell a story. ``The Way
I Found Her'' is a carefully plotted mystery-cum-philosophical
meditation, and Lewis a likable protagonist. And, as he reminds us,
in a novel it is important to be on someone's side.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is no ordinary English schoolboy, head buried in soccer
scores and video games. His interests run to chess _ ``solving
things'' _ Dostoevsky and introspection. If at times he appears too
knowledgeable _ he muses about not only Marilyn Monroe but also
Arthur Miller _ he credibly explains, ``There is a disparity
between what is meant to be in the mind of a 13-year-old boy from
Devon and what is actually in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what a 13-year-old boy has experienced is another matter
altogether. The book begins with Lewis recounting the events of the
past summer. Until then he had been waiting for his life to begin.
It begins in Paris with his infatuation for the seductive Valentina
Gavril.
</P>
<P>
   Valentina, a best-selling writer of medieval romances, summons
Lewis' mother, Alice, her English translator, to Paris. The
publisher is pressing hard for completion of the latest book, and
Alice must translate as Valentina writes, a situation that has the
two women at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who comes along to practice his French, is left on his
own to explore the city. He spends the days wandering the shops and
parks _ gorgeously described _ contemplating his passion for
Valentina.
</P>
<P>
   Tremain introduces a diverse cast of characters, all of them
important to the mystery. Lewis befriends Baba, Valentina's maid, a
sorrowful young African who fears she will be deported because her
working papers have not come through. He visits Valentina's mother
in a musty apartment that recalls her Russian exile. Didier, the
man repairing Valentina's roof, takes Lewis under his wing, telling
him of the sad fate of his own father, who was also a roofer.
</P>
<P>
   Each portrait is rounded, yet subtle. Valentina's neighbor,
Moinel, we infer, is suffering from AIDS. In pushing back his chair
in a cafe, Grigory Panin, Valentina's Russian lover, shows us his
frustration has turned dangerous. One look at Didier's wife's dress
and we understand he is unhappily married and involved with Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Didier engages Lewis in thoughtful conversations, explaining his
existential philosophy. When Lewis tells Valentina about the
roofer's ideas, an amused Valentina replies that no one is an
existentialist anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but the characters at times sound dark and
existential. Cool, remote Alice tells Lewis, ``We're in a life we
don't understand.'' His father, Hugh, has warned him not to look
for too much happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Even Valentina admits that a person must make choices based on
circumstances. ``You do not know what you are capable of doing,
until that moment ... arrives,'' she tells him. More often,
Valentina, vowing ``never to be poor again,'' sounds suspiciously
like Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the way into the book, after leaving Lewis to meet
Grigory at his hotel, Valentina disappears. It will be up to Lewis,
``a person of resolution,'' according to the head teacher at his
school, to find her.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he has difficulty convincing anyone she has been
kidnapped. When it becomes clear even to the blas police
investigator that she has been taken, Lewis withholds his theory on
the motive for the crime. He has discovered that Valentina's latest
romance novel is plagiarized from Grigory's biography of Catherine
the Great. Lewis believes that Grigory, discovering this perfidy,
has forced Valentina to return with him to their native Russia. But
this is only one possibility.
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis delves deeper into Valentina's life _ modeling himself
after the inspector Petrovich in ``Crime and Punishment'' _ he
comes up with some revealing evidence. He doesn't realize how
closely he is approaching the truth of Valentina's abduction.
Closely enough, it turns out, that he too is kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   Tremain positions the characters like pieces in Lewis'
well-loved chess game. She manipulates them a little too precisely
in the manner of mystery writers. Although clues are strewn
throughout, they are better read backward than forward. Even Lewis'
toy soldier, introduced in Devon, becomes a plot device. The only
thing that we can guess will be important is the French book Lewis
is translating into English for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the sleuthing seems plausible for a clever, well-read
teen-ager. Even his rescue reveries of the woman he adores are
persuasive, the best dream a boy could ever have. The reader sees
Lewis as Tremain intends: a smart, resourceful youth but still a
child when it comes to capturing the attention of the adults who
are in charge.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects him to find Valentina, no one but Lewis himself.
He may be the book's hero, but his being kidnapped takes the story
across the line and turns it into an adolescent fantasy, complete
with half-crazed, bungling abductors.
</P>
<P>
   Tremain does redeem herself at the end. Having brought Lewis and
Valentina together improbably, she provides a bittersweet
conclusion that takes the story round to its opening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet underneath this competent mystery-adventure lies a richer,
more affecting coming-of-age story. In Lewis' voice, Tremain
achieves perfect pitch. Here is a boy at the end of childhood,
seeing his parents clearly for the first time. Tremain conveys his
dawning realization that his unworldly father is incapable of
holding on to the beautiful, complicated Alice. In his mother's
bretrayal Lewis senses his release from her.
</P>
<P>
   He is moving into his secrets just as she is moving into hers.
``Almost nothing turns out the way you think it will,'' Alice tells
him. It is a truth Lewis learns too early.
</P>

RUSSIAN RUBLE CRISIS TRIGGERS NEW JITTERS AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``i'' and ``f'' categories.)   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Recent nervousness in global markets stemming from fears
that the ruble might be devalued is something new. Russia has
repeatedly teetered on the edge of economic ruin in the years since
the collapse of communism in 1991 without causing undue
international alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Except for its extensive mineral resources like natural gas,
Russia hasn't really been a player in the economic big leagues.
Most of its industrial products are inferior, if not downright
shoddy, and therefore uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the tribulations of President Boris Yeltsin's
regime have been greeted calmly abroad _ that is, until now.
</P>
<P>
   Last week as Russian markets plunged over the threat of
devaluation, foreign officials and investors reacted with evident
concern.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble nosedived, U.S. officials said they expected Russia
to survive its problems, and Yeltsin, declaring there was no
crisis, ordered his government to put a strict limit on how much
the currency would be allowed to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar.
However, many financial authorities were skeptical that such
artificially imposed limits could be maintained for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it's different,'' said Paris-based Robert
Vishnogradov, a specialist on the Russian economy. ``The worry is
that further trouble in Russia might be enough to trigger worldwide
difficulties because major economies everywhere are currently
treading on thin ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's banking crisis, worsened by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's warning last week that his country faces a lengthy slump,
rumbles on. Nervousness has grown that Wall Street's recent losses
may foreshadow a bear market. European officials fear their own
hoped-for upturn may be submerged by a big drop on the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic disintegration could prove to be ``the drop of
water that causes the glass to overflow,'' Vishnogradov said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many analysts insisted that Russia's latest crisis is
mainly psychological, resulting from a general loss of confidence
in Yeltsin, Vishnogradov said there was little doubt the country's
financial system has ``broken down.'' He noted that ``the
government can't meet its bills and is unable to collect taxes
because people simply refuse to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia has continued to soak up foreign loans ``the
way blotting paper soaks up ink,'' he said, estimating that $30
billion from the International Monetary Fund and other sources has
``trickled away'' during the past three years. ``Nobody can really
say what has happened to the money,'' he added. ``It certainly
hasn't helped the national economy or stabilized government
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little reason to fear bankruptcy, he contended, because
``Russia is already effectively bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations by unpaid workers have become a daily event in
Moscow. For some, unpaid wages go back as far as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Russia's industry have reverted to a primitive barter
economy. Last month, a company manufacturing combines sold five of
the harvesters to Bulgaria. The Bulgarians paid for them with a
shipment of 50,000 jars of dill pickles. Workers at the plant
received pickles, instead of rubles, as their back wages.

PARTIAL SUN, FREQUENT WATERING WILL HELP BLUE BUTTERFLY BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a blue butterfly bush (``Clerodendrum ugandense'') in
a container. Could you tell me what it needs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your blue butterfly bush can continue to grow in a container
in partial sun. It will require frequent watering, as everything
does, during summer. Therefore, you'll need to replenish nutrients
more frequently. A balanced fertilizer or a hibiscus-type (with a
high last number rather than a high middle number) is best.
</P>
<P>
   The blue butterfly bush should be root-hardy in Zones 8-9 in a
protected spot in the garden. Plant in moist but well-draining rich
soil in partial shade. Mulch to protect the roots. You will lose
the top during freezing weather, so you might want to continue
growing the plant in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find blue butterfly bush produces its 1-inch, two-toned
flowers best in spring and fall rather than in summer. I've even
seen our plant loaded with blooms during mild winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Prune to prevent excessive ranginess. The plant can reach well
above 6 feet. I like to give mine an application of diluted fish
emulsion from time to time.

   Q: I bought four ``Thunbergia grandiflora'' this spring. I now
have a large fence covered with Thunbergia, but where is the
grandiflora? These vines haven't bloomed. I fed them a couple of
times with 10-10-10, and two weeks ago I applied 10-60-10 to no
avail. Do you have any ideas where I've gone wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Thunbergia grandiflora'' is a rapid grower that likes sun.
Commonly called sky flower vine, it produces beautiful, large,
sky-blue flowers late summer until frost. Flowering may continue
into early spring during winters as mild as the one just past. But
usually the top dies during freezing weather, and the vine returns
from the roots in spring and provides good shade by summer. Mulch
to protect the roots.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine there is an adequate supply of phosphorus in the soil.
Your vines should come around. Hold off on any further applications
of phosphorus, represented by the high middle number in the
fertilizer formula.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: My large ``Judge Solomon'' azaleas I've had for 20-25 years
seem to be afflicted with some disease. I first noticed signs of
trouble about a year ago. A small limb will droop, then the leaves
on that limb turn pale, then brown. Eventually the small limb dies,
then the entire larger limb goes through the same process. About
half of two large shrubs are gone now. Is this treatable or
helpless?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are fungal diseases that pester azaleas here. Symptoms
are similar. Phomopsis dieback, which is triggered by stress,
causes wilting and yellowing foliage and dying twigs and branches.
If you cut a stem of the plant and see brown streaks, Phomopsis is
the problem. Remove any affected branches to try to control the
situation. This may work, and with special care through this heat
and drought, your plants may make it. Keep the soil moist but not
soggy. Mulch well. You could try a copper or sulfur spray or ask
your nurseryman for a systemic spray.
</P>
<P>
   Another disease that strikes azaleas is root rot, which is
usually triggered by poor drainage. At work here is the fungus
Phytophthora, encouraged in warm, wet conditions. When this fungus
is at work, you'll see wilting, discolored, then dead leaves.
Branches may die. Ensuring good drainage is the best preventative.
A systemic fungicide also can be used as a control. Remove affected
branches. If the shrub does not survive, remove and replenish the
soil in that area.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, detected problems with a couple of azaleas last year. I
removed affected branches and gave those shrubs extra care and so
far have not had to use fungicides. The shrubs seem to have
recovered, but with the incredible extremes we've had these past
two years, it's not surprising when any plant falters or fails.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a tuberose that is planted in a medium-size black pot
that rests in a decorative planter. It has done well and put on two
flower stalks loaded with white buds. The flowers have never
opened. The plant is on my deck and gets afternoon and evening sun.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tuberoses like sun and a well-draining, organically enriched
soil. I'm not trying to duck a real answer here _ but if yours are
receiving proper culture, I think it's not only too hot by day, but
too hot at night for flowers to behave as they ``should.''

CAPPUCCINO AND KHAKIS: A WOODSTOCK WITHOUT THE PURPLE HAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ This time there was no mud, very little garbage
and no free-for-all at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Day in the Garden'' _ actually three days of rock music
_ on the site of the original 1969 Woodstock festival, has
generated a cultural critical mass of its own. Though it has drawn
a fraction of the 400,000 people who flooded Max Yasgur's farm for
the concert 29 years ago and fewer than the 30,000 promoters had
hoped for on Saturday, a sense of optimism and accomplishment
abounded in the countryside over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the first time around, there was no shortage of
bathroom facilities or food at ``A Day in the Garden.'' Vendors
were doing a brisk business selling cappuccino ($3.50 for a small,
$5 for a large), and grilled portabello sandwiches with french
fries for $5 a pop. Tye-dyed T-shirts, hemp dresses and rope
bracelets abounded. An enterprising Cornelius Alexy hawked metal
peace sign pendants he swore were crafted from pieces of the fence
that gate crashers ripped down 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stardust, we are golden and we've got to get ourselves
back to the garden,'' Joni Mitchell wrote in her 1970 anthem,
``Woodstock.'' On Saturday afternoon, Mitchell delivered a mellow
set to an appreciative crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of people who attended ``A Day in the Garden''
weren't alive in 1969. Generation Xers with signature baggy jeans
and T-shirt and halter tops mixed with bikers with chest-long
beards and boomers sporting earrings and khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Concertgoers arrived with young children in tow. Families sat on
blankets or lounged in lawn chairs while listening to performers
like Melanie and Richie Havens _ both alumni of the original
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   Some even sprang for the wooden folding chairs, which were being
rented for $20 apiece or $30 for two.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 State Police troopers set up nine traffic
checkpoints around the concert site, effectively barring those who
did not have either tickets or official credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The natural amphitheater was surrounded by five miles of wooden
split-rail fences, manned every 50 feet by plain-clothes officers
to discourage gate crashing, the police said. The few people caught
trying to sneak into the site were asked to purchase tickets or to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Even though several ``beer gardens'' started serving at 11 a.m.,
the animated crowd remained well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the pasteurized, '90s version is a worthy
successor to the 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Fair that almost
instantly achieved cultural landmark status remains up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Concert organizer and developer Allan Gerry, who made his
fortune in cable television, sees the new festival as a positive
change with a chance to improve the future of the region. So do
Bethel town officials, who hope Gerry's plans to turn fields
surrounding the 37-acre site into a park to showcase an array of
American music will bring a much-needed economic boost to
economically struggling region.
</P>
<P>
   The lower Catskills two hours from New York City are no longer
the thriving Borscht Belt resort area with bungalows, hotels and
entertainment. But the current concert's organizers have fixed
their gazes firmly on the future. Gerry's vision includes a
permanent stage where the original Woodstock stage stood along with
a hotel, restaurants and a museum of popular music.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Lynne DiCostanzo, a 46-year-old physician
from nearby Callicoon, and Maureen Baxter, a 49-year-old nurse
practitioner from Rock Hill, rented chairs and set themselves up
near the middle of the sloping lawn. ``Of all the things I have
done in my life, I will never, never forget Woodstock,'' said
DiCostanzo, who wore a T-shirt and shorts, herself a hippie at
heart. ``But this is wonderful, very pleasant. We really need
something like this here. The county is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mike Rinaldi, who was born 18 years and several miles away
in Marrowsburg: ``I don't think this is anything like what happened
in 1969, but it's cool,'' he said. ``A lot of people are moving
away. Anything would be better than that.''

ANTI-GAY AD STIRS CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Daniel Leifler said he spent ``20 years asking
God to make me straight, praying and praying and praying some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Leifler is out of the closet and his faith in God is
stronger than ever. He said he spent years wanting God to make him
heterosexual instead of accepting ``that God made me gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Leifler, 40, was one of 16 gay Christians interviewed Sunday at
Metropolitan Community Church in San Francisco's Castro District
who shared their responses to a full-page advertisement published
Sunday in the San Francisco Examiner by a group that claims it can
cure gays and lesbians of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   That ad features a photograph of about 100 smiling men and women
described as ``ex-gays'' and offers to help homosexuals change
their orientation through faith, saying, ``many have walked out of
homosexuality ... into sexual celibacy or even marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of four similar ads that have appeared in the New York
Times, Washington Post and other newspapers in the past month. A
coalition of 15 Christian groups paid $35,000 to the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency to place the ad in the news pages of the Sunday
Examiner, which also is received by subscribers of the San
Francisco Chronicle. The Chronicle had rejected the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any newspapers that understand these issues, I
thought it would be in San Francisco,'' Leifler said. ``I'm very
disappointed. I thought you knew better.''
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Managing Editor Sharon Rosenhause said, ``The Examiner
accepted the ad because the newspaper does not believe in censoring
any group's views, however abhorrent they may be. While we accepted
the ad, we also published an editorial in Sunday's paper,
expressing the paper's view that the ad `represents a perversion of
Christian ideals.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the ads have sparked a firestorm of controversy
among gays, lesbians and psychologists specializing in sexual
orientation. They call the ads' claims wrong and hateful.
</P>
<P>
   The ads contend homosexuality is learned behavior, not innate,
as many gay activists have argued in their campaign for civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claiming that sexual orientation is chosen is like claiming
that the Earth is flat,'' Leifler said. ``There's no scientific
basis for their claims. They just want it to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, there were a handful of callers to The
Examiner who were critical of the newspaper's decision to publish
the ad. No one could be reached Sunday at the toll-free number for
Exodus Ministries, the group that placed the ad. Exodus is an
umbrella organization of religious groups that uses counseling to
help gays and lesbians who want to be straight. The 25-year-old
organization moved from San Rafael, Calif., to Seattle two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was denounced from the pulpit at the Metropolitan
Community Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We of the Metropolitan Community Church refute the claims made
by the ad regarding the sinful nature of homosexuality, and we
refute the claim that any person's sexual orientation needs to be
changed,'' the Rev. Karen Foster, assistant pastor, told the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When violence against gay and lesbian people is on the rise,
when young people who suspect they are gay commit suicide at
alarming rates, rhetoric that claims homosexuality is a sinful
disease is both irresponsible and absolutely contrary to the love
and compassion central to the Christian ethic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most parishioners interviewed took issue with the claims made by
the ad and the right-wing groups behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad is using the guise of religion to promote hatred and
intolerance,'' said Betsy Hosick, a parishioner from Castro Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow parishioner Joe Miller agreed, saying: ``God created us
just as we are. This ad isn't designed to help anyone. This ad is
designed to play on the fear of the unknown and stir up support
among conservatives for the right-wing agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   For homosexual Christians such as Leifler, the ads' claims
stirred painful reminders of their own personal struggles to
reconcile their belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ with their
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one group has a monopoly on faith in God,'' said
parishioner Paul Slaikeu of Hayward. ``The groups behind this ad
have a very limited perspective on God. ... It shows that some
people are rather out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservative Christian groups believe that one can't be
both gay and religious, and they have taken strong public stances
against homosexuality. Sunday's ad praised football player Reggie
White and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ``for having
the courage to speak the truth about sexual sin.''
</P>
<P>
   But a whole wing of Christianity sees otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 29 years, we in this church have and continue to celebrate
ourselves as gay and lesbian Christian people,'' Foster said.
``Both our sexuality and our spirituality are gifts from God, and
we celebrate those gifts.''

SLOPPINESS VS. MAKE-BELIEVE AT THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The flap at The Boston Globe over different
punishments meted out to two transgressing columnists, one a black
female, the other a white male, illustrates how race impacts what
otherwise might have been just another dispute over journalistic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith wrote movingly about Boston's minorities, as
befits a writer who is also a poet. She resigned at the editor's
request because she had made up people and conversations for large
parts of four columns.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barnicle made his reputation evoking Boston's blue-collar
world, and cultivated national stature from his frequent
appearances on television. Less than two months after Smith had to
leave, Barnicle was caught presenting as his own thoughts eight
one-liners that appear to have been rewritten from a book by comic
George Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   After Barnicle claimed he had not read the book, his editor
suspended him for one month without pay. Whereupon the television
station where he appeared regularly showed a clip in which he
recommended the Carlin book to his viewers. At this point, the
editor asked for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle refused. He took to TV and radio to drum up support and
an advertiser, readers and other Globe staffers all lobbied on his
behalf. The editor changed his mind and handed him a two-month
suspension without pay, which Barnicle agreed he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, editor Matthew Storin came under fire for
adopting a double-standard because of race and/or gender. Joining
in the escalating criticisms were Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz (with whom Barnicle has feuded in print), the Boston
chapter of the NAACP, a racially mixed group of Boston Globe
staffers, other African-American activists and even the editorial
page editor of The New York Times, owner of the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   In our time, self-consciousness about race almost invariably
tends to enmesh issues involving blacks and whites, heightening
tensions and the stakes in play. What might otherwise be an
ordinarily complicated dispute over fairness gets caught up in
racial politicking, making matters worse. That grim reality
underlies what is happening at The Boston Globe. To the contrary,
the American ideal is that race should not matter, that common
decency ought to command that everyone in the same boat be treated
equally. As hallowed as that proposition might have been in
national mythology, it did not flourish in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, to assure fairness, the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
following by nearly 100 years an earlier civil rights law, made
discriminatory treatment of employees of different races and both
sexes illegal. For the first time, the mythology was given
practical means of achievement. Another law, the Civil Rights Act
of 1991, provides that ``the complaining party demonstrates that
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was the motivating
factor'' in the discipline.
</P>
<P>
   At The Boston Globe, Barnicle partisans invoked race to defend
their man. They reasoned that his offense, copping a few jokes, was
not in the same ball park as making up all or large parts of
columns. They argued that Barnicle was being pressured to resign to
provide a perception of racial equity to the discipline meted out.
</P>
<P>
   Race was not raised by Patricia Smith's supporters until the
demand for Barnicle's resignation was withdrawn. Then her
punishment was no longer regarded as legitimate to preserve the
integrity of the newspaper. Yet examining the facts coldly,
Barnicle's offense was of a different magnitude from Smith's.
Moreover, her editor says she had been warned three years ago
against making things up in her column.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, questions were also raised about the factualness of
some quotes in Barnicle's columns. According to the editors,
nothing had been found to confirm fakery. Smith, on the other hand,
admitted to what she did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle belatedly explained about the column material that his
TV commentary had been filmed several months before it was telecast
and he had forgotten having recommended the book, which he insists
he did not read, but which his friends discussed with him.
</P>
<P>
   Newsroom staffers at the Globe were angered by Barnicle not
having been forced to leave, in part, apparently, because they felt
he is a prima donna not held to the same standards that the rest of
them were.
</P>
<P>
   In journalism, there is nothing worse than the writer who
concocts a story and presents it as fact. A newspaper columnist may
resort to fictional techniques to make a point, but the reader has
to be aware that is going on. The reader can be clued in through a
direct statement or by way of an obvious implication or hyperbole,
for example, the late Mike Royko's use of his alter-ego, barfly
Slats Grobnik, as a foil. Patricia Smith was properly disciplined
because she committed an intolerable offense over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barnicle, who is guilty of personal arrogance and
inattention to his job while pursuing television celebrity,
deserved reprimand, maybe more than he got, but not firing. Not
quite yet. He has to get back to earth and to work. If he gets
seriously sloppy again, he also should have to go. Stardom should
be an attribute of excellence, not a substitute for it.

ANTIQUITIES FROM UKRAINE TO MAKE U.S. DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>

   SAN ANTONIO _ Golden treasures of the ancient Scythians, rarely
seen outside Ukraine, will make their U.S. debut at the San Antonio
Museum of Art in a major national touring exhibit scheduled for
November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scythian Gold: Treasures from Ancient Ukraine'' will feature
165 objects dating from the fifth to third centuries B.C. With
armor, weaponry, jewelry and ceremonial objects, the works of art
also include gold sculptures of animals and men on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Masterpieces never before seen in the United States include a
gold helmet bearing relief scenes of Scythian warriors locked in
combat, in a style clearly influenced by ancient Greek vase
painting. A gold cut-out plaque depicts winged dragons is a blend
of Near Eastern motifs and Greek iconography.
</P>
<P>
   After opening in San Antonio, the exhibit will travel to the
Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, which co-organized the show, and
then tour to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Brooklyn
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Scythian objects are from the Treasures of Ukraine Museum
and the Archaeological Institute in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.
This will be the first exhibit to be sent abroad by the country
since it declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although small groups of Scythian objects from the Ukraine
have been seen in several European cities over the past few years,
this will be the largest and most complete exhibition ever
assembled from the Scythian material in Ukraine,'' said Gerry
Scott, interim director of the San Antonio Museum of Art and the
curator of ancient art.
</P>
<P>
   A nomadic people who originated in the central Asian steppes
sometime in the early first millennium B.C., the Scythians ruled a
great expanse of European plains that stretched from the Danube,
east across what is today Ukraine and into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce warriors with a love of grandeur and beauty, the
Scythians made drinking cups out of their enemies' skulls. The
abrupt disappearance of the Scythians, who were feared as
invincible marauders for 400 years, remains as mysterious as their
wandering existence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what is known about the Scythians has been uncovered
during archaeological excavations of burial mounds known as
``kurgans.'' Many of the animal sculptures reflect influence from
ancient Near Eastern cultures, while others are in the Greek style.
</P>
<P>
   The Scythians probably traded wheat and slaves with the Greeks,
which provided them with much of their wealth. Also featured will
be gilded bronze Greek vessels discovered near the Dnieper River,
which flows through Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Reeder, the Walters curator of ancient art, said, ``Many
of the recently excavated objects in the exhibition represent a new
chapter, even a new book, on the interrelationships of the ancient
Greek world, the ancient Near East and the steppes that extended
from north of the Black Sea as far as the Alti Republic near
Mongolia. It is this latter area that will continue to be of timely
interest as oil and natural gas exploration make it better known,
better traveled and better published.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first Scythian exhibit to visit this country
since a 1975 exhibit toured to New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the objects from the 1975 exhibit will be featured in
the new show, including the celebrated ``gorytos,'' a bow and arrow
case, with relief scenes closely related to the art of classical
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Other famous objects that will return to the United States
include two gold scabbards and swords bearing scenes of animal
combat, and a foot-high gold plaque designed for a horse's head.
The plaque bears a hunting scene of horse and rider that is similar
to the art of the Asian steppes.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the objects in the exhibit have been excavated since
1975 and will be seen in this country for the first time. Newly
discovered objects include a leafy-footed, bearded man who looks
part Scythian, part Assyrian. There's also a belt of lion heads
directly related to Persian imagery.

THE TROUBLE WITH CLINTON'S TROUBLES

   Commentary

 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dave Hepp thought it was a reasonable question.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner, Lise Bang-Jensen, host a public television
program called ``Inside Albany.'' They were moderating a debate the
other night between the three candidates for the Democratic
nomination for the Senate seat now held by Alfonse D'Amato, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green, New York City's public advocate, has always been a
strong voice for integrity and truthfulness in government. Former
Rep. Geraldine Ferraro is an old Washington hand and has endured a
few trials of her own in public life _ her husband's real estate
operations in New York City, for example, her son's drug problems.
Rep. Charles E. Schumer sits on the House Judiciary Committee.
Conceivably, he could have to consider this question in concrete
form instead of just as a hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   So the other night in a large meeting room at an Albany hotel _
during a political debate sponsored by the Public Employees
Federation, a big state government union _ Dave Hepp asked this:
``Before we go to questions from union members out here, I'd like
to just get a quick response to President Clinton's troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of public employee union people laughed nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just got your quick response,'' Schumer snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Hepp plowed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, he's about to testify before a grand jury. Isn't
it time for him to tell all?''
</P>
<P>
   The response was loud groans and boos from the crowd, as though
Hepp was some pro wrestler kicking the good guy in the crotch while
the referee was looking elsewhere. Undaunted, Hepp pressed for his
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And under what circumstances,'' Dave Hepp asked, ``would you
urge President Clinton to resign?''
</P>
<P>
   That question was greeted by a spirited chorus of boos from the
crowd. Schumer took the occasion to say that Ken Starr is a
wretched human being. It was one of the few things Mark Green
agreed with him on. And Ferraro responded that nobody cares about
any of this except reporters.
</P>
<P>
   I was there that night, watching that ugly scene. I talked with
Dave Hepp about it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   He told me, ``I was surprised that as soon as I mentioned
President Clinton's troubles the boos broke out ... It was the
first time I've gotten booed at a debate, not being a candidate. In
retrospect, I'm not really surprised. It was a Democratic crowd,
and afterward I talked to some people. And they said, `We don't
want to hear about this. It's you press people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always, you know, when you can't find a whipping boy,
it's the press at fault ... As soon as the candidates got that
reaction from the crowd, they said, `Oh boy, we'll handle this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So you just ask the question. I've been pounded on by the best
of them. What the hell?''
</P>
<P>
   I've gotten the same thing _ on my voice mail number, on my talk
radio show. Who cares if the president lied about a fling with some
woman? That's private. Why did they even ask him about that in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Paula Jones sued him, alleging that he'd come on
like a pig with her in private. The judge in the case said, ``OK,
since it's your word against his, Ms. Jones, you can call other
employees on whom he might have hit to establish a pattern of
behavior on his part to bolster your case. And you can ask him if
he came on with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Private stuff? Sure. If, that is, you want to kiss goodbye to
enforcing sexual harassment laws, if you want bosses to lie with
impunity in these cases, regardless of the evidence. That's the
price of privacy in matters like this. But, really, who cares,
right?

THE BARD GOES TO MANHATTAN IN NEW TAKE ON `MACBETH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a brilliant day in Manhattan, and the songbirds
are trilling their joy. Sunlight spills through a canopy of leaves
onto the stone walls and arches of Fort Tryon Park, a rolling snake
of green that undulates above the spikes-and-slabs topography of
Washington Heights.Macbeth and his Lady embrace on the path before
a small mob of filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your face, my thane, is as a book where men may read strange
matters,'' she says, reaching out to caress her husband's rugged
visage. The birds chirrup. A heavy camera skids back on a dolly.
Lady Macbeth moves closer, holds his hand to her lips, stares
lovingly into his eyes. They kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on cue, the planes arrive. Two of them, searing across the
tufted sky from La Guardia Airport, adding ungodly 20th-century
noise to a sedate medieval scene. William Shakespeare would not
approve.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the director, Greg Lombardo, a wiry 28-year-old with
quick blue eyes and a pronounced addiction to cigarettes. He takes
a drag, peers at the jets arcing overhead. He winces.``Cut!'' he
snaps at his entwined stars, who relax and step back in
late-afternoon slants of light.
</P>
<P>
   They are a handsome couple: Lady Macbeth, robed in a glorious
ankle-length wine sheath, is Gloria Reuben, best known as Jeanie
Boulet on ``ER.'' Playing her tortured general is Nick Gregory, a
veteran of independent film (``Last Summer in the Hamptons'') whose
Ceasar haircut tops an altitudinous figure. He doesn't stand; he
looms.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory and Reuben are the leads in ``Macbeth in Manhattan,'' an
aptly titled independent production produced and co-written by
filmmaker Joe Gagen.
</P>
<P>
   It's Gagen's first feature film. He's done industrial and
corporate videos before, and as a lifelong film buff he has long
dreamed of producing ``something tangible ... something that maybe
people could enjoy and get sustenance from.''
</P>
<P>
   But this brisk, 20-day shoot in the urban wilds of Manhattan
marks his real introduction to the insomniac madness of making
movies. ``A friend of mine who is a big-time producer said to me:
`Making a film is like going to war,' says Gagen, a
gentle-mannered, quietly persuasive man of 58. ``Filming just takes
over every minute of your day. There are so many demands whenever
you're the director or the producer. You are constantly, constantly
busy and it doesn't end with the 12-hour days that are allotted for
filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday in June, and Gagen has just come off a
particularly trying run: He and his wife, Vera, allowed their house
on West 94th Street to be used as a set for almost a week. For six
straight days, several dozen cast and crew members squatted in
their living room, ate, drank, perspired, used the bathroom, moved
furniture around and muscled sundry tech equipment into the nooks
and crannies of their home. It was not an easy fit. And while Gagen
is glad to trim fat from the budget, turning his abode into a
soundstage is one cost-cutting measure he isn't likely to try
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never use your home as a set,'' he says, his affable face
sagging with battle fatigue. ``That's the first rule of
producing.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/A producer's woes are never-ending. The director may helm
the day-to-day filming, but the producer is responsible for keeping
the entire thing afloat. Gagen isn't just the bean counter: He
obtains the beans (in this case, from private investors), tallies
the beans, dishes out the beans and frets when the beans run short.
</P>
<P>
   It's been seven takes already, and for a small-budget film (less
than $500,000), that's a lot of celluloid. The sun is getting low,
and the director's getting itchy Lombardo isn't one for ordering
take after take after take. Besides, he says, ``This has to be the
last take I have to go to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs, tugs at another cigarette, shuffles a foot on the
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben and Gregory take their marks for the eighth time. Then
Gregory steps back, batting at his head ``a bug bite,'' he says.
``I could just feel it on my ear.'' Lombardo is willing to call it
a day, but Reuben wants another shot. So, take eight. Take nine.
And take 10, which gets Lombardo's relieved OK despite the jet
passing imperiously overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thumbs up! Cut! We got it!'' he says, then steps back from the
flicker of a video monitor. The shot is finished. ``Macbeth in
Manhattan'' is one scene closer to completion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movies are different on screen than on paper, but a read through
Gagen's and Lombardo's script reveals Shakespeare with a dash of
soap: It's the bickering behind the Bard, a contemporary tale of
actors rehearsing a stage production of ``Macbeth'' in New York
City. As work on the play progresses, cast members become embroiled
in their own tale of sex, betrayal and revenge, assuming the traits
of their characters in the play and engaging in an eerily similar
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Macbeth, for those who haven't read the play since high school,
is a triumphant general with dreams of ruling Scotland.
Unfortunately for him, King Duncan already wears the crown. But
Macbeth's conniving, seductive wife persuades her morally
ambivalent husband to murder Duncan, pin the blame on a couple of
drunk guards and thereby assume the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Horrific consequences ensue; Macbeth slaughters several other
people, including the wife and children of his main rival, MacDuff
(played in the film by David Lansbury, Angela's nephew), while Lady
Macbeth is unhinged by guilt (``Out, damned spot!''). The king dies
by the sword of MacDuff. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's oeuvre ``is fantastic, you can always reinvent
it,'' says Lombardo, whose work as artistic director of the touring
National Shakespeare Company caught Gagen's eye last year. When
Gagen approached Lombardo with an idea for an updated ``Macbeth,''
their first impulse was to write the script as a comic documentary,
similar to ``Looking for Richard,'' Al Pacino's sly exegesis of
``Richard III.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE...MORE)
</P>
<P>
   But as the project progressed, it became less of a mockumentary
and more of a Russian nesting doll, a play-within-a-film that
embraces layers upon layers of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the play, Macbeth wants to be a superstar,'' Lombardo
explains, ``so when you set that against a backdrop of people who
are ambitious or greedy... '' He trails off. After mulling over the
differences between film and stage, he says: ``The idea of a play
within a play is such a common theme in Shakespeare. To do a play
within a film is a natural.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The only downside to fiddling with ``Macbeth'' is its legendary
curse actors have expired performing the role. As a result,
superstitious thespians routinely refer to it as ``The Scottish
Play,'' hoping to avoid death, injury or other insult sparked by
the wrath of Shakespeare. ``Macbeth in Manhattan'' is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning it was really kind of scary, because one
person fell off the stage,'' says Gregory. ``Then I stabbed David
Lansbury'' in the arm, during a swordfight; he recovered ``and I
had one incident on my third day of rehearsals when a person came
up to me and said, `Is it dangerous riding on those bicycles?' It
was like witches with omens. I really wondered whether I would be
injured by the end of the shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its tinkering, the film stays true to the spirit of
``Macbeth.'' The screenplay blends scenes from Shakespeare's
original with contemporary sequences set amid the hubbub of modern
Manhattan; tying them together is a soliloquizing ``Chorus,'' a hip
young emcee who keeps the audience up to date on the political
rumblings in assorted Scottish castles. Played by actor Harold
Perrineau (of TV's ``Oz'' and last seen on the big screen as bear
food in ``The Edge''), he pops up throughout the film in different
guises as a costume designer, a makeup man, a fellow sweeping the
stage. The role was conceived as a bridge, an ambassador of sorts
between Shakespeare and his silicon-age interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually gives me a lot of different things to do,'' says
Perrineau, a bolt of energy with a beaming grin. ``He's not really
one character, but he is there in different ways, as a stage hand
or a (street) person. It's been fun figuring out what to do with
each of them. `Oh, my God! What do I do for this character?'''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his castmates, Perrineau doesn't utter any of the Bard's
actual dialogue. Reuben and Gregory get their share. ``For any
actor, it's really a good challenge,'' says Reuben, scooting across
an intersection at Broadway and 97th on her way to shoot another
scene. Juggling two distinct characters divorced by space and time
is, she says, a tricky proposition. ``It kind of gets intricate:
I'm an actress playing an actress playing Lady Macbeth. But it's
timeless. The messages and the relationships and the character
traits are timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory agrees. ``It's the best material in the world, you
know,'' he says of Shakespeare's text. He says Gagen's and
Lombardo's screenplay is one of the sharpest he's read ``in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He has great expectations for the finished product. ``It's
really rare that you get a product where the director, actor and
the writing are all good,'' Gregory says. ``It's usually one good
actor, or it's not written that well, or it's got a bad director.
But this film has potential to turn out really great so I'm really
excited.''

DIANA REDUX: GET READY FOR THE MEDIA ONSLAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVIS ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She haunts us still. When Princess Diana died
suddenly and tragically Aug. 31, 1997, in Paris, much of the world
plunged into intense, prolonged public mourning.
</P>
<P>
   A media icon in life, Diana is a de facto saint in death. She
will be canonized anew with documentaries and updated reports on
the fatal car crash in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone on Earth knew Diana secondhand, solely through
media images: Her wedding portraits, pictures of her charity work,
her carefully crafted confessional TV interview, the state funeral
watched by a tearful audience of 2.5 billion. Her many admirers
feel they knew her personally and easily accept her self-coronation
as ``the people's princess.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no mean feat for a rich blueblood, a pal of pop stars,
fashion designers and playboys. Yet, such is the power of the
camera that distant celebrities seem more ``real'' than people we
really know. Differences in class, race and nationality become
blurred in a facsimile of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Many media outlets are planning fresh Diana tributes,
culminating on and near the Aug. 31 anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Attenborough's ``Diana,'' a two-hour documentary film by
the director of ``Gandhi,'' will air in prime time Aug. 31 on NBC.
Additionally, ``Dateline NBC'' plans to devote a show to the late
princess.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, CBS will air Diana packages on the ``CBS
Evening News,'' ``The CBS Morning Show'' and ``48 Hours.'' MSNBC,
the cable network owned by Microsoft and NBC, will devote blocks of
programming to Diana over seven days, Aug. 28 through Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's ratings soared when the then year-old network pre-empted
programming to obsess about Di immediately after her death. ``We
had our highest numbers ever,'' recalls spokeswoman Cameron
Blanchard. ``Our numbers went to 3.0 for the top quarter-hour
during the funeral.'' That's about 1 million households. MSNBC
averaged a barely-there 0.1 rating, 39,000 households, before
Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   After Diana's demise, MSNBC permanently dropped programs,
including the technology show ``The Site.'' ``We wanted to be more
reactive to breaking news,'' Blanchard says.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Epstein, the MSNBC programming executive overseeing this
year's ``Diana: The First Anniversary'' package, says, ``There's a
serious interest among the public on this, on her humanity and her
message. She's still huge. There's a continuing fascination with
this woman and the royals.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC will kick off Aug. 28 with NBC News' Donatella Lorch and
Charles Sabine reporting from Paris and London. On Aug. 30, MSNBC
anchor Jodi Applegate will host a live, one-hour special from
London, adding more updates the next day. Starting Aug. 31, ``Time
&AMP; Again's'' Jane Pauley presents the first of four nightly one-hour
reports on Di and the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard declines to divulge how much the shows cost or how
much revenue MSNBC expects to take in, but Epstein says any efforts
devoted to Diana are well worth it. ``It's the story that put us on
the map,'' he says. ``It showed viewers the depth of NBC News.
Clearly we knew we would devote significant resources to it'' this
year.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine, which put Diana's face on the cover a
mind-boggling 43 times before she died and published an all-Diana
keepsake issue last September, does not plan to do a new
stand-alone issue. Instead People will include a Diana package in
an upcoming regular issue, says spokeswoman Susan Ollinick, who
doesn't say if Diana will again adorn the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Barring big Ken and Monica news, it wouldn't be wise to bet
against Diana. She has been a big money-maker for Time Inc.'s
People. Published reports say that four issues of People with Diana
as cover girl sold out, each issue bringing in an extra $1 million
in ad revenue. People, with a paid circulation of 3.5 million and
profits of more than $200 million a year, is America's most
profitable magazine.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: On Sept. 5, 1997, six days after Diana's death, Mother
Teresa died. Like Diana, Mother Teresa did good works. Unlike Di,
36, Mother Teresa was old, 87, and not a glamorous dresser. How
many major network TV specials will air on the first anniversary of
Mother Teresa's passing?

SAVING PVT. TICAO, AND OTHER PHILIPPINE WAR HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMIL GUILLERMO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everyone wants to save Private Ryan. No one
wants to save Pvt. Felizardo Ticao.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. T. Cow? No, Ticao. He's Filipino. He's one of those heroes
no one seems to give a damn about. In a few short years, he's
likely to die, our debt to him unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   But Pvt. Ryan? He's hotter now than on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' has grossed over $100 million already.
Considering all the eventual revenue streams, the film's grosses
could finance a small war. Hooray for World War II. The one we
actually won. But not without help.
</P>
<P>
   The war in the Pacific was won with the capable support of
Filipinos _ like Pvt. Ticao _ enlisted to fight alongside American
forces. People know vaguely about Bataan and Corregidor. They know
of the death marches and the Japanese concentration camps. But few
people know of the more than 200,000 Filipino men who were promised
full benefits to fight for America _ only to be cruelly cut off at
war's end by something known as the Rescission Act of 1946.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the Pvt. Ryan phenomenon fairly ironic. While money
is rolling in buckets to the movie, there's not much money from
anybody, specifically the U.S. government, to save real heroes like
Pvt. Felizardo Ticao. Ticao was awarded the Purple Heart by Gen.
Douglas MacArthur. He got the same award, but not the same
benefits. You won't find Pvt. Ticao's tale of patriotism and
heroism at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   To experience the heartache of his continuing war, one can look
at photographer Rick Rocamora's exhibit, ``Unfinished Mission: The
American Journey of Filipino WWII Veterans,'' currently on display
at the San Francisco Art Commission Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Stare into the proud but somber eyes of Ticao, 80. A hero who
helped defeat the Japanese, he's been whipped by the squalor of
American homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   See another Purple Heart recipient, Melecio Cayao, play with the
hook attached to the prosthetic device that replaces his right arm.
The Rescission Act slashed his veterans benefits in half. You'd
figure a right arm would be worth something to a right-wing
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the Filipino vets, they arrived in San Francisco
and Los Angeles in the 1980s, looking to be made whole. But with
Congress blocking veterans benefits (an estimated $1.4 billion),
most veterans are forced onto welfare.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the pot of gold they were seeking. They want their
benefits, not welfare, said Rocamora. But they're also afraid of
dying in America. They're willing to settle before they're sent
back to the Philippines in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has until October to grant the money and end the
bureaucratic death march. But it's unlikely to happen. Is that
anyway to treat legitimate war heroes? It is when no one cares
about saving Pvt. Ticao.

them:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRESIDENCY _ WASHINGTON _ The prolonged investigations
into President Clinton's personal life and his past financial
dealings have forever changed the presidency. Experts believe that
court decisions requiring the testimony of Secret Service agents
assigned to the president, as well as rulings stripping away
executive privilege from top presidential aides, will cause future
presidents to alter their conduct, making them unreasonably
cautious about everything they say or do while in the White House.
And forcing the commander-in-chief to testify in civil trials and
grand juries, as Clinton did on Monday, could signal a future in
which presidents spend much of their time with lawyers prepping to
take part in court proceedings. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through Whitewater
despite a public that often preferred to hear less rather than more
about presidential scandal. They weathered the backlash of the
Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance from fellow
reporters and their own publications. Now the handful of
journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies for
six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever appearance
by a president before a criminal grand jury. The persistence of
fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely responsible for
keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the country. ``The
heroes are the ones that have kept it alive,'' says Britt Hume, who
anchors an evening report on Washington for Fox Cable News. ``These
people have done tremendously well on this story, and it hasn't
been easy.'' Among them: Susan Schmidt of The Washington Post,
Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Steve Labaton of The New York Times, Pete
Yost of the AP, as well as Jackie Judd and Chris Vlasto of ABC.
(Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   US-ADULTERY _ WASHINGTON _ Despite President Clinton's high
approval ratings in the face of allegations of marital infidelity,
a huge majority of Americans still believe adultery is wrong,
according to polling data. And adultery among the average American
couple is far less common than the flurry of recent allegations
against Clinton and other public figures would suggest, say
sociologists, marriage counselors and clergy. But in cases of
divorce, adultery plays a much larger role. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).

   IRELAND-BOMBING _ OMAGH, Northern Ireland ? Police arrested five
suspects at dawn today in connection with the car bomb that killed

religiously mixed town in Northern Ireland. The suspects were
arrested in two villages north and southeast of Omagh and taken to
the main police center in Belfast, 70 miles to the east. Under
Northern Ireland?s anti-terrorist law, they could be questioned for
up to a week before being charged or released. (Roughton, Cox News

   JAMAICA-VIAGRA _ KINGSTON, Jamaica _ A 70-year-old man accused
of raping a 27-year-old woman after taking a dose of Viagra goes
before a judge on Tuesday(Aug. 18) in what may be the world's
first-ever Viagra assisted rape case. But the case comes as no
surprise here. Although the male-impotency drug is supposed to be
illegal in Jamaica, it's smuggled in because of its soaring
popularity and sold for as much as $20 a pill. Throughout Latin
America and the Caribbean, where male virility is a much-prized
attribute, Viagra has ignited widespread interest. People have even
stepped up campaigns to get indigenous potency products -- such as
the bois bande tree bark -- out to men who might be unable to
afford Viagra. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   INITIATIVE-AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION (Undated) Two years ago, in the
aftermath of California's passage of Proposition 209, it seemed
much of the nation was on the verge of following the Golden State's
lead and repealing affirmative action. Legislatures in 16 states
considered eliminating programs that take race and gender into
account in government hiring, contracting or school admissions.
Citizens in at least six states mounted signature-gathering drives
seeking to end affirmative action programs. But all those statewide
efforts have faltered, with one exception: Washington state. Voters
in Washington state will be asked to decide Nov. 3 whether to
abolish preferences for women and minorities designed to overcome
historic racial and sexual discrimination.

GORTON'S AID FOR MICROSOFT PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton's advocacy for Microsoft is being
rewarded with campaign contributions from company executives.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of the year, 23 Microsoft executives
have contributed to Gorton, even though the state's 70-year-old
senior senator isn't a candidate for anything and hasn't announced
whether he plans to seek re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money Gorton has received from Microsoft _ $7,250
from January through June _ is a small fraction of the $200,000
Gorton raised during that period.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of contributors from Microsoft _ most of whom
gave at a fund-raiser two weeks after Gorton made his first major
speech on the Senate floor defending the company _ is an indicator
of growing appreciation for the senator at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we have an annual gala, and this year there were
350 people there,'' said Gorton's chief of staff, Tony Williams.
``We have not had that number of people from Microsoft in the past.
They were there because they want Slade to run again in 2000, and
they want to be supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Gorton has received money from nearly four
times as many Microsoft employees as gave to him in all of last
year. In 1996, no one at Microsoft gave him money, and in 1995, he
got a contribution only from company Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has received money from more Microsoft employees than has
Sen. Patty Murray, who is running for re-election this year, and he
has received money from more employees than contributed to him the
last time he appeared on the ballot, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's current Microsoft contributors also are mostly
high-ranking executives, in contrast to Murray's Microsoft
contributors, who are generally middle managers.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's contributors to Gorton are half of Microsoft's
executive committee, including Steve Ballmer, the company
president; Bob Herbold, the executive vice president and chief
operating officer; Nathan Myhrvold, the chief technology officer;
and Jeff Raikes, group vice president for sales and support. The
contributors also include the company's top in-house lawyer,
William Neukom, and several of its other lawyers and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, a former state attorney general, has been a passionate
defender of Microsoft and a relentless attacker of its critics,
including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the fund-raiser, Gorton made another Senate floor
speech defending the company, and he has since given numerous
speeches and news conferences praising Microsoft and attacking its
critics. He has also opened his office for use by the company and
has agreed to represent Microsoft at a debate in Seattle this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft employees are very appreciative of Senator Gorton,
Senator Murray and the whole congressional delegation,'' company
spokesman Vivek Varma said. ``It's really not surprising to see
some of our employees participating in the process and supporting
political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, who has held elective office in Washington state for all
but two of the past 40 years, would turn 79 in the final days of a
fourth term in the Senate. Although he suffered a mild heart attack
in 1994, he says his health is fine _ he runs five miles a day _
and he seems energized by the power he possesses as a subcommittee
chairman and a confidant of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   According to a financial disclosure report recently received by
the Federal Election Commission, Gorton has $250,000 in his
campaign treasury. That is not much by Senate standards, but enough
to signal that he is not ruling out a future race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that he wants to keep all his political options
open and wants to keep his troops energized,'' Williams said. ``He
is doing all the things that lead me to believe he's going to be a
candidate (in 2000), and he has told his staff to make sure that
option is open.''
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that Gorton is spending money nearly as
fast as he raises it, mostly on direct mail to shore up his
contributor base. Most of Gorton's money is coming from Washington
state residents, not political action committees or out-of-state
residents.

GOV. WILSON'S GREATEST WORK MAY BE OVERSHADOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER SCHRAG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ With the completion of the 1998-99 budget,
the record on Pete Wilson's eight years as governor and California
policy-maker is now all but closed. Unless something totally
unexpected occurs in the next few months, it's a record in which
negative strokes of politics, though often successful, are likely
to be more memorable than the positive acts of policy.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the record, the biggest mystery is the governor
himself, a man whose better angels seemed forever to be warring
with his darker side. And it was that darker side that, through
much of his tenure, seemed most often to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   It did not begin that way. Wilson arrived in office as a fully
credentialed moderate flying the flag of what he called
``preventive government'' _ early intervention, particularly among
young children to reduce the need for more costly remediation later
on _ in health, in education, in crime control.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate _ and particularly as a supporter of abortion
rights _ and as a man who supported Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan
in the 1976 primaries, Wilson was never close to the conservative
heart of the California Republican Party. But in 1990, on the eve
of the 1991 decennial reapportionment, California Republicans
needed Wilson more than he needed them. He was by far the most
electable Republican, and a little moderation was a small price for
preventing the Democrats from gerrymandering the state one more
time.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous recession-driven budget deficit of his first year _
ultimately a total of $14 billion _ sharply constrained Wilson's
ability to pursue his prevention agenda. Family planning money was
immediately restored and a few symbolic health care initiatives
were launched, but not much more. Yet even Wilson's resolution of
that first budget crisis _ through an almost even balance of tax
increases and spending cuts _ was moderate and, in the face of a
Legislature dominated by Democrats, admirably pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   But in a state where parties are increasingly driven by
ideology, no pragmatic compromise earns much praise, and no good
deed, no matter how necessary, goes unpunished. Wilson got little
credit, particularly in his own party. The experience, combined
with the untimely death of his long-time friend and aide, Otto Bos,
early in his first term, seemed to have spooked Wilson so
profoundly that he has looked ever since like a man who has been
trying to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the amends-making was the dragged-in-by-the-heels
vehicle license fee cut that Wilson managed to win in the budget
negotiations just concluded. That, as some people charge, may just
be Wilson trying to make himself acceptable to conservative
Republican primary voters in New Hampshire in 2000. In part it may
also have been Wilson's effort to prove that the taxes he had to
approve in bad times were in fact repealed in good times.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been more fundamental consequences as well, most
particularly the emergence of the nasty-tough Pete who dominated
state affairs for much of the past eight years:
</P>
<P>
   _ The divisive wedge-issue politics of Proposition 187, the
initiative, since blocked by federal courts, that was designed to
deny schooling and other services to illegal immigrants, and the
inferential Mexican-bashing that accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The equally political exploitation of Proposition 209, the
measure prohibiting race-based affirmative action in California
public education, hiring and contracting.
</P>
<P>
   _ The heavy-handed attempt, in Proposition 226, to punish the
unions that have been his chief political adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ The blatant political arm-twisting in 1995, before Proposition
209 was passed, to make the University of California regents follow
his line on affirmative action. All this from a man who, as mayor
of San Diego and a state legislator, was a strong supporter of
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   _ The neglect of officially sanctioned brutality in the state's
prisons. The failure during his first five years in office to
address any of the state's pressing educational issues, even as the
state's schools were falling further into disrepair and
dysfunction; the quixotic presidential bid of 1995, despite his
promise to serve the gubernatorial term to which he had just been
elected.
</P>
<P>
   The relative merits of any single measure on the list of old
Wilson favorites are debatable. But surely not many people in the
future will look back on them as great progressive acts in public
policy or as steps that have in any measurable way enhanced the
public climate and quality of life in California.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Wilson has done a good deal in recent years to improve
preventive health care for children. He helped eliminate a long
list of expensive and scandal-plagued practices in the state's
workers' compensation program. He forced into place California's
first real statewide school testing program in a decade, a program
that, for all its flaws, should ultimately give Californians a
fairly decent relative measure of how well their schools and
children are doing. He appointed a first-rate group of justices to
the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that this list is likely to be overshadowed by the
other. It was ``three-strikes'' sentencing laws, the death penalty
and divisive proposals such as Propositions 187 and 209 that got
the public attention and Wilson's political energy _ the things
that he most wanted to be known for. Sadly, he will get his wish.

FILMMAKERS AIMED FOR `THE TRUTH' IN `FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jason Patric and Neil LaBute are an unlikely pair.
</P>
<P>
   One's an enigmatic, almost obscenely handsome actor, and the
other is a chubby, unkempt writer and director.
</P>
<P>
   But they've just completed collaborating on ``Your Friends and
Neighbors,'' LaBute's eagerly awaited second feature _ the followup
to his controversial, scathing comedy of corporative manners, ``In
The Company Of Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Patric has often played a loner anti-hero, teetering on the
precarious brink of stardom in a hit-and-miss string of movies like
``Rush,'' ``Sleepers,'' ``Geronimo,'' ``After Dark, My Sweet'' and
the dismal ``Speed 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Some projects never even opened in theaters _ indeed ``Denial''
tanked and went directly to video and ``Incognito'' has yet to be
released. But luck might be about to change for Patric, whose
granddad was comic Jackie Gleason and whose father is the
playwright Jason Miller.
</P>
<P>
   As Cary, the hard-core conscience and purveyor of truth in
``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' the actor finds himself in the
center of another dark, abrasive modern comedy of morals and
manners; this time set in the picture perfect apartments and trendy
homes of six ``friends'' in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Patric produced the film, along with Steve Golin, and it was
shot in brisk 22 days.
</P>
<P>
   The movie boasts a stellar cast _ Patric, Amy Brenneman, Aaron
Eckhart (who finally gets his due after playing the despicable Chad
in ``In The Company Of Men,'' and who put on 40 pounds to play this
role), Catherine Keener, Nastassja Kinski and Ben Stiller.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ``immorality tale'' about two couples and two singles
who are friends, and, if pushed, likely enemies. They scheme,
cheat, argue, love, covet and suffer together. ``Welcome to the
'90s,'' cautions the film's tag line.
</P>
<P>
   Patric and LaBute are anything but contentious on a hot Seattle
summer day. They have an easy camaraderie as they sip ginger ale in
their suite at the Olympic Four Seasons Hotel and eagerly talk
about the film that is sure to infuriate, distance and possibly
enlighten audiences.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute is keenly aware that he pushes buttons. He says though
``Your Friends and Neighbors'' might keep viewers at ``an
appropriate aesthetic distance,'' they can't help but be caught up
in what's happening onscreen because ``it uses human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conceit the playwright Brecht got wrong,'' says LaBute.
``He was great on paper but he forgot he was using people. That's
why I think we have a comedy here instead of a drama. People watch
it and laugh because there's a recognition factor. It isn't like,
say, a sci-fi film.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I use distance and shoot scenes in long takes,
we're still just presenting a situation and not passing judgment.
People always say, `Oh, I've been there,'' after they see it and
that's because no matter how far back I put the camera, it's still
human and it's still funny; it's funny in that awful, funny way we
humans get along with one another.``
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Your Friends and Neighbors'' often feels like a live
theater piece because it's so painfully intimate and full of
intense, talky scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film could be perceived as cruel but I think it's just
that it's hurtful in the way people can be hurtful,'' says Patric.
``I personally see the vulnerability in all these people. They just
make specific choices that ultimately are their demise.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute his goal wasn't to give the audience an easy ride, but to
find the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response I've gotten so far is, `I'm glad you're being
respectful to your characters because by doing so you're respectful
to us.' And all of these characters are surprising because they
aren't cookie cutter stereotypes of good and bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' asserts Patric. ``My character, Cary, for
example, isn't a braggart and he's not macho. I associate that with
people who are trying to impress. But he's the only character in
the whole movie who never lies. He's specific and that's what's
interesting about Neil's writing. Some of the best films are never
about whether we like the characters or wish they were real and we
could take them home with us, but just that they're human enough to
recognize them and to want to find out what eventually happens to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience of making what might be perceived as a
cold-blooded, ruthless movie could have been a trauma for the
actors. But Patric says making the film was a pleasure, plus
``there was great joy in watching afterward how truly proud they
were of their work, which is not the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey we went on in this film was very different from
how most movies are made,'' he insists. ``What I wanted to do as a
producer was create a great utopian existence for the cast because
I've never had that on a set. I knew it would cost money from the
budget but it had to be that way. It's what I believed acting was
really about _ the ensemble, the unity.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute concedes that he, too, tried to make the set a welcome
place. ``I'm a director. I'm not onscreen, but directors these days
obliquely say, `Hey look at me, I'm over here.' Therefore the
tricks never stop and there's a perpetual signal that says
`director at work.' Actors like to act, not in 30-second scenes but
for a long time. In this film, the actors set the pace, not the
editor or director. It goes as fast as real life. I like talky
films.''
</P>
<P>
   So does LaBute believe these six characters are emanations of
his own personality? ``Oh sure,'' he smiles. ``I'm some piece of
all of them. Everything is a cocktail. They're part of me, part of
people I know. The things that happen in this film are not foreign
to me because I'm alive and living amongst people and I recognize
what they represent. There are six very distinct views presented.''

   Patric says that he wasn't initially going to be an actor in the
film. ``I was just going to produce it. But when I read the script
I had a visceral response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had that kind of response to anything for a long
time. Early on in my career I was able to get good material and
some of the films I made were ahead of the dark indie curve.
Consequently, I spent a lot of time in the '90s with projects that
were only partially interesting. I'm at the point now where I want
to do things that I look forward to in a different way instead of
just making a career decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This film gave me the opportunity to be funny and it gave me
the chance to work with actors I wanted to work with. I liked the
fact it was hard-hitting because I don't like pandering to an
audience and I don't like fame for fame's sake.''

WASHINGTON INITIATIVE A BELLWETHER FOR ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, in the aftermath of California's passage of
Proposition 209, it seemed much of the nation was on the verge of
following the Golden State's lead and repealing affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures in 16 states considered eliminating programs that
take race and gender into account in government hiring, contracting
or school admissions. Citizens in at least six states mounted
signature-gathering drives seeking to end affirmative action
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But all those statewide efforts have faltered, with one
exception: Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Washington state will be asked to decide Nov. 3
whether to abolish preferences for women and minorities designed to
overcome historic racial and sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   As the only state in the country considering a repeal this
election season, Washington is being watched by both sides of the
affirmative action battle.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington residents _ mostly white and known nationally for
being mild and reasonable _ abolish affirmative action, activists
believe they'll have a much better chance of making their
anti-affirmative action cause a mainstream movement.
</P>
<P>
   If the state retains its preference program, defenders of
affirmative action are hopeful an already faltering movement will
peter out.
</P>
<P>
   Houston voted last year to retain the city's affirmative action
program. But the effect of that vote was muddied after a judge
threw out the results because of a dispute over the ballot
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common wisdom is that if a mellow, laid-back state like
Washington, which isn't Mississippi, passes this, it will show this
effort is not a right-wing jihad, but a respectable debate over an
important con-
</P>
<P>
   stitutional principal,'' said Michael Greve.
</P>
<P>
   He is executive director of the D.C.-based Center for Individual
Rights, a non-profit law firm that has successfully defended
California's 209 from legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law, a D.C.-based civil rights organization
tracking state efforts, said there's little question an Initiative
200 defeat would deal the movement a crippling blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opponents of affirmative action really thought after they were
successful in California they could spread this initiative like
wildfire across the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they found it just didn't have legs. So what they're
trying to do in Washington state is get a jump-start on batteries
that are running very low.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Washington became the only state to follow
California's lead this year sheds light on the difficulties
opponents of preference programs will face spreading their movement
farther.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, like California, had the key political ingredients _
grass-roots support, appealing ballot language and an infusion of
cash _ during the critical period in which signatures were being
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   California's Prop. 209 and Washington's I-200 also got their
starts in much the same way. Each was spurred by white men who
believed their state's affirmative action policies discriminated
against them and were damaging their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Two little-known San Francisco Bay-area academics, Glynn Custred
and Thomas Wood, were the masterminds behind California's ini-
</P>
<P>
   tiative.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Color Bind,'' a book recounting Prop. 209's
passage, the two scholars developed the wording of the initiative
after studying the language of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well
as polling data showing that voters who said they supported
affirmative action overwhelmingly disagreed with quotas and
programs that gave qualified blacks preference over equally
qualified whites.
</P>
<P>
   The final wording of the proposition, which is being copied on
Washington's ballot, said: ``The state shall not discriminate
against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group
on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origins in
the operation of public employment, public education or public con-
</P>
<P>
   tracting.
</P>
<P>
   Prop. 209 didn't mention affirmative action; it focused on
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Custred and Wood failed to get their initiative on the 1993
ballot. And their 1995 effort nearly faltered until Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson persuaded Ward Connerly, a high-profile black
businessman who led the repeal of affirmative action at the
University of California, to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's own experience had taught him that hard work and not
race was the key to success. He strongly believes affirmative
action programs are a form of state-approved racism giving groups
advantages just because of their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   With the highly quotable Connerly at the helm, the state GOP
poured $500,000 into the campaign for Connerly to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's story is uncannily parallel. I-200, too, was
dreamed up by two white guys _ state Rep. Scott Smith, a
35-year-old, plain-spoken Republican from Graham in Pierce County,
and Tim Eyman, a 32-year-old Seattle resident who owns a small
mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's opposition to affirmative action is personal. He claims
that in 1991, his wife, Leslie, beat him out for a job offer from
the King County Sheriff's Office, even though she scored 260 places
behind him. He blames an affirmative action program that sought to
increase women officers in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, as a freshman lawmaker, Smith decided to act on his
anger. He introduced a bill barring state and local governments
from using race or gender as a basis for granting jobs or
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the fireworks surrounding the issue made many lawmakers wary
of a debate in which charges of racism would be hurled across the
House and and Senate floors. Smith's bill never even came to a
committee vote and continued to languish in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith was moving behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted Connerly and a new organization the UC regent had
founded to spread the anti-affirmative action gospel across the
country: the American Civil Rights Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly had also been contacted by Eyman, who says watching
Connerly fight off personal attacks from other blacks convinced him
he was
</P>
<P>
   an ``inspirational, almost historic
</P>
<P>
   figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyman tracked down a Bellevue lawyer who drafted a nearly
identical initiative for Washington state. Then the American Civil
Rights Institute put Eyman and Smith together. And in March 1997,
they filed the Washington Civil Rights Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, the ACLU challenged I-200 in Thurston County
Superior Court, arguing that the words ``affirmative action''
needed to be part of the ballot title because the initiative
effectively would undo affirmative action programs. The judge
disagreed, ruling that the ballot title and summary accurately and
objectively reflected the initiative's intent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, voters here will be asked whether the state should
be prevented from discriminating against or granting preferential
treatment to any individual on the basis of race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   Eyman spent the summer striking deals to give local libertarian
and Republican groups $3,000 for every 10,000 signatures they could
deliver. Smith raised money.
</P>
<P>
   But by the fall, the two had only 17,000 signatures in hand and
little money in the bank. Smith said he knew they needed help. He
persuaded Connerly to call John Carlson, the provocative KVI-AM
radio host who had successfully taken two other initiatives to the
ballot, Three Strikes You're Out and Hard Time for Armed Crime.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said I-200 needed a leader who was well respected
locally and not just another ``white guy whining that he lost a job
because of affirmative action.'' In Carlson,
</P>
<P>
   Connerly saw someone who could
</P>
<P>
   argue preferences are ``morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than three months to deliver 180,000 signatures,
Carlson said he knew he'd need paid signature gatherers. He agreed
to become chairman on one condition: that the American Civil Rights
Coalition, the political arm of Connerly's rights institute, would
match every dollar raised with a dollar on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's group eventually provided $162,000, or about 45
percent, of the $373,458 that I-200 raised. Opponents raised just
$37,841.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said his decision to pump money into Washington's
effort over drives in Florida, Michigan and other states was based
on a simple fact _ Washington is mostly white. He reasons that when
race becomes an issue of political debate, citizens
</P>
<P>
   tend to vote by the color of their
</P>
<P>
   skin.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said he learned that lesson from experience in Houston,
where 54 percent of voters said they didn't want to end affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 ballot language there specifically asked voters whether
they wanted to ``end the use of affirmative action for women and
minorities in the operation of city of Houston employment and
contracting.''
</P>
<P>
   But a judge recently overturned the vote, ruling that the ballot
language, which was altered by the City Council, didn't reflect the
intent of 20,000 voters who petitioned to put the issue on the
ballot using language similar to California's Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the race card gets played, people always vote their
identity, rather than on the basis of principle,'' Connerly said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the cash infusion from the American Civil Rights
Coalition, and Carlson's success in prompting public debate on his
radio show, made the critical difference for I-200. In January,
Carlson, Smith and Eyman turned in more than 280,000 signatures to
the state, 100,000 more than were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Komar of the D.C.-based Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights said the challenge for affirmative action defenders will be
educating voters about the initiative's true consequences. But with
polls reflecting as much as 69 percent support for I-200 statewide,
he conceded it'll be
</P>
<P>
   tough.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, for his part, said a Washington victory here will be a
``real shot in the arm'' for his movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be involved in Washington unless it was the only
way to keep the ball moving up the field,'' he said. ``We've got to
fight some highly selective battles until justice prevails.''

   FEZ-RESTORE (Fez, Morocco) _ Fez is an ancient place but also a
functioning city, and one in need of repair. Several years ago
Unesco named it a Heritage of Mankind City, like the Old City of
Jerusalem. But a major difference between the old walled city, or
medina, of Fez and almost all other ancient city centers in this
part of the world is that it remains the hub of the local economy.
The problem here is how to fix up the medina without fundamentally
changing it, how to preserve it as a religious and economic center.

By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a December night three years ago, New York book publisher
Morgan Entrekin knew he was onto something extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Entrekin was reading a partially finished manuscript
from first-time novelist Charles Frazier, whose narrative traced
the journey of a Civil War deserter across the beloved mountains of
North Carolina, toward a reunion with a woman he hoped would be his
lover. The writing was poetic. The story gripping. The historic
detail impressive and illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   All of which led to a first printing by Entrekin's publishing
house, Grove/Atlantic, of 25,000 copies, a solid number for
literary first novels like Frazier's ``Cold Mountain.'' But the
bestseller list was a slender hope at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good success for a literary first novel would have been to
sell 40,000 to 50,000 copies,'' Entrekin said, incredulity still
apparent in his voice. ``And this one just exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least. By last week, ``Cold Mountain'' had hit 1.6
million in sales in its 57th week on ``The New York Times''
bestseller list, sales more commonly associated with the names of
John Grisham, Stephen King and Tom Clancy. And, perhaps more
surprising, ``Cold Mountain'' has plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, similarly serious, literate books, both fiction
and nonfiction, have crashed bestseller lists in numbers not seen
in a generation. Witness ``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's memoir
of childhood deprivation and grit in an Irish household, which
recently spent its 99th week on the ``Times'' list. ``Midnight in
the Garden of Good and Evil,'' John Berendt's quirky chronicle of
society in Savannah, Ga., has lingered on the ``Times'' list for a
staggering 212 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other titles, though with somewhat less spectacular
sales, come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, at one time you had three literate first novels on
the bestseller list, `Cold Mountain,' Arundhati Roy's `The God of
Small Things' and Arthur Golden's `Memoirs of a Geisha,' ''
Entrekin said. ``I don't think that's happened in my 21 years in
the business. I know it hasn't, that you would have three literary
first novels on the bestseller list at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly how to explain it, but I'm happy that
it's happening. It's good for the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Grau, co-editorial director at Riverhead Books in New
York, can scarcely contain her glee when discussing ``An Instance
of the Fingerpost,'' author Iain Pears' mystery set in 17th-century
Oxford, which lingered on the bestseller list for six weeks this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing,'' said Grau, the editor of Pears' book,
which was published by Riverhead this spring. ``It's a really
intellectually rigorous, challenging book. It's a 700-page book,
and it's meticulously detailed and true to the period. I say it's a
murder mystery, but it's a deeply complicated plot ... and it hit
the `Times' list in its second week of sale.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is just amazing,'' Grau said. ``Miraculous. ... I think
there clearly is a constituency of people now who are ready to run
to the bookstore and buy books that come highly reviewed and
recommended regardless of the difficulty of the book. ... I think
it's healthy all around.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly for the struggling authors of midlist books, the
modest publishing niche where literary, first-time novelists
generally find themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For these writers, advances and first printings are typically
small. Their careers generally require editorial patience, on the
bet a healthy readership can be acquired, often over a series of
books. Before their explosion, the books of Charles Frazier and
Frank McCourt would have fallen into the midlist category.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely those writers who seemed at risk in a publishing
world increasingly controlled by huge conglomerates. Megacompanies
seeking double-digit profits usually prefer the cash cows like
Grisham, or Danielle Steel, or detective Mark Fuhrman, while
unknown writers of serious books are increasingly ignored. Or so
the industry moaning often went.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the opposite is increasingly true, editors and publishers
say. Publishers search the midlist, looking for the next ``Cold
Mountain.'' Entrekin, whose house has a long heritage of publishing
literary books often overlooked by the larger publishers, now finds
himself bidding against the giants for the same high-brow works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it might be more apt to say that publishers are seeing
commercial potential in areas where they might not have seen such
vast potential before,'' said Grau, of Riverhead Books. ``The
success of one genre begets imitators. We rip ourselves off all the
time. This is just a more fruitful mimicry.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Editors and publishers, who enjoy the literary resurgence,
nonetheless have a hard time explaining it. A different marketing
approach may help, with publishers occasionally pushing literary
titles in the same, robust manner formerly devoted to the latest
celebrity bio.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, when I have a serious book that I think has some
talking points, I will myself, in addition to our publicity
department, call (National Public Radio talk show) ``Fresh Air'' or
Amazon.com (a bookselling Web site) to see if they're interested,''
said Daniel Menaker, senior literary editor at Random House. ``I
think we're learning that we're all competing for a little sunlight
to get into the serious corner of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent emergence of book superstores has also helped. Stores
like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders, with their coffee bars and plush
furniture, have become leisure destinations, the coffee shops and
libraries of yesteryear. And, as a matter of course, those stores
push serious literature next to the thrillers and the schlock.
Right now, a huge promotional poster in many Barnes &AMP; Nobles
features not Grisham or Steel, but author Ethan Canin and his new
literary novel ``For Kings and Planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not picking dopey books,'' Julie Grau said, citing
Winfrey's promotion of novelist Toni Morrison as an example.
``Morrison's a world-class, provocative, important novelist. I dare
say that half the people who bought her books on Oprah's
recommendation had never read a book remotely like that before. So
Oprah's really introduced a whole broad spectrum of readers to
literary books.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most encouragingly, the new enthusiasm for
literature is also because of a shift in cultural appetites. With
thriller entertainment now more readily available and easily
consumed on television, in the theater, or in video rental stores,
large numbers of consumers drift to books for greater edification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that people are really turning to books for what
books can do that no other medium can do, which is, in the hands of
a serious writer, take you places that no other medium can take
you,'' Entrekin said.
</P>
<P>
   Grau says that increasingly, when people invest the time
necessary for a book, entertainment is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to learn now,'' Grau said. ``It's not
merely enough to be entertained. They want to walk away with more
than a vague smile on their face.''

IT'S FAMILY-FRIENDLY, BUT A DOG OF A TALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no easy task, panning a movie with its heart in the right
place. Especially when it's a family movie that declines to stoop
to cheap jokes. Especially when you're a dog lover and the movie is
``Air Bud: Golden Receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sad truth is that this ``Bud'' just isn't very good. A
sequel to last year's ``Air Bud,'' it's so by-the-numbers that it
makes the already formulaic original look like ``Old Yeller.''
Worse, though, it makes the same mistake as the original: It takes
a fun premise _ this time, it's a football-playing dog _ and
surrounds it with a gloppy, sentimental story that's no fun at all.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost forgive the original's maudlin aspects. After
all, it needed to introduce us to young hero Josh (Kevin Zegers),
who was despondent after his pilot father's death, and to canine
sidekick Buddy, an abused golden retriever who bonded with Josh
through their mutual love of basketball. But hey, they've bonded
already. You'd think the sequel would lighten up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Zegers is an appealing actor, but Josh is fast on his way to
becoming the most screwed-up kid in movies. In this one, he's upset
because he might be getting a new father. Mom (the watchably quirky
Cynthia Stevenson, making the most of a slim role) is dating again,
and with the help of Buddy, she's found a good-natured hunk of a
veterinarian (Gregory Harrison) whose company she enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Josh's anxiety at this would be more understandable if the vet
weren't such an obviously nice guy; maybe the kid's just perturbed
because his potential stepfather has a narrower range of facial
expressions than his pet. Even so, Josh's distress is more logical
than his solution to his mom's newfound love life: He joins the
football team! Of course, the players are so bad that even a team
of _ oh, film critics _ could beat them. And of course, Buddy comes
along to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   As forced as it is, the main plot is a gem compared with the
``comic relief.'' Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti make like Boris and
Natasha as a couple of evil Russian circus wranglers. Guys, ``The
Bullwinkle Show'' was a cool cartoon, but its Bolshevik villains
were a product of its time, not ours.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Martin (son of '60s ``Laugh In'' host Dick
Martin, who makes a lame cameo performance as an addled
sportscaster) had a lot on his hands here: kids, animals, three
plot lines that don't really intersect. Considering this, the
jagged, uneven product he puts on the screen is probably better
than it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is in the writing, and the premise itself. It is
kinda cool to watch a dog play football (Bud, the
basketball-playing pooch, died of cancer after the first film; a
pack of six dogs takes his place here). But it doesn't fill up a
feature film, and when the dog's not on the field, you might wish
you could zap to some other sporting event or run to the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the final sequel: ``Air Bud: World Pup'' (you guessed
it _ Buddy plays soccer) is already in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' is rated G. It includes some mildly
gross slapstick and scenes of imperiled animals, but it's family
entertainment.

`STELLA' NEEDS MORE THAN GROOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), the 20-year-old object of
affection in ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' is a deep-dish
dream, a boy-toy sculpture carved out of Godiva chocolate who turns
out to be just the thing for on-the-go diva Stella (Angela
Bassett).
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella'' is probably the most unique picture in current
release because not only does it reverse the trend of older male
stars with younger female co-stars, it acknowledges the age
difference. If that isn't enough, it's also a glamour treatment for
African-American women, one in which they don't communicate in
hip-hop slang. Seeing black women in control of their own destinies
in a dramatic context is so unusual a film scenario that it's
thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad we don't get to see it in a much better movie.
Except for the skin color of the cast, ``Stella'' is the kind of
thing that turns up with numbing frequency on Lifetime, sandwiched
between reruns of ``thirtysomething'' and ``Designing Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella is a 40-year-old single mother who thrives in her
professional life. As played by Bassett, she's all movie-star
dynamism _ the role seems mostly sketched from the outside.
Stressed out, Stella and her best friend, Delilah (Whoopi
Goldberg), pack off for a spontaneous trip to Jamaica. When the
20-year-old Winston sidles up beside Stella at breakfast, he
flashes teeth as white as bone china. And as Bassett is as perfect
a camera object as Diggs, they're a match made in screen heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs' at-the-ready, eager-to-please grin makes him look like a
young (black) Tom Cruise. And in ``Stella,'' he's almost as bad as
the young Cruise, dropping the occasional ``Yeah, mon'' in a
Jamaican accent worse than the one Philip Michael Thomas used on
``Miami Vice.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs has so little to do in his underwritten part that only
when I read the press notes did I realize I'd seen Diggs show
powerful presence on stage as the landlord in ``Rent.'' Winston is
not a part that requires Diggs to act, however. Instead, he follows
Stella around like a grateful puppy in a Jamaica that's been
sanitized in a ``Come back to Jamaica again and again''
tourist-mecca fashion. The dramatic high point for Diggs is a scene
in which he exposes his rock-hard booty in the shower, which will
probably get him a bigger ovation than any of his work in ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella'' grinds along to its predictable finish as clumsily as
the Terry McMillan source novel _ Will the slapdash obstacles in
their path keep them apart? Because the book was a celebration of
McMillan's relationship under similar circumstances, it's not too
hard to guess.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan worked on the adaptation with Ron Bass; they also
adapted McMillan's ``Waiting to Exhale.'' ``Stella'' is a much
better movie than ``Exhale,'' if only because of the life Regina
King adds as Stella's younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   Because she's not required to carry the picture, King can relax
and show some humor and style. She has a familial rapport with
Bassett, and their scenes together are the only instances in which
Bassett doesn't seem like she's in the movie alone. Bassett and
Goldberg have no chemistry, and Goldberg makes cracks that probably
won't get as many laughs as those made by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the wish fulfillment provided by a picture creates
such goodwill among audience members _ hungering for a fantasy they
don't normally see _ that it's easy to understand why they lean
close to a movie like ``Stella.'' When I saw ``Waiting to Exhale''
with its target audience _ African-American women who'd savored the
book, some of them holding dog-eared copies in their laps _ they
greeted the film with a thunderclap of applause that gave it a
great deal more power than it deserved. As their euphoria withered,
``Exhale'' still delivered a low level of satisfaction because
black women are so pitifully underserved by the movie industry. The
New Yorker critic Pauline Kael summed up this phenomenon: ``People
can be so hungry for a particular subject, it doesn't matter that
it's not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of response that ``Stella'' is likely to
trigger. Pandering to unsophisticated fantasies, rendering plot
points with the broadest melodramatic strokes, it's like the most
expensively mounted high-school play of all time. With any luck,
this fertile and underexploited ground _ dramas featuring
African-American women _ will peak soon, with the upcoming
adaptation of Toni Morrison's ``Beloved,'' starring and produced by
Oprah Winfrey. Until then, we'll have to make do with ``Stella's''
microwavable feel-good vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is rated R for adult
language, brief nudity and sexuality.

KINDERGARTNER TAKES HIS FIRST STEPS AWAY FROM MOM ON FIRST SCHOOL

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The boy bounds from the top bunk at 6 a.m.
because he hears his mom and dad stirring, and he can't sleep
anymore. This is a big day, and Kevin Langford is ready. This is
his first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   He sits at the kitchen table with his mom and dad and his
brother, 2-year-old Cade. They eat pancakes because pancakes are
Kevin's favorite. His are shaped like a dinosaur and a heart, and
one is supposed to be the letter K, for his name, but it spread so
much it looks like a truck ran over it.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin eats from ``the special plate.'' His mom drags it out for
birthdays most of the time. ``Today is Your Day!'' it says.
``Celebrate!''
</P>
<P>
   When breakfast is over, Kevin sits on his mother's lap and she
reads aloud the card they made the night before. On the front are
words for every letter of his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``K is for kind, E is for energetic, V for valiant. We had to
look that one up. I is for inquisitive. Do you know what that
means? N is for noble.''
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie Langford is Kevin's mom. She's 32 years old, and she was
a kindergarten teacher until Kevin was born. She tried to teach
that year but she missed him so much that she cried every day.
Three months later, she quit.
</P>
<P>
   She knows she will cry sometime today. But Kevin is so excited
she tells herself not to cry in front of him. She won't embarrass
him by crying at school, either.
</P>
<P>
   There have been moments she has almost cried just thinking about
this day. Memories are everywhere: Hank, the stuffed horse Kevin
used to sleep with; the white-blond lock of hair in his baby book;
the calendar where she recorded milestones and funny things he
said.
</P>
<P>
   June 22: ``Swim lessons at the Y.'' July 26: ``Mommy, can fish
live in milk?'' Aug. 13: ``You pretended to be a Dalmatian.'' Sept.
13: ``You made a soccer goal.'' Sept. 15: ``You counted to 20!''
</P>
<P>
   But Lezlie promised she would not cry. Every time she almost did
she thought of something else. She does it now, with Kevin on her
lap as she reads the card:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Kevin:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so proud of you. You have grown into a truly wonderful,
sweet, smart little boy. We are very thankful to the Lord for
giving us the gift of you. Today you start a new adventure. Be
strong and courageous, and ALWAYS REMEMBER WHO YOU BELONG TO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love,
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom and Dad''
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie eases him off her lap. ``Don't get too mushy now, Mom,''
she says. She rinses syrup from the special plate.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin is back in his room, climbing to the top bunk, where the
clothes he picked out last night hang on his bed. He wanted to wear
jeans but his mom said it was too hot so he wears the size 5 khaki
shorts his grandparents gave him on his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He puts on the blue Gymboree shirt and the braided belt and he
sits on the floor beside Matchbox cars and a baseball bat that
pokes out from under the bed. He puts on white socks before he ties
the new laces on his old sneakers. His dad watches.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Langford is 34 and a highway construction project
engineer. He's not as emotional as his wife, but this morning he
tells Kevin that he couldn't wear shorts to school when he was a
boy. Kevin doesn't hear him because he's in the bathroom getting
Dad's aftershave. One squirt, and he's off to comb his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Chris says it seems like yesterday they walked out of the
hospital with a baby boy. Kevin Garth arrived at 6 a.m. on July 22,
1992, all 8 pounds, 9 ounces and 20 inches of him.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about raising him was the surgery to mend the
collarbone broken during delivery. In the pictures, Kevin lies on a
hospital bed so big and white it looks like a cloud about to
swallow him whole. That was the hardest thing, Lezlie says. Until
now.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin went to preschool, but this is ``big school.'' From this
day forward he will be out of her sight for five days a week, 180
days a year, for the next 13 years. She tries to think of something
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look very handsome, Kevin _ very ready for school,''
Lezlie says. The video camera records Kevin picking up his book bag
from the spot beside the door where it spent the night. He packed
it before he went to bed, and now it slides down his back, heavy
with pencils, crayons, markers, paper and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking mighty sharp there,'' his dad says. Kevin
stands beside the piano in the living room and smiles for the
camera. Somebody notices the time. It's a little before 8 a.m.;
school starts at 8:05.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan rolls down Tucker Boulevard, and two blocks from the
school, you can already see the commotion: Cars, brake lights and
the flashing blue of a police car. You can hear it, too: the
policeman's whistle as he directs another gaggle of moms and dads
and children across the street.
</P>
<P>
   J.L. Hill Elementary is an established school in the center of a
subdivision old enough that nobody calls it by its name anymore _
Meadowbrook or Meadowcreek or something like that. The school
hasn't changed much in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin walks up the steps past a girl in a green jumper posing in
front of the flagpole for a picture. The tide of people sweeps
Kevin and his mom through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Kindergartners take a left, past the cafeteria where the Scotty
terrier school mascot is painted in the clouds. They turn at the
first right, heading to Room 130, where Mrs. Speer is waiting.
</P>
<P>
   After 26 years of teaching, Liz Speer can hug a child and shake
a hand and at the same time sense that a camera flash is blinking.
She smiles in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speer started teaching soon after the Texas Legislature
established kindergarten in 1970, deciding that every boy and girl
could benefit from a dose of early learning. Every one of her
classes has started something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Boys and girls sit on plastic chairs with chrome legs, hardly a
foot off the floor. Mothers and fathers stand above them,
spectators with cameras pointed. They expect something exciting to
happen and nothing does. The children ignore them, begin to draw.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speer shepherds Kevin Langford to a seat at the center
table. To Kevin's left sits a boy named Andre; to his right, a girl
named Ellen. Across the table, a girl named Turner is drawing a
rainbow and a girl named Colleen is writing her ABCs with a pink
marker. The camcorders roll.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin's mother bends to kiss him goodbye. He doesn't see her
when she stands by the door and looks back. Kevin is coloring a
tree trunk when his mother leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It's close to 8:20, and the bell is about to ring. Mrs. Speer
smiles and nods and ushers the parents out.
</P>
<P>
   One little boy is crying and rubbing his eyes. His dad kneels,
and their foreheads touch. The boy's mom wipes tears from under her
glasses before Mrs. Speer closes the door behind them.
</P>
<P>
   So here they are: Eleven boys and six girls about to embark on
the rite of passage into adulthood. This is where it begins. This
is where children are taught respect, responsibility, the demands
of communal living.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speer points to the classroom rules beside the black board:
``Look. Listen. Learn.'' She returns to them a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   She reminds her boys and girls that following the rules will
result in praise and Happy Grams sent home to mom and dad. Breaking
the rules will bring her to her knees, at their side, where she
takes their little faces in her hands and warns them that a few
minutes alone in the corner will come if it happens again.
</P>
<P>
   Here, she explains, boys and girls clean up their own blocks and
put away their crayons. She instructs them to hold up the
index-card name tags dangling from their necks for formal
introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speer has their attention _ for now. She knows she has 10
minutes before their minds wander, and if she loses one, she is
like a comedian in front of a heckler and she risks losing them
all. When the bell rings, she is off and running.
</P>
<P>
   The clapping they do together will lead to adding and
subtracting. When they repeat the silly poem after Mrs. Speer says
it aloud, they are laying the foundation for reading. Their
drawings are the early stages of learning to write the 26 letters
of the alphabet, capital and lower-case letters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin doesn't say much when the children sit in the circle and
hear a story about blue horses and purple cats. He quietly arranges
colored octagons when the class breaks into groups. His voice is
lost in the roar when all the children swing their arms with gusto
and shout the kindergarten motto: ``I can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speer teaches them how to behave. They must share puzzle
pieces, stay in line on the way to the bathroom, wait their turn at
the fountain, walk and not run to their lockers, and refrain from
making animal or bomb noises during group activities.
</P>
<P>
   In three hours, she dispenses learning while she empties book
bags, fills lockers and nearly trips over a ``Toy Story'' backpack.
</P>
<P>
   She ties Sam's laces, tweaks Andre's nose, strokes Taylor's
ponytail, pats Carson's back, praises Xavier's puzzle, sorts Teddy
bears with Palak, Colleen, Taylor and Ellen. She thanks Kevin for
sitting so nicely at circle time.
</P>
<P>
   The children cling to her like burrs. Cody stops crying during
the pledge of allegiance and only sniffles during the moment of
silence. By the time two teachers sing ``This Land is Your Land''
over the intercom, shy Kevin is not so shy anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He is fourth in line behind Mrs. Speer when she marches around
the room while the record plays ``When the Saints Go Marching In.''
He buzzes like a bee and hisses like a snake and wiggles his hips
as the song tells him. He waits patiently when Mrs. Speer goes back
in the bathroom to fetch Blake and Richard, who have been delayed
by a bug in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin sits so quietly at the end of the day that Mrs. Speer asks
him to hand out animal crackers. The day goes so fast that Andre
announced only twice that he was ready to go home and Mrs. Speer
said only twice that her hearing was fine and no one needed to
yell.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden the boys and girls are removing their name tags
and standing in line. Kevin is near the middle. Mrs. Speer sends
Matthew to the end for touching the knob without permission, and
she shuffles Ally from the boys line to the one for girls. She puts
a finger to her lips and down the hall they go.
</P>
<P>
   Lezlie Langford is among the parents waiting outside. Kevin runs
to her for a hug and then he takes off to climb on the wall with
the other boys. He's gone when his mom confesses. She made it out
of the school and to the car before it happened. She cried. She
knew she would.

`STELLA' NEEDS MORE THAN GROOVE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: FIXES box at bottom) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), the 20-year-old object of
affection in ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' is a deep-dish
dream, a boy-toy sculpture carved out of Godiva chocolate who turns
out to be just the thing for on-the-go diva Stella (Angela
Bassett).
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella'' is probably the most unique picture in current
release because not only does it reverse the trend of older male
stars with younger female co-stars, it acknowledges the age
difference. If that isn't enough, it's also a glamour treatment for
African-American women, one in which they don't communicate in
hip-hop slang. Seeing black women in control of their own destinies
in a dramatic context is so unusual a film scenario that it's
thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad we don't get to see it in a much better movie.
Except for the skin color of the cast, ``Stella'' is the kind of
thing that turns up with numbing frequency on Lifetime, sandwiched
between reruns of ``thirtysomething'' and ``Designing Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella is a 40-year-old single mother who thrives in her
professional life. As played by Bassett, she's all movie-star
dynamism _ the role seems mostly sketched from the outside.
Stressed out, Stella and her best friend, Delilah (Whoopi
Goldberg), pack off for a spontaneous trip to Jamaica. When the
20-year-old Winston sidles up beside Stella at breakfast, he
flashes teeth as white as bone china. And as Bassett is as perfect
a camera object as Diggs, they're a match made in screen heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs' at-the-ready, eager-to-please grin makes him look like a
young (black) Tom Cruise. And in ``Stella,'' he's almost as bad as
the young Cruise, dropping the occasional ``Yeah, mon'' in a
Jamaican accent worse than the one Philip Michael Thomas used on
``Miami Vice.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs has so little to do in his underwritten part that only
when I read the press notes did I realize I'd seen Diggs show
powerful presence on stage as the landlord in ``Rent.'' Winston is
not a part that requires Diggs to act, however. Instead, he follows
Stella around like a grateful puppy in a Jamaica that's been
sanitized in a ``Come back to Jamaica again and again''
tourist-mecca fashion. The dramatic high point for Diggs is a scene
in which he exposes his rock-hard booty in the shower, which will
probably get him a bigger ovation than any of his work in ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella'' grinds along to its predictable finish as clumsily as
the Terry McMillan source novel _ Will the slapdash obstacles in
their path keep them apart? Because the book was a celebration of
McMillan's relationship under similar circumstances, it's not too
hard to guess.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan worked on the adaptation with Ron Bass; they also
adapted McMillan's ``Waiting to Exhale.'' ``Stella'' is a much
better movie than ``Exhale,'' if only because of the life Regina
King adds as Stella's younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   Because she's not required to carry the picture, King can relax
and show some humor and style. She has a familial rapport with
Bassett, and their scenes together are the only instances in which
Bassett doesn't seem like she's in the movie alone. Bassett and
Goldberg have no chemistry, and Goldberg makes cracks that probably
won't get as many laughs as those made by the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the wish fulfillment provided by a picture creates
such goodwill among audience members _ hungering for a fantasy they
don't normally see _ that it's easy to understand why they lean
close to a movie like ``Stella.'' When I saw ``Waiting to Exhale''
with its target audience _ African-American women who'd savored the
book, some of them holding dog-eared copies in their laps _ they
greeted the film with a thunderclap of applause that gave it a
great deal more power than it deserved. As their euphoria withered,
``Exhale'' still delivered a low level of satisfaction because
black women are so pitifully underserved by the movie industry. The
New Yorker critic Pauline Kael summed up this phenomenon: ``People
can be so hungry for a particular subject, it doesn't matter that
it's not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of response that ``Stella'' is likely to
trigger. Pandering to unsophisticated fantasies, rendering plot
points with the broadest melodramatic strokes, it's like the most
expensively mounted high-school play of all time. With any luck,
this fertile and underexploited ground _ dramas featuring
African-American women _ will peak soon, with the upcoming
adaptation of Toni Morrison's ``Beloved,'' starring and produced by
Oprah Winfrey. Until then, we'll have to make do with ``Stella's''
microwavable feel-good vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is rated R for adult
language, brief nudity and sexuality.

IT'S FAMILY-FRIENDLY, BUT A DOG OF A TALE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: FIXES box at bottom) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no easy task, panning a movie with its heart in the right
place. Especially when it's a family movie that declines to stoop
to cheap jokes. Especially when you're a dog lover and the movie is
``Air Bud: Golden Receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sad truth is that this ``Bud'' just isn't very good. A
sequel to last year's ``Air Bud,'' it's so by-the-numbers that it
makes the already formulaic original look like ``Old Yeller.''
Worse, though, it makes the same mistake as the original: It takes
a fun premise _ this time, it's a football-playing dog _ and
surrounds it with a gloppy, sentimental story that's no fun at all.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost forgive the original's maudlin aspects. After
all, it needed to introduce us to young hero Josh (Kevin Zegers),
who was despondent after his pilot father's death, and to canine
sidekick Buddy, an abused golden retriever who bonded with Josh
through their mutual love of basketball. But hey, they've bonded
already. You'd think the sequel would lighten up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Zegers is an appealing actor, but Josh is fast on his way to
becoming the most screwed-up kid in movies. In this one, he's upset
because he might be getting a new father. Mom (the watchably quirky
Cynthia Stevenson, making the most of a slim role) is dating again,
and with the help of Buddy, she's found a good-natured hunk of a
veterinarian (Gregory Harrison) whose company she enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Josh's anxiety at this would be more understandable if the vet
weren't such an obviously nice guy; maybe the kid's just perturbed
because his potential stepfather has a narrower range of facial
expressions than his pet. Even so, Josh's distress is more logical
than his solution to his mom's newfound love life: He joins the
football team! Of course, the players are so bad that even a team
of _ oh, film critics _ could beat them. And of course, Buddy comes
along to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   As forced as it is, the main plot is a gem compared with the
``comic relief.'' Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti make like Boris and
Natasha as a couple of evil Russian circus wranglers. Guys, ``The
Bullwinkle Show'' was a cool cartoon, but its Bolshevik villains
were a product of its time, not ours.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Martin (son of '60s ``Laugh In'' host Dick
Martin, who makes a lame cameo performance as an addled
sportscaster) had a lot on his hands here: kids, animals, three
plot lines that don't really intersect. Considering this, the
jagged, uneven product he puts on the screen is probably better
than it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is in the writing, and the premise itself. It is
kinda cool to watch a dog play football (Bud, the
basketball-playing pooch, died of cancer after the first film; a
pack of six dogs takes his place here). But it doesn't fill up a
feature film, and when the dog's not on the field, you might wish
you could zap to some other sporting event or run to the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the final sequel: ``Air Bud: World Pup'' (you guessed
it _ Buddy plays soccer) is already in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' is rated G. It includes some mildly
gross slapstick and scenes of imperiled animals, but it's family
entertainment.

OUT-OF-TOWN KIDS HAMPERED IN HELPING AGING PARENTS  
 (RESENDING FOR THE NEWS &AMP; ADVANCE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``You can do everything possible by long distance, but
there's still that knowledge that you can't go over there in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   That is 42-year-old Bonnie Hughes Marcus, expressing the anxiety
she feels about living in Ohio and trying to be a good,
long-distance daughter to her 81- and 82-year-old parents, Felice
and Warren Hughes, who live in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I epitomize the sandwich generation, raising three kids
between 8 and 17 and, more and more, assuming a caregiving role for
my parents,'' said Bonnie who lives in Shaker Heights, a suburb of
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that their family has a strong foundation of love,
but it's still hard for her to know if she's giving too much or too
little, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your 40s and 50s, you're faced with some pretty grueling
family issues. It can be overwhelming unless you figure a way to
find your balance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie is hardly alone in her situation, according to David
Helgeson, a psychologist who helps families with elder-care issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing many more middle-age adults these days who want to
know how to deal more effectively with their parents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also gets an earful of complaints from older patients about
their middle-aged children, who either don't call enough, or who
wrongly (say the seniors) think their parents are going senile.
</P>
<P>
   Helgeson sees denial on both ends: Many older people don't want
to admit the loss of their capabilities, and their kids refuse to
see their parents as aging because it reminds them of how old they
are getting, or because they don't think they have the time or
money to help them. They will chat about the weather rather than
about what's obvious and important.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a serious or even life-threatening event has to occur
with a parent before everyone will face the situation. Solving the
problem is difficult under any circumstances, but it's compounded
when the parents live far away.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie and her brothers kept out of their parents' financial and
legal affairs until five years ago, when Warren Hughes had a
life-threatening aneurysm and high-risk surgery. Bonnie frankly
discussed finances and health care options with her father. She
knew he had prepared a will, but she didn't know where it was
located or who he had named as an executor. They wrote a living
will and a medical power of attorney, just in case anything went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the family was relieved that he came through surgery
beautifully and that family financial affairs remained in order,
Warren's wife, Felice, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Warren tried to handle the care of his wife on his own. But as
the disease advanced, he hired someone to help three days a week,
then five, then seven. But even then it became too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes children didn't know their father was having so much
difficulty until a year and a half ago, when Warren had to be
hospitalized for stress for five days.
</P>
<P>
   After that, even Warren couldn't deny that caring for her had
become too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad was great,'' Bonnie said. ``He called us all home and we
had a meeting in a conference room he had arranged at his church.
He wanted us to meet in a place where we could try to make an
unemotional decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The family agreed it was time to put Felice into a nursing home.
They surveyed 15 homes, finally picking one close to her doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On most Saturdays and Sundays, Warren and his dog, Bordeaux,
visit Felice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She recognizes the poodle and me,'' said Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Four days each week, Warren volunteers as a counselor to
families going through similar experiences. He takes that work as
seriously as he ever did his career as an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   He tells other families that it is important that at least one
person besides the spouse should be there to help make decisions
and communicate with the family. Among his children, Bonnie is that
person. She helps him make decisions and she watches over his own
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Because she couldn't be in town to help her father manage her
mother's care, Bonnie hired a geriatric care manager to make
professional visits. The monthly report usually includes a note
about ``Mr. Hughes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the geriatric care manager sees a possible problem, she calls
the doctor directly or Warren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted someone extra who would be objective. Whose
observations wouldn't be tied to emotion,'' said Bonnie. The
monitoring costs $65 a month, but she says it is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her mother moved to the care facility, she and her
brothers strongly encouraged their father to move from the family's
3-bedroom ranch home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our thinking that he would be better off in a smaller
place,'' said Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   But Warren didn't agree and there were family arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all trial and error,'' she said. ``I have learned that I
have to be respectful of what he is going through as well. He was
going through a grieving period, too, and losing his house and
losing Mom to this disease in one big swoop was too much for him.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Just weeks ago, after many rounds of hard bargaining, the IMF
finally authorized a $22.6 billion loan package for Russia.
Meanwhile, the Russian markets have continued to plunge and fears
of a total inflationary collapse persist. Despite initial optimism
from the IMF, investors are asking hard questions about progress,
before putting money into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, the ordinary men and women on the street are
living day to day, trying to feed their children, often going for
weeks and months unpaid, despite holding, perhaps, two or three
jobs and exhausting themselves with work.
</P>
<P>
   What is the problem here? Is Russia, as the president states,
really under control?
</P>
<P>
   Other questions are being asked too both in Russia and the West:
Did the IMF do the right thing? Can the latest IMF bailout affect
the Russian situation in a positive way? How can IMF money
influence the course of events in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   At home and abroad, I am asked very often whether aid to Russia
is necessary and, if so, what kind of aid. Legitimate questions,
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary package was an endorsement of the program of
anti-crisis measures proposed by the government of Prime Minister
Kirienko. When presenting the plan to Parliament, the prime
minister said that the Cabinet was, in effect, charting a new
economic policy aimed above all at reviving production.
</P>
<P>
   But it is already clear that the new economic policy is no more
than a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever modest steps were initially planned to stimulate
production _ the real economy _ have now been dropped from the
government's program. The tax burden is set to increase, most of it
falling on the beleaguered people. Hence, the too-small amounts of
real income and effective demand can be expected to shrink. With
tax pressures on business continuing to increase, economic growth
will not resume.
</P>
<P>
   In today's global society, a total collapse of the Russian
economy would send tremors throughout the world. The old Cold War
thinking _ ``let them suffer, we will win'' _ has no place in this
world where boundaries are slim and we are one people.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia and its partners are facing a dead end, this has
strong implications for the West, for Asia and for the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe is that the root causes of the crisis _ despite
Western bailouts _ lie in Russia. They lie in the flawed economic
policies pursued for seven years now, with the West's support.
These policies have had a bad effect on Russia. They have
discredited democracy and magnified corruption, lawlessness and
arbitrary rule. They have allowed organized crime to penetrate ever
deeper into the bodies of government.
</P>
<P>
   The point at issue is this: How long do we wait? Will the loans
save the day? Will they cause the inertia to be reversed?
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, most analysts feel that the IMF package, based on the
pledges of the president and the Kirienko government, just like the
previous bailout in spring 1997, is bound to fail because it lacks
popular support. If so _ and the conclusion rings true _ what
should we expect? Moscow is awash with scenarios trying to predict
further developments.
</P>
<P>
   If the president and his entourage continue to insist on a
flawed and unworkable economic program, it could ignite mass
protest. Currently, 90 percent of those polled think that a social
upheaval could erupt in Russia in the near future. It is quite
ominous and the events could go out of control. This is an
unacceptable scenario.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a different course of action, which offers a
realistic alternative to chaos. I suggest that if the breathing
space allowed by the IMF loan _ we were told that it would allow us
a respite _ does exist, then it should be used as time to chart an
orderly way out of the most dramatic phase of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to us to implement the reforms that best suit our own
circumstances. Our reforms are entirely our responsibility. We do
need support from other nations. I am, however, against handouts.
We need equal and mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we should have early presidential and parliamentary
elections, held simultaneously, this fall or early spring, to open
the way to a type of federal government that would have credibility
among a majority of the Russian people and thus be strong enough to
implement a program for ending Russia's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The president should call for these elections, and they should
be coupled with a referendum on certain sections of the
Constitution, in order to reallocate the powers of government
between the president, the cabinet and parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1993 Constitution, which vested the president with
unlimited powers, has turned out to be both unworkable and
dangerous. It is a source of political instability, engendering
irresponsible behavior and confrontation between the branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   I also propose submitting to the referendum a constitutional
amendment creating a post of life-long senator for former
presidents after they leave office. Such an initiative would help
to ease this very dramatic moment, avoiding a dangerous division in
Russian society and assuring a democratic transition from one team
to another.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come for the president to prove that Russia's
interests and stability and, above all, the interests of its people
are indeed his highest priority.

TRAVEL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   (For release Sun., Aug. 23)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are six adults bound for Cape Town in October and have a
layover in Frankfurt from 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Any recommendations
on sightseeing, shopping and dining? _ Lois Mendelson, Livingston,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. With seven and a half hours of air travel behind you and
13-plus hours to Cape Town ahead, you and your friends may well
want to leave some time just to catch your breaths. Making an
airport hotel a base will allow you to rest and to be near your
airline terminal when departure time draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two hotels that have ``day rooms,'' where one can stay
from morning until 6 p.m. The rates are for double occupancy. At
the Sheraton Frankfurt Hotel, (49-69) 69770, fax (49-69) 60549, the
rate is $126, based on 1.78 marks to the dollar. It is connected to
the terminal by a pedestrian bridge. At the Steigenberger Airport
Hotel, (49-69) 69750, fax (49-69) 69752505, it's $115.
</P>
<P>
   When there's a trade fair such as the huge Frankfurt Book Fair,
from Oct. 7 to 12, the rate does not change but availability can be
very tight. The hotels are 20 minutes from downtown by taxi ($17 to
$28) and 10 minutes by the S-8 Bahn ($3.20).
</P>
<P>
   The downtown area is compact enough to get around easily on
foot. Starting at the Hauptwache, a historic guardhouse, will put
you in the heart of the city (nearest S-Bahn stop: Hauptwache).
From there you can head for the Zeil, where the shopping options
include the Zeil-galerie, an exclusive mall, and the Fressgasse
(part of which is officially known as the Grosse Bockenheimer
Strasse), where cafes and bistros abound.
</P>
<P>
   An easy way to catch the highlights is to take a
two-and-a-half-hour bus tour that includes a walk through the old
part of the city and a visit to the Historical Museum and the
Goethe-Haus, where the writer was born 249 years ago this week. The
tour departs from the Tourist Information Office Roemer, at 27
Roemerberg, at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. from April to October; (49-69) 21
23 88 00. During the rest of the year, there is a single tour, at
2. Cost: $25.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buildings around the square known as the Roemerberg,
where the city tour originates, is the Roemer, a house with three
stepped Gothic gables that the city acquired in the 15th century;
it has become became the city hall and a symbol of the city itself.
Also bordering the square is the cathedral where coronation
ceremonies for Holy Roman emperors were held. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you return to the Hauptwache, you are a few minutes' walk
from the Restaurant Francais, in the Hotel Frankfurter Hof, 1
Kaiserplatz, (49-69) 2 15 02. The cuisine is European; a
three-course dinner for one, not including wine, is $20 to $42.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Should time, interest and energy permit, you can cross to the
south bank of the Main where along the Schaumainkai you will find
half a dozen museums, including the recently renovated Staedel Art
Institute, whose holdings include works by Rembrandt, Rubens,
Duerer and Goya. The entry fee is normally $2.80, but it will be $5
in October because of an exhibition about ``Interior Lives'' in
painting from the 14th to the 20th century. Closed Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   A bit farther west, at 71 Schaumainkai, is the Liebighaus, a
sculpture museum. Its outdoor cafe, amid beautiful trees, is most
romantic. A cup of coffee and a pastry is $3.65.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; All Aboard for the Rockies &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Public television WNET recently televised a program titled
``The Rockies by Rail.'' Can you provide details about how to take
this journey? _ Howard S. Ravis, Ossining, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The trip shown on your local Public Broadcasting Service
station was aboard the American Orient Express. A restored luxury
train with cars built between 1948 and 1958, it is operating on
eight routes this year, including the trip you saw _ between Denver
and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights of the six-day journey, known as ``The Rockies
and Yellowstone,'' include traveling for 238 miles along the
Colorado River, by turns turbulent and placid, and passing through
a series of dramatic canyons, among them Glenwood. It is Glenwood
that is said to have inspired the building in the 1940s of rail
cars with spacious windows affording a view not only of grand
vistas and towering rock walls on either side but also of the sky
above.
</P>
<P>
   After a stop in Salt Lake City, the train goes to Great Salt
Lake and Antelope Island State Park. Then come two major highlights
_ Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks _ after which the
train follows the Columbia River on the way to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Trips through the Rockies resume in 1999, when the schedule
calls for departures from Denver to Portland on June 11 and Oct. 8,
and from Portland to Denver on May 17 and Sept. 11. The prices are
from $2,875 to $4,585 a person, double occupancy, and include all
meals, one night at the Jackson Lake Lodge in Yellowstone and
excursions. Information: American Orient Express Railway Co., 2025
First Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98121; (888) 759-3944 or (206) 441-2725,
fax (206) 727-7309.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Atlanta to Savannah &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will be traveling to Atlanta, and while in the South we
want to visit Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. Is there a bus
tour that leaves from and returns to Atlanta? _ S.Kaye, Queens,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The limited interest in such an excursion doesn't justify
running it regularly, representatives of the two major bus-tour
operators in Atlanta say.
</P>
<P>
   If you're really determined to see Savannah while in Atlanta,
you can take an intercity bus. The ride on the first three buses of
the day _ departing at 7, 7:30 and 8 a.m. _ can take from 5 hours
40 minutes to 6 hours 40 minutes. All three arrive at 1:40 p.m. The
7 and 8 a.m. runs are operated by Southeastern Stages, which
charges $71.16 for a round trip, and the 7:30 and three other buses
to Savannah are operated by Greyhound Lines, which charges $77.04
round trip. Information: Greyhound, (404) 584-1728; Southeastern
Stages, (404) 874-2741.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, there are about two dozen tour companies, and they
offer tours by van, by boat and on foot. So if the trip seems worth
the effort, you can get details from the Savannah Area Convention
and Visitors Bureau, 222 West Oglethorpe Ave., Savannah, Ga.
31402-1628; (800) 444-2427 or (912) 944-0456. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another option is staying put and getting to know Atlanta
better. A choice of daily four-hour excursions is offered by
American Coach Lines, (770) 449-1806, for $35 to $40, and American
Sightseeing Atlanta, (800) 572-3050 or (404) 233-9140, for $35 or
$36.

 &HT;    VIAGRA-FUELED RAPE CASE GOES BEFORE JUDGE IN JAMAICA
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim at 550 words.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ An elderly businessman charged with
raping a young employee goes before a judge here Tuesday, and
prosecutors are expected to say that Viagra made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   At an initial hearing last month, prosecutors charged that Keith
Roberts, 70, who takes tourists on boat rides, sexually attacked
the 27-year-old woman after swallowing a dose of the wonder drug.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth McLeod, who will represent Roberts at Tuesday's
preliminary hearing, maintains that the whole thing is a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client is being framed,'' said McLeod, declined to discuss
specifics of the case. ``The woman wants his money.''
</P>
<P>
   The case -- while certainly alarming to many Jamaicans -- hasn't
stirred as much surprise on this tropical island as one might
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Viagra are not yet legal in Jamaica, yet pharmacists
say they've been bombarded by Viagra-related questions from men --
some desperate, some merely curious. Black markets for Viagra have
sprung up throughout the Caribbean, with the light blue
diamond-shaped pill, manufactured by Pfizer Inc., selling like snow
cones in a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its popularity, many governments in the region are
pushing the anti-impotency drug through the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest is definitely here because many people are asking
for it,'' said Norma Inniss(CQ), president of the pharmacy board in
the twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. ``We're hoping to
get approval soon because everyone's talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, Trinidadian customs officials raided several
pharmacies and confiscated hundreds of Viagra pills being sold for
as much as $20 each.

   Introduced in the United States last April, Viagra has become a
global phenomenon in just over four months. Prescription sales
indicate that as many as 3 million American men may have already
popped one of the so-called wonder pills, while Pfizer officials
expect worldwide approval of the drug by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has, in particular, aroused a lot of interest in the
Caribbean and in Latin America, where male virility is a highly
valued attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the drug to do quite well in the Caribbean and Latin
America,'' said Pam Gemmel, a spokeswoman for Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials say Viagra doesn't cause men to act
aggressively and that it isn't an aphrodisiac, but that it
increases the flow of blood to the genitals.
</P>
<P>
   In South America, the sale of Viagra has been approved in
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. In late July,
Costa Rica became the first Central American country to approve
Viagra, which will be sold for about $11 a pill by prescription
only.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, where sales are expected to be approved later this
month, Viagra is known as ``the love pill.'' The news media is full
of rave -- although usually unscientific -- reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where sales are permitted, humorists claim Viagra
means ``the old lady is grateful'' from the words ``vieja'' and
``agradecida,'' which mean ``old'' and ``thankful'' in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The drug's hype has become so frenzied that the mayor of one
southern Brazilian town recently announced that he would hand
Viagra out free to townspeople in order to jumpstart a sagging
population and, thus, boost the amount of federal aid his town
receives.
</P>
<P>
   Elcio Berti, the mayor of Bocaiuva do Sul, said his town's
population dropped from 12,000 to 8,750 after it was divided into
two municipalities in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Berti, who only last year tried to ban condoms, said he will
spend $35,000 of his own money on Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Inniss said that the positive publicity surrounding Viagra has
increased the market for traditional, but cheaper, alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Within Latin and Caribbean societies, where an emphasis is
placed on ``machismo,'' it's never been unusual to see men flocked
around dirty, roadside stands where raw oysters are sold despite
the threat of cholera.
</P>
<P>
   But besides shellfish, Inniss said men now are also in hot
pursuit of the ginseng root, the bark of the bois bande tree, and
anything else that's said to have sexual curative powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more interest in local products right now,'' she said.
``I think that Viagra just started the ball rolling.''

VOID IN L.A. LURES WALSH, DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh is still intrigued
by the gaping maw of the Los Angeles market, celebrating its fourth
year of NFL-free living and showing no signs of moral, economic or
vitamin deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   He still sees the possibilities of unlimited wealth for the
lucky swine who gets in first with a team, a building and a plan to
un-jade the most encrusted sports fans in America.
</P>
<P>
   So, as we all know, is Al Davis, who is renting the Oakland
property while keeping his own covetous eye on L.A. for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has money. Los Angeles IS money. Going broke with
the only NFL team in a population of 13 million takes the kind of
creativity one usually associates with tax cheats, narcotics
informers and other domesticated animals.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, isn't there a team in Los Angeles? Why isn't there
a team being formed to go into Los Angeles? Why, most specifically,
aren't the Oakland Raiders already there waving tire irons wrapped
in injunctions at anyone casting a covetous eye toward their little
ranch in extremis?
</P>
<P>
   Give it time. As it becomes more and more evident the Raiders
are only visiting and not really planning to stay, all of these
things might happen, testing Walsh's grandiose theories, Davis'
rapacious instincts and commissioner Paul Tagliabue's legal skills.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's going to be blood on the moon, and we're
going to ruin a few good dress shirts getting too close to the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the economic logic that sent Davis to Los Angeles back
in 1981 (``L.A. plus me equals zillions'') still applies, and the
absence of a second team in L.A. makes it an even more appealing
prospect. Knowing he can beat the NFL in court pretty much whenever
he wants to makes it even more exciting to him, and few things get
Al's blood a-bubble quite like sticking his index finger up to the
third knuckle in the NFL's legal eye.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Davis' complaints about the mistreatment and
treachery accorded him by Oakland officials, convicted as they are
of throwing great wads of money at him to bring him back, ring so
hollow. Not because he doesn't feel wronged, mind you, but because
legal trouble with the locals works just as well for him as peace.
</P>
<P>
   We all know what our local pols did to screw up the Raiders'
return, starting with giving Al the bulk of the money up front.
They deserve all the grief they get, for both their arrogance and
their stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   But Al hasn't done much to alter the status quo that wounds him
so. For one, he keeps pinning the seat license and attendance woes
on the pols and marketers who promised him full houses into the
Thursday before eternity. And yet, he does none of the obvious
things a businessman concerned with the bottom line would do _ say,
usurping control and running the joint the way he wants it run. In
this case, taking back control of his tickets and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   And no, let's not hear about how he can't. Al takes what he
wants, no matter how long it takes to get it. He beat the
unbeatable Pete Rozelle _ you think a couple of puddings from the
Oakland flats with a piece of paper bother him?
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, he doesn't want control of his tickets and marketing.
Either that, or he already does have control and has no intention
of changing a single decimal point.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is still sitting there, and Al keeps asserting his rights
to the market as though he were still there.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he looks like more of a threat to return if things are
going badly in Oakland than if they go well. He might have a harder
time convincing a judge of the merits of his L.A. claim if he is
minting money in Oakland. He would certainly have a harder time
convincing you or me.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving now, though, creates some annoying legal problems in
Oakland, and it puts him back in the rotting hulk that is the L.A.
Coliseum, which he fled four years ago holding his nose. Going back
now isn't progress but another spin on the hamster wheel, and Davis
has never been one to stand still. He marches ahead, he falls
behind, but he never just stands there. Not when it comes to
location, relocation or de-location.
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes, and the L.A. situation heats up, you will
see how much Davis wants to stay in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   As for Walsh, who knows? He is 67, and by the time Los Angeles
becomes viable, he could be 77, or at its present rate of progress,
107. Right now all he can do is admire that team-less burg from
afar and wonder over a tall, cool, properly aged something or other
what it would be like to be in charge one last time.

 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ At 67, with a great career as a particle physicist and
teacher already behind him, Dr. James W. Cronin of the University
of Chicago has embarked on a new one as a kind of traveling
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   He is campaigning in a score of countries for help in building a
pair of gigantic cosmic-ray telescopes expected to reveal some
tantalizing secrets of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a professor of Greek and Latin, Cronin has spent much
of his career doing particle experiments at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and the Brookhaven National
Laboratory in Long Island, where in 1963 he and Dr. Val L. Fitch,
both professors at Princeton University at the time, discovered a
type of particle decay that may explain why the universe survived
its violent birth instead of annihilating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin and Fitch were awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics
for the achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin has spent most of his life searching for subtle insights
hidden in thickets of data, and he still loves data and the
experiments that produce it.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years he has also become a spokesman for
cosmic-ray research, traveling endlessly and bringing his charm and
gift of persuasion to bear on government agencies and institutions
in 19 nations. For what he is trying to do he needs money,
equipment and scientific talent.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a full-time laboratory denizen, he spends as much time
on airliners as in the comfortable apartment overlooking Lake
Michigan he shares with his wife, Annette, at the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have successful fund-raising trips and sometimes I
don't. I've become the Willy Loman of cosmic-ray physics,'' he
remarked with a wry smile. (Willy Loman was the pathetic hero of
Arthur Miller's play, ``Death of a Salesman.'')
</P>
<P>
   Cronin is selling a kind of particle physics that helps explain
what makes the universe tick.
</P>
<P>
   Particle physicists learn from nature by accelerating specks of
matter_protons and antiprotons, for example _ and forcing them to
collide with fixed targets or with each other. These collisions
produce flashes of energy which convert themselves into new
particles of matter, many of them bizarre forms that existed in
nature for only an instant after the Big Bang of creation.
</P>
<P>
   But Cronin has turned away from laboratory accelerators to focus
his attention on the sky, which furnishes a constant rain of
cosmic-ray particles, some with almost inconceivably great
energies. The half dozen most energetic cosmic-ray particles
detected so far packed a punch of more than 10 to the 20th (100
quadrillion) electron volts each, some 10 million times more energy
than that of a particle boosted by the world's most powerful
accelerator. No one is sure how such vast energy is generated.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays began piquing
Cronin's curiosity a decade ago, and it has spurred him to organize
an experiment on a gigantic scale designed to operate on a very
tight budget_far more frugal than the budgets of most laboratory
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the ``Auger Project'' to honor the late French
cosmic-ray physicist Pierre Auger. (pronounced ``oh-zhay'') When
(and if) it is completed, it will consist of 1,600 detectors
scattered across a region of Argentina the size of Rhode Island,
and an equal number of detectors in a tract at the Dugway Proving
Grounds 75 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the detectors being built for the experiment is a
light-tight metal tank containing 12 tons of water and three
photomultiplier tubes. When a high-energy particle hits the water
it will leave a streak of blue light along its track _ a kind of
optical shock wave. The photo tubes will record the direction from
which the streak originated, and with luck, the experimenters may
identify some of the celestial objects from which high-energy
cosmic rays are arriving.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine site near San Rafael in Mendoza Province, and the
Utah site, are both sparsely populated.
</P>
<P>
   The detectors will be installed in hexagonal patterns, each
detector spaced from its nearest neighbors by one mile, and each
array covering an area of 1,160 square miles. Dispersed among these
detectors will be some other instruments known as `fluorescence
detectors,'' or ``fly's eyes,'' so named because of the multiple
phototubes they point toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   During clear, moonless nights, these detectors can see the faint
flashes of fluorescence in the sky caused by showers of high-energy
particles, and will measure the energies of these flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Arrays covering huge areas on the ground are essential to the
Auger experiment because it will look for the rarest of cosmic
rays.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have determined that about once a century a single
cosmic ray particle with an energy of 10 to the 20th power electron
volts will hit any given one-square-kilometer (0.39 square mile)
patch of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   By using an area much greater than one square kilometer, the
odds of snagging the shower produced by a very high energy particle
are improved. When both the Argentina and Utah arrays are working,
Cronin calculates, they may detect and measure about 30
ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles a year. Small though that
harvest will be, it may help to resolve a dilemma that is puzzling
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, an American, Dr. Kenneth Greisen of Cornell University,
and two Soviet physicists, Dr. G.T. Zatsepin and Dr. V.A. Kuzmin,
independently reached the conclusion that no cosmic-ray particles
reaching the earth could exceed 5 times 10 to the 19th power
electron volts.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning was that cosmic ray particles above this energy
speeding through intergalactic space would interact with photons of
microwave radiation left over from the Big Bang, and so be
destroyed and converted into secondary particles of lower energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sparse evidence collected since then has suggested that there
might indeed be some kind of energy cut-off. But a paper published
on Aug. 10 in the journal Physical Review Letters by a team of
Japanese physicists reveals new evidence that the hypothesized
cut-off may not exist, and that there may not be any limit to the
amount of energy a cosmic-ray particle might have.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese group, led by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research
of the University of Tokyo, reached its conclusions from data
gathered by the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array from 1990 through
1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This Japanese array, which covers an area of 100 square
kilometers (38.6 square miles), saw a number of cosmic-ray showers
with energies of magnitudes supposedly ruled out by the cut-off.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a continuous range of cosmic-ray particle energies,
or is there a gap in the range? Is there an upper limit to cosmic
ray energies? Where do these celestial bullets come from, and how
are they accelerated?
</P>
<P>
   The Auger detector arrays in Argentina and Utah, which will be
the largest ever built, may solve some of these questions.
</P>
<P>
   But such arrays are expensive. Cronin and his collaborators
expect the Argentine and Utah detectors and apparatus to cost about
$100 million. So far, there is a big deficit in financing for the
Argentine array, and little if any financing for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Holding an international coalition together has also proved
tricky, Cronin said; if one nation expresses misgivings about its
financial contribution, others begin to worry. That means that
Cronin must be constantly on the move to plug holes in the
organizational dike. Currently, for example, he is conferring with
officials in Argentina to strengthen their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps being a Nobel laureate, because potential supporters
take you more seriously. But it's tough going, even so,'' Cronin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Having technically retired two years ago, Cronin is now a
professor emeritus at the University of Chicago. But this fall he
will begin teaching part time at the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an ulterior motive in going to Utah, besides wanting to
teach there,'' he said. ``I hope to beef up support for the Utah
part of the Auger project, which has not yet been funded.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that brought fame to Cronin and the professional
status helping him to attract financing had to do with the
juxtaposition of matter and antimatter created in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom of particle physicists prior to 1956
assumed that matter and antimatter were identical in every respect,
except that a particle of antimatter is a mirror reversal of all
the dimensions of its matter counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1956, faith in this assumption was shaken by two
physicists at the University of Chicago, Dr. Chen Ning Yang and Dr.
Tsung Dao Lee, who found evidence that this might not be strictly
true. A year later they were awarded a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Cronin and Fitch performed a very delicate experiment
that conclusively demonstrated an even more striking violation of
these symmetry principles, and provided an explanation for the
seemingly improbable existence of our universe, which is made
entirely of matter, without any antimatter.
</P>
<P>
   A particle of matter that encounters an antimatter particle
causes the annihilation of both particles and the creation of gamma
rays that race away at the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   It was generally believed that the Big Bang created matter and
antimatter in precisely equal amounts. But if that were so,
theorists wondered, why had not the primordial matter and
antimatter canceled each other out completely, leaving only an
invisible glow of gamma rays?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Cronin and Fitch learned from their particle-beam
experiment at Brookhaven, was that nature is even less even-handed
than had been supposed. In technical terms, the two physicists
discovered that the ``charge conjugation'' and ``parity'' observed
in the decay of unstable particles called neutral K-2 mesons are
slightly violated by the ``weak'' nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   To a physicist, CP-violation, as this effect is commonly called,
is disturbing; it is a little like finding a flaw in the symmetries
of Newton's laws of motion. In effect, nature is slightly biased by
the weak nuclear force in favors of left-handed particle
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery entailed hard, uncomfortable work for the two
physicists and their graduate students, Cronin said. During their
research in 1963 they labored in an instrument-crammed nook next to
the big Alternating Gradient Synchrotron accelerator at Brookhaven
National Laboratory in Long Island. Their research quarters were
confining, dirty, and stifling-hot; ``We called it Inner
Mongolia,'' Cronin recalled, ``but we loved it, and I loved the
data it generated. In fact, I love data in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 discovery of CP-violation at the microscopic particle
level offered a possible explanation of why the universe was not
annihilated soon after its birth. The amounts of matter and
antimatter created by the Big Bang must have been nearly equal, but
not precisely so. For every billion particles of antimatter created
in the genesis explosion, the experiment by Cronin and Fitch
demonstrated, there could have been a billion and one particles of
matter. One surviving atom of matter for every billion particles
annihilated was enough to create the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Big accelerators have become so expensive to build that energies
much greater than those already operating may not be attainable. In
1992, construction of the Superconducting Supercollider was halted
by a Congress unwilling to support the $8-billion project, and
physicists have been forced to set their sights much lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't match the experiments that might have been possible
with the SSC,'' Cronin said, ``but there's enormous satisfaction in
studying cosmic ray particles. The money and scientific teams are
much smaller than those needed for accelerator experiments, so it's
a friendlier environment. It gives scientists from many developing
countries a chance to do research in high-energy physics. And it's
nice doing experiments out of doors.''

MICROSOFT COMBINES TV, COMPUTER AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the recent media noise about the paucity of new features
in Windows 98, surprisingly little has been written about WebTV for
Windows, an intriguing addition to the operating system that
foreshadows both the promise and the growing pains of mixing
television with the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   In its most basic form _ running on a standard PC connected to
the Internet _ WebTV for Windows acts as a sort of electronic TV
Guide that automatically gathers programming information for the
user's local broadcast area, cable system or satellite television
service.
</P>
<P>
   This information, plus brief descriptions of each program, is
delivered over the Internet and presented in a grid covering about
72 hours of programming _ generally, the current, previous and
following days.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is searchable by word or phrase, enabling the user to
hunt for a special program, character, actor, etc., without having
to read the entire guide, which can run to more than 100 channels
on some cable and satellite services.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the search does not have to be in the program's
title. Entering ``Mary Tyler Moore'' on Thursday, for example,
brought up two time slots for ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' on
Nickelodeon and ``Ordinary People'' on the Movie Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In this basic configuration, WebTV for Windows is sort of useful
but no more so than TV Guide's TVGEN Web-based service or Gist, the
Web-only television guide.
</P>
<P>
   But WebTV for Windows gets a lot more interesting on a computer
with both an Internet connection and a TV tuner card, which allows
viewers to watch broadcast, cable or satellite programming on the
computer screen. In this configuration, the lines separating
television, computer and Internet begin to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic program guide melds with channel selection, a
preview window and the interactive television/Web technology that
was created for the original WebTV system.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of this last feature is a rich irony, since the
original WebTV was designed by a small company of the same name as
a sort of antidote to the computer. By offering people e-mail, Web
access and other Internet features through their television sets,
the company hoped to attract customers who did not own _ or did not
want to bother with _ a computer.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV was arguably the first of an entire category of devices
known as ``Internet appliances'' that were intended as alternative
gates to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft acquired the WebTV company last year for $425
million, many industry analysts saw it as a defensive move, since
people who did not want or need computers obviously did not need
Microsoft. But increasingly, the acquisition is looking like an
astute offensive move as the company builds a platform for
interactive digital television on the WebTV foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Microsoft sealed a deal to provide key elements of
WebTV technology to Tele-Communications Inc., the cable giant
acquired last month by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the major cable players, TCI is eager to sell customers
more products, many requiring a new generation of set-top boxes
that can meld cable television and Internet access into a seamless,
interactive information and entertainment system.
</P>
<P>
   In June, with the release of WebTV for Windows as part of
Windows 98, Microsoft demonstrated an eagerness not only to play in
the digital television market but to formulate the rules. This is
nothing new; Microsoft has tried to dictate the rules in every
industry it enters.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not always get its way. Among its major losses came
after an aggressive attempt in the last 18 months to dictate
standards that would have made digital television sets compatible
with computer monitors at the expense of high definition.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is the only company right now offering a product
that not only melds the Internet and television but offers a
rudimentary form of that long-promised but elusive Holy Grail of
the cable industry, interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not a bad attempt at that. No, WebTV for Windows will
not provide video on demand, but if a cable provider carries the
interactive portions of programming that has been enhanced for
WebTV _ not all do _ consumers can click their way through some
extra interactive features of a particular show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a viewer could call up a pitcher's earned run
average while watching a game, open a chat window to compare notes
with other investors during a financial report or download recipes
while watching a program about cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Guggenheimer, who oversees development of WebTV for
Windows as Microsoft's group product manager for digital
television, said last week that he was not surprised by _ or
worried about _ consumer confusion about WebTV, which he called
``the first integration of television and Internet
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology will continue to advance, he said, and will
eventually be added to Windows CE, for hand-held devices, and
Windows NT, the industrial strength version of the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that Microsoft is trying to force everyone to
watch television on their PCs,'' Guggenheimer said. ``That's not
true. We're working to integrate two information platforms. The PC
is an information appliance, and television is another form of
information. There are many ways they can be used separately or in
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to develop an information machine that
offers enough flexibility so that each user can take from it what
he or she needs, whether it is Guggenheimer's watching a Sonics
game in the corner of his screen on nights he works late or
students in a classroom using interactive educational television
with the Internet for enriched instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that enthusiastic vision is shared by the
companies that manufacture TV tuner cards for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of ATI Research, the Toronto-based market
leader in both graphics and TV cards, said the company had seen ``a
very large increase in demand and sales'' in the few weeks since
the release of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is too early to know for certain how much of that
can be attributed to WebTV for Windows, he says he is certain that
consumers will eventually share his enthusiasm as they begin
simultaneously surfing channels and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Microsoft added a Web browser to Windows,'' he said last
week. ``Now they've added a cable browser and, really, a lot
more.''

MANY PROSTITUTES SUFFER COMBAT DISORDER, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The world's oldest profession may also be among its most
traumatizing. A new study has found that a serious psychiatric
illness resulting from exposure to physical danger is more common
among prostitutes than among troops who have weathered combat duty.
</P>
<P>
   The illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, is the modern
equivalent of shell shock, or combat fatigue. It leaves survivors
of serious physical danger emotionally numb, and tortured by
recurrent nightmares and flashbacks, often for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be presented today at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association in San Francisco, researchers
interviewed almost 500 prostitutes from around the world and
discovered that two-thirds suffered from post-traumatic stress
disorder. In contrast, the condition is found in less than 5
percent of the general population. Studies of veterans of combat in
the Vietnam War have found that the disorder may be diagnosed in 20
percent to 30 percent, about half of whom have long-term
psychiatric problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, we need to view prostitution itself as a
traumatic stressor,'' said Dr. Melissa Farley, a psychologist and
researcher at the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco
who directed the study with colleagues from Turkey and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farley's team interviewed male and female prostitutes
ranging in age from 12 to 61 who operated on the street and in
brothels in San Francisco and six large cities in Europe, Asia and
Africa. The vast majority reported having sustained recurrent
physical or sexual assaults in working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Using a severity scale developed by scientists who study
post-traumatic stress in the military, Dr. Farley's team found that
the prostitutes averaged a slightly more severe form of the disease
than even Vietnam veterans seeking treatment for the condition.
That is an ``enormously high'' rating on the scale, said Dr.
Matthew Friedman, executive director of the Department of Veterans'
Affairs National Center for post-traumatic stress disorder and a
professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of post-traumatic stress disorder among the
prostitutes appeared to be unrelated to their nationality or where
they worked. It was as common in Istanbul as in San Francisco, and
as common among the men and women working in three expensive
brothels in Johannesburg as among those working in the streets of
that city, even though less physical violence occurred in the
brothels, Dr. Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is the first study of post-traumatic stress in prostitutes,
but other studies have shown similarly high frequencies of the
disorder in other disadvantaged groups of women, including pregnant
drug users, and homeless and battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farley also found that about two-thirds of the prostitutes
studied complained of medical problems. Unexpectedly, few of the
problems appeared to be related to sexually transmitted diseases,
she said. Instead, they were similar to the medical problems
researchers have found in other groups of patients with the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the romantic vision of prostitution often
presented by Hollywood, ``prostitution is not just a job choice,''
Dr. Farley said. More than 90 percent of the prostitutes in her
study said they ``wanted out'' of that way of life.

   &UR; Seeing Stars &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why can't you see the stars in photos or videos taken by
astronauts?
</P>
<P>
   A. Such pictures do not ordinarily show stars because the stars
are not bright enough in comparison with the nearby Sun and the
things it shines on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all of the astronaut photos are of objects that are
brightly illuminated by the Sun,'' explained Scott Kardel of the
Lake Afton Public Observatory in Wichita, Kan., ``so to capture
them on film without overexposing the image, you need a relatively
short exposure. These short exposures do not provide enough time
for the film to capture images of stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Some photos taken in darkness do show stars, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stars are visible from space as long as there is no other
strong source of light in the picture,'' said Dr. Douglas
Blanchard, chief of the Earth Science and Solar System Exploration
Division at Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas ``Cameras and
video cameras adjust to the strongest light source in their field
of view. If the Sun is in view, no stars will be seen, just as we
do not see stars in the daytime although we know they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually astronauts' cameras are trained on parts of the
spacecraft or something else in the field of view, he continued,
and those objects reflect more light than the stars, so the stars
do not appear in the captured images.
</P>

   American and Australian astronomers have found more evidence of
dark objects apparently scattered throughout the fringes of the
Milky Way, and they say this could solve the mystery of the dark
matter that is unseen and accounts for most of the mass in Earth's
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may actually be observing dim stars in nearby galaxies,
and not any of the elusive dark matter. At least that is what some
skeptics suspect on the strength of other recent observations. As a
result, some astronomers think they may be just as much in the dark
about galactic dark matter now as before the concerted search began
early in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Charles Alcock, an astrophysicist at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California who directs the
research, said in an interview last week that observations of more
than 15 dark objects strengthen the argument that a halo of such
matter does surround the visible disk of the Milky Way and could
represent 50 percent of the galaxy's mass.
</P>
<P>
   The objects, detected at the Mount Stromlo Observatory in
Australia, appear to be composed of ordinary matter in chunks of
about half the mass of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have long been puzzled by calculations of the
dynamics of the stars in the Milky Way and in other galaxies, which
suggest that the Milky Way contains as much as 10 times more mass
than can be accounted for by its visible stars.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, Alcock's team of American and Australian
dark-matter hunters first linked such machos, which stands for
massive compact halo objects, to this mysterious missing galactic
mass. At the time, they had recorded only six detections using an
indirect observational technique called gravitational lensing.
</P>
<P>
   When an otherwise unobserved macho passes in front of a
background star, the macho's gravitational field acts like a lens,
magnifying the star's light. The star's sudden brightening signals
the presence of a macho.
</P>
<P>
   Alcock will describe the 15 new gravitational-lensing detections
Tuesday at an international astronomy conference in Canberra,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have two and a half times as much data, and so the
results are much more secure than when first reported,'' Alcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists can only speculate on the identity and nature of
these halo objects. They could be dim collapsed stars called white
dwarfs, remnants of the galaxy's earliest stellar populations
billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are white dwarfs, they should have left detectable
traces of carbon in the diffuse gas of surrounding space, and
nothing like that has been observed.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the machos are primordial black
holes, extremely dense objects that might have formed about 10
microseconds after the origin of the universe in the theorized Big
Bang. But the existence of primordial black holes has yet to be
established.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Freeman of the Mount Stromlo Observatory cautioned that
the macho detections might help solve the dark matter problem for
the Milky Way, but not for the universe. Astrophysicists estimate
that at least 90 percent of the mass of any galaxy takes the form
of a dark halo, which provides the gravity that holds the galaxy
together.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery has centered on whether the halo matter consists of
star-size lumps or exotic elementary particles. The current
findings have no bearing on the dark matter in the vast spaces
between galaxies, also presumably a major component of cosmic mass.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the new macho findings, Dr. John N. Bahcall, an
astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
N.J., said that serious questions have been raised over whether the
detected objects are in the Milky Way halo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they have found is important,'' he said of the
American-Australian team. ``But they may have found answers to
different questions than they asked.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, for example, the astronomers alerted colleagues at
other observatories to an unusual brightening of one of the stars
in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy. The
background stars that the machos magnify are in that galaxy or the
Large Magellanic Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the event, telescopes in Australia, Chile and South
Africa made a puzzling finding: The brightening event lasted many
hours or days, much longer than is consistent with the lensing
macho being in the halo of the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   In its July 17 issue, the journal Science reported several
observations indicating that the brightening had to be the lensing
effect of a slow-moving object passing close to the background
star. Several of the events thus had nothing to do with mass in the
Milky Way halo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Gould of Ohio State University in Columbus was quoted
as saying that the long duration of the lensing event implies with
99.5 percent to 99.9 percent certainty that the lens is in the
Small Magellanic Cloud, not the halo.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Alcock conceded that ``substantial uncertainty
and controversy'' surrounded the macho findings and that it was
often not possible to determine exactly where an observed dark
object lies along the line of sight to the background star, whether
near or far or in the halo or well beyond.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the position of only two machos could be reliably
determined by current techniques, and they were both inside the
halo.

WHEN SHIP INSPECTION MISSES STOWAWAY GERMS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After at least 270 passengers became ill on three successive
Regal Princess cruises from Vancouver, Canada, to Alaska this June,
the cruise industry was abuzz over a British newspaper report about
a plan for an international network to monitor health standards
aboard all cruise ships. But no such monitoring network seems
likely any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been talk about an international conference in the
next two or three years to deal with health and sanitation on
cruise ships,'' said Dave Forney, the senior health adviser with
the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta. ``But with the exception of the U.S. and
the Canadian inspection programs, you can't really point to much
more. And we're not sure why there isn't more international
interest, since we get lots of calls from U.S. citizens who worry
about getting sick on cruises.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study of cruise ship safety and health, commissioned by
the Coast Guard, noted that the number of outbreaks of
gastrointestinal disease had declined from 8.1 per 10 million
passenger days in 1975 to about 2.1 in 1996. But Forney said it has
probably risen slightly since 1996, because of the growing numbers
of cruises and cruise passengers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One reason there is no special urgency to embrace an
international monitoring system, aside from the cost, is that the
overwhelming majority of the more than five million cruise
passengers worldwide last year were North Americans. For tax
purposes most cruise ships are registered in Panama, Liberia and
the Bahamas, but, according to Forney, many have probably never
been to their countries of registry. In addition, United States
health and sanitation regulations apply to almost every ship that
pulls into an American port. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1975 under the authority of the Public Health
Service after several major disease outbreaks on cruise vessels,
the Vessel Sanitation Program keeps watch over every vessel with a
foreign itinerary arriving in United States ports with more than 13
passengers. Each such ship is given unannounced inspections at
least twice a year, and if it fails either one, the ship must
undergo another within 60 days.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inspections, are paid for by the cruise lines. Results are
available from travel agents and are posted on the Internet at
www.cdc.gov under the Travelers' Health menu.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each inspection checklist consists of 42 items, from water to
hand-washing facilities to food protection, and a passing score is
at least 86 points out of a possible 100. Five points are
subtracted for lapses in hygiene by food workers, for water and for
equipment that does not properly monitor the water.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian program, according to a spokesman in the Canadian
Embassy in Washington, amounts to one unannounced inspection a year
on ships traveling Canadian waters during the cruise season from
April through October.
</P>
<P>
   But after so many passengers became ill on the Regal Princess
cruises from Vancouver to Alaska this summer, Canadian authorities
inspected the ship after the first two cruises. During the outbreak
on the third cruise, Forney and Dr. David Kim, a medical
epidemiologist with the Vessel Sanitation Program, also boarded the
1,600-passenger Regal Princess in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC coordinates with state, local and foreign health
departments when deemed necessary, as it did in the summer of 1994
when pneumonia and Legionnaires' disease were detected among
passengers who sailed the Celebrity Horizon from New York to
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intervention measures were taken both during and in between
each of the Regal Princess cruises,'' Forney said, ``and when those
measures were not successful, the company made the decision that
the best way to take care of the problem was to do the systematic
cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing that can only be done without
passengers aboard ship. That's why they took it out of service.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines usually hasten to cooperate with inspectors, not
least because failure to get a clean bill of health can quickly
cost $1 million in lost revenue. The Regal Princess was out of
service for a week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The culprit in the Regal Princess outbreak was the Norwalk
virus, a fairly common cause of gastrointestinal-disease outbreaks
at sea or on shore, usually characterized by nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and abdominal pain lasting 24 to 48 hours. However, the
source of the Norwalk virus aboard the Regal Princess is still not
known,  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause of the illnesses, the subsequent
stem-to-stern disinfecting of the Regal Princess, which scored a 92
in its inspection last January, appears to have done the trick. The
ship continues to sail its normal itinerary, and in its latest
inspection, on July 8, it scored a 95.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most detailed inspection is often powerless to
uncover or prevent illness aboard ship. Germs could lurk in
improper handling of food before it got aboard, or in the failure
of food handlers aboard ship to practice proper sanitation. There
is also no way to prevent passengers or crew who may be in the
early stages of an illness from boarding ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wants to go to the Black Sea, and he asked me what ship
to go on,'' Forney said. ``I told him nobody could guarantee that
he won't come down with something, but that he should be sure to
pick a ship that's been inspected by the Public Health Service.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost exactly three months ago, Craig Dahl, 26, a park
concessions worker, took his last hike, setting out on a steep,
winding trail above Two Medicine Valley in the southeast corner of
Glacier National Park in Montana. He never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, on May 20, rangers discovered the grisly
scene: Dahl's partly consumed body cached in a clump of vegetation
down slope from a trail.
</P>
<P>
   From the physical evidence, searchers surmised that a female
grizzly bear and her two cubs had preyed upon Dahl. Experts then,
working with the tools of forensic science, identified the
culprits, tracked them down and had them destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many ways the mystery was just beginning. Research
suggested that the female was a grizzly, nicknamed Chocolate Legs
for her distinctive coloring, who had been identified as a problem
bear in 1983, captured, and moved to the park's back country.
</P>
<P>
   She lived the normal life of a bear in the wild until 1997, when
she and her cubs again became bold around people. What triggered
that change? Why, a year later, did the bears stalk, kill and eat a
human _ predatory behavior extremely rare among grizzlies?
</P>
<P>
   On average, bears kill two people a year in North America, with
the number equally split between grizzlies and the far more
numerous black bears. In Glacier and Yellowstone, the national
parks in the United States with the most grizzly bears, the
frequency of fatal attacks is considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1910 and this year, bears have killed 10 people,
including Dahl, in Glacier; in Yellowstone, the total is 5 since
1839.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all attacks on humans result from a bear's defense of its
cubs, its food, or itself, according to Christopher Servheen,
coordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Service's grizzly bear
recovery program. ``Grizzlies are generally nonpredatory toward
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, weighing up to 1,000 pounds, grizzlies are formidable
predators, and their attacks, fierce enough in their own right, are
often sensationalized in popular accounts to make the big, powerful
bears seem more ferocious and dangerous than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Because wildlife officials hope to allay that fear and because
the 1,000 or so grizzlies left in the lower 48 states _ from a
presettlement population estimated at 50,000 _ are listed as
``threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act, they thoroughly
investigate every bear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of discovering the remains of Dahl, scientists
isolated human DNA in bear droppings taken from the scene. They
also matched bear DNA from hair samples gathered at the site with
that of hair collected a year earlier from the female grizzly and
her male cub by Daniel Carney, a wildlife biologist for the
Blackfeet Tribe, when he captured them, put tags in their ears,
clasped an electronic collar around the mother's neck and turned
them both loose.
</P>
<P>
   Carney began collecting hair samples from all bears he trapped
around 1995 when he realized that DNA would become an important
identification tool. This was the first occasion the collection was
put to use.
</P>
<P>
   When the experts matched the hair to the aggressive bears Carney
had tagged earlier, park and wildlife officials decided to destroy
all three animals.
</P>
<P>
   A few bear experts called the evidence circumstantial and argued
that the attack might have resulted from natural defensive
aggression or that the bears might have done no more than scavenge
the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when they do someone in, they don't feed on him,''
said Charles Jonkel, a former professor at the University of
Montana and a noted bear authority. Given the element of doubt, he
urged that the young female be moved and put through behavioral
conditioning to restore her wariness of people.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials decided that they could not take that chance.
Circumstantial or not, the evidence convinced them that the bears
had chased Dahl for several hundred yards downhill before killing
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire family group participated in this activity,''
Servheen said. ``Offspring learn from their mother and since they
were involved in pursuing and eating a human, those offspring were
likely to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Using dogs, helicopters and radio waves transmitted from the
mother's collar, park rangers began hunting the bears, who had
split up. The female cub was trapped on June 3, held four days as a
lure for her brother, who had vanished into the high country, and
then euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, wearing ear tag number 235, was found June 4 with an
adult male grizzly and shot. At the end of the month, the young
male returned to the Two Medicine campground, rushed a group of 16
tourists and then twice charged the guide before backing away just
feet from him. The bear departed, but was tracked down and killed
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Bear biologists were left to ponder why these apparently healthy
animals crossed the line to become man killers. While searching for
an explanation, Steve Gniadek, the park's chief wildlife biologist,
recently compiled a dossier on Bear 235 that deepened the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   After examining thin cross sections of a tooth stained to reveal
the dark rings that form every winter in the bonelike covering of
the tooth's root, scientists at Mattson Laboratory in Milltown,
Mont., placed the age of the female grizzly at 16 years, solidly
middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Based on that information and the holes in her ears indicating a
prior capture, Gniadek concluded that in all likelihood she was
Chocolate Legs, who had gotten into trouble as an 18-month-old cub.
</P>
<P>
   At that age she had already lost her wariness of people and was
causing ``bear jams,'' as tourists stopped their cars to watch and
photograph her along the roadside in Many Glacier Valley in the
park's northwest corner. Such bears, labeled ``habituated,'' forage
around roads and homes and are considered at risk of stealing food,
destroying property or coming into conflict with people.
</P>
<P>
   Captured in July 1983, fitted with an ear tag (number 251) and
radio collar, Chocolate Legs was flown 20 miles southwest across
the Continental Divide to the remote headwaters of Pinchot Creek
near 10,000-foot Mount Stimson.
</P>
<P>
   According to radio readings, between 1983 and 1986, she
repeatedly crossed the Continental Divide through the 8,000- to
9,000-foot peaks of the Lewis Range. In 1986, she threw off the
collar at her den near the headwaters of Pinchot Creek. At some
point, the original ear tags rotted out.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 11 years, Chocolate Legs apparently unobtrusively
occupied a range that included Two Medicine, although Gniadek
believes that she may have been involved in one incident in 1995 in
which a pair of hikers were frightened and their packs raided for
food.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that by 1997, Chocolate Legs and her cubs
were so habituated that they had become pushy around people. In May
1997, the three bears boldly walked through Red Eagle campground on
the Blackfeet Reservation, which abuts the east side of Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Carney captured Chocolate Legs and her son,
applied the ear tags and the collar and collected the telltale hair
samples. Then, he released them to a barrage of loudly exploding
``cracker shells,'' to scare them away and help restore their
wariness of people.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Carrie Hunt of the Wind River Bear Institute
in Heber City, Utah, and Tim Manley, a bear management specialist
with the Montana Department of Fish, Game and Parks used trained
dogs, loud noises and rubber bullets to drive the bear family from
the Two Medicine campground.
</P>
<P>
   Through June, the mother and cubs continued to show no fear of
people. In July, they displayed ``strange and erratic behavior''
around searchers looking for a missing hiker, Matthew Truszkowski,
25, of Michigan. Later, the female came onto a trail sniffing the
air and looking around, as if searching for Carney. In September,
the three bears again charged at hikers, backing away just feet
from them.
</P>
<P>
   After Dahl's death, some officials began to view the previous
summer's behavior as more ominous than it had first appeared.
Speculating that Chocolate Legs might have killed Truszkowski, the
authorities launched a new search, without success. Servheen
suspects that something happened in the summer of 1997 to cause
Chocolate Legs to view ``people as food.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts suggest that the key to understanding what
happened lies buried in the particular events of the bear's life
and personality. But common threads are habituation and a regular
diet of human and pet foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at bears that have killed and eaten people, except
those provoked by photographers, you see that they have a history
of habituation and food conditioning,'' said Stephen Herrero,
professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of
Calgary and a leading authority on bear attacks. But, he cautioned,
``Bears are complex, intelligent and individualistic, and so we
can't predict their behavior as if they were stimulus-response
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Chocolate Legs, said Herrero, underscores the need
for vigilance to prevent bears from becoming habituated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing,'' Servheen added, ``is that this doesn't
happen more often, given that there are people all over their home
range. That it does not is evidence that bears generally prefer to
let people go their own way.''

ON MOUNT ST. HELENS, HISTORY IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Wash. _ After climbing 4,500 feet through forest,
over and around boulders and finally across a steep snowfield, your
last steps take you to the rim of the Mount St. Helens volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The view is electrifying. The half-moon crater walls drop
straight down 2,100 feet to a lava plug dome, a mile across and
topped with crags, a wisp of steam emerging from its center. At its
edges, plumes of dust rising from continuous rockfalls trick you
into thinking a small eruption is in progress. The top 1,300 feet
of the old mountain _ once 9,677 feet high _ is gone, beheaded,
along with the entire north flank, which blew out. The summit now
peaks at 8,363 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The plug dome gives way to the blast zone, where the side of the
mountain, in a cataclysmic explosion, devastated 230 square miles.
It looks like a moonscape except for Spirit Lake on the north edge
where thousands of trees still float, logjammed by the volcanic
eruption on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond are 14,411-foot Mount Rainier to the north, 12,276-foot
Mount Adams to the east, and 11,235-foot Mount Hood to the south,
all rising like pristine diamonds in contrast to the hulking ruin
in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   As you take all this in, you swear you feel a tremor _ the Earth
shifting, perhaps like the movement that foretold the shocking
event 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen again? Here? At another mountain?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many chapters still to be written in the story of
Mount St. Helens,'' said Ed Klimasauskas, of the U.S. Geological
Survey. But, he said, there will be ``adequate warning of any
explosive event.''
</P>
<P>
   The Earth is talking again, and a lot of people are listening _
and watching.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of earthquakes at Mount St. Helens increased from
60 per month last winter to 165 in May, 318 in June and more than
450 in July. The USGS released a statement that concluded the
volcano was ``replenishing the magma reservoir'' for some kind of
outburst in the future, most likely a ``steam explosion.'' Because
the hundreds of recent quakes have been deep in the Earth below the
volcano and relatively minor (rather than shallow and major), the
USGS believes another catastrophic eruption is not imminent here.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been seismic activity at Mount Rainier near
Seattle, which some believe will be the next big one to blow. The
epicenters of its earthquakes are directly below the centerline of
its summit, an old lava pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, repeated earthquakes near Mammoth Mountain in
the eastern Sierra include a 5.1-magnitude quake in mid-July and
several aftershocks measuring 3.0 to 4.1. There also has been
significant venting of carbon dioxide, enough to kill several
groves of trees there. A team of USGS scientists said this venting
indicates a ``larger, deeper magma source and/or major reservoir of
high-pressure gas (that) is being tapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But such hints of danger do not seem to deter the curious. Mount
St. Helens _ 57 people died when it erupted _ has become one of the
most popular tourist destinations in America. It has attracted 3
million to 4 million visitors five years running, nearly equal to
the record numbers visiting Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the most climbed volcano in North America, with
13,000 people hiking to the rim each year, second in the world only
to Mount Fuji in Japan. Mount St. Helens holds its distinction
despite a quota of 100 hikers per day _ 60 of whom reserve permits
and another 40 who win a daily lottery. All must pay a $15 fee.
</P>
<P>
   It is a demanding climb for most, 11 miles round-trip, with a
rise of 4,500 feet to the rim. The last three miles are half-hike,
half-scramble along Monitor Ridge amid pumice boulders and
snowfields.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, the mountain is a ghostly site. In ancient times, the
Cowlitz Indians believed it to be a sacrilege to stand on its
summit. They named the mountain ``Las-We-Lat-Klah,'' which evolved
in the 1800s to ``Loowit,'' which translates as ``Person From Whom
Smoke Comes.'' Somehow that has been corrupted into ``Fire
Mountain'' at the visitor centers.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Mount St. Helens'' came from explorer George
Vancouver, who named it in 1792 in recognition of his friend
Alleyne Fitzherbert, the Baron of St. Helens in England.
</P>
<P>
   My hiking partner, Michael Furniss, and I began our trek after a
quick camp breakfast with an easy walk through the woods. Ptarmigan
Trail climbs gently, shaded and cool through old-growth forest,
then rises more steeply near the tree line. At 2.5 miles you emerge
from the forest to face Monitor Ridge, a 3-mile succession of
pumice boulders of all sizes cast by the volcano atop a ridge line.
A faint trail has been worn by previous hikers, and where it
disappears in the rubble, the Forest Service has placed poles to
mark the route.
</P>
<P>
   It follows and climbs the ridge, a gain of about 1,000 feet per
mile. It's steep, dry, often hot and the menace of cracking a shin
or knee against a boulder is constant.

   Above the tree line, other climbers came into view along the
ridge. They were all ages and, as it turned out, from all parts of
America. Ten straight were from different states.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be here with my son, to make this climb _ there are a lot
of lifetime feelings for me,'' said Fred Sibeanman, 70, of Moline,
Ill. ``This is not something you suddenly decide to do, and what
I'm feeling here won't suddenly leave me.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: HEALTH SCARES THAT WEREN'T SO SCARY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How often has your clock radio awakened you with the distressing
news that something you eat, drink, breathe or do has just been
shown in a new study to be a serious health hazard? And how often
did it turn out to be a false alarm, unsupported by subsequent
research?
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Science and Health, based in New York,
recently updated and expanded its popular report, ``Facts Versus
Fears,'' reviewing what it considers the greatest unfounded health
scares of the last five decades. Although controversy continues to
rage about potential risks associated with some of these
``scares,'' including Agent Orange and hormones in beef, most _
including those that resulted in serious economic damage and
changes in public policy _ have been soundly discounted by
subsequent studies.
</P>
<P>
   The following review of some of the most prominent scares in
recent decades serves as a cautionary tale that should help you
realize why it is unwise to leap before you look more closely at
what any new study actually means.
</P>
<P>
   ALAR _ In 1989, the popular television show ``60 Minutes,'' the
Natural Resources Defense Council and the actress Meryl Streep
denounced this chemical used to regulate the ripening of apples as
``the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply'' and
said it was a cause of childhood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation was based on a 1973 study in which a byproduct of
Alar caused tumors in mice. The dosage used in the study was eight
times greater than the so-called maximum tolerated dose, the amount
above which tissue damage occurs even from innocent substances
because of the high concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent tests by the National Cancer Institute and the
Environmental Protection Agency failed to show that Alar caused
cancer. Only when mice were given extremely high doses, equivalent
to 133,000 to 266,000 times the amount a preschool child might
consume in a day in apples and apple juice, did any tumors result.
</P>
<P>
   Still, millions of alarmed parents panicked and dumped untold
gallons of apple juice and bushels of apples, the apple industry
lost about $375 million, the Department of Agriculture lost another
$15 million, countless children were given far less nutritious
drinks in place of apple juice and Alar was taken off the market by
its manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE AND PANCREATIC CANCER _ In 1981 in The New England
Journal of Medicine, Harvard researchers published an
``unexpected'' finding linking pancreatic cancer to coffee
consumption. Just two cups of coffee a day doubled the risk and
five cups tripled it, said the researchers, who estimated that
coffee accounted for more than half the cases of this nearly
universally fatal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the study was designed to look not at coffee but at alcohol
and smoking as factors in this cancer, and other researchers who
had been studying huge numbers of people had found no such link to
coffee. Nor did animal studies disclose any association between
coffee and pancreatic cancer. Five years later, the Harvard group
repeated its study and failed to confirm its own findings.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Facts Versus Fears,'' the council stated, ``This brief
scare illustrates the danger of putting too much credence in a
single study without analyzing any possible biases or confounding
factors.''
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC BLANKETS _ Everyone in modern societies is exposed to
electromagnetic fields (EMF's) _ at home, at work and everywhere
that electricity is in use. A 1979 report hinted at a possible
relationship between childhood cancer and living near high-current
residential power lines, and subsequently, electric blankets were
singled out as possible risks, because of their nightlong proximity
to the body.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a study found a modest increase in cancers in children
whose mothers had used electric blankets during pregnancy and a
lesser increase in children who had used such blankets.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted a warning label on all electric blankets and a
redesign of the product that reduced EMF exposure to the background
level produced by household wiring.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent studies have not borne out the 1990 finding, and
this year a large National Cancer Institute study concluded that a
causal relationship between childhood brain tumors and EMF's from
appliances, including electric blankets, was unlikely. Other
studies that examined several adult cancers also found no
relationship to the use of electric blankets.
</P>
<P>
   CELLULAR PHONES _ Like electric blankets, cell phones create
EMF's. In 1990, a woman who had used a cell phone extensively for
two years developed a brain tumor just behind her right ear, where
she typically placed the phone's antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband filed suit against the manufacturer, saying that the
phone's EMF's had caused his wife's cancer. In 1993 he appeared on
the CNN program ``Larry King Live'' to proclaim his assertion,
which prompted three lawsuits from other cell phone users making
similar claims.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the industry paid for independent safety studies,
which have yet to clearly link cell phones to cancer. Although it
is not possible to prove that EMF's are safe, there is still no
convincing evidence of harm from the kind of EMF's that cell phones
emit. While the incidence of brain tumors has risen slightly in
recent years, there has been no disproportionate increase in tumors
near the ears, despite a meteoric rise in cell phone use.
</P>
<P>
   As the council points out in its report, by far the most serious
hazard associated with these phones is their use while driving.
Last year a study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine
showed that drivers who use cell phones are four times as likely as
nonusers to have an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ASBESTOS IN SCHOOLS _ Asbestos that is contained in a solid
substance is harmless. But when it becomes crumbly, airborne and
inhaled, it can lodge in body tissues, where it can sometimes cause
cancer. Asbestos insulation to protect against fire was required in
schools until 1973, when the Environmental Protection Agency banned
its use to reduce children's exposure. The 1980s produced two
Congressional acts requiring schools to inspect for asbestos
hazards and clean them up. Despite the fact that in most schools
asbestos levels were extremely low (less than the amount that in 10
years of exposure might cause one additional death in 100,000 over
a lifetime _ one-third the risk of being struck by lightning), by
1990 some $6 billion had been spent on asbestos abatement in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that asbestos removal, which increased
airborne asbestos, created a far greater hazard to the children,
who might have benefited far more had this money been spent on
enhancing their education.

 CASTLE ROCK, Wash: x x x leave me.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He smiled and trudged on. Everybody seemed bonded by the
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Most people require about four or five hours to reach the
summit, grinding out the last mile. Finally, it's a few last steps
and to the north Mount Rainier comes into view.
</P>
<P>
   You scan miles of landscape, from the plug dome out the blast
zone, across the mud flow and pumice to Spirit Lake and beyond to
the scorch zone and the ravaged Toutle River Valley, a view like no
other. Sitting on the crater rim, scanning the panorama, I swore I
felt an earthquake. Later in the week, checking seismograph
records, it turned out I had.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Few would have wanted to be in that spot on a soft spring
morning 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of small earthquakes had rumbled ominously for months
before a 5.1-magnitude quake jolted Mount St. Helens at 8:32 a.m.
on May 18. The bulging north flank of the mountain collapsed,
creating a gargantuan landslide. Part of it swept through Spirit
Lake, pushing up a wall of water 600 to 800 feet high _ an estimate
based on the wash line, since nobody who saw it survived. The
largest portion of the slide rampaged 15 miles down through the
Toutle River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A blast exploded out of the side of the mountain, venting
700-degree gases mixed with pulverized rock and ash at an estimated
650 mph, leveling everything for 15 miles on the north flank of the
mountain. The devastation continued downstream through the Toutle
River Valley and another 100 miles south along the Columbia River.
A vertical column of billowing dark smoke and ash then rocketed 17
miles into the sky, blocking the sun and turning eastern
Washington's day into night.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours later, magma rose into the crater and hardened,
forming superheated rocks called pumice, which then were ejected
out the side of the mountain. The heat from the volcano melted 70
percent of the snow and ice that had covered the peak, creating a
steaming, flooding ooze of mud down the Toutle River that crushed
everything in its path, closed Interstate 5 between Seattle and
Portland, and soon blocked traffic in the shipping channel of the
Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   According to historian Christine Colasurdo, the eruption
destroyed or damaged 27 bridges, 200 homes, 185 miles of roads and
stranded 31 ships. Spirit Lake was filled with 150 feet of mud,
burying everything and creating a new lake atop the flow, 40
percent of it covered by 35,000 trees. An entire forest was
despoiled, the trees toppled and scattered like tiny Lincoln Logs.
</P>
<P>
   In all, enough ash fell to bury a football field 150 miles deep.
Two weeks later, ash from the eruption had circled the planet and
fell near its source in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At least 170 people were taken to safety, but 57 died or
vanished. The most famous was Harry Truman, 83, who for 50 years
operated St. Helens Lodge on the south shore of Spirit Lake. In an
eerie recording, complete with piano music and glasses clinking in
the background, Truman explained why he refused to leave despite
being warned of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mountain is a part of me, and I'm a part of it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is now buried 300 feet down, under 200 feet of mountain,
deposits and mud flows, with the new lake on top of that.

<P>
   Michael Furniss and I sat for four hours on the crater rim
talking about the eruption, absorbing the view and watching the
reaction of hikers as they ascended the final steps and took in the
panorama.
</P>
<P>
   ``My face may be dirty and streaked, but the dirt is volcanic
ash from Mount St. Helens and the streaks are because I was crying
when I made the rim,'' said Nicole Sultana of Northville, Mich.
``It is all so unbelievable. I felt so much emotion, and it found a
way out in my tears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing; this is one of the special places in this
country,'' said Carol Dailey of Lincoln, R.I., who climbed up with
her husband, Joe. ``Film can not do it justice.''

CHEAP COMPUTERS ARE GOOD DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED -So you stroll through the doors at the local Kmart,
walk down the main aisle and hang a left to reach the electronics
department.
</P>
<P>
   There, stuck between the boomboxes and color TVs is your goal: A
row of computers in designer colors.
</P>
<P>
   You spend 10 minutes comparing the features, choose the
middle-priced model and reach below the display to grab the boxed
version of the machine you want.
</P>
<P>
   On your way to the checkout line, you pat your pocket to make
sure you brought those four $20 bills to pay for your new toy.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get home, you unbox the computer, plug it in and use
it, as though it was nothing more significant than a new telephone.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dream, I know. But we sure seem to be headed in that
direction!
</P>
<P>
   I base this claim on many things, including the computer ads I
run across every day in the newspaper, in magazines and online, and
a spiffy new iMac computer that Apple sent us last week to review.
</P>
<P>
   If you hunt through the ads a bit, and if you're not picky about
brand names or getting cutting-edge equipment, you can now find
yourself a basic Pentium-level computer for $400 and change _
including a monitor!
</P>
<P>
   Good grief, Hazel! It wasn't long ago that experts wondered
whether it was possible to produce a $1,000 computer. We've blown
through that roadblock, and show no signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of news that makes consumers jump for joy, but
leaves computer company executives with that sour, I-need-some-Tums
feeling in the pit of their stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery why the Intels and Motorolas of the world are
going through rough times, laying off workers and floundering about
as they try to cope with the millions of people who have always
wanted, and are now demanding, low-cost computers.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a segment of the market that desires
top-of-the-line stuff. Corporate buyers and computer enthusiasts
will always line up to shell out several thousand bucks for Pentium
IIs, 21-inch, flat-panel displays, 16-gigabyte hard drives or
8-megabyte 3D video cards.
</P>
<P>
   But it looks like the great unwashed masses don't care for that
stuff. The software doesn't require such power, and certainly
neither does surfing the World Wide Web or trading e-mail. Keep
your Lexus, Mr. Grove. All I need is an '82 Chevy, thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the masses might only be asking for an '82 Chevy, but
computer companies are giving them '98 models!
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 1 issue of ``PC'' magazine includes the results of
tests conducted on 37 sub-$1,000 PCs. After looking at what
consumers could get for less than a grand, the magazine concluded
that seekers of low-end machines should expect Pentium II-266
chips, 4 gigabytes of hard drive space, 4 megabytes of video RAM,
32-speed CD-ROMs and much more.
</P>
<P>
   The days when ``cheap'' meant ``slow'' or ``outdated'' are gone.
</P>
<P>
   As for the iMac, we pulled the $1,299, all-in-one unit out of
its box, plugged it in and it worked! And that included a
connection to our in-house network. It was almost as easy as
installing a new telephone. (We'll be writing a review of the unit
soon. Watch for details on www.azcentral.com/computing).
</P>
<P>
   So where will it all end? Will my Kmart dream come true?
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea. But I'd like to think we will some day reach the
point where the machine is secondary to the content, where how we
use the machine is more important than the machine itself and where
the machines become so affordable, reliable and easy to use that
the equipment fades into the background and we can focus on
communicating, learning, working or just playing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is just a dream. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHO USES THE INTERNET? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The September issue of ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' magazine has the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the magazine's best issues is full of statistics about
how many people use the World Wide Web, average ages, average
incomes, levels of education and lots more. The mag even has a cool
history of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of information you'd typically have to pay a
research firm thousands of dollars to collect. And you would, too,
if you wanted to launch an online business and actually make money.
If you don't understand your customers, how can you serve them?
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're just an occasional surfer, you'll enjoy browsing
the issue. Here's a few tidbits:
</P>
<P>
   - 51.7 million people use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   - 72 percent of American small businesses use e-mail to connect
with customers.
</P>
<P>
   - The average Net user is 37, up from the 1995 average age of
35.
</P>
<P>
   - 59 percent of Net users do their surfing at home.
</P>
<P>
   - 15 percent of Net users have published a personal Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Net-related statistics have always been a difficult thing to
come by, although that's never stopped anybody from trying. I
remember a time two years ago when the population of the Net was
estimated by one research firm at more than 40 million, while
another source doubted more than 10 million people were online. Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet Life'' did a good job providing the sources of all
its stats. But are they accurate? You'll have to be the judge. Some
sound like they're accurate. Others make you stop and wonder. I
mean, the average age of Web users is rising? If that's true, it
must be another baby boomer effect. (It would be interesting to see
if the average age of rock and roll fans is rising, too!) &QL;

 &HT;    POLICE ARREST FIVE IN CONNECTION WITH BOMBING, TOWN COPES WITH
SHATTERED PEACE
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ At about 11 a.m. (local time) Monday,
Tom Watterson emerged through his shop door and quickly turned to
post a sign on the metal security screen covering his store
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Wattersons is a small town dry goods store. Inside are clothes,
some linens and bedding, that kind of thing. Since Sunday, a neat
handwritten sign has been taped to the screen saying the store
would be closed until the funerals of the people killed in the
bombing 200 yards up the road from Wattersons.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday morning, the work of identifying the dead had
produced enough information for an update. Accordingly, Watterson
posted a new sign and silently withdrew into the store.
</P>
<P>
   Written in neat black ink, the sign said the store would be
closed until the funerals of three ``respected and totally
dedicated members of staff who died so tragically on Sat. 15th
August 1998.'' Best friends Geraldine Breslin, a Catholic, and Anne
McCombe, a Protestant, Saturday had taken their lunch break from
Wattersons together and headed up the street. A few minutes later,
they were killed in the blast of a 500-pound bomb hidden in a
stolen car parked on Market Street. Also among the dead from
Wattersons is Veda Short, a grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Omagh, which became acutely aware of its loss Monday, long has
been a place where people from different backgrounds got along,
developed friendships and tended to the day-to-day issues of life
in peace. It would only follow then that a bomb placed in the
city's heart would find victims across the political, religious and
national spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing,'' said Sean Clarke, the chairman of the
Omagh Council and a member of the Sinn Fein political party. ``The
bomb cut through all classes and creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in the worst terrorist attack in the 30-year
conflict here remained at 28. The count includes nine children --
including two babies -- 14 women and five men. Eight people are
still in critical condition, but expected by hospital officials to
survive. Another 100 were still hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   In an early morning raid, police arrested five men near Omagh in
connection with the bombing, but it was not clear whether they were
being held for questioning or as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The men were arrested in two villages north and southeast of
Omagh and taken to the main police center in Belfast, 70 miles to
the east. Under Northern Ireland's anti-terrorist law, they could
be questioned for up to a week before being charged or released.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Mackey, leader of a group under suspicion in the
bombing, today denied the organization was to blame, and said his
19-year-old son Shane was one of those arrested. Mackey is chairman
of the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, which denies allegations it
is affiliated with the ``Real IRA,'' a splinter group which broke
away from the Irish Republican Army in opposition to the mainstream
group's cease-fire in support of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators continued to probe the shards of bricks, boards
and glass for evidence. Workmen on ladders began nailing plywood
sheets over glassless shop windows. Their hammering echoed through
the narrow streets of this small town which eased through the day
in a stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic met much
of the day to develop strategies for bringing those responsible to
justice. They vowed to never give the bombers peace until they were
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people streamed into the small town carrying flowers,
many of them with notes attached. Hundreds of small bouquets were
left near Wattersons, where people congregated to read the messages
and speak somberly among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some brought small, white teddy bears. One of the notes read:
``In loving memory of all those who died so tragically in Omagh
Saturday. RIP. WHY?''
</P>
<P>
   The flood of condemnation continued. ``This is a fanatic group,
a minority group acting in a savage and wild way,'' the Spanish
Deputy Prime Minister Fernando Alvarez Cascos said after touring
the town center. ``All people living and believing in democracy
should be fighting together this kind of thing in solidarity.'' One
boy from Spain was killed and eleven Spanish children, here on an
exchange visit, were injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there is much political work to be done to salvage
the fragile peace process, that was a task many people wanted to
put off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tomorrow's job,'' said Barry McElduff, a local Sinn
Fein representative. ``Today's job is to bury the dead.''

STATISTICAL SAMPLING TO DETERMINE U.S. POPULATION A BAD IDEA  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC ON MONDAY, AUG.

<P>
   UNDATED - Since 1790, census-takers have counted heads and
collected volumes of data on how we live. These census-takers don't
take a poll and, based on a sampling of 1,800 people, determine
that three people live in your house, four next door and 4.6
million in all of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   No, they count heads _ one by one, as the Constitution requires
in its reference to an ``actual enumeration'' of Americans every 10
years. In the same way, we hold elections instead of relying on a
sampling of voters to determine our elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional method of taking a census is being challenged by
President Clinton and most Democrats. They want to use statistical
sampling _ that is, polling _ in the 2000 census. It's a bad idea
that invites bias, fraud and all sorts of other problems.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in this controversy _ as is usually the case when
politics rears its head _ are money and power.
</P>
<P>
   Data collected from the 2000 census will be used to divvy up
nearly $200 billion a year in federal funds among cities and
states. The data also will determine which states pick up seats and
which lose them in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments and businesses depend on the census data being
honest and reliable. Cities use the information in their planning
for police and fire stations, among other facilities. Businesses
rely on it to target customers and help decide where to locate
everything from restaurants to medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The debate boils down to this: Republicans believe census-takers
should count heads for reasons of accuracy, fairness and because
the Constitution requires it. Democrats, saying too many Americans
were missed in the 1990 census, particularly in larger cities,
propose using a statistical sampling method to supplement the
standard head count.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic proposal, the census would count 90 percent
of the population. Then, a statistical sampling would be used to
make estimates of the other 10 percent _ or about 27 million
people, give or take a few million.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sparks the question:
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know when you're at 90 percent if you don't know
what 100 percent is?'' asks U.S. Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who
serves on the newly-formed House subcommittee on census.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another problem is that sampling becomes less accurate as an
area gets smaller. For example, sampling a neighborhood block is
subject to great error _ plus or minus 28 percentage points,
according to one study. That has enormous implications because
redistricting starts from very small census blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For all their stated concerns about undercounting among
inner-city Blacks and rural Hispanics, Democrats don't propose
sampling to tally the most undercounted minority in the last
census: Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Their rationale is that counting heads is the most accurate
method on reservations _ which doesn't say much for the polling
argument. What's really going on, of course, is that there aren't
enough undercounted Native Americans to interest Democrats. For
Democrats, the next census is largely about finding those groups
traditionally viewed as Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   While the census isn't perfect, it can be made to work by
returning to the basics of knocking on doors to make sure everyone
is contacted and completes a survey in this $4 billion process.
Many of the 4 million who were missed in the last census were poor.
Half were estimated to be children. If all else fails, let's
explore reaching the undercounted when they come into contact with
the government for medical and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Polls, as any politician knows, can be inaccurate. They can be
biased, depending on how you decide to conduct them. They can also
be easily manipulated for political purposes. In 1990, the Census
Bureau suggested five formulas for adjusting numbers, and each
would have produced a different apportionment of House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic method of counting, there is even talk that
some surveys would be rejected if they didn't fit the statistical
scenario. That's wrong. Americans participating in the census have
every right to expect that their surveys will be counted _ and that
they count, too. &QL;

LIFETIME OFFERS THREE SHOWS THAT ASSERT THE FEMININE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Research people at the Lifetime channel probably don't spend
much time down at the VFW waiting for some guy to say, ``Hey,
anybody see that `Intimate Portrait' piece on the Queen Mum last
night? Some kinda woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV is all about narrowcasting _ the opposite of what the
mainstream networks try to do _ and Lifetime's slogan is
``Television for Women,'' a not-too-subtle attempt to stake out a
testosterone-free viewing zone. Given a choice, however, and based
solely on pilot episodes, here's one guy who'd choose the Lifetime
alternatives over much of tonight's offerings on the Big Four.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just the feminine side asserting itself here. Or
maybe it's the irresistibility of Annie Potts, Ann Cusack and
Joanna Gleason. If they were in the same show, I'd have season
tickets. Not that any of these original new series _ a milestone
for Lifetime, by the way _ is likely to be remembered as a TV
pioneer. They're not so much cutting edge as just slightly
different and, at bottom, the sort of programming that wouldn't
likely show up on the networks.
</P>
<P>
   There's some irony in that, because ``Any Day Now'' is a series
with noble aspirations and an interesting history. It was conceived
as a half-hour drama about an interracial friendship between two
girls growing up in Alabama in the early '60s. CBS planned to
introduce it in the summer of 1990, but an executive at the studio
developing the series balked, feeling the timing wasn't right. (He
was probably correct. A year later, NBC introduced ``I'll Fly
Away'' to critical applause and audience apathy.)
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Miller, co-creator of ``Any Day Now,'' evidently didn't
burn any bridges. She and Gary Randall, the studio exec who pulled
the plug on her eight years ago, are working together now as
executive producers of the new ``Any Day Now.'' But where the
original idea was to focus on two Birmingham girls in the
tumultuous '60s, this version centers on them as adults, with
frequent flashbacks to their youth.
</P>
<P>
   It's an effective conceit, though not particularly
groundbreaking. A steady reliance on the childhood scenes could be
little more than theatrical overstatement. In any event, we know
that the two women, Rene and Mary Elizabeth, now in their 40s,
haven't spoken to each other in more than two decades because of a
rift that drove them apart at 19. Rene, who always dreamed of
marriage and a family, is single, childless and a prominent
attorney in Washington, D.C.; Mary Elizabeth, who vowed to remain
single and leave Birmingham as soon as she could, never left,
married her childhood sweetheart and had three kids, one of whom
died.
</P>
<P>
   When Rene (Lorraine Toussaint) returns to Birmingham for her
father's funeral, Mary Elizabeth (Potts) initiates a reunion that,
we presume, will re-cement the bond that was once, in the words of
Rene's father, the best hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for ``Any Day Now'' is to remain a smart show
about two women struggling to understand their own imperfect lives
while trying to reinvent what once seemed the perfect friendship.
</P>
<P>
   In Toussaint and Potts, the series has formidable actors who can
handle thoughtful, sensitive material with amazing grace. Their
youthful counterparts, Shari Perry and Mae Middleton, also seem
capable of conveying the brilliant simplicity of an unlikely
friendship that grew more complicated as they grew taller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now'' could be something very special, and if it
avoids the slide into lazy melodrama it could give the networks one
more reason to worry about cable.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Cusack is another reason. Though not as well known as
siblings Joan and John, she is certainly their equal in bringing a
real-world sensibility to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Maggie'' (not to be confused with Faith Ford's upcoming
``Maggie Winters'' on CBS), Cusack plays a married mom whose 40th
birthday is cause for alarm. If the ``values'' police were
contemplating a Lifetime achievement award for the lofty aim of
``Any Day Now,'' they might be reconsidering after a look at Maggie
Day, who has gone from having fantasy liaisons with ``Melrose
Place'' hunk Jack Wagner to having make-believe trysts with the
doctor she sees every day at the veterinary clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie's self-absorbed husband, a ``real'' doctor, finally tunes
in to her mid-life malaise, but is it too late to rekindle their
romance?
</P>
<P>
   The typical sitcom would likely take the safe route, but
``Maggie Day'' might surprise us. Creator/producer Dan O'Shannon,
who earned his stripes on ``Newhart'' and ``Cheers,'' isn't letting
the cat of the vet's office, but he hopes the ``reality'' of
Maggie's situation will keep viewers coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers also will appreciate Cusack's innate ability to bring
truth to a comedic character _ she was easily the best thing about
NBC's version of ``The Jeff Foxworthy Show'' _ without making it
silly.
</P>
<P>
   Another practitioner of truth-in-acting is the elegant Joanna
Gleason. Alas, she is not the star of ``Oh Baby.'' Cynthia
Stevenson (``Hope &AMP; Gloria'') is.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Stevenson is more than agreeable in the role of
Tracy, a woman whose career (marketing executive) is nearly perfect
and whose personal life (single with commitment-phobic boyfriend)
is not nearly. Tracy wants to have a baby, and she decides
artificial insemination is the only viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The witty interplay between Stevenson and Gleason, as Tracy's
best friend, Charlotte, is bright and refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Less so is a gimmick involving a TV set and remote-control wand
that Tracy uses to explain her life, complete with fast-forward,
stop-action and rewind features.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of device we've all wished we had when describing
a particular passage in our lives, and Stevenson has fun with it in
the first episode. It could become tiresome after a while, but ``Oh
Baby'' can easily survive without the gimmickry.

TAILORING A HEALTHY MESSAGE TO BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ky., Ala.)   (af) 
By LINDA VALLAROSA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with whites, black Americans have higher death rates
from all kinds of serious illnesses _ from heart disease, diabetes,
stroke, some forms of cancer and asthma. Black babies are more
likely to be born small and die in their first year, and black
adults live fewer years than their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many of these problems could be attributed to the
fact that blacks are more likely than whites to be poor, to have
received less education and to have inadequate access to health
care. In recent years, though, the economic gap between blacks and
whites has narrowed, yet the health gap persists.
</P>
<P>
   This problem is attracting the attention of researchers, health
officials and the president, who has made it a priority. He is
seeking $400 million over five years for the Initiative to
Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health, which would
target six health categories that disproportionately affect
minorities: infant mortality, diabetes, cancer screening and
management, cardiovascular disease, HIV and AIDS, and
immunizations.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the problem, experts say, is the difficulty in
communicating health information to the black community. Despite an
increased public appetite for the latest news about medicine,
nutrition and exercise, and increased coverage in the press,
several studies and experts say health educators may not be
communicating the message clearly or appropriately to blacks. Or,
blacks may be ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three studies reported in a recent issue of The
Journal of the American Medical Association found that black
parents often missed hearing about a campaign to reduce the
incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The Back to Sleep campaign was created in 1994 by the United
States Public Health Service, the American Academy of Pediatrics
and several other organizations after experts who attended a
National Institutes of Health conference concluded that placing a
newborn in a side or back sleep position helped reduce the risk of
SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign seems to have had impressive results: In 1992, 70
percent of parents put their babies to sleep on their stomachs,
which increased the risk of SIDS, and in 1996, only 24 percent did
so. Since 1992, the rate of SIDS has declined by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the research also showed that low-income black and Hispanic
mothers are less likely to put their babies to sleep on their
backs, and their rates of SIDS remain higher than those of their
white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Back to Sleep message is not being adequately transmitted
to the black population,'' Dr. Michael H. Malloy, a pediatrician at
the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, wrote in an
editorial accompanying the research reports.
</P>
<P>
   Malloy, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics task
force that helped devise the campaign, noted that it had not been
designed with any particular group in mind, though, at the time, it
was widely known that the rate of SIDS was much higher for blacks
than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, ``we were more interested in a generic
campaign,'' with brochures and posters mailed to health care
providers to pass along Back to Sleep information to their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the medical journal studies, researchers found that
the greatest influence on a mother's decision to put her baby to
sleep on her back was advice from a health care professional. Yet,
in a small study conducted in Louisville, Ky., researchers found
that 72 percent of parents in a predominantly white private
practice setting reported that their physicians had recommended
putting their children to sleep on their backs compared with only
48 percent in a predominantly black inner-city clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reed V. Tuckson, the highest-ranking black in the hierarchy
of the American Medical Association, said, ``The public health
information network in every major city is being dismantled, and
the opportunity for a health care provider to spend quiet,
deliberate time in conversation with patients is diminishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuckson, the AMA's senior vice president for professional
standards, added: ``There is a need to increase the cultural
competence of doctors dedicated to service in poor communities. In
the sleep studies, it wasn't that the mothers were stupid or
irresponsible. They were concerned that the babies couldn't sleep
on their backs or that they would choke. There is a need for their
health care providers to go a little deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study, by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the National
Association of Black Journalists, involved surveys of 804 blacks
and 664 whites to determine the effectiveness of the press in
delivering health information. Compared with whites, blacks were
much less likely to think the press provides enough health and
health care coverage and more likely to think the press does a poor
job of ``telling people in this country what they need to know
about health and health care.''

LABUTE-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Neil LaBute is the film world's
unlikeliest Mormon. Last year, the writer-director burst upon the
scene with the controversial ``In the Company of Men,'' a movie
where two middle managers deliberately set out to woo a woman and
then heartlessly dump her. Now he's back with another cynical look
at love and relationships, ``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' By Glenn
Whipp. 
. 
MULAN-HAIR (Los Angeles) _ Call it the real parent trap. Inspired
by the spirited heroines of two new made-for-little-girls movies,
some youngsters are taking up scissors and trying their hands at
shearing their own locks. Snip. ``Look, Mom, I'm Mulan.'' By
Jenifer Hanrahan. 
. 
MOVIES-FASHION (Los Angeles) _ Movies make stars, but they also
make fashion statements. Consider the film ``Titanic'' and that
dazzling ``Heart of the Sea'' necklace. It's being knocked off all
over town, and it's ditto with the dresses. By Barbara De Witt. 
. 
UMA-FASHIONS (Los Angeles) _ Say what you will about the new
``Avengers'' movie _ that you don't remember the 1960s TV series,
that you didn't even know there was a TV series, that English twits
(even in parody form) are still English twits and therefore about
as enjoyable as boiled beef and cabbage for breakfast _ but this
film does have one thing working for it, a selling point so vivid,
so delectable, that you can see why they green-lighted the whole
thing in the first place. 
. 
PARTY-SOCIAL (Los Angeles) _  Benefits and balls are swell, but the
CaliforniaMart's lingerie party was a nice change of pace on the
social circuit. This wasn't one of those parties in people's homes
where they sell nightgowns like Tupperware but a lavishly staged
runway show of the latest in undies, presented while guests sipped
wine and nibbled pate, focaccia and chicken on a stick. By Barbara
De Witt.

WHEN MULAN CUTS, SO DO GIRLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; At least it's not as bad as when little boys
jumped off the roof to be like Superman.
</P>
<P>
   Little girls have found their own idol in Mulan, the spunky
heroine of the animated film by the same title who shears off her
long dark locks with a sword to masquerade as a man and defend her
family's honor.
</P>
<P>
   So what are little girls up to this summer? Hacking off their
own hair to be just like Mulan.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents are dragging their little girls into hair
salons, hoping stylists can undo the do-it-yourself 'dos.
</P>
<P>
   Hair stylist Maria Navarro recently had a 5-year-old come into
Halos Kids Cuts in Reseda dressed in a Mulan T-shirt, Mulan shoes
and a Mulan haircut to match. She had chopped off her bangs to the
scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``She only stopped there because her mom walked in on her,''
Navarro said. ``I asked her why she did it. She said, `I want to
look like Mulan'.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozy Raissian, owner of Land of Ozy in Encino, had a customer who
loved her 3-year-old daughter's long, reddish-dark brown hair.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mother left her daughter with a baby sitter who took
the girl to see ``Mulan.'' While the mother was away, the little
girl chopped off her hair, leaving little clumps here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Raissian said. ``She cut it like a mushroom.
I fixed it nice. Now the little girl is happy because her hair is
short. But the mom is very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't take a movie to get a kid to cut her own
hair. Between 2 and 6, kids cut the bangs off dolls and Barbies.
And, if the mood strikes them, sometimes they take liberties with
their own hair, too, stylists say.
</P>
<P>
   Movie and cartoon characters always have inspired children to
yearn longingly for that certain look. Long, flowing hair captured
little girls' fancies when Pocahontas was the Disney gal of the
moment. Flat tops were the hit among boys when Bart Simpson first
hit the tube, said Sabrina Feldman, manager of Yellow Balloon in
Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, banning your child from theaters may not be the
answer, either. Jessica Conway, 7, of Reseda went to Halos Kids
Cuts to get her long locks chopped into a bob just like Posh Spice,
who Jessica is playing in a summer camp skit.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just be thankful it's not Edward Scissorhands who captured
kids' imaginations.

MORMON SCREENWRITER`S CHARACTERS ELICIT STRONG REACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Neil LaBute loves the power of words. He's
practically inebriated over the idea that words _ his words! _ can
move audiences to shout at his characters on a movie screen, to
write angry screeds in newspapers and magazines, to confront him on
the street, to even spit in his face. LaBute will take your saliva
and wear it as a badge of honor. Don't misunderstand. He wants your
love. But he doesn't mind if some hate comes with it. Just don't
ignore him. Indifference would be like a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute _ whose new movie, ``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors,'' opens
Wednesday _ will never forget when his first movie, ``In the
Company of Men,'' premiered last year at the Sundance Film
Festival. Now, remember, this is Sundance, an event dominated by
Movie People, hardened cynics who watch hundreds of films a year
and think they have seen it all. Then the lights go down and
LaBute's movie starts unspooling and there are these two
businessmen who blow into a town and scheme to romance the same
deaf woman and then, just when she's all doe-eyed and dewy, they
dump her _ simply for the sport of it!
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be reaching for the sleeping pills within a week, and
you and me, we'll laugh about this until we're very old men,'' said
Chad, the duo's charismatic, stinkbomb of a ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie ends and the credits start rolling, LaBute thinks
that some people are going to grab a rope and lead him to the
nearest tree. Aaron Eckhart, who played Chad, was walking out the
door when a woman found him and hissed, ``I HATE you!'' Eckhart,
who has known LaBute since college and has seen this type of
reaction before, replies, ``No. No. You've got it wrong. It's not
me you hate. It's the CHARACTER.'' But the woman doesn't see it
that way. ``No. I hate YOU.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, LaBute doesn't help matters much with his casual
intellectualism and blase dismissals during the question-and-answer
session that follows the screening.
</P>
<P>
   Sample Question: Why is the movie's victim a deaf woman?
</P>
<P>
   LaBute: I don't know. I guess I've just always thought deaf
people were funny.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it. Neil LaBute. Sundance Scofflaw.
Filmmaking Firebrand. World-class Hun. Except ... what's this? ...
LaBute, 35, has a wife of 13 years and two kids, ages 10 and 7.
Lives in Indiana. Is unfailingly cordial and polite. Is loved by
friends and family. (Although his mother wishes he'd make a
``nice'' movie.) Has worked with mental patients in spare time. Is
a devout and practicing Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   With each new fact, the picture becomes a little fuzzier. Who is
this guy? And what exactly is he up to, anyway? That's precisely
what LaBute wants people to ask. He doesn't believe in heroes or
villains, whether they populate the movies he writes and directs or
walk the streets of our neighborhoods. LaBute lives for the gray
areas. That's where he feels most comfortable, except for those
times when he's making his audience feel uncomfortable. Comfort in
discomfort is his working motto.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is the idea behind LaBute's new movie, an
unflinching look at the intimate relationships of six upscale
suburbanites. The film's three men and three women lie, cheat and
betray each other and themselves in a variety of perverse, twisted
ways. The film has no nudity and the audience sees the sex either
immediately before or immediately after the act. It's all talk.
Words! Brutal, unsparing, emotionally wrenching words.
</P>
<P>
   ``His language is precisely shocking,'' says Eckhart, who
appears in the film playing an impotent man who's the polar
opposite of his character from ``In the Company of Men.'' ``Neil
has always been able to open up a can of worms that no one else
seems willing to touch. And the great thing is, he doesn't feel the
need to explain these people or have some big emotional catharsis.
They are who they are. There are no judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. Because while in one breath LaBute will tell
you, ``I'm not passing judgment on behavior. I'm just exposing it
and asking, `What do you think?' minutes later he's telling you
about his Mormon faith and explaining how it influences his work.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute converted to Mormonism after winning a scholarship to
Brigham Young University's acclaimed drama program following
graduation from his school in Tacoma, Wash. While there (and LaBute
returned later for graduate studies), he didn't exactly sing in the
Tabernacle Choir. Mostly he did what he's doing now, pushing the
envelope with his words and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Example: One of the first plays LaBute wrote was called
``Bash,'' which featured a well-heeled Mormon discussing a previous
night's gay-bashing while he waits to take a family portrait. BYU
administrators didn't come right out and say, ``No. You can't do
this.'' They simply asked LaBute if he could maybe make the
character, say, a Catholic instead. LaBute refused.
</P>
<P>
   Later in his BYU days, LaBute staged a production of David
Mamet's ``Sexual Perversity in Chicago.'' This time he had to cut
much of the play's language and situations. By the time he was
done, the show was almost incomprehensible. Still it was ``Sexual
Perversity'' at ... Brigham Young University! (Words! The power of
words!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always liked to shock people,'' says Eckhart, a
longtime friend and a fellow Mormon. ``His plays at BYU had the
same themes of betrayal and portrayals of the dark side of
humanity. People didn't know what to make of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, practicing Mormon LaBute acknowledges that most in the
church feel his Mormonism needs a little more practice. LaBute
thinks his faith is just fine, if, admittedly, a little improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't look at my work and say, `That's what I'd expect
from a Mormon,' '' LaBute says. ``But I think you need to give
voice to subjects. I felt that way at BYU and I feel that way now.
The church's tendency is to feel that there's enough bad in the
world, so let's have some positive examples, especially in the
media. They're wary of being able to find good by showing the
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute, naturally, takes the complete opposite approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of good can come from showing evil,'' he says.
``It promotes thought and discussion. Both of my films and most of
my plays have had a very staunch moral point of view by looking at
these people, these Philistines, as if from on high, and saying,
`Hmmm ... I'm not so sure I like how these people are operating.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's very Old Testament, very condemning, very judgmental, in
its own subtle way. You just have to look at the movies from the
proper perspective _ from LaBute's perspective. That way you don't
look at two guys stringing along a deaf woman and think ...
misogynist! You see two reprehensible human beings who will, upon
their demise, spend all of eternity shoveling brimstone in the Lake
of Fire. Or something like that. Just don't expect LaBute to hold
your hand and help you make the call. That's not his method of
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised that women felt that `In the Company of
Men' was misogynistic,'' says Alix Madigan, a producer on LaBute's
new film who met the filmmaker at that fateful Sundance festival.
``I mean, yes, it was brutal, and when I first met Neil, I kind of
expected to see him walking around in a dark cape. But he doesn't
shock you for the sake of the shock itself. He's showing some
terribly flawed people and not making any apologies for their
behavior. He trusts the audience to draw their own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Steve Golin, another ``Friends &AMP; Neighbors'' producer:
``His movies have this weird blend of drama and comedy, and it's
the kind of humor where you hate yourself later for having laughed.
And after getting to know Neil and spending time with him, it's
hard to figure out where all this cynicism comes from. Maybe the
work is therapy for him. Maybe that's where he gets all the dark
stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute's wife, Lisa, a therapist and lifelong Mormon, might have
something to say about that. She reads all his scripts, checking
for the characters' psychological accuracy. Lisa was very pleased
with ``In the Company of Men,'' but was less enthusiastic about
``Your Friends &AMP; Neighbors.'' Oh, Neil got the mental underpinnings
down all right, she thought, but did he have to make a movie about
couples and, um, sex? After all, what would their friends and, yes,
neighbors think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most people, she's a little squeamish talking frankly
about sexuality,'' LaBute says. ``People can watch a movie sex
scene with two people writhing around in bed with saxophone music
playing in the background and it doesn't bother them nearly as much
as watching two people sitting and talking about it. So, yes, I
think she found it a little unnerving.''
</P>
<P>
   But unnerving is good. Discomfort is the goal. Push-pull,
pull-push. Love-hate, hate-love. Bad is good because good comes
from seeing bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any harm from shaking up a can of bees just to see
what happens,'' LaBute says. ``I think we have enough niceness in
our culture, too many entertainments that leave absolutely no
ripple in anyone's consciousness. They just take up time. To me,
that's the most damning kind of review you could receive. It was
`nice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Neil. Chances are, nobody will ever feel inclined
to write that.

UNDIES OUT IN THE OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Benefits and balls are swell, but the
CaliforniaMart's lingerie party was a nice change of pace on the
social circuit.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't one of those parties in people's homes where they
sell nightgowns like Tupperware but a lavishly staged runway show
of the latest in undies, presented while guests sipped wine and
nibbled pate, focaccia and chicken on a stick. Definitely not a
party husbands had to be dragged to ...
</P>
<P>
   Typical of social events in L.A.'s Fashion District, the female
guests expressed themselves in swaths of tulle, slinky black
cocktail sheaths, and peasant dresses in washed-out pastels worn
with slashes of pink eye shadow, while men favored loud
Italian-looking sport shirts or dark linen tees with sport coats.
</P>
<P>
   On stage, the fashion parade was presented by Cosabella and
Calida. Other manufacturers previewing their fall and holiday lines
included Lise Charmel, La Perla, Lou, Nina Ricci, Only Hearts,
Simone Perele, Natori, Ripcosa, Keiko Ono, Jonquil, Hanro and Flora
Nickrooz.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, from the looks on the runway, underwear is no longer an
unmentionable. According to Sue Scheimann, president and chief
executive officer of the CaliforniaMart, ``Last year we hosted our
first intimate apparel fashion show, the only one of its kind on
the West Coast, and responding to the monumental interest displayed
at the debut show, we naturally decided to make this an annual
event.''
</P>
<P>
   The news? Several guests, such as fashion mavens Linda Arroz and
Jane Mannfolk, talked about how lingerie sales are up and how the
G-string, once a stripper's staple, has influenced the fashion biz.
Later, I chatted with Sergio Oxman, co-owner of the Italian
lingerie firm Cosabella, and he agreed that bikini panties have
been replaced by lacy thongs _ which, by the way, were given as
party favors. He also said decorative bustiers are the newest trend
in underwear as outerwear. His portion of the fashion show included
them, plus heavily embroidered rich gold and red lingerie and saucy
see-through peignoirs inspired by the '50s. His finale was a
``bride'' in a white leaf-print bustier and sheer skirt over a
G-string, who was serenaded by an opera singer in black tie.
</P>
<P>
   The CaliforniaMart's next round of parties will be Oct. 4, when
the California Designer of the Year and Rising Star awards will be
presented at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills. For ticket
information, call Dana Forster at (213) 630-3618.
</P>
<P>
   For more fashionable soirees, circle your calendars for Sept. 24
and 25, when the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will hold Art of
the Palate '98. A major fund-raiser for the museum, the event is
all about eating in a unique setting. Instead of everybody going to
one place, you choose your dream date locale from among 51 parties.
For instance, the ``Pleasures of Prague'' is a night of Eastern
European cuisine and music with the Consul General of the Czech
Republic, Ivana Hlavsova, priced at $225 a person. Or how about
``Picasso's Paris,'' an intimate soiree designed to be a fantasy
journey to Paris in the decadent '20s; or ``The Mayor Who Came to
Dinner,'' which is a dinner party at the Brentwood home of Mayor
Richard Riordan, priced at $500 a person. Most events are for 14
guests and don't require a tuxedo. For more information, call (323)
857-6182.

ENGLISH LEATHER REACHES NEW HEIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Say what you will about the new ``Avengers'' movie
_ that you don't remember the 1960s TV series, that you didn't even
know there was a TV series, that English twits (even in parody
form) are still English twits and therefore about as enjoyable as
boiled beef and cabbage for breakfast _ but this film does have one
thing working for it, a selling point so vivid, so delectable, that
you can see why they green-lighted the whole thing in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Namely: Uma. Emma.
</P>
<P>
   And, really, what more do you need? Uma. Emma. Which, roughly
translated, means Uma-leather, since Uma Thurman's ``Avengers''
character, sexy super-sleuth Emma Peel, spends half the movie
prowling about in a leather catsuit.
</P>
<P>
   For men, Uma and leather are two words that have a certain
inevitability to them, not to mention a precise, lyrical beauty.
They go together like peanut butter and jelly or Bill Clinton and
subpoena. If David Letterman had used Uma-leather as his mantra
instead of Uma-Oprah four years ago at the Oscars, he might have
been invited back to host. Alas, he didn't, and he was
unceremoniously shunted back to the late-night wasteland, never to
don a tux again.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. Uma-Emma, Uma-leather. Uma is the kind of
statuesque beauty (not to mention crackerjack actress!) who
``Avengers'' costume designer Anthony Powell said would ``look sexy
wearing a garbage can liner.'' (Uma-Hefty? Hmmm...) In ``The
Avengers,'' she and her bowler-hat-wearing partner John Steed
(played by Ralph Fiennes) drolly engage cartoon criminals in
methods only a little less silly than Austin Powers, International
Man of Mystery.
</P>
<P>
   No one remembers Emma for her crime-fighting exploits, though.
It was her clothes, specifically the leather catsuit that she
occasionally wore to the office. Actress Diana Rigg only slipped
into the outfit a few times during the run of the television series
because it would split whenever she tried to run or pull off a leg
kick. (These were the prehistoric days before stretch leather.)
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to update the catsuit, Powell tried to come up
with a look that, like Uma-Emma, Uma-leather, had a certain
inescapable destiny to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my first meeting with Uma, she asked where the catsuit
would hang in Emma's wardrobe,'' Powell says. ``That's a very good
question. You just don't get up one morning and think, `Today, I
may fall off the top of a skyscraper, so I'd better wear the black
leather'.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. But if retailer J. Peterman has his way, a number
of women might start thinking along those lines. His new catalog
features a replica of Uma's ``Avengers'' catsuit under the heading:
Only Slightly Perverse. The typically droll caption goes on to say
that the outfit is ``High Risk. High Reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for $2,000, Peterman's catsuit isn't the kind of impulse
buy women are likely to make for the upcoming fall season. There's
also the nagging question of accessorizing the outfit (what kind of
earrings go with a catsuit?) and where, precisely, today's woman
would wear such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, unique, sexy,'' Peterman says.
</P>
<P>
   And it could give those casual Fridays at the workplace a whole
new lyrical beauty of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.

HOLLYWOOD HAUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Movies make stars, but they also make fashion
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the film ``Titanic'' and that dazzling ``Heart of the
Sea'' necklace. It's being knocked off all over town, and it's
ditto with the dresses. Numerous designers, including California
Designer of the Year nominee Judy Rabineau of Mica, have their own
version of ``Titanic'' costumes scheduled to hit stores by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``The Avengers'' opened Friday, and with it come a
slew of '60s styles that Jackie O probably didn't wear.
</P>
<P>
   In this big-screen return of secret agents John Steed and Emma
Peel (played by Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman), costume designer
Anthony Powell gives us sleek black catsuits that are sure to be a
hit by Christmas, especially with high-heeled boots (already
spotted at Macy's).
</P>
<P>
   Thurman's sexy cheongsam is an easy snag, as it's already on the
racks _ in black with Nordstrom's Classique label, and coming soon
in deep red by Mica.
</P>
<P>
   And those oversize shades Thurman's character wears? You won't
need to wait for a knock-off. They're by Calvin Klein, and
available at Sunglass Hut stores for $85.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``Ever After'' will have to dig deeper in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``glass'' slippers worn by Drew Barrymore as Cinderella
are exquisitely beaded mules designed by Italian shoemaker
Salvatore Ferragamo, with a $2,500 price tag. Even at that price,
and a six-week waiting list, a Ferragamo spokeswoman says there's a
waiting list. FYI: Cinderella's custom-order shoes feature 200
silver pearls, 1,000 tiny glass beads and meters of silver thread.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, if you've got the money, you can make! the shoe
fit.
</P>
<P>
   To order, call (800) 822-1956, or go to the Ferragamo boutique
on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, where the shoe's on display until
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   For Barrymore's tiny braids and wavy mane, check out your local
mall. Many have carts selling ready-made synthetic braids and
hairpieces.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're going for the look in a serious way, try the
Dean Rhodes Salon of Beverly Hills. They'll create a replica of
Barrymore's romantic medieval style for about $50 (depending on the
length of your hair), and also make custom-blended hair pieces if
you've got short hair.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest Cinderella trend to try is the glossy glitter on
Barrymore's face when she goes off to the ball. It's $25 at the
Chanel counter; less expensive variations (less than $10 for a
small jar) also are available at accessory stores around town.
</P>
<P>
   Another movie with sparkle aplenty is ``Dance With Me,'' which
features competition ballroom dresses with Swarovski crystal beads.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not featured in the film, Swarovski created a
special retro-style ``Dance With Me'' choker made of tiny pearls
and pave crystals in a platinumlike setting, $125 at most
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Although they're not designed specifically for ballroom dancing,
designers such as Gucci, Prada and Givenchy have gowns with sparkle
in their fall collections.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``BASEketball,'' a stupid sports spoof, has a fashion
angle.
</P>
<P>
   Those saucy little marabou-trimmed sheer nylon robes and baby
doll pajamas worn by the teams' cheerleaders were provided by
Frederick's of Hollywood. The lingerie chain store now has a
complete line of ``BASEketball'' fashions, including garter belts,
bras and white lace corsets, which should give a big boost to the
renewed interest in '50s lingerie.

SAFEKEEPING IN THE FRIDGE?  
 CLUES TO COMPREHENSION  
 GROWING SMARTER WEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Md.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget about keeping valuable documents in a safe deposit box.
The best place to preserve them, scientists say, could be the
fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Richard V. Wolfenden, a biochemist at the University of North
Carolina, has found that enzyme reactions that break down starch
and cellulose, common elements of paper, are highly sensitive to
changes in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of 18 degrees Fahrenheit lowers the reaction rate six
times; a 36-degree drop from 77 to 41, produces a fortyfold
decrease in the rate.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfenden, who studies reaction speeds as part of his research
on enzyme antagonists like protease inhibitors, notes that papers
that might ordinarily crumble in a few decades could last for
centuries if properly refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   But before throwing that last will and testament in with the
cold cuts, consider this: Moisture is as much an enemy of paper as
heat, and the relatively high humidity in run-of-the-mill
refrigerators would probably doom a document to a short shelf
life. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reaction rate of a different sort was the subject of an
unusual experiment in which researchers at the Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine measured the time it takes the brain to comprehend a
pictured object.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. John Hart, a neurologist, worked
with an epilepsy patient who had electrodes temporarily implanted
on his brain in preparation for surgery to control seizures. The
22-year-old patient agreed to participate in the study, which
involved naming and categorizing images of everyday objects, while
the grid of 174 small electrodes was in place.
</P>
<P>
   A mild electric current applied between two electrodes
temporarily disables that part of the brain. In the experiment, the
researchers focused on an area at the base of the brain that was
linked to word recognition.
</P>
<P>
   By applying the current at specific times while the patient was
viewing an image, and noting whether word recognition was
disrupted, the scientists could determine how long it took to
process the information.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: about four-tenths of a second for a familiar object,
up to about three-quarters of a second for a less familiar one.
Beyond those intervals, the current had no effect.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say that the experiment is further evidence that
information builds up gradually (if rather quickly) in the brain.
Investigation of this process could help in understanding how
information is lost when a person suffers a stroke or develops
Alzheimer's disease. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weeds may be pests, but they are not dumb: They can make use of
the best that genetic engineering has to offer and still keep their
essential weediness intact.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known that genetically altered traits like
resistance to herbicides can be transferred from crops to related
weeds through cross-pollination. But it was thought that the
resulting hybrid weeds would produce fewer seeds or have other
characteristics that would make them less aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers in Denmark and at Ohio State University have
shown that weeds related to oil seed rape, the source of canola
oil, have the best of both worlds: They not only acquire
genetically altered traits from the crop, but produce as many seeds
as unaltered weeds. So a herbicide-resistant hybrid will not be
crowded out; indeed, if a field is then sprayed with herbicide,
only resistant weeds will remain.
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid passing on altered traits, the researchers
suggest, would be to change the genetic engineering process to
modify the DNA outside the nucleus of a plant cell rather than
inside it, as is now done. DNA from the nucleus is contained in the
pollen, which is carried throughout a field by the wind or insects;
DNA from the cytoplasm outside the nucleus can only be passed on
through seeds.

   A German tourist walks into a McDonald's in New York City and
orders a beer. The local guy in the line behind him immediately
gives him a verbal jab, `They don't serve beer here, you moron!'
</P>
<P>
   The German fellow felt embarrassed, however he turned to the New

</P>
<P>
   `And what's so funny?' the New Yorker demands.

<P>
   `Oh, nothing really, I just realized how stupid you are. You

<P>
   &UR; FARM COUNTRY HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A motorist, after being bogged down in a muddy road, paid a
passing farmer five dollars to pull him out with his tractor. After
he was back on dry ground, he said to the farmer, `At those prices,
I should think you would be pulling people out of the mud night and
day.'
</P>
<P>
   `Can't,` replied the farmer. `At night I haul water for the
hole.'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a flight from Hartford, Conn., to Chicago recently, a lovely
lady who has to be everyone's idea of a grandmother settled into
the seat next to me. Obviously not a frequent flier, she looked
about with lively interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a spacious seat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly don't give you a lot of room for your knees, do
they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they don't,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   When our meals arrived, she examined the salad closely, and she
poked the cellophane-wrapped roll with an inquiring finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread,'' I said, anticipating her question.
</P>
<P>
   Then the main course arrived, which bore a faint resemblance to
chicken. She looked at it and tested it with her fork. Then, very
quietly, she mused: ``So this is life in the fast lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Hirshorn, on the verge of her fifth birthday, is ``a real
New Yorker,'' according to her grandmother, Nancy Yanes-Hoffman.
Recently, after finishing her dinner, Rachel jumped up from the
table, eager to read a new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say before you leave the table?'' her mother
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check,'' Rachel replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Rachel,'' her mother groaned. ``That's not what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel thought for a minute. ``I know,'' she said. ``Check,
please.''
</P>
<P>
   The softball field is a short walk from Robert T. Quade's house
in Bernardsville, N.J., and for more than three decades he has
strolled down on summer evenings to watch the men's teams in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been changes: uniforms and equipment,
sponsors, haircut styles, cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Many players, coming directly from work, have wolfed down pizza
slices, hamburgers and sub sandwiches, but on a hot dusty day last
month there was another innovation. As his team was at bat, an
infielder took over third-base coaching, keeping a keen eye on the
batter and runners while, with great aplomb and handling his
chopsticks faultlessly, he munched sushi.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Stuart was looking for a parking space on East 71st
Street recently when she spied a car about to pull out. So did the
motorist ahead of her. As she attempted to pull forward into it,
the driver ahead simultaneously tried to back in. Stalemate. Both
sat there, neither one able to claim the spot, and neither one
willing to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, the other driver got out of his car and
walked back toward Ms. Stuart, who rolled down her window and
asked, ``Are you a gambling man?'' He was, he said. How about
flipping a coin for the space, she asked. He produced a quarter,
flipped it and said, ``Your call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads,'' Ms. Stuart called _ and it was. The man smiled, got
into his car and drove off, no doubt to continue his search.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Express train from Old Greenwich to Grand Central.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Two businessmen
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Jennifer Sherwood
</P>
<P>
   First businessman: ``We finally got our new Suburban. It's
perfect. It has two pull-down movie screens in the backseat and two
matching headsets. We don't have to worry about the kids bothering
us on long car trips. You should look into it.
</P>
<P>
   Second businessman, not missing a beat: ``Well, I'll have to
come over soon with the kids, and we'll put them in the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying on a bathing suit at Bloomingdale's, Menorah Rotenberg
overheard the following conversation between the woman in the next
dressing room and the woman's husband, waiting outside.
</P>
<P>
   He: Honey, are you hungry?
</P>
<P>
   She: After trying on these suits. I'll never be hungry again.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters to New York are so used to traffic jams that they
generally take them in stride. In five years of commuting from New
Jersey to Manhattan over the George Washington Bridge, Leslee
Fetner has seen drivers reading newspapers, styling their hair,
applying makeup and, of course, talking on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But she was pleasantly distracted one day recently when traffic
was particularly heavy. A sleek blue sports convertible pulled
alongside. The driver _ white plastic baton in hand _ was earnestly
conducting a symphony that was obviously coming from his radio or
CD player. Next stop, Carnegie Hall?
</P>
<P>
   Verla C. Gabriel was in an elevator with two other women,
obviously friends. One, who had seen a list of to-do chores posted
in the other's kitchen, asked what ``metal'' meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means cleaning silver,'' the friend replied. ``I didn't
want to write silver because if a burglar came, he'd start looking
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could write `argent' or another foreign word,'' the first
woman suggested.
</P>
<P>
   No way, said the woman. ``New York burglars are multilingual,
everyone knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Evelyn Murphy in her local supermarket, watching:
</P>
<P>
   Action: A woman in the soup aisle, looking tired and completely
uninterested. She glances at the rows and rows of soup labels and
takes out her cell phone. She punches several buttons, still
looking bored. ``So, what do you want for supper?'' she asks.

   NEW YORK _ Hoods may once have been worn only for warmth, but
now they have entered the fashion scene on all manner of clothing,
including dresses and tailored jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is just one more way in which designers are being
influenced by athletic styles like sweatshirts and anoraks, making
them suitable for work, not just workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue has a tailored gray-hooded jacket with a zip
front by Bisou-Bisou ($158); a sleeveless white matte jersey top
($118) and a red matte jersey dress ($145), both by ABS; a fitted
gray cap-sleeve sweater by Diabless ($148), and a belted long
cardigan from Weekend by Max Mara ($375).
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan's charcoal wool hooded pullover ($580) and Theory's
gray zip-front jacket ($240) are at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, there are black cashmere sweaters with
hoods by Urchin ($120); pale blue rayon pullovers by Yesin ($120),
and black stretch rayon tops with three-quarter sleeves by Page
($92).

   The softball field is a short walk from Robert T. Quade's house

   Over the years, there have been changes: uniforms and equipment,

</P>
<P>
   Many players, coming directly from work, have wolfed down pizza

   Sheila Stuart was looking for a parking space on East 71st
Street recently when she spied a car about to pull out. So did the
motorist ahead of her. As she attempted to pull forward into it,
the driver ahead simultaneously tried to back in. Stalemate. Both
sat there, neither one able to claim the spot, and neither one
willing to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, the other driver got out of his car and
walked back toward Ms. Stuart, who rolled down her window and
asked, ``Are you a gambling man?'' He was, he said. How about
flipping a coin for the space, she asked. He produced a quarter,
flipped it and said, ``Your call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads,'' Ms. Stuart called _ and it was. The man smiled, got
into his car and drove off, no doubt to continue his search.

   First businessman: ``We finally got our new Suburban. It's

us on long car trips. You should look into it.
</P>
<P>
   Second businessman, not missing a beat: ``Well, I'll have to
come over soon with the kids, and we'll put them in the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying on a bathing suit at Bloomingdale's, Menorah Rotenberg
overheard the following conversation between the woman in the next
dressing room and the woman's husband, waiting outside.
</P>
<P>
   He: Honey, are you hungry?
</P>
<P>
   She: After trying on these suits. I'll never be hungry again.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters to New York are so used to traffic jams that they
generally take them in stride. In five years of commuting from New
Jersey to Manhattan over the George Washington Bridge, Leslee
Fetner has seen drivers reading newspapers, styling their hair,
applying makeup and, of course, talking on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But she was pleasantly distracted one day recently when traffic
was particularly heavy. A sleek blue sports convertible pulled
alongside. The driver _ white plastic baton in hand _ was earnestly
conducting a symphony that was obviously coming from his radio or
CD player. Next stop, Carnegie Hall?
</P>
<P>
   Verla C. Gabriel was in an elevator with two other women,
obviously friends. One, who had seen a list of to-do chores posted
in the other's kitchen, asked what ``metal'' meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means cleaning silver,'' the friend replied. ``I didn't
want to write silver because if a burglar came, he'd start looking
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could write `argent' or another foreign word,'' the first
woman suggested.
</P>

   No way, said the woman. ``New York burglars are multilingual,

looking bored. ``So, what do you want for supper?'' she asks.

`SWAMP FEVER' CASES LINKED TO TRIATHLON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Wis., Ga.)   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and 42 state health departments are investigating an outbreak of
leptospirosis, an infection contracted through exposure to
contaminated soil or water, among participants in a Springfield,
Ill., triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   They have concluded that this was the largest recorded exposure
in this country of the disease, which sometimes goes by the
appropriately murky name of swamp fever.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, three triathletes were hospitalized with
unexplained high fevers in Madison, Wisc., just a few days after a
triathlon there. The cases were alarming enough to city and state
officials that they contacted the centers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators soon learned that only two of the three patients
had participated in the Madison triathlon, but that all three had
taken part in the June 21 Springfield Ironhorse Triathlon, which
included a 1.5-mile swim through Lake Springfield, a 45-mile bike
race and a 10-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend of July 18-19, Illiniois state health officials
and more than 100 CDC volunteers hit the phones, working from the
registration lists for the events, which included names from 44
states and seven countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began doing a lot of calling,'' said Dr. John R. Lumpkin,
Illinois' director of public health. ``Every time we reached one
participant, we asked how we could reach others. We had to reach
some by mail, fax or e-mail, because that's how they registered.''
</P>
<P>
   What they found was a large number of sick triathletes, which
attracted notice, because ``they are normally a young, healthy
group of people who don't like to be ill for any reason,'' said Dr.
Jordan Tappero, a CDC official who coordinated the tracking effort.
``It interrupts their training.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 4, investigators had contacted 1,133 of the 1,432
people known to have participated in either event. The numbers
pinpointed Springfield as the source: of the 870 athletes
contacted, 89, or 10.2 percent, had symptoms that met the case
definition of leptospirosis, primarily high fever, headache, muscle
pain or red eye.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two had felt bad enough to seek medical attention, and
23 had been hospitalized. Of those, two had suffered kidney failure
and one had received an operation under the false impression that
an abdominal disorder was at work. Only one case of the infection,
which is generally not life-threatening and is treatable with
antibiotics, was diagnosed correctly.
</P>
<P>
   If there had not been a triathlon, putting so many bodies in the
same place at the same time, Lumpkin said, the cases ``would have
probably been written off as the flu.''
</P>
<P>
   Leptospirosis is ``ubiquitous in the environment,'' Tappero
said, many strains are harmless and only a scattering of cases are
reported each year. A spirochete that is found in livestock, wild
animals, rodents and some dogs and cats, the bacteria are released
through the animals' urine.
</P>
<P>
   People are exposed by coming into contact with freshly
contaminated mud or water, usually in a small river or stream. The
bacteria enter the body through skin abrasions, the mouth or eyes.
Symptoms appear anywhere from a few days to a month later, and
positive diagnosis requires detection of antibodies in a patient's
blood, which can take several weeks longer to develop.
</P>
<P>
   After state officials publicized the outbreak, more than 100
swimmers and boaters who had been in Lake Springfield after the
triathlon came forward reporting similar symptoms. Although only a
few proved to have leptospirosis, the state shut down most of the
lake's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Though the outbreak seems to be winding down, the ban remains.
``There's a strong basis to believe that a good, hard winter may
decrease the risk of transmission next spring,'' said Lumpkin,
``but we will need to be vigilant.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula Jones showed her new nose last night on 'Primetime.' She
showed off her old nose on 'This Old House.' She's using it to
build an extension on a trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big heat wave in Europe. In Paris, it's 100 degrees. The
French government is advising its citizens to stay inside and try
not to do anything --you know, like they did in World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen this new commercial for a toothpaste for smokers
called Tar-gone? It's supposed to get the tar off the teeth of
smokers. Is that really the biggest concern of people who smoke?
How about coming out with a toothpaste called lung-come-back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Know whose birthday it is? Hulk Hogan's. I don't want to say
Hulk is old, but instead of having a stripper jump out of a cake,
they had a registered nurse come out of a giant bran muffin.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOUCHE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A German tourist walks into a McDonald's in New York City and
orders a beer. The local guy in the line behind him immediately
gives him a verbal jab, `They don't serve beer here, you moron!'
</P>
<P>
   The German fellow felt embarrassed, however he turned to the New
Yorker with a surprised look on his face and begins to chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   `And what's so funny?' the New Yorker demands.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, nothing really, I just realized how stupid you are. You
came here for the food!'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FARM COUNTRY HUMOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A motorist, after being bogged down in a muddy road, paid a
passing farmer five dollars to pull him out with his tractor. After
he was back on dry ground, he said to the farmer, `At those prices,
I should think you would be pulling people out of the mud night and
day.'
</P>
<P>
   `Can't,` replied the farmer. `At night I haul water for the
hole.'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a flight from Hartford, Conn., to Chicago recently, a lovely
lady who has to be everyone's idea of a grandmother settled into
the seat next to me. Obviously not a frequent flier, she looked
about with lively interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a spacious seat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly don't give you a lot of room for your knees, do
they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they don't,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   When our meals arrived, she examined the salad closely, and she
poked the cellophane-wrapped roll with an inquiring finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread,'' I said, anticipating her question.
</P>
<P>
   Then the main course arrived, which bore a faint resemblance to
chicken. She looked at it and tested it with her fork. Then, very
quietly, she mused: ``So this is life in the fast lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Hirshorn, on the verge of her fifth birthday, is ``a real
New Yorker,'' according to her grandmother, Nancy Yanes-Hoffman.
Recently, after finishing her dinner, Rachel jumped up from the
table, eager to read a new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say before you leave the table?'' her mother
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check,'' Rachel replied.
</P>
<P>

   Over the years, there have been changes: uniforms and equipment,
sponsors, haircut styles, cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Many players, coming directly from work, have wolfed down pizza
slices, hamburgers and sub sandwiches, but on a hot dusty day last
month there was another innovation. As his team was at bat, an
infielder took over third-base coaching, keeping a keen eye on the
batter and runners while, with great aplomb and handling his
chopsticks faultlessly, he munched sushi.

walked back toward Ms. Stuart, who rolled down her window and

   VALDEZ, Ala. _ Mighty and majestic, the river of ice snakes down
to Prince William Sound between classically craggy mountains
wreathed in clouds. Through the mist-streaked windows of a light
plane, Columbia Glacier's huge mass and aquamarine-flecked
desolation have an almost visceral impact.
</P>
<P>
   But like much of the rest of Alaska, the glacier is not what it
used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, cruise ships nosed right up to the glacier's
200-foot-high front wall to watch icebergs break off and crash into
the sound. That is impossible today. The front has retreated by
more than eight miles in the last 16 years, and ships are separated
from it by a vast expanse of melting icebergs, penned in by a rocky
shoal that stretches from where the shrinking glacier's front wall
used to be to where it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska is thawing, and much of northern Russia and Canada with
it, and many scientists say that the warming of these cold regions
is one of the most telling signals that the planet's climate is
changing. Experts have long said that in an era of global warming,
this bellwether region should warm more and faster than the Earth
as a whole, and that is just how things are turning out.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists employing laser instruments have confirmed that many
of Alaska's hundreds of glaciers are retreating. The warmer
atmosphere, which holds more moisture, has produced more snow to
feed the glaciers, but longer, warmer summers have in many cases
melted them even faster than the heavier snows can build them up.
At this time of year, countless streams run full and chalky with
tiny rock particles pulverized to dust by the glaciers. The
region's permafrost, ground that is perpetually frozen, is thawing
in Alaska's interior, and pockets of underground ice trapped in the
frost are melting with it. Over thousands of miles, big patches of
forest are drowning and turning gray as the ground sinks under them
and swamp water floods them. Here and there, deep holes have opened
in the earth. Roadside utility poles, destabilized by the melting,
tilt at crazy angles. So do trees, creating a phenomenon known as
drunken forest.
</P>
<P>
   The intermittent character of the land's subsidence _ the
permafrost comes in patches in most of the state, and not every
patch has ice pockets _ wreaks havoc on paved roads. Between here
and Fairbanks, 360 miles away, many stretches of highway are like
ocean swells overlaid with irregular breaks and cracks, and driving
on them safely often requires vigilance. Maintenance crews in the
summer are constantly busy not just repairing roads, but constantly
re-repairing them, at substantial cost.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Fairbanks-to-Valdez stretch, entire mountainsides of
spruce forest, prime timberland that used to be part of the
magnificent taiga, the vast boreal forest of conifers that rings
the world's northern latitudes, are dead and gray. The trees have
been weakened by several climate-related stresses, then killed by
spruce bark beetles whose population, scientists say, has exploded
in the higher temperatures. ``It has moved into high gear in the
last six or seven years,'' said Dr. Glenn Juday, a forest ecologist
at the University of Alaska. ``It's just rolling through the
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   About the magnitude of the warming, there is little doubt. While
the average surface temperature of the globe has risen over the
last century by 1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more, scientists at
the University of Alaska and elsewhere say that it has increased
over the last 30 years by as much as 5 degrees in Alaska, Siberia
and northwestern Canada. The warming has been most pronounced in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are not certain how much of the regional warming
relates to over-all warming of the globe, if any. Some of it, they
say, is clearly the result of a change in prevailing patterns of
atmospheric circulation, beginning in the mid-1970s, which
generally redirected the flow of warm air from the Pacific toward
Alaska. But researchers like Dr. Gunter Weller, of the University
of Alaska in Fairbanks, an expert on climate change, point out that
big areas of northern Russia not affected by the circulation change
have warmed as much as Alaska. Moreover, say other experts, it is
possible that global warming had something to do with the shift in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts believe the regional thaw has resulted from
a combination of natural and human-induced climate change.
Mainstream scientists predict that globally, the average surface
temperature will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next
century, with a best estimate of about 3.5 degrees, if emissions of
heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide are not
reduced. The gases are produced by burning fossil fuels like coal,
oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say that Alaska and other far northern
continental regions should warm about twice as much as the average
for the globe. Two main reasons lie behind this: As ice and snow
melt, less heat is reflected off the land, amplifying the warming.
And at these latitudes, the atmosphere is more stable in winter and
spring. This confines more heat to its lower layers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the combination of causes of Alaska's warming, the
catalog of effects is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the temperature at Fairbanks reached 80
degrees for only about a week in the summer. Now it hits or exceeds
that mark for a total of about three weeks. On average, Juday says,
a summer day is about 11 percent warmer than it was three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Weller moved to Fairbanks 30 years ago, winter temperatures
frequently dipped well below minus-40. In the last two decades, the
number of sub-40-degree days has dropped substantially compared
with the three preceding decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bering Sea, scientists have found, the amount of sea ice
has decreased by about 5 percent over the last 30 years. In Nanana,
inland near Fairbanks, people since 1917 have taken great pains to
record the exact moment when the Tanana River ice breaks up each
spring. A lucrative lottery depends on the result. Four of the
earliest breakups in that 81-year span have been in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the interior, higher temperatures have been accompanied by
more snow in the winter (as is well known, extreme cold means a
drier atmosphere and less precipitation), but also less rain in the
summer. For agriculture (the potential of which is in any case
limited by a scarcity of suitable Alaskan land), the warming has
been a double-edged sword. The good news is that the growing season
is about 20 percent longer; the bad news is that sufficient water
for crops is often lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed dramatically since the '80s,'' said Scott Miller,
who farms a big, flat spread of barley, oats and hay that is about
a two-hour drive south of Fairbanks, within sight of the
snow-capped Alaska Range. There, with a brilliant sun beating down
and the temperature heading toward 80, Miller explained that in the
1980s, it rained practically all summer, and there was a danger of
frost in July. ``Now,'' he said, ``we're way on the other end of
the spectrum; we're usually hurting for water, and there's more
heat.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, according to the 1997 study, longer summers
have allowed the state's vibrant tourist industry to expand. Other
long-range benefits are expected. Shipping in the region should
become easier, and an open-water sea route between Alaska and
Europe could open up. The contraction of sea ice could allow more
offshore oil drilling. Warmer water could help some fisheries.

</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, the warming is perhaps most evident in its
effects on forests, permafrost and glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear summer day a few miles southwest of Fairbanks, from
where the gleaming white pyramid of Mount McKinley rose through
hazein the distance, Juday knelt on the floor of the Bonanza Creek
Experimental Forest, a long-term ecological research reservation. A
vintage old-growth forest of white spruce not far from the Arctic
Circle, it is in the middle of the taiga. Moss-covered logs litter
the ground. The spruces themselves, their short, needled branches
draped with feathery lichens much like Spanish moss, tower
overhead, straight and tall, rising to 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the cream of the crop _ the very best
forests we have in interior Alaska,'' Juday said. As he spoke, he
set up a hand-held global positioning instrument and contacted
overhead satellites to fix the spot's coordinates. The purpose was
to aid airborne scientists who later would survey the forest for
climate-related damage _ in this case, the extent to which the
crowns of the big spruces have been snapped off by heavy snows.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the snows at that latitude are light and fluffy. But
recently they have become heavier, apparently a result of the
changing climate. The weight of two especially heavy snowfalls in
the late 1980s and early 1990s broke off the tops of trees. ``There
was an incredible outbreak of insects following that,'' and they
attacked the trees, Juday said as he pointed out two topless spruce
giants.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, he said, the warming climate, coupled with less
summer precipitation, has stunted trees' growth. The crowns of
aspens, for instance, look especially puny, and that is where the
recent growth would have taken place. Besides promoting a bigger
buildup of tree-eating insects in general, the warming has prompted
some species, like the spruce budworm, to move farther north.
</P>
<P>
   ``These trees are in real trouble,'' Juday said. ``We've got a
sick forest here.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, much of the forest is more than sick; it is dead
or dying. In a broad swath stretching for 300 or 400 miles along
the state's southern tier, from the Kenai Peninsula south of
Anchorage past the spectacular Chugach Mountains north and
northeast of here, chunks of landscape have turned red (freshly
killed) or gray (long dead). Spruce bark beetles are the killers,
and they are ``basically eliminating the forest canopy,'' said
Jerry Boughton, who heads the U.S. Forest Service's regional forest
health program, based in Anchorage. Scientists estimate that a
third to half of Alaska's white spruce have died in the last 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have combined to produce this ecological
holocaust, said Boughton, not least the fact that the forest is
older, and therefore more vulnerable to insect attack. ``But
certainly, the warming has created a better environment for the
bark beetle to expand,'' he said. In fact, mainstream scientists
say, that is how the predicted global warming would often make
itself felt: by exacerbating stresses of many kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts expect the taiga to migrate slowly north, replacing
treeless tundra, if the warming continues or intensifies. In other
regions of the world, other species from farther south would
normally move in behind them. But in Alaska, which is bounded on
the south by ocean, it is unclear what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any trees in the Gulf of Alaska,'' Juday said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vladimir Romanovsky, formerly of Moscow State University but
now of the University of Alaska, has seen lots of permafrost; it is
his area of expertise. But if he wants to see firsthand what can
happen when permafrost melts, he need look no farther than the
field next to his mother-in-law's home outside Fairbanks. There, a
hole, 15 feet long, 6 feet across and 8 feet deep has recently
opened in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The hole, doomed saplings and sod lying in the bottom, is a
thermokarst: a sinking plot of ground caused by thawing permafrost.
Growing numbers of thermokarsts now abound in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has long been known to thaw permafrost if not
undertaken with care, but now something different is happening. A
thicker layer of insulating snow in the winter, combined with
warmer summer weather, is causing undisturbed permafrost to thaw,
creating an uneven and sometimes crater-pocked landscape.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Thawing permafrost has forced the relocation of roads and
runways. Agricultural fields have been damaged and houses have
tilted off kilter. Roads and bridges have been abandoned, as has a
hospital in the town of Kotzebue. Even the site for the
university's building for international arctic research, under
construction in Fairbanks, had to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Along interior roads, drivers can see the telltale sign of
sinking ground: a stand of larch, its branches looking delicate and
spidery, but gray rather than green, standing in the water of a
stretch of muskeg, or subarctic swamp. When a thermokarst develops
the swampy water fills it, and the trees die.
</P>
<P>
   Romanovsky said measurements from boreholes drilled into the
ground show many areas are mere tenths of a degree from the melting
point and will thaw if the warming continues. If the warming runs
its course as predicted, thermokarsting will eventually be
complete, the permafrost line will have moved north by 300 miles or
so (it has already migrated 80 miles in the last century in some
places), and a new stability will have set in, making construction
and maintenance easier than before the thaw. The transition is the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   When the Columbia Glacier was first studied a century ago, it
was advancing so rapidly that blocks of ice would fall on trees in
its path. The advance stopped about 1923 and was followed by a
slight pullback. More recently the glacier was stable, its leading
edge anchored to a broad underwater shoal of rocky debris, called a
moraine, that the glacier had pushed ahead of it as it advanced.
Each summer the glacier would fall back a bit, but would advance in
the winter and re-attach itself to the moraine.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1983, it failed to re-attach, and the retreat was on.
It has been retreating toward the shore at an average rate of about
half a mile a year since. The moraine pens up the 8-mile field of
icebergs that holds ships away from the glacier's front.
</P>
<P>
   What touched off the pell-mell pullback? ``My belief is that it
is climate,'' said Dr. Will Harrison, a geophysicist at the
University of Alaska, who is an expert on glaciers. One theory is
that the warmer environment prevented the glacier from re-attaching
itself to the moraine after the seasonal summer fallback. ``Once
climate kicks it off, you can't stop it,'' Harrison said of the
retreat. ``Once the bullet's fired, that's it.'' Many climate
experts believe that in general, abrupt changes like this, rather
than gradual ones, are likely to typify a warming climate.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has more than 1,000 glaciers, big and small, and together
they make up the fourth-largest collection of ice in the world,
after Antarctica, Greenland and the neighboring Queen Elizabeth
Islands of the high Arctic. And as is true of mountain glaciers
generally, many of Alaska's are retreating, and the retreat has
accelerated in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Recent mapping of a sampling of nine glaciers, said Harrison,
has revealed that all have thinned substantially at lower
elevations, probably because of increased melting in the summer.
But at higher elevations, most of the glaciers have thickened,
probably because of increased winter precipitation. Still, in most
instances, the melting at the base of the glaciers has outstripped
the new ice provided by winter snows, and the trend has been
especially pronounced in the last five years. ``Something's
happened here,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainty of climate predictions, the future is
unclear. ``But each year and each month that the temperature
doesn't drop down,'' said Juday, ``is confirmation that the whole
system has been kicked up'' to a new climatic state.

 &HT;    ANXIETY RISES AS RUBLE FALLS IN RUSSIAN EFFORT TO RESTORE
MARKETS
 &HT;    EDs: Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Struggling to avert financial disaster, Russia cleared
the way for a sharp devaluation of the nation's currency on Monday,
raising fears that soaring inflation and social instability could
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ruble, previously at about 6.3 to the U.S. dollar,
was allowed to drift on currency markets as high as 9.5 to the
dollar -- in effect, a 34-percent devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy was a dramatic shift for the government, which
determined it could no longer afford to spend billions of dollars
of its hard-currency reserves to prop up the ruble, as it has in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The move also was intended to restore confidence in Russia's
hemorrhaging financial markets. Russia's stock market, ranked as
the world's worst-performing this year, has lost about 75 percent
of its value since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts feared the medicine could be more painful than
the current ills.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's long-suffering consumers prepared for a decline in
their buying power, particularly for imported items. Many of the
goods on Russian store shelves, including groceries, clothing and
household products, come from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real income will diminish for all of us. It is a de facto
cut in salary for Russians while the prices of imported goods go
up,'' said Sergei Kolmakov, an analyst for the Policy Foundation, a
Moscow think thank. ``Certainly, Yeltsin will feel the political
fallout from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians rushed to convert their rubles to dollars after
the announcement Monday morning. But there was little sense of
panic in the streets even as signs posting the dollar-ruble
exchange rate changed by the minute, rising as high as 9.5 rubles
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The government also imposed a 90-day moratorium on the payments
it owes of ruble-denominated foreign debt, but insisted it was not
defaulting on its loans. Russia is seeking to re-schedule its debt
payments of more than $1 billion a week.
</P>
<P>
   The actions Monday raised more questions than they answered.
Most analysts feared more instability in the markets and the
possibility of social unrest if Russian consumers suffer massive
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market ended the day down about 4.5 percent on light
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Gibbs, chief strategist at Nomura International in London,
said investors were in ``a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the ruble also was expected to lead to the
collapse of many of Russia's 1,500 commercial banks, some already
near bankruptcy before Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to devalue the ruble came despite firm assurances
Friday by President Boris Yeltsin and other high-ranking government
officials that no devaluation would occur. A Central Bank
spokeswoman had told reporters Friday that devaluation ``would
bring this country problems, and mostly for our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The government decided -- with apparent nudging over the weekend
from officials of the International Monetary Fund, which last month
assembled a $22.6 billion bailout package for Russia -- that it
must devalue the ruble to improve Russia's bottom line in its
effort to prevent bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tougher and more effective measures were necessary. That is
exactly what we are doing,'' said Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF package had been intended to buy time for Russia to
improve its finances and lure investors back. But the market
free-fall was so acute by late last week that trading had virtually
ceased.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House urged Russia's government to
quickly stabilize the ruble and reassure international investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government has had to make some painful
decisions,'' White House spokesman Michael McCurry said. ``Building
market confidence at this point is fundamental. Strong effective
actions offered by the Russians are the key to restoring
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, the problems are not the fault of Russia. The Asian
financial crisis has driven foreign investors out of emerging
markets in Russia and elsewhere. The declining world price of oil,
Russia's biggest export earner, coupled with the country's own
difficulties in collecting taxes, has left the government strapped
for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government, as much as it tried, could not deal with the
situation and it became a victim of circumstances. Of course it
will be a hard hit for most citizens of Russia,'' Sergei Baburin,
deputy chairman of the Duma, the lower house of parliament, said of
the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition-led Duma, dominated by Communists, announced it
would interrupt its summer recess to meet in emergency session on
Friday. The government wants the Duma to approve measures to raise
more tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is total bankruptcy,'' said Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov. ``We think that it (devaluation) is first of all a blow
for the poorest. Prices will jump high, most banks except the
biggest will collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung in previous years by erratic fluctuations in their
currency, most Russians hold their savings in dollars and exchange
them into rubles only as they need to purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, Alexei Vachensov, reluctantly gave up a $100 bill at a
Moscow exchange bank Monday afternoon. ``I need rubles to buy
things, otherwise I wouldn't be trading,'' he said. ``Who knows
what to expect next from our foolish government.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, many banks and currency-exchange points were
refusing to sell dollars or had closed for business altogether.
Some retailers -- especially those selling big-ticket items like
automobiles and home appliances -- shut their doors to re-tag their
goods with higher ruble prices, reflecting the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   At Jumbo, an upscale supermarket, prices for imported fish went
up 10 percent as suppliers Monday raised the wholesale prices, said
manager Olga Ivanuychkina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take a week or so to see how things shake out before we
determine whether prices must go up on all items,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cautious mood affected foreigners in Russia, too. Following
the morning announcement, American Express in Moscow suspended its
banking services and refused to release wire transfers of dollars
to expatriates.

markets in Russia and elsewhere. The declining world price of oil,
Russia's biggest export earner, coupled with the country's own
difficulties in collecting taxes, has left the government strapped
for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government, as much as it tried, could not deal with the
situation and it became a victim of circumstances. Of course it
will be a hard hit for most citizens of Russia,'' Sergei Baburin,
deputy chairman of the Duma, the lower house of parliament, said of
the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition-led Duma, dominated by Communists, announced it
would interrupt its summer recess to meet in emergency session on
Friday. The government wants the Duma to approve measures to raise
more tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is total bankruptcy,'' said Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov. ``We think that it (devaluation) is first of all a blow
for the poorest. Prices will jump high, most banks except the
biggest will collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung in previous years by erratic fluctuations in their
currency, most Russians hold their savings in dollars and exchange
them into rubles only as they need to purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, Alexei Vachensov, reluctantly gave up a $100 bill at a
Moscow exchange bank Monday afternoon. ``I need rubles to buy
things, otherwise I wouldn't be trading,'' he said. ``Who knows
what to expect next from our foolish government.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day, many banks and currency-exchange points were
refusing to sell dollars or had closed for business altogether.
Some retailers -- especially those selling big-ticket items like
automobiles and home appliances -- shut their doors to re-tag their
goods with higher ruble prices, reflecting the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   At Jumbo, an upscale supermarket, prices for imported fish went
up 10 percent as suppliers Monday raised the wholesale prices, said
manager Olga Ivanuychkina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take a week or so to see how things shake out before we
determine whether prices must go up on all items,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cautious mood affected foreigners in Russia, too. Following
the morning announcement, American Express in Moscow suspended its
banking services and refused to release wire transfers of dollars
to expatriates.

   Temperatures will soar past 90 degrees Tuesday afternoon along
the Northeast Seaboard as winds from the west strengthening ahead
of a cool front warm by compression on descent from the
Appalachians. Westerly winds will average 12 to 25 mph in the
afternoon, slightly easing the effects of heat and humidity. Widely
separated clusters of thunderstorms will develop later Tuesday
afternoon and evening as the cool front and a trailing jet stream
disturbance rapidly lift moist air. A few of the storms could
produce strong wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will roam the northern Plains Tuesday
as a tandem of Pacific disturbances interact with invading humid
winds from the south. The first disturbance will arrive in the
predawn hours over North Dakota and northwest Minnesota, spawning a
system of showers and storms, some of which will be heavy. The
second disturbance will arrive later Tuesday afternoon or evening,
setting the stage for an eruption of burly thunderstorms in the
Dakotas. A few of these storms will become severe, producing
damaging winds and hail. Though the probability of tornadoes is
low, it is not zero percent. Thus, a few twisters are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will build in the southern Plains under the warm auspices
of a high pressure system centered several thousand feet aloft over
southeast Kansas. Meanwhile, thunderstorms, fueled by tropical
moisture and the uneven heating of mountains and valleys, will boil
up over the Southwest. Gusty storms moving over deserts in Arizona
could cause localized sand storms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Black Blizzards
</P>
<P>
   The season of black blizzards is underway in the Arizona
deserts. Strong daytime heating leads to invisible updrafts,
precursors of desert storms. Each year by mid-summer, the
atmosphere at 15,000 feet above the ground has been moistened by
winds from the gulfs of Mexico and California, while air near the
ground can be quite dry. The moisture is fuel for thunderstorms.
Often, rain falling from the incipient thunderstorms evaporates in
the dry air near the earth's surface. Then, blasts of wind, cooled
by evaporation, raise palls of dust, which are black blizzards that
roam the desert floor. &QL;

SUMMER GIFTS OF GAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)  
 (Eds: Items in boldface should be set in italics. Double
parentheses should be set as brackets.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm fixin' to go on vacation and want you to have a book bag of
word books.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fixin' to &LR;  is a Southernism covered in ``Jesse's Word of the
Day From Abacinate to Yonic,'' lively scholarship by Jesse
Sheidlower (Random House paperback, $12.95). As we all know,
 &UR; abacinate &LR;  means ``to blind cruelly,'' and  &UR; yonic &LR;  is the female
equivalent of  &UR; phallic &LR;  (a doughnut, Sheidlower notes, is a  &UR; yonic &LR; 
symbol), but the primary meaning of  &UR; fix &LR;  is ``to repair''; where
did the sense of ``to prepare to'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   That sense dates to the early 18th century and is an extension
of the sense of ``put in order; establish, settle definitely,'' and
I presume it is the basis of the political  &UR; fix &LR; . The extension of
that meaning to ``get ready'' has been expressed since the 1930s in
the Gulf and South Atlantic states as  &UR; fixin' to &LR; . It is always
followed by an infinitive, is only used with actions in the near
future and, as Sheidlower points out, ``remains one of the
best-known indicators of Southern speech, along with such words as
 &UR; reckon &LR;  and  &UR; y'all &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The book is drawn from his Internet page
(www.randomhouse.com/jesse), which answers surfers' queries and is
a demonstration of the Web as a progenitor of books. (With the
onset of electronic books, we will need a retronym for
old-fashioned books with paper pages and a nice heft.) He raises an
interesting etymological question with his entry on  &UR; the skin of my
teeth &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   That's from Chapter 19, Verse 20 of the Book of Job, as the
bedeviled innocent man wails, ``My bone cleaveth to my skin and to
my flesh, and I am escaped with  &UR; the skin of my teeth &LR; .'' That's
the King James translation of 1611, taken from the Geneva Bible
translation of 1560, ``I have escaped with  &UR; the skin of my
teeth &LR; .'' Sheidlower notes that ``the point is that Job is so sick
that there's nothing left to his body.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true; I once wrote a book about Job, and discovered that
recent translators find both  &UR; skin &LR;  and  &UR; teeth &LR;  but no  &UR; skin of my
teeth &LR;  in the original Hebrew, written three to six centuries
before the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin H. Pope's translation in the 1965 Anchor Bible renders
that verse as ``My flesh rots on my bones, my teeth drop from my
gums,'' and the translator notes that ``The KJ's `I am escaped with
 &UR; the skin of my teeth &LR; ' has become proverbial for a narrow escape,
but the context offers no support for this idea.'' It's a mistake
in translation that has become a familiar part of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Professor and the Madman,'' by Simon Winchester
(HarperCollins $20), is the linguistic detective story of the
decade. Dr. William Chester Minor, an American who studied medicine
at Yale, served in the Union Army as assistant surgeon during the
Civil War and contributed more than 10,000 citations to the Oxford
English Dictionary. When the lexicographer James Murray and a
committee wanted to honor this stalwart reader for his work, it
turned out he was a murderer incarcerated in the Broadmoor Asylum
for the Criminally Insane outside London.
</P>
<P>
   Delusional but scholarly, the man in the asylum had stumbled
across Murray's appeal for volunteers to help survey all that had
been written in English. He wrote in, giving the accurate hospital
address. ``I thought he was either a practicing medical man of
literary tastes with a great deal of leisure,'' Murray said years
later, ``or perhaps a retired medical man or surgeon who had no
other work.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchester does a superb job of historical research that should
entice readers even more interested in deeds than words. Language
mavens owe a lot to a madman.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yawk Tawk,'' by Robert Hendrickson (Facts on File,
$14.95), will not be out until October, and will have entries like
 &UR; gizza &LR; , which is a slurred pronunciation of ``give us a,'' as in a
tender moment in Richard Condon's ``Prizzi's Money'': `` &UR; Gizza &LR; 
kiss, Al.'' But this gives me a chance to recommend a range of
recent Hendrickson dialect works that also cost $14.95 in paper,
from ``Yankee Talk'' to ``Whistlin' Dixie'' to last year's Ozarkian
``Mountain Range.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Happy Trails,'' a 1994 dictionary of Western expressions,
he provides the original, full name of Los Angeles:  &UR; El Pueblo de
Nuestra Senora la Reina de los Angeles de Porcinuncula &LR; : the town
of our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porcinuncula. (Digging deeper:
 &UR; Porcinuncula &LR;  is the Spanish spelling of the Italian
 &UR; Porziuncola &LR; , which means ``little portion.'' It is a church in
Assisi often visited by St. Francis.)
</P>
<P>
   His entry for  &UR; goodnighting &LR; , a word not found in most
dictionaries of eponyms, deserves to be reproduced in full:
``Students of the old West may be aware that bulls on long cattle
drives often suffered from chafing of the testicles, which
frequently swelled so large that the animal sickened and died. The
remedy was to cut off the testicle bag, push the testicles up into
the body and sew the cut _ a process that enabled the bulls to
travel well and did not impair breeding. The remedy was called
 &UR; goodnighting &LR; , after the cattleman Charles Goodnight, who invented
it, and is surely among the most unusual of words named after
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever meet a cranky yachtsman? I was thumbing through The
Illustrated Dictionary of Boating Terms (Norton, $23.95) and came
across  &UR; cranky &LR; . The preceding word,  &UR; crank &LR; , is defined as ``to
turn. To  &UR; crank &LR;  a winch is to turn the winch handle.''  &UR; Cranky &LR;  is
then defined as ``difficult to steer, unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that the origin of what some call me (along with
 &UR; curmudgeonly &LR; ,  &UR; cantankerous &LR;  and other endearments)?
</P>
<P>
   No. J.E. Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang
(three volumes now out, $50 a crack) has it: Gertrude Lefferts
Vanderbilt wrote in her 1880 social history of the Flatbush section
of Brooklyn, N.Y.: ``A child who was querulous was said to be
`krankie,' from ((Dutch))  &UR; krank &LR; , weak, sick.'' The Smith and Dale
vaudeville skit was titled ``Dr. Kronkheit and His Only Living
Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's a new edition of Wilson Follett's ``Modern
American Usage'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, $25 _ nice round number, none of
that $24.95 baloney), revised by Erik Wensberg.
</P>
<P>
   Despite solid guidance from the great usagist Jacques Barzun,
this guide never matched the popularity of Fowler's ``Modern
English Usage.'' It's tough going up against that bible, but I like
MAU's scholarly sassiness in its entry on  &UR; grammatical error &LR; : ``A
few stuffed shirts will always contend that this expression is a
contradiction in terms and itself in error. ... To condemn phrases
that are perfectly clear and have long been accepted is pedantry.''

AND THERE WAS WHOOPING ... AND THERE WAS MOSHING ... THE THIRD
DAY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ Everything changed but the site, the hillside
where the Woodstock Festival was held in 1969, for the third ``Day
in the Garden'' festival show here Sunday. The careful, relatively
decorous, professional music of the first two days was replaced by
rowdy, noisy, hormonally charged (though equally professional)
rock. Onstage and off, people started to jump around. The
headliners were current hit makers in their 20s and 30s, not
performers who had been established for decades, and the audience
had fewer parents and many more teen-agers, including a large
contingent of squealing girls for the final band, Third Eye Blind.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was larger than it was on the festival's first two
days; 28,000 tickets were sold, some for as little as $10 each. The
music was louder, male band members took off their shirts, and a
mosh pit roiled for seven hours, not even stopping when Joan
Osborne sang a ballad like ``One of Us.'' And where Joni Mitchell,
Pete Townshend, Stevie Nicks, Richie Havens and Melanie had paid
tribute to the site's history on Friday and Saturday, the bands on
Sunday were decidedly less reverent. ``I have no desire whatsoever
to live in the past,'' Stephan Jenkins of Third Eye Blind declared.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be offered a choice. In the 1990s, very few rock
bands have generated the kind of loyalty that bands from the '60s
and '70s came to expect. Radio stations, MTV and recording
companies now market hit songs, not the musicians who make them,
training listeners for short attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock Festival in 1969 was encouraged by the newly open,
semi-underground tastes of FM rock stations that disdained the
commerciality of the Top 40. Now, commerciality has triumphed. Many
of the fans here Sunday had decorated themselves with the call
letters of a local radio station running a promotion, voluntarily
turning themselves into billboards. In six months, that station
probably won't be playing half the headliners.
</P>
<P>
   The day's lineup was a modern-rock sampler, largely devoted to
blaring guitars and varieties of responses to adolescent
frustrations. ``You're burning up inside and no one cares,'' the
Goo Goo Dolls sang in one of their punk-charged power-pop songs.
Third Eye Blind and Dishwalla chose melodramatic earnestness and
big crescendos; Marcy Playground played catchy, sardonic pop-rock
that sometimes erupted into power chords, and the Flys latched on
to the guitar-driven funk of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
</P>
<P>
   While Third Eye Blind is a San Francisco band, its musical
models are British. Its music marches and builds like U2 songs,
parades its guitar riffs like David Bowie's glam-rock and
occasionally revs up to Clash-style punk-rock. Jenkins bawls his
lyrics in a mysteriously acquired English accent, as fervently
off-pitch as the typical English rock belter. Third Eye Blind's
songs are the testimony of a sad-sack Romeo promising that his
misery will make him a sympathetic partner or contemplating how
much he's going to suffer after a breakup. ``Jumper'' urges a
suicidal friend to come back off the ledge, proclaiming, ``If you
do not want to see me again, I would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeroing in on an adolescent market, one song yells, ``Can I
graduate?'' The band's big hit, ``Semi-Charmed Life,'' gloats and
gripes at the same time, recounting sprees of sex and drug use as
the chorus complains, ``I want something else.'' Once the band had
played that hit, a good part of the audience started to head for
the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Osborne was rambunctious in her own more rooted way. Her
band leaned hard on blues and funk grooves for songs, many from a
forthcoming album, about the untrammeled power of desire, while Ms.
Osborne pushed her voice hard. She had a sweet understatement in
``One of Us,'' but the blues has taught her how roughness can cut
to the heart. She used harrowing, penetrating nasal tones and a
rasp that approached Janis Joplin's double-stops; she made notes
break and ululate. She also tried some of the slides and percussive
attacks of Pakistani qawwali music. The songs were about abandon
and exaltation, and Ms. Osborne made them vivid without ever losing
control.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Playground is a bare-bones trio: acoustic guitar, bass and
drums, though the guitar had electric-guitar capabilities. John
Wozniak, its songwriter, has a knack for offhanded pop melody,
touching on anything from lightly strummed folk-rock to big grunge
buildups; his sly lyrics don't take themselves too seriously. In
three days at the Woodstock site, only Wozniak confessed onstage to
writing a song while tripping. Dishwalla's set was a modern-rock
anthology. One song used the ominous crunch and haggard vocals of
Nine Inch Nails, another cranked up the Beatles chords and spacious
guitars like Oasis; another marched like U2. The band has a good
sense of melody while it hedges its bets about style.
</P>
<P>
   The Goo Goo Dolls pulled off a difficult combination: sincerity
without pomposity. With raw-throated fervor, they sang about
growing up too fast and searching for romance and meaning, but
their chosen style doesn't allow them to wallow much. Their music
is an update of the 1980s Minneapolis rock of the Replacements and
Soul Asylum, using punk's fast strumming to rev up the tunefulness
of the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   A self-conscious generational anthem goes down a lot easier with
a big beat and a surging melody. And Johnny Rzeznik, the band's
main lead singer, wasn't about to let the site make him
sanctimonious. ``Promise us that in 30 years you're not going to
get stupidly nostalgic and come back here in your BMW's,'' he said.
``All we've got is now.''

   The saddest moment in ``Any Day Now'' comes right after little
Renee Jackson and Mary Elizabeth O'Brien pay their bus fares. Mary
Elizabeth, who is white, plops down in the nearest available seat.
Renee, who is black, walks back out of the bus' front door, goes to
the back door and boards. In Birmingham, Ala., in 1962, apparently,
sitting in the back of the bus isn't enough. Black people can't
even walk past the white passengers in the good seats.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to trust that depiction, though, since so much of
``Any Day Now,'' a new Lifetime drama series that has its premiere
Tuesday night at 9, strains credibility, embraces stereotype and
generally falls short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The series, set in Birmingham in the present, opens by showing
the two girls all grown up. Renee (Lorraine Toussaint) is a
high-powered Washington lawyer who lives on her cell phone and has
lunch dates with senators. Mary Elizabeth (Annie Potts) is still in
Birmingham, smoking cigarettes, handing out Happy Meals to her
troubled children rather than cooking, and getting fed up with her
unemployed, beer-drinking husband. The two women haven't spoken to
each other for 24 years, but when Renee's father dies suddenly and
she decides to move home to take over his law practice, the former
childhood pals are reunited.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the beginning of an interesting portrait of a
friendship that survived tumultuous times, but the two personable
stars have a lot of earnest, obvious dialogue to deal with. Mary
Elizabeth's reaction at first sight of Renee: ``You look beautiful,
like something out of a magazine.'' Renee to Mary Elizabeth: ``I
travel a lot, mostly in Europe and Asia.'' Mary Elizabeth to Renee,
later, when threatened: ``You might be some big-shot lawyer but
you're alone. You've got no husband, no kids.'' And in one of the
show's many flashbacks, Renee and her father (who is, of course, a
lawyer working with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) have this
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Dad: ``And fear and ignorance breed _ what?''
</P>
<P>
   Renee: ``Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad: ``That's my girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, when Mary Elizabeth and Renee have a serious argument
at age 19, they end up trading racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, I was growing up about 30 miles from Birmingham, and I
have trouble believing that this friendship between school-age
girls of different races could have existed in that time and place.
If the series grows stronger, maybe we'll gladly suspend disbelief.
But the first episode doesn't look promising, with its use of
unlikely coincidences like Renee's return visit to a lingerie shop
where she and her mother (who looked and dressed like a black
Jacqueline Kennedy) were once treated badly. She finds the same
saleswoman still working there and seems genuinely surprised that
the woman doesn't remember her.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Birmingham and throughout the South in the
early 60's could be the inspiration for thought-provoking,
multilayered drama. The subject deserves much better than this.

   It's easy to sympathize with Maggie Day, wife, mother and
would-be veterinarian. Maggie (Ann Cusack) is ignored by her
husband, who is too busy being thrilled with having been declared a
``leading'' cardiologist in a news magazine. For Maggie's 40th
birthday, her teen-age daughter gives her a book called ``You're
Over the Hill When . . . '' No wonder Maggie regularly fantasizes
about being ravished in her kitchen by a hunky actor from ``Melrose
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder she's drawn to Richard (John Slattery), her boss
at the animal clinic. He's handsome, he takes her seriously, and
he's funny. When a man brings in his pet rabbit who has been bitten
by a pet duck, Richard explains that this is clearly a case of
Warner syndrome, the belief that ducks and rabbits hang out
together.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the teen-age daughter's best male friend, an aspiring
artist, has decided to become gay because so many great artists
have been. This puzzles Maggie. ``Are you attracted to men?'' she
asks. The young man answers hopefully, ``Not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie'' has a lot going for it: an appealing heroine played
by the fabulous Ms. Cusack, a great supporting cast and jokes that
are actually funny. What a concept!

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: Our company hired a young man who
brought in a great deal of business. However, he often arrives
late, leaves early, goes out every hour to smoke for 15 minutes,
and comes back late from lunch, usually inebriated and obnoxious to
all of us. I reported this to management, who completely
disregarded what I had to say. The company will do nothing about
him because of the business he brings in. What can I do? P.C. &QL; 
Answer: If you truly enjoy working at this company, one strategy is
to try to keep your contact with this individual to a minimum,
which might not be so difficult in light of the fact that he is
hardly around.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is that management of your company feels that
the best way to handle this situation is to overlook it and ignore
you. You alerted them to a situation in which an employee is
destroying himself, creating substantial liability, and conceivably
undercutting cooperation and productivity. And yet, the top-siders
figure that this is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Based on managerial inaction in this situation, it appears that
you are in a company that is reactive rather than proactive,
minimally concerned with employee health and safety, oblivious to
the notion of teamwork, uninterested and unresponsive in dealing
with the employees' concerns and fixated on short-term thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the time has come for you to think about spending more
time away from this company, permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a doctoral student in organizational psychology, and I
have just begun a fellowship program with a municipal organization.
I work on a team of specialists in engineering, financial
management, and related areas. Since I am a part-time employee and
full-time student, I am restricted from leading higher-profile
projects, even if I have expertise in them. How can I communicate
my abilities without coming across as intimidating and/or
theoretical? P.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since you are new in the organization, part-time, and more in
the role of student than teacher, it might be a little early to be
thinking about leading those high-profile projects. This is an
important objective, and clearly one that you should pursue.
However, it may make more sense to use the early months of
employment to study the organization, build your network, and
establish your credibility through solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   When there are opportunities to discuss new and creative ways to
approach various projects or problems, you should be ready to
present some ideas based on your expertise. In such situations, try
to emulate the style of your professional peers. For example, if
they are fast-paced, brief and concise, you should be too. In a
word, let them see that you are knowledgeable and have a great deal
in common with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this approach can increase the likelihood of your
associates and departmental management looking to you for some
leadership. There's nothing intimidating or theoretical about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently left a job where I worked for nearly two years. I
made a terrible mistake when I was there. My boss was willing to
let me stay on, but the pressure was too great, so I left. I can't
put this job on my resume because I fear a future employer will
find out what happened and not hire me. And, by not having it on my
resume, it will look like I haven't worked in two years. Do you
have any suggestions? M.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: No matter how terrible your mistake may have been, you will
be making an even greater mistake if you leave that job off your
resume. You can assume that any potential employer will take
references on you, and when the missing job is found, the job
opportunity will be lost. And, if you are miraculously hired
without having that job on your resume, you will most likely be
terminated if your employer learns about it.
</P>
<P>
   It makes far more sense for you to have it on your resume, and
when you are asked why you left that job, you can present your side
of the story and take away any element of surprise when a reference
is taken on you. Let the potential employer see how much you have
learned and grown from this experience, and how it will actually
make you a better employee.
</P>
<P>
   Every working person has made mistakes and experienced failure.
In fact, some companies feel particularly positive about applicants
who openly discuss a failure, a mistake or a termination.
Willingness to be open about such matters can be viewed as signs of
confidence, self-assurance, honesty, and self-insight. Why deny
yourself the opportunity to demonstrate these characteristics
during the hiring process?

TOTING CHAMBER MUSIC TO SOME UNEXPECTED CHAMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., Ga.)   (af)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   ISLESFORD, Maine _ As the headlands and mountains of Mount
Desert Island merged behind them in a distant summer haze, 16 young
musicians from the Kneisel Hall Chamber Music School and Festival
disembarked here from a ferry boat ride across the harbor for the
group's second annual invasion of the island.
</P>
<P>
   After they had hauled cumbersome violin, viola and cello cases
along a dock stacked high with colorful lobster pots, a station
wagon drove up to take the four cellos to the Neighborhood House,
the island's community center and library.
</P>
<P>
   Kneisel Hall on Tour, as this new program is called, began last
summer as a way of giving performance experience to student artists
seeking to become professional musicians. Equally important, it
provides chamber music concerts to people in outlying Maine
communities who usually do not have access to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Islesford, the program serves towns including
Bangor, Belfast, Deer Isle, Ellsworth and Machias. But the
picturesque setting of this island and the enthusiastic response of
its residents to the student concerts poignantly brought home the
isolation of Maine's rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   This outreach program is the ultimate realization of the goals
of Franz Kneisel, the Austrian violinist who came to this country
in 1885 at age 20 as concertmaster of the Boston Symphony. He also
founded the Kneisel Quartet, the first professional string quartet
in America.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested in 1902 that his devotion to chamber music
might be interfering with his symphony responsibilities, he quit
the symphony. That summer he began to bring gifted music students
to Maine to continue their training at his summer home in the
coastal town of Blue Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students were from the Institute of Musical Art, now
the Juilliard School, where Kneisel was chairman of the department
of strings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1922, his friend Felix Kahn, brother of the financier and
arts patron Otto Kahn, built the lodge-style concert hall on the
wooded slopes of Blue Hill where faculty artists of the school
still give twice-weekly summer concerts. Kneisel Hall on Tour was
conceived as a midseason opportunity for the students to perform.
This year, the program was supported by a grant of $2,500 from the
Presser Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The students arrived in Islesford in time to give a 3 p.m.
children's concert. At the Neighborhood House, a wooden lodge built
in 1913 with an indoor basketball hoop, they were met by Katy
Fernald, their host for the day, whose husband, Dan, is a lobster
fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fernald announced the schedule: the children's concert; a
walk around the 400-acre island (one mile long by two-thirds of a
mile wide); a casserole supper, prepared by residents, back at the
Neighborhood House; and finally, the main concert at 7 p.m. in the
Islesford Congregational Church.
</P>
<P>
   Then she told them about the two committals, the local term for
burials, that had taken place that week on the island. ``We have
had eight deaths since last fall,'' she said, a great loss in a
place with a year-round population of only 80. Summer visitors
swell the island's population to 300 to 500. ``I hope the music
will bring us peacefulness today,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting the arrival of the children who would be their
audience, the young artists disappeared into corners of the hall or
out on the lawn to tune their instruments. The cacophony of these
individual sounds and melodies seemed a metaphor for the
performers' different origins, Peruvian and Taiwanese in addition
to American from 10 states. The students on the trip were part of a
larger group of 50 ranging in age from 15 to 29 and representing
nine countries.
</P>
<P>
   By the time sunburned youngsters, many with parents, filed in to
take their seats or sit on the floor, the first trio was already in
place rehearsing Dohnanyi's Serenade in C Major (Op. 10). Patricia
Hawkins, 21, a violist who teaches elementary school music students
in Oregon, introduced the afternoon's selections, an abbreviated
version of the evening program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We make music better in small ensembles,'' she explained,
``and all of us play stringed instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that everyone march in place to the ``Marcia''
movement of the Dohnanyi. She explained how the violin differed
from the cello, with the viola positioned between the two.
</P>
<P>
   In Schubert's Cello Quintet in C Major (Op. 163, D. 956), Brook
Bennett, 17, a cellist, told the children to listen for the ``angry
parts when we sound like we are fighting each other.'' At that
point, Lane Rylander, age 5, did a few ballet turns in place,
wearing homemade paper deer's ears on a head band, in hope, said
her mother, of becoming an acceptable playmate to the deer that
grazed on their lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Before Beethoven's String Quartet in E flat major (Op. 74), the
children were told to raise their hands whenever they heard music
that sounded like a harp, and a forest of hands went up each time
the strings were plucked in the pizzicato arpeggios of the first
movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Hung-Wei Huang, 19, a violist from Taipei, asked his
fellow musicians to demonstrate the high and low notes of each
instrument and the finger position that results in a vibrato sound.
</P>
<P>
   By then summer breezes wafting through the windows beckoned
everyone outside again, and the young artists packed their
instruments and set out to explore. Their first stop was the post
office/general store for ice cream before the trek along narrow
roads to the Coast Guard beach on the Atlantic side, where, among
rocks and rugosa roses, they wandered and chatted in groups _ a
Winslow Homer come to life.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the beach, Wilson Pedrazas, 27, a violinist from
Peru, talked about the difficulties the players sometimes
experience during practice. ``It is a kind of marriage of from
three to five people, and sometimes even good friends can become
nasty during rehearsals,'' he said. Having already won an
international competition and performed as a soloist with the
Brazilian Symphony Orchestra, he is also preparing for a solo
career.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone returned to the Neighborhood House, the buffet
tables were filled with bowls of steaming chowder, casseroles,
platters of cold salmon, salad, blueberry cake and other local
dishes. The entourage was joined by State Sen. Marge Kilkelly, who
is also director of community services for the Island Institute,
which assists Maine island communities in sustaining their
independent way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now only 14 islands on the Maine coast with
year-round populations compared to 300 at the turn of the
century,'' she said. Islesford, also known as Little Cranberry, is
in the cluster called the Downeast Islands. Suddenly, the young
women artists began to appear in long floral-patterned skirts they
had tucked into their knapsacks for the free evening performance in
Islesford's 1898 half-shingled, half-clapboard Congregational
Church.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people, mostly families with children, attended
the concert, which added Mozart's Viola Quintet in C minor (K. 406)
to the afternoon program. The music sounded full as it resonated
off the wood paneled walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing concert; I didn't expect anything so
serious,'' said Dr. Mark Pentecost, visiting from Georgia. There
was resounding applause, and many bows. The invasion had been a
success.
</P>
<P>
   But this evening, when the young artists returned to the dock
under a sky streaked with red, they were in high spirits. All the
seriousness was gone as they laughed and joked all the way home on
the ferry, and the lights on the island faded into the distance
across the dark waters.

   The American University in Cairo is suing the chief censor of
the Egyptian government for permitting the release of a film that
it says uses the university's name without permission. The suit,
filed on Thursday, seeks to pull the hit comedy ``A Saidi at
American University,'' out of theaters in Egypt and to have its
posters taken down.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Said Hamed, tells the story of a peasant
who gets a scholarship to the university, which is portrayed as a
sanctum of the upper class.
</P>
<P>
   The chief censor of Egypt, Ali Abu Shadi, told the news service
Agence France-Presse that he considered the suit frivolous. ``There
is nothing in this film that hurts AUC,'' he said, referring to the
university. He added that the suit ``only gives the film more
publicity.''

   She may be in a professional slump, but Sandra Bullock is still
on top in Canada. The Montreal World Film Festival has announced
that the actress will receive a career excellence award at the
festival on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bullock, who received lukewarm reviews this summer for
``Hope Floats,'' was chosen because ``she's quite a popular actress
here,'' said Lorraine Jamison, a spokeswoman for the festival.
``She is somebody that the people of Montreal would like to meet,''
Ms. Jamison added. The festival, which will also include a tribute
to the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, runs from Aug. 27 to Sept.
7.

   Going Digital
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced Monday that it
would establish a program to encourage producers to integrate
digital technology into offerings for public television.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which will begin awarding grants this year, is to
focus on two applications of the technology: enhanced television,
which allows large amounts of supplemental information to be
incorporated into the screen, and multicasting, which involves
broadcasting multiple channels on a single signal. Federal laws
mandate that public television networks switch to digital
broadcasting by 2003.

   NEW YORK _ On the set of ``Power Plays,'' the Alan Arkin and
Elaine May comedy at the Promenade Theater in Manhattan, it seems
that the best way to replace one ``Catch-22'' veteran is to simply
find another.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, Richard Benjamin, who played Major Danby in the
1970 film version of Joseph Heller's novel ``Catch-22,'' will step
in for Arkin, who played the war-maddened bombardier Yossarian.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin will be joined in the cast by his wife, Paula Prentiss,
who is replacing Ms. May. The show, which opened in May, will take
a vacation before the changeover, going dark from Sept. 13 to 21.
Jeannie Berlin and Anthony Arkin, Alan Arkin's son, will remain in
the cast.

 &HT;    Mother Jones hopes makeover will appeal to a younger crowd
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even bell bottoms go out of style eventually. After 22 years as
the counterculture voice of political activism, Mother Jones
($3.95) has gotten a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to broaden the magazine's appeal among readers who are
looking for a hip, substantive alternative to the increasingly
celebrity-driven media,'' says publisher Jay Harris. In other
words, the publisher wants younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   The September/October issue is a giant step in the right
direction. Graphics are bolder, colors are brighter, and the
reporting is irreverent. The cover story on Rupert Murdoch is
presented as a tabloid pullout with typical tab headlines: ``World
Domination Plot Exposed! World-Class Tax Dodger!'' Reporter Zev
Borow tracks Murdoch's empire building and concludes that he is
successful because of his political connections and emphasis on TV
sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   BAD TIMING: This week's newsmagazines were caught in the awkward
position of writing about what President Clinton was going to say
to the grand jury before he said it. Time ($2.95) hedged its bets
by examining the damage the scandal will have on the presidency _
and the media. ``I'm filled with disgust with what has become of
this country,'' says journalism scholar Todd Gitlin, ``and I hold
the media crucially responsible.'' As for the presidency, Time
notes that the right man or woman can go a long way toward
restoring the mystique of the office, just as Ronald Reagan did.
</P>
<P>
   In Newsweek ($2.95), Jonathan Alter compares Clinton to a
political Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. One Clinton ``uses the English
language with obvious skill to comfort, as he did once again last
week when the bodies of the American victims of the Africa bombings
came home. The other uses it with obvious slickness to confuse.
...'' Meanwhile, a Newsweek poll taken on the eve of Clinton's
testimony indicated that only 29 percent of the public believes the
president should be impeached.

   LIFE WITH LINDBERGH: In kindergarten, Reeve Lindbergh thought
her father was God. Why else, she reasoned, did she call him Father
when her friends called their fathers Daddy? And why did she have
to eat Pepperidge Farm bread rather than Wonder bread? In a
poignant essay in The New Yorker ($3.95), the daughter of the
famous aviator describes a regimented life with a man who always
had to be in control. He was as meticulous with his family as he
was with his airplanes, she writes, maintaining detailed checklists
for each child. ``He exercised affection and discipline in like
measure, often at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   HOT STAR: With an Oscar in hand for ``Good Will Hunting'' and an
upcoming role in Cormac McCarthy's ``All the Pretty Horses,'' Matt
Damon has not done too badly as a Harvard dropout. His biggest
burden, says Steven Daly in a Details ($2.50) profile, is his image
as a regular guy. Well, a regular guy who's involved with Winona
Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SCENE: Forget about dinner and a movie. Atlanta magazine
($3.50) suggests 41 ideas for great dates, including a sunrise or
sunset balloon ride or a Martinis &AMP; Imax evening at Fernbank Museum
of Natural History. Also of note in this issue: A visit with TV
chef Nathalie Dupree at her new home in Social Circle and a road
trip to the North Carolina resort town of Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   COVER STORIES: You expect nudity in Playboy and Penthouse, but
some magazine covers have stretched the limits of good taste. The
current issue of Vanity Fair features an actress wearing
transparent lingerie, and the Aug. 20 issue of Rolling Stone ($3)
showcases model Laetitia Casta wearing a seductive expression and
nothing else. Inside the magazine (Yes, you have to turn the cover)
is a ``hot list'' of people and trends. Hot actress? Christina
Ricci. Hot TV? On-air funerals of celebrities.

 &HT;    Older women dating younger men is still rare, but is starting to
gain momentum
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry McMillan plans to keep her groove on.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stella, the central character in her novel turned movie
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' McMillan is engaged to a stud
muffin she met in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   No, she isn't worried about how long the relationship will last.
And, yes, she's using her 46 years of wisdom to keep her romance
with a guy in his ``mid-20s'' in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan and Jonathan Plummer, who makes a cameo appearance in
the movie, have been an item for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get three more good years, it's still three more years
of happiness I've had that I wouldn't have had if I hadn't given
myself permission to do it,'' McMillan said from California. ``Our
attitude is: `Yeah, we're going to get married. However long it
lasts, it lasts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Men have been bedding and wedding women half their age since the
beginning of time, and Hollywood has been depicting such romances
for almost as long.
</P>
<P>
   But when women hook up with guys they could have burped and
diapered, in life or on the screen, people whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Some movie critics, for example, find it a little unbelievable
that Stella, a woman who has everything, would fall for a youngster
whose biggest asset is his biceps.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-powered stockbrokers with six-digit salaries don't risk
it all for a mere hunk,'' writes critic Karen Hershenson of the
Contra Costa Times in Walnut Creek, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella's retrieval of her groove is totally dependent on her
surrendering herself to this youthful sexual fantasy, and it's
inconsistent with the smart, grounded ... corporate trader we see
in the first half-hour,'' carps Sara Voorhees of The Albuquerque
(N.M.) Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Hershenson and Voorhees obviously haven't met women like Terry
McMillan _ who are smart and grounded, but also in love with
younger men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think times have changed,'' McMillan said. ``I'm in a
position where I don't need a man to pay my mortgage or car
payment. I'm in a position where I can like anybody I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. But relationships like hers are still the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the Census Bureau, at least 379,000 of
the 57.1 million married or live-in couples nationwide were women
with men at least 10 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   The older-man relationship is still more common, of course. In
1997, more than 2.1 million men were with women at least 10 years
their junior.
</P>
<P>
   Relationship experts say that when older women date younger men,
the woman is the trophy _ not the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can attract a young guy then you're pretty hot,'' said
Lillian Glass, a New York psychologist who wrote ``He Says/She
Says: Closing the Communication Gap Between the Sexes'' (Putnam,
$9.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an older guy and you're with a young woman, it's no
big deal. If you have money, you could look like Frankenstein and
they'll go with you.''
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, young men aren't looking for a sugar mama
when they date older women, Glass said. The chemistry typically
stems from the older woman's uninhibited sexuality, her maturity,
her willingness to mingle with his friends and try new things and
her ability to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generation of the Betty Friedans raised some amazing boys
... who treat women like ladies. They're not going to go with a
Monica Lewinsky type _ a woman who has no skills but is looking to
get ahead on someone else's coattails. They're looking for somebody
with substance and intelligence. Not that spoiled princess type,''
Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Older women, on the other hand, admire younger men for all the
qualities older men often lack, she added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, young guys don't tend to be as rigid about gender
roles as men their fathers' age, because they are more accustomed
to working with women as equals in the workplace, Glass said. They
also are more malleable, not as set in their ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger men have more energy to do sports, to dance, to have
sex with. ... He hasn't been jaded by life,'' said Joan Irvine, a
former matchmaker in Marina del Rey, Calif., who co-wrote a book
titled ``Recipes for Hot Sex'' (Lions' Head, $9.99).
</P>
<P>
   McMillan's muse seems to be all that, and a bag of chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan is teaching me how to swim,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has forced me to slow down and take two hours in the middle
of the day to read a book and not feel guilty about it. He'll say,
`Terry, forget about the laundry. Forget about cooking. Let's go
out to dinner, let's go for a walk.' He braids my hair. He's not
intimidated by me in the least. He's very, very open.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said being with a man so much younger has also given
her a chance to experience a part of life she forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, part of the beauty of it is, I've been given an
opportunity to look at things a second time that I either glossed
over or overlooked or was moving too fast to pay attention to. It's
kinda nice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Stella and her young beau, Winston Shakespeare,
play a joke on a flirtatious bartender who thinks they are mother
and son. McMillan, whose own son, Solomon, is 14, said she and
Plummer get the same kind of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever someone says, `What does your son want?' we just kind
of play it off, and I'll say, `Son, what are you having?' It's a
private joke between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Angela Bassett, who plays Stella, McMillan says she's in
good shape physically and isn't worried that she will age or that
Plummer will find a woman his age more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   But again, she's keeping things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are, he's going to meet a younger woman. That's fine.
I could also meet someone. But right now, we have each other,''
McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie was based on the book, which is as close to
an autobiography as McMillan has ever written, she said there are
few similarities between how she fell in love with Plummer and the
couple in ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McMillan said with a laugh, ``My version was better
than the movie.''

 &HT;    Some famous May-December romances
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among celebrities, older men and younger women are the norm. But
some well-known women have bucked the trend:
</P>
<P>
   -- Susan Sarandon, 51, whose common-law husband, Tim Robbins, is
39.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pam Grier, 49, whose fiance, Kevin Evans, is 36.c
</P>
<P>
   -- Barbra Streisand, 56, who had a fling with Andre Agassi, 28.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ursula Andress, 62, who was romantically involved with Harry
Hamlin, 46.
</P>
<P>
   -- Francesca Annis, 54, whose companion is Ralph Fiennes, 35.
</P>
<P>
   -- Elizabeth Taylor, 66, whose latest ex-husband is Larry
Fortensky, 46.
</P>
<P>
   -- Glenn Close, 51, who once dated Woody Harrelson, 37.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cher, 52, who had a string of younger guys, including Richie
Sambora, 39; Tom Cruise, 36; and Val Kilmer, 38.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fashion designer Mary McFadden, who was 58 when she married
for the seventh time to Vasilis Calitsis, then 31.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mary Tyler Moore, who wed heart surgeon Robert Levine, 16
years her junior, in 1983.

 &HT;    Lifetime unviels its ``Man-Free TV'' lineup
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women have needs, too.
</P>
<P>
   TV needs, that is. Whadja think we were talking about? Sex?
Careers? Even, God forbid, the occasional cigarette?
</P>
<P>
   All that and more is covered in three series debuting tonight on
Lifetime _ but that's hardly what matters about the cable network's
``Original Tuesdays.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Man-Free TV, the way the small screen world undoubtedly
would look if women wore all the programming pants.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that men don't exist in these shows. They just don't
matter as much. The focus is on 40-something females facing
real-life dilemmas that would never pass through that funky purple
front door on ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, some of it is unreal (C'mon, a recurring Jack Wagner
fantasy?). And some is just plain dumb (Jack's black velour top).
But any minute now on ESPN (owned, like Lifetime, by Disney), the
``World's Strongest Man'' contest is starting, so it's all pretty
much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about damn time.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Any Day Now'' 9 p.m. EDT Call it ``I'll Fly Back.'' And not
just because this hour drama puts a human face (albeit through
flashbacks) on the civil rights era.
</P>
<P>
   Single, successful D.C. attorney Rene (Lorraine Toussaint) goes
home to 1998 Birmingham after her father's death. There, she sees
her childhood best friend, Mary Elizabeth (Annie Potts), now a wife
and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Rene decides to stay, but first, the duo picks at 25 years worth
of emotional scabs that underscore two things about being female:
No one can betray you worse or support you better than your best
friend.
</P>
<P>
   That Rene is black and her pal ``M.E.'' white both enriches and
complicates this saga. A scene in which young Rene boards a bus
twice _ once to pay and once to sit in the rear _ is silent and
heartbreaking. But too many flashbacks could detract from the main
story.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that is. From romantic breakups to unemployed husbands,
there's too much going on. Thanks to Toussaint and Potts, it never
deteriorates into melodrama, but any day now, producers might want
to focus more.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Maggie'' 10 p.m. EDT Here's what we learn: Cartoons, this
show tells you, are funny; ``Maggie,'' you find out on your own,
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Maggie (Ann Cusack) has too many problems,
including turning 40, going to vet school, being ignored by her
husband and lusting for a co-worker at the animal clinic. Whew! All
that's missing is a crazed stalker. (Although if ``Melrose
Place's'' Wagner shows up in Maggie's fantasies many more times
...)
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea. Dump the husband (John Getz), a cardiologist so
lifeless he must've been cast from his hospital's morgue. Set
things in the clinic, where the situations _ a fish having
nightmares _ and people are funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you're thinking: I'm too good for him,''
receptionist Amy (Melissa Samuels) says of a date who tastes all 12
of his cats' food. ``But I had a long talk with my mother, and it
turns out I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Amy can't do any better. But ``Maggie'' could.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Oh Baby'' 10:30 p.m. EDT Oh boy. Do we really think women
are waking up and saying, ``Omigod, I forgot to have a baby!''?
</P>
<P>
   Tracy (Cynthia Stevenson) does. Talking to the camera, like it's
secret-sharing time at the school locker, she tells us why she's
been artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the usual stuff: Not getting an engagement ring from
the boyfriend she's consistently lied to about wanting to stay
single. Baby clothes that are s-o-o cute. Something about office
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, meanwhile, about love, wanting to produce the next
Albert Schweitzer or carrying on the family genes. So why is this
show still so annoyingly appealing?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it's Stevenson, who's funny (she says of dating for 22
years: ``No one should have to be polite for that long''). And
sweet when talking about what could be her ``only chance to make
(my) own family.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll give her the first trimester.
</P>

 &HT;    Crowes compilation isn't in demand
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Black Crowes, Atlanta-born rockers looking to jump-start
their careers, are hoping the release of the five-disc box set
``Sho' Nuff'' will trigger interest in ``By Your Side,'' the

</P>
<P>
   Neither HMV Music, asking $47.99 for the set, nor Best Buy,
where the price is $35.99, reports much demand for the set in the
Atlanta area. It contains remastered versions of the Crowes' four
albums with a couple of bonus tracks on each, some videos and an EP
with five unreleased tunes recorded during a 1995 show at the
Beacon Theatre in New York City.

PRESERVING A CITY'S SOUL WHILE RESTORING ITS ANCIENT HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEZ, Morocco _ The peak of development for the old walled
center, or medina, of this city came during the 14th and 15th
centuries, and the place looks as if it has hardly changed since
then. There are almost no cars. Mules still lug goods through the
narrow, labyrinthine streets. Metalworkers bang on pieces of copper
in storefront shops barely bigger than steamer trunks. This is a
city outside time.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a religious center for more than 1,000 years,
anchored by the Karouinye mosque and university. For first-time
visitors, one of the unforgettable experiences is to be awakened
around 4 a.m. by thousands of people at morning prayers. The sound
fills the medina.
</P>
<P>
   Fez is an ancient place, in other words, but also a functioning
city, and one in need of repair. Several years ago Unesco named it
a Heritage of Mankind City, like the Old City of Jerusalem. But a
major difference between the medina of Fez and almost all other
ancient city centers in this part of the world is that it remains
the hub of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Medinas elsewhere have degenerated into slums or been superseded
by civic development beyond the medina's walls. The Old City of
Jerusalem, for example, is no longer the locus of that's city
economy or civic life. Rome, which is a very different kind of
ancient city in a different part of the world, remains a capital,
but at the cost of a certain modernization, as everyone who has
dodged the traffic there knows.
</P>
<P>
   People from throughout this part of Morocco, on the other hand,
still shop in Fez's medina. Weavers work in it as they have for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is how to fix up the medina without
fundamentally changing it, how to preserve it as a religious and
economic center. And you don't have to read Jane Jacobs to know
that countless downtown areas, from Detroit to Moscow, have been
turned into ghettos or theme parks or been blighted by shoddy
development because of decades of misguided urban plans.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable news about Fez is that it seems to have learned
from such mistakes without really having made any yet. Or at least
there is an organization here that has begun to do things the right
way. The Agency for the De-densification and Rehabilitation of the
Medina is now working to preserve not only the great art and
architecture of the place but also its most precious commodity, its
historic soul.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is still in its infancy, a small organization without
much money but with some big ideas. The implicit question that the
agency has raised seems to be no less than, what is civic culture?
Is it an object like a building or a sculpture? Or can it be the
life of a community, of which great architecture and art are parts?
Westerners tend to see culture in terms of things. ADER-Fez (the
agency is known by an acronym in French) is making a case for the
other view.
</P>
<P>
   It regards the medina as a neighborhood whose living links to
the past are the city's truest legacy. A historical artifact like a
city, it recognizes, has an economic value that goes beyond
tourism. Consequently the agency is hoping to accomplish several
things at once: to repair the major monuments, a project that
benefits tourists, but at the same time to improve the
infrastructure for residents, cleaning up a polluted water system,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   The agency wants to obtain loans for homeowners to fix up their
houses and to ease the severe housing crunch in the medina by
giving incentives for some people to leave, thereby making it more
appealing to the people who stay. Also, ADER-Fez is trying to
rejuvenate industries that have been part of the life of the medina
for a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the agency has backed a school to train craftsmen
in ancient Islamic building techniques, which include the sort of
intricate stucco filigree that is one of Islam's great
contributions to art. Some of the techniques were nearly forgotten
here. Now they are being revived. The idea is that monuments in the
medina can be restored in keeping with the original designs, but
creatively: craftspeople have added their own new decorations to
buildings where old decorations like painted tiles or carved stucco
have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   One case is the Bou Inaniya, a lovely 14th-century medersa, or
religious school, which was a picturesque but complete ruin until
recently. With a private grant from King Hassan II to the agency,
its stucco designs have been recreated and augmented and the place
generally adapted to make a dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   As great examples of religious architecture, such buildings in
the West might be treated as museum objects, but here they are
considered practical parts of the community and adaptable. They are
being returned to use in a process that provides jobs to local
craftspeople doing local kinds of handiwork. In other words, no
division is drawn between the past and the present, so that what's
old is made new through what's old.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The agency's approach is slow and incremental, and not everyone
in Morocco agrees with it. Detractors have asked, Is this the best
way to preserve historical monuments? Tradition notwithstanding,
wouldn't modern building techniques be more efficient and less
expensive?
</P>
<P>
   But ADER-Fez is devoted to a broad, long-term view of historical
preservation. A private organization, it receives some help from
the Moroccan government. It is run by a local man named Abdel-Latif
El Hajjami, whose father was a religious adviser to the King.
</P>
<P>
   He is a passionate and unshakable spokesman for his cause.
Hajjami's focus was on the major monuments until people in the
medina began to complain that their needs were being overlooked.
Then a new plan was devised. Hajjami formulated a vision of
preservation here that better took into account the whole
community.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank paid for a team from the Unit for Housing and
Urbanization at Harvard's Graduate School of Design to help. The
Moroccan government then donated land outside Fez that the agency
would be able to develop and sell to raise money for its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now the World Bank is providing the Moroccan government with a
loan of more than $20 million for infrastructure improvements,
emergency repairs and short-term loans for tenants and homeowners
in the medina.
</P>
<P>
   The plan involves some small-scale modernizing interventions,
for example to provide limited access in the medina for ambulances
and fire- and sanitation trucks to replace the donkeys, which
happen to be heavy polluters. Some miniparks will also be created,
because the medina has no places for children to play.
</P>
<P>
   Already about 200 buildings have received some sort of emergency
help in the last several years from ADER-Fez. Because the medina is
so overcrowded, the agency is not always able to find temporary
homes for people who live in crumbling buildings during the
repairs. One of the oddest sights in Fez is of families living in
the middle of construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Ansari family, for example, live behind a pile of rubble
that, not long ago, had been the outside of a house next to theirs.
Scaffolding shores up what remains of their walls. Workers on
ladders busy themselves with repairs. And in a room open to their
small central courtyard, now muddied by construction equipment, the
Ansaris calmly sit at a low round table, sipping sweetened Moroccan
tea and watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the agency's more conspicuous successes, besides the Bou
Inaniya, include the restoration of the Foundouk Nejjarine, for
example, a lodge, then a mosque that has now become a handsome
woodworking museum in the carpenters' quarter. But the Ansaris'
house encapsulates the crucial connection being made here between
the preservation of local culture and daily life _ a profound idea,
once you think of the medina in Fez, its community, both physically
and socially, as a living work of art.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the question is whether it will really be possible to
make the place more amenable to tourists yet not turn it into a
theme park. Can housing in the medina be improved, and the prices
of houses made to rise, giving a lift to the economy, without
gentrifying the community? With Fez especially burdened by building
codes and fragmented ownership patterns, can the agency help
eliminate the red tape to encourage more homeownership so that
residents will feel it is worthwhile investing in the medina's
improvement?
</P>
<P>
   Hajjami sees a few trickle-down effects so far: the hiring in
Spain, for instance, of craftsmen trained in Fez in the old arts of
building construction, and voluntary improvements by some
homeowners with faith in the medina's fiscal prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows yet? It will take time merely for ADER-Fez to
develop the land it received from the government to maintain its
staff and offices.
</P>
<P>
   What's intriguing for now is the concept alone. Americans often
judge culture in terms of money, asking how much a painting is
worth. Fez is a reminder that, elsewhere in the world, culture is
more a matter of public identity, of local or national self-worth.
It is inseparable from the people who made it, and defines them.
The lesson here is that the life of the medina, its residents, and
their art and architecture are inextricably linked.

STUDENT, WOMEN GROUPS PROTEST ABUSE AGAINST CHINESE DURING
INDONESIA RIOTS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Students and women's groups held emotional protests
Monday over the looting, killing and rape directed against ethnic
Chinese during riots in Indonesia in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting in Indonesia originally received only cursory media
coverage in China. It was not until this month, when two Chinese
newspapers published photo essays showing the violence, that the
issue was thrust before the Chinese public.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports have prompted anger directed primarily at
Indonesia's leaders. But China's government and its official press
have also been criticized by some citizens who say they should have
reacted sooner and with greater force.
</P>
<P>
   Both a women's group and students from Beijing University had
applied to the Public Security Bureau for permission to hold
organized demonstrations Monday, Indonesian Independence Day, and
were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals from both groups went ahead with events that
were small but had a powerful impact, contending they were not
organized demonstrations. It was an unusual move in a city where
political demonstrations are tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Though tiny by comparison, the student protests were the largest
since the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   At a hotel banquet room in central Beijing decorated with
feminist slogans and pictures of women who had been reported raped
and tortured, 150 people attended a protest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 10,000 demonstrated in Hong Kong _ more than 10,000
signatures were collected in New York,'' Zhao Shuqing, a television
news reporter who wore a yellow ribbon in support of the ethnic
Chinese Indonesians, said at the meeting. ``And I wondered, what
has mainland China done in this matter?''
</P>
<P>
   At the Indonesian Embassy in Beijing's trendy Sanlitun district
Monday, small groups of somber looking university students, also
wearing yellow ribbons, arrived throughout the morning to protest
the abuse, each in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   A group of several dozen from Beijing University staged a short
sit-in outside the ambassador's residence and presented a T-shirt
signed by more than 100 students protesting the atrocities. Others
unfurled posters bearing grisly photographs that have appeared in
the Chinese press in the last week. Two groups also presented
petitions to the embassy last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came spontaneously,'' said a young man who would identify
himself only by his surname, Xiong, and who said he is an
undergraduate at Beijing University. ``This was not organized. It
was a matter of conscience,''
</P>
<P>
   Security was heavy, with far more police officers than students
lining the street outside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have said 1,200 people were killed and 150
women raped in the riots in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, in
addition to the widespread looting of Chinese businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic violence in Indonesia, as well as the protests in
Beijing, presents a quandary to Chinese officials. China's longtime
policy has been not to meddle in the affairs of other countries and
not to tolerate other countries' meddling in its affairs,
particularly when human rights is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as China has grown as a regional power, it has begun to
shed its traditional isolationism. With world outrage growing over
the reports of abuse of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, the
Chinese government started in mid-July to lodge protests, which
have grown louder over time. In a recent editorial, the Communist
Party newspaper, The People's Daily, urged the Indonesian leaders
to ``punish the criminals strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although both the women's group and the students had to sidestep
the authorities somewhat to get their message out, they also
received some support from the government. Officials passed on a
student petition protesting the violence to the Indonesian
government, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   After women from the China Women's News were denied permission
to demonstrate, some of them reserved a banquet room in the Qi Lu
Hotel for an event they called Intellectual Women of the Capital
Voicing their Support for the Ethnic Chinese Victims of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the speeches were to start, the hotel managers
became alarmed and asked the organizers if they had official
permission. The organizers replied that none was needed since it
was not a demonstration. In the end, the hotel allowed them to stay
_ as long as the hotel's name on the stage was covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese media didn't act quickly enough when the riots
broke out,'' Zhang Kangkang, a well-known author, said at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no human rights under a dictatorial government,''
she said later. ``This is a point we must realize.''
</P>
<P>
   The students also ultimately had their say. On Saturday, a huge
poster appeared on the Beijing University campus with a letter of
protest addressed to the Indonesian ambassador in Beijing. It
quickly gathered 1,500 signatures, at a time when the university is
not even in session.
</P>
<P>
   University officials from around Beijing were summoned to a
meeting during the weekend where they were instructed not to permit
demonstrations to leave campus.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday students slipped out from Beijing University and
Qinghua University in dribs and drabs and made their way to the
Indonesian Embassy for their protests.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of police officers generally allowed the students
to briefly make their point, then politely urged them to go home.
But the police presence was intimidating. Representatives from the
women's meeting who had intended to deliver a letter to the
Indonesian ambassador turned back and decided to fax it instead.

DESIGNS TO BUT 25 STORES FROM LEVI STRAUS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After reporting another quarterly loss, Designs Inc. said Monday
it plans to acquire 25 outlet stores from a subsidiary of Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. as part of an ongoing turnaround strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Designs, a Needham, Mass. retail chain that relies heavily on
Levi's denim clothing, said it has agreed to pay $12 million for
nine Levi's Outlet stores and 16 Dockers Outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
   For Levi's, the sale is a chance to exit the outlet business and
stress urban stores that showcase its gear as a fashion brand. For
Designs, which operates 121 stores in five different formats, the
sale is a chance to grow the store group that has fared better than
any other of its retail divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Designs operates 70 stores in a Levi's outlet format, including
some as joint ventures with Levi Strauss; the proposed sale will
position Design as the largest US operator of outlet stores that
offer the Levi's and Dockers brands, said Designs president and
chief executive Joel H. Reichman.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would partly offset revenues lost from closing 36
underperforming stores over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the troubles at Designs can be traced to Levi's, whose
jeans are now viewed as old hat by some young consumers. Meanwhile,
other consumers have passed up Levi's to buy cheaper jeans that
department stores sell under their own brand names.
</P>
<P>
   At Designs, such trends have hurt the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Designs reported a loss of $3.1 million on sales of
$47.1 million for the quarter ended Aug. 1; at stores open for at
least a year, sales dropped 23 percent. For the same quarter last
year, Designs lost $16.6 million on sales of $64.5 million when it
operated far more stores.
</P>
<P>
   Designs said it's poised for a 1999 turnaround. Levi's jeans
have fallen out of fashion before, only to rebound strongly.
Designs is counting on that happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too early for them to have an evidence of a
turnaround; they're still in transition,'' said president Ward
Mooney of BankBoston Retail Finance Inc., which extended a $50
million line of revolving credit to Designs in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's proposed acquisition should be ``a postive'' for
Designs, Mooney added.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, shares of Designs were up 1/32 to close at 1 5/32.

`BADGE OF COURAGE': STEPHEN CRANE, MAKING REAL A WAR HE NEVER
FOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading a new biography of Stephen Crane, you wonder what fresh
insights it offers about ``The Red Badge of Courage'' and the
story's relevance today. How does that Civil War novel hold up
against the blood-red images of real warfare, from Kosovo to
Normandy, in print and on film, at the end of this dying century?
The novel's opening paragraph, one of the most stunning in American
literature, hints at the answer and demands rereading:
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold passed reluctantly from the earth and the retiring
fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting. As the
landscape changed from brown to green the army awakened and began
to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors. It cast its eyes
upon the roads which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud
to proper thoroughfares. A river, amber-tinted in the shadow of its
banks, purled at the army's feet and at night when the stream had
become of a sorrowful blackness one could see, across, the red
eye-like gleam of hostile camp-fires set in the low brows of
distant hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the armies of the night confront each other and men fall in
``grotesque agonies'' under a red sun that is ``pasted in the sky
like a fierce wafer,'' memorable phrases that appear in Crane's
masterpiece. (The word ``fierce'' was excised by the publisher in
the 1895 edition; I am quoting from the authentic 1982 Norton
edition of the restored novel, which follows the original
manuscript.) It's still a source of wonder that Crane, who was born
six years after the end of the Civil War, could imagine it so
vividly.
</P>
<P>
   But more than his imagination was at work. He studied the
memoirs of Union Army veterans in the Century and other magazines.
And as a freelance writer for various newspapers, he covered the
front lines of life in the lower depths of New York, a battlefield
of its own in the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   One of the welcome facts we learn from Linda H. Davis'
well-documented biography is that Crane's opening paragraph
practically wrote itself. He told Hamlin Garland, the generous
fellow writer who helped him simplify the novel's characters, that
the language came to him with ``every word in place, every comma,
every period fixed.'' To his artist friend, Corwin Linson, he said
it was as if he were taking dictation, writing ``throughout with
the unhesitating speed of one who did not have to contrive incident
or think it through at all; it was simply the labor of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor of writing. Much of Crane's prose was hurried and
uneven, produced for Grub Street to survive; yet behind the hack
work hovered an idealist who wanted to break out of the narrow
newspaper columns and say something larger about human nature. At
his best, Crane did so in fiction by creating realistic
individuals, just as the muckrakers did reportorially in McClure's
magazine before and after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In his first novel, ``Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,'' which he
paid a New York job printer to produce, Crane exposed prostitution.
In ``The Red Badge of Courage,'' he made a bitter statement about
the physical and psychological horrors of war. The ``red badge''
symbolized two different things in the story: for one character, it
was a deadly wound; for another, a wound of conscience. In ``Red
Badge,'' Crane calls war ``the red animal _ the blood-swollen
god.'' He proves that any authentic war novel _ in any country's
literature _ is perforce an antiwar novel.
</P>
<P>
   For Crane fans, Ms. Davis describes the origins of his work in
loving detail. She is a diligent researcher, building on much
earlier scholarship and original sources, including Crane's
correspondence with editors, agents and publishers. Her previous
biography, ``Onward and Upward,'' was about Katharine S. White, who
had been a revered editor at The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Badge of Courage'' leaves the impression that Crane's own life
as a street reporter, war correspondent, novelist and aspiring bon
vivant was perhaps his most original piece of work. Stephen Crane
was more or less married to Cora Crane, the madam of the most
elegant ``sporting house'' in Jacksonville, Fla., which had an
inviting name, the Hotel de Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Cora nursed Stephen back to health after he had been
shipwrecked, went off with him as a correspondent in her own right
to the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, then became the hostess of an
English manor house. With more fame than money, they somehow
entertained Joseph Conrad, H.G. Wells and Henry James, all admirers
of Crane's Civil War novel. Ms. Davis quotes Wells on Crane: ``I do
not think that American criticism has yet done justice to the
unsurpassable beauty of Crane's best writing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of an American author who matched Crane's
accomplishments in a 10-year career. He turned out a series of
novels, short stories, poetry and daring journalism before dying of
tuberculosis at the age of 28 in 1900. In addition to ``Maggie''
and ``Red Badge of Courage,'' several of Crane's stories _ ``The
Open Boat,'' ``The Blue Hotel,'' ``The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky''
_ have become part of the American literary canon. Had Crane lived,
wrote A.J. Liebling in a 1961 New Yorker piece, he ``might have
been the great correspondent that the First World War failed to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, his labors left him a poor man. As Ms. Davis tells us:
``In four years Stephen had published five novels, two volumes of
poetry, three big story collections, two books of war stories, and
countless works of short fiction and reporting. And yet in three
years he had earned just over $1,200 for his entire American
output, at a time when the country's per capita income was $1,200
annually.'' Crane told a friend that he couldn't afford a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Badge of Courage'' bears the burden of a rather obvious and
ambiguous title. But Ms. Davis has written an impressive biography,
with many fascinating facts about Crane's rough-and-tumble career,
series of romantic liaisons and adventurous writing. The book helps
to call attention to the realism in Crane's own life. By chasing
wars as a newspaper correspondent, he strove to prove the validity
of his imagined stories. In a remarkable turnabout _ fact following
fiction _ Crane told Conrad that he went to war to see if his ``Red
Badge'' was right.

FUENTES APPOINTED MANAGING EDITOR OF THE BEAUMONT ENTERPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Beaumont Enterprise  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Diana Fuentes, regional and political editor
at the San Antonio Express-News, has been named managing editor of
The Beaumont Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy M. Kelly, the editor of the Enterprise, announced the
appointment Monday and said Fuentes will join the newspaper August
31.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said her professional experience, community-mindedness and
high professional standards ``make her ideally suited for leading
The Enterprise's newsroom. We were fortunate to attract a
journalist and person of Diana's caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, 39, a native of Laredo, Texas, has worked at the
Express-News since 1989. She was the chief of the newspaper's
capital bureau in Austin for four years and has been regional
editor since 1996. She assumed the additional duties of political
editor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes previously worked at two other Hearst newspapers in
Texas _ at the San Antonio Light as a reporter and at the Laredo
Morning Times for seven years as a reporter, magazine editor,
Sunday editor, capital correspondent and city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes is financial officer and a member of the board of
directors of the 1,500-member National Association of Hispanic
Journalists. She is a 1985 graduate of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rivard, editor of The Express-News, said: ``Diana's
arrival in Beaumont comes at a time when Hearst newspapers in Texas
are working more closely together, sharing our news products and
our growing talent pool. Readers are the real beneficiaries because
they are getting more relevant and in-depth Texas news not
otherwise available. Diana will bring energy and experience to her
new post in Beaumont.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise is the sixth-largest newspaper in the Hearst
group, serving Beaumont, 10 counties in Southeast Texas and two
parishes in Louisiana. It has a daily circulation of 60,000 and a
Sunday circulation of 72,000.

 &HT;    THE SCENE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE FENCE AND PEBBLE BEACH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's scandal-driven media circus moved from
Monica Beach to Pebble Beach on Monday as correspondents, shaded by
golf umbrellas, stood on a patch of crushed gravel on the White
House grounds and speculated on what President Clinton might be
telling independent counsel Kenneth Starr inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know nothing, but the imperative is to say something,''
conceded veteran ABC newsman Sam Donaldson in the early afternoon
as several colleagues reported nearby about the on-going,
closed-door interrogation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   By testifying to a federal grand jury from the White House Map
Room via closed-circuit TV, Clinton shifted the scandal focus away
from Monica Beach, the name photographers have given the sunny
sidewalks and plazas outside the E. Everett Prettyman U.S.
Courthouse where former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
other witnesses have testified over the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
   On this steamy August afternoon, the action _ at least what the
public could see _ was at Pebble Beach, the name those ever-glib
photographers have given the rocky area designed to spare the north
lawn as camera crews set up and TV correspondents perform
``stand-ups'' with the White House in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of history and of humidity hung over the scene as scores
of sweaty tourists stood outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and
peered through the wrought-iron fence to the familiar building
where, for the first time, a president was testifying to a criminal
grand jury investigating his own actions. Impromptu sidewalk
debates were as hot as the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having our own 'Crossfire','' said Matt Focht of
Rockville, Md., referring to the weeknight political debate program
on CNN. ``This is a defining moment,'' he said. ``I want the
president to tell the truth and to have the character to accept the
consequences of that truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Monica,'' said Karen O'Shea of Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? That woman is twisted,'' retorted Michael Rogers of
Washington, D.C. ``You don't save clothing with stains from sexual
encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a young woman, very vulnerable to men of power,
particularly presidential power,'' said O'Shea. ``I compare her to
a groupie. So when she made it with the president, she kept a
souvenir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just got to 'fess up and tell the truth,'' said Yolanda
Treiguts, a self-described ``lifelong Democrat'' visiting from
Chicago. ``Then I think the people will forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, forgiveness might be unlikely from the group of people on
the sidewalk dressed in overcoats and wool scarves to ward off the
``snow job'' they said Clinton has pulled on the populace. And
there was little sympathy for the president from the folks handing
out peaches _ symbolizing ``impeachment'' _ and carrying signs that
said ``Honk If You Want to Impeach Clinton.'' They were from the
Council of Volunteer Americans, which has been protesting Clinton's
ethics for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had his detractors, too, with signs comparing his
investigation to McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a witch hunt with the independent counsel and the
media out to get him,'' said Emoke Pelay, a student from
Fayetteville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House briefing room, UPI reporter Helen Thomas,
dean of the press corps, said she had only seen this kind of
atmosphere a handful of times in a career stretching back to the
Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''It resembles Watergate and the end of the Vietnam War,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 journalists, four times the usual number, showed up
the morning ``gaggle'' _ an informal briefing _ and prompted
presidential press secretary Michael McCurry to speak in the White
House briefing room rather than from his office desk.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry acknowledged the difficulty of the day, describing how
Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles had already instructed aides in ``the
importance of sticking together.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Bowles recalled a lesson he learned from his father
while growing up in North Carolina: ``It's easy to be there for
someone when they're up. But it's the good ones who are there for
you when you're down.''

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN 32-YEAR-OLD KLAN MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Jury selection began Monday in the fourth
trial of Sam Bowers, the 73-year-old imperial wizard of the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, more than three decades after he was
first accused of the murder of Vernon Dahmer, the president of the
local chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors said that they had new evidence that
identified Bowers as the man who ordered Dahmer's slaying in 1966,
the state moved to revive the case earlier this year. Bowers, a
Klan leader in neighboring Jones County, is accused of dispatching
two carloads of ``night riders'' who firebombed Dahmer's house to
punish him for his activism in registering black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer, a prominent Mississippi civil rights activist, died from
burns he suffered in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers and a dozen other Klansmen were charged in the case
shortly after the attack. Three men were convicted, but Bowers'
three trials in the 1960s resulted in mistrials. He served six
years in federal prison for an unrelated conviction growing out of
the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers in Neshoba County,
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was in the courtroom Monday as the new proceedings began,
wearing a worn suit and sporting two Mickey Mouse buttons in his
lapel. He refused to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As he entered the courthouse, District Attorney Lindsay Carter
said, ``We're trying to get some closure in this matter for the
Dahmer family. They deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahmer's son, Vernon Jr., was on hand as Circuit Judge Richard
McKenzie began the tedious job of selecting a panel of 12 jurors
and two alternates from several hundred residents called for duty.
McKenzie sought to establish a comfortable environment in the
courtroom with gentle jokes and comment that provoked laughter from
a racially-mixed group of potential jurors. But outside, two
pickets carried signs that said: ``White Revolution is the only
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, McKenzie had excused a handful of prospective
jurors who said they were convinced of Bowers' guilt or expressed
concern over political pressure that forced the Klan leader to
trial again.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he expected more than a week of testimony.

   Fuentes, 39, a native of Corpus Christi, Texas, has worked at
the Express-News since 1989. She was the chief of the newspaper's
capital bureau in Austin for four years and has been regional
editor since 1996. She assumed the additional duties of political
editor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes previously worked at two other Hearst newspapers in

our growing talent pool. Readers are the real beneficiaries because
they are getting more relevant and in-depth Texas news not
otherwise available. Diana will bring energy and experience to her
new post in Beaumont.''

U.S. WOMEN CAN SET STANDARD FOR EMPOWERMENT WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It's easy to forget how much progress American women
have made in recent decades. Harassment remains, the glass ceiling
is tightly in place and high-quality child care is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   But we need only look beyond our borders to appreciate how far
we've come and how much we need to reach out to our sisters
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, as democracies have developed so has a
resentment toward women even though their status, education and
opportunities lag far behind men in their society.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of this hostility is a growing resentment by some in
South Africa who oppose legislation that the Parliament is expected
to approve that would address employment equity, domestic violence
and skill development.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the upbeat atmosphere during National
Women's Week was tarnished by warnings by elders in Soweto that
there would be a backlash against women if the government's efforts
succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens with change, these naysayers warn that giving
women more rights would weaken society by leading to more divorce
and violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Liphadzi, a community leader is Soweto, was quoted as
saying that ``If further rights are given, a woman will have the
right to control a man. That will make him weak. Without the bills
there is already a lot of violence in the house because women feel
they can do exactly what they like.''
</P>
<P>
   Sangoma Violet Moswanganye added that ``women should not have
any rights because they will say `I can work and do the things I
want.' It could lead to more violence in the home, and make divorce
more common.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the backlash against women stems from a misunderstanding
that empowering women weakens men. It is especially difficult to
convince people that enabling a woman to get a job will help her
family when her husband, brother or father can't find work in a
country with double-digit unemployment and a 35 percent illiteracy
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of course is that research has confirmed that
improving the status of women helps not only that woman but her
family and her society. That is why agencies such as the Hunger
Project are focusing on empowering women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending the subjugation of women is key to ending hunger,''
said Carol Coonrod, education and advocacy coordinator for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   That is why we in the United States need to not only set an
example, but we need to support programs and policies that empower
women worldwide. Quoting an African woman's song: ``I have only one
request. I do not ask for money although I have need of it....I
have only one request. All I ask is that you remove the roadblock
from my path.'' - 30 -

 &HT;    Most Americans say adultery is wrong under any circumstance
 &HT;    (EDS: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE REQUESTED IT.)
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite President Clinton's high approval ratings
in the face of alleged marital infidelity in the White House, a
huge majority of Americans have been telling pollsters for years
that they believe adultery is wrong under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   And among average American couples, adultery appears to occur
far less than might be suggested by the flurry of recent news
accounts about the president and such other public figures as Bill
Cosby, Frank Gifford and Bruce Willis, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear to be all that common,'' said Dave Murray,
director of the non-profit Statistical Assessment Service in
Washington and an anthropologist whose speciality is family
structure. ``If anything, attitudes toward adultery in the 1990s
have hardened, possibly as a backlash to the sexual revolution of
the 1960s,'' added Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable data on adultery in the United States are limited.
Probably more than any other human behavior, adultery is cloaked in
secrecy and, therefore, researchers can hardly count on complete
candor from subjects. In addition, much of the research that has
been done in recent years has been colored by ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a 1994 survey by the National Opinion Research Center at
the University of Chicago, and a host of public opinion polls
conducted since, portray Americans as moralistic and conventional
in sexual matters _ ''essentially monogamous,'' as the University
of Chicago researchers summarized their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, recent research by sociologist Judith Treas of the
University of California in Irvine found that
</P>
<P>
   American attitudes about adultery are closely aligned with those
of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Poland, three nations with
conservative Catholic populations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The much-hyped sexual revolution apparently failed to loosen
American adults' non-permissive attitudes toward sex outside
marriage,'' Treas said.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general population seems to say, 'Oh, no, adultery is not
the right thing to do,' but a lot of the people saying that are
engaged in extra-marital relationships,'' said Albert Watson, a
University of Cincinnati professor who teaches family counseling.
</P>
<P>
   How many Americans commit adultery is difficult to quantify. But
a frequently used starting point is the 1994 National Opinion
Research Center survey.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face survey of 3,432 adults who were born between
1933 and 1974, the center asked: ''Have you ever had sex with
someone other than your husband or wife while you were married?''
About 24 percent of men and 11 percent of women answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   Those percentages, if applied to the current population of
adults in the United States, would mean that about 19 million men
and 12 million women have committed adultery at least once in their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures may be low, however, since polls of any kind do
not always elicit the truth. ''If your wife is in the next room,
you're not going to be completely candid,'' said Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the University of Chicago survey findings are similar to
those of public opinion polls conducted since. For instance, about
80 percent of those surveyed by the University of Chicago for its
1994 report agreed that adultery was ''always wrong'' while 10
percent said it was ''almost always wrong.'' A Gallup Poll last
December, before the Monica Lewinsky investigation of Clinton
began, found that 79 percent of Americans believe adultery is
''always wrong,'' 11 percent believe it is ''almost always wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Pew Research Center for The People and The Press,
found recently that 85 percent of Americans ''agree'' or ''mostly
agree'' that they have ''old-fashioned values about family and
marriage'' _ a figure that has been remarkably constant since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But Father James Heft, chancellor and a professor of faith and
culture at the University of Dayton, notes that there is nothing
old-fashioned in the way Americans speak of adultery today.
Consequently, he believes, there is little public outrage arising
from the allegations that Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky, and
tried to conceal the affair from Whitewater investigators and
lawyers representing former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones in
a sexual harassment suit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We usually don't speak of adultery or fornication anymore,''
he said. ''We use more neutral terms like extra- and pre-marital
sex _ clinically descriptive and morally contentless. (CQ) That's
been part of our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Ellen Balchunis, a professor at LaSalle University in
Philadelphia, said, ''Americans can and do separate their attitudes
toward infidelity and their politicians.'' Their attitude is ''they
didn't vote for Clinton to be pope,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for Clinton's continued high standings in the
polls may be the growing importance of privacy to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a twist on the concept that we Americans hold our leaders
to a higher standard _ that Americans are afraid that the same
standards will be applied to them,'' said Nate Lenow, a private
investigator in Memphis, Tenn., with experience in adultery-related
divorce cases.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the past 30 years, American society has been
moving away from what University of Chicago sociologist Edward O.
Laumann calls the ''public guarantee of morality through law.''
With that movement has come a secularization of adultery laws, most
notably the no-fault divorce statutes of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who did what to whom no longer plays a part in the finances of
a divorce settlement,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Barry Schatz, a nationally known divorce attorney with the
Chicago firm of Kalcheim, Schatz &AMP; Berger. ''It may be an issue in
terms of emotions and it can set the tone for a case, but not the
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Schatz said most divorces are not brought on by adultery, but by
the decay of relationships, which sometimes leads to adultery.
</P>
<P>
   ''If spouses work at being friends and supporters, respect each
other and have some common interests, they can sustain some of that
early romance,'' he said. ''They won't need extra lovers, and they
won't have to come see me.''

BILLBOARD FOR DNA TESTING CREATES DOUBTS ABOUT PATERNITY, CRITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ The little boy, 6, looked just like his
daddy.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl, 3, did not. So the divorced Johnson County,
Kan. man loaded the girl in his car and told her they were going to
the dentist to get their teeth cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he took her to a Kansas City, Mo., laboratory where a
worker took a cotton ``cheek swab'' from both their mouths. A test
would compare their DNA and determine whether the girl was really
the man's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from a billboard the man saw alongside Interstate
70. The sign at the Jackson curve east of downtown asks in big
letters, ``Who's The Father? Call 1-800-DNA-TYPE.''
</P>
<P>
   Identigene, based in Houston, apparently has hit an untapped
market.
</P>
<P>
   With its billboards in Kansas City and 23 other cities
nationwide, the company is peddling DNA paternity tests _
traditionally a legal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a home kit so customers don't have to go to a lab.
They just mail in the cotton swabs.
</P>
<P>
   The company boasts that the test, which costs about $600, is
quick and 99.9 percent accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Business is booming, Identigene president Caroline Caskey said.
She founded the company five years ago based on a technology called
polymerase chain reaction that was developed by her father, a
geneticist.
</P>
<P>
   Before the billboard promotion, the company did about 40 tests a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's doing 175.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do about 9,000 this year,'' Caskey said.
</P>
<P>
   But she's heard from critics who think the billboard pitch is a
little tacky.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Carl Herbster, pastor of Tri-City Ministries in Blue
Springs, Mo., isn't so much bothered by the billboard as he is the
appeal the tests seem to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tragic that we've come to this level of immorality in our
society,'' Herbster said. ``It shows the distrust that we have in
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Caskey said that complaints, mostly from Christian
conservatives, have come from most cities where the billboards are
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``They prefer not to see that kind of sign on the side of a
freeway,'' Caskey said. ``They say they don't want their children
to read that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Family Research Council in Washington wonders how many
seeds of doubt are planted by Identigene's billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drive to work and they see that billboard and it gets
them to thinking something they never would have suspected
otherwise,'' said Kristin Hansen, spokeswoman for the council,
which monitors family issues relating to public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this company is playing on fears and suspicions that
probably aren't valid. And it's probably breaking up some
families.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   After barely escaping death in the crash of his balloon at sea,
Steve Fossett relaxed aboard a rescue ship in the South Pacific on
Monday, saying that he planned ``to sit back and smell the roses
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett, a 54-year-old commodities broker from Chicago, was
almost killed Sunday attempting to become the first balloonist to
circle the world nonstop. He had come much closer to that goal than
any other aeronaut when a thunderstorm sucked him down, ruptured
his balloon and slammed him into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the water about 500 miles east of Australia after having
traveled more than 15,200 miles from his starting point in Mendoza,
Argentina. Thus, he broke his own distance record of 10,360 miles,
a mark he set in 1997 when he reached India from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some difficult maneuvering over the Indian Ocean last
week, Fossett had had a fairly trouble-free flight, and his
ground-control team in St. Louis believed that on this, his fourth
round-the-world attempt, he had an excellent chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   But after he flew east over Australia at speeds over 100 miles
an hour, Fossett's troubles began. He related the experience by
radio to a journalist from 7 Network Australia aboard an Australian
rescue plane.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rice, the team's chief meteorologist, had warned Fossett
that he was approaching a line of thunderstorms over the South
Pacific, and the balloonist tried to climb above them. At an
altitude of nearly 30,000 feet, Fossett said he thought he had
safely risen over the storm when a violent downdraft hit the big
Solo Spirit balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing. There were tremendous sheets of hail just
flooding me, and my greatest descent rate was 2,500 feet a
minute,'' Fossett said. The compartment of the balloon holding
helium lifting gas ruptured as the wind tore at it, leaving only
the hot-air compartment for lift. Fossett threw some fuel tanks
overboard to lighten his craft and slow its descent and he poured
full power into his propane hot-air burners.
</P>
<P>
   And then he hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised,'' he said. ``I thought it would kill me.
In just the last 30 seconds I cut away a lot of tanks. Maybe I gave
the balloon a little bit of lift so I hit the water more gently,
and then the capsule was immediately pulled underwater and filled
with water.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected to die. Despite the water pouring into the
capsule, the balloon's propane burners set the capsule on fire. But
Fossett managed to grab his life raft and dive to safety through
the capsule's submerged hatch. He also retrieved a radio distress
beacon, which began transmitting automatically.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of hours, a French reconnaissance plane found the
balloonist, dropped him another life raft and reported his
position. After that, planes from the Australian air force remained
over his raft almost continuously until he was picked up after 10
hours by a privately owned Australian sailboat. A rendezvous was
arranged to transfer Fossett to an Australian naval ship, which was
to take him on Wednesday to Townsville in Queensland, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Curtis, the Australian journalist who interviewed Fossett
by radio, asked him: ``Is this the end of adventures for Steve
Fossett?''
</P>
<P>
   The balloonist's reply, as relayed by his ground crew:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, but I'm not going to comment about any attempts to fly
around the world by balloon at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett is a championship sailor and climber, and he has
competed in the Iditarod dog race in Alaska and in long-distance
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   His latest attempt to circumnavigate the world was the first in
the Southern Hemisphere by any balloonist. Several other teams may
attempt the trip next January, but considering the bad luck all
have had during the past decade, the field of competitors may be
small, even though a million-dollar prize awaits the first
balloonist to complete the transglobal circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving his floating capsule Fossett sealed it in hopes
of eventually recovering it. Its contents include instruments and
records of a scientific experiment intended to test systems that
might one day be used for a balloon on Mars.

6 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN NORTHERN IRELAND ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ British police arrested six men Monday
in towns near this city for questioning in the car bomb attack here
on Saturday that killed 28 people and injured 220.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, the deadliest in 29 years of sectarian violence in
this predominantly Protestant British province, is widely believed
to have been the work of a group that calls itself the Real IRA, a
splinter group whose members left the Irish Republican Army this
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland pledged to hunt down the killers
and made it clear that they thought that the Real IRA was
responsible for the attack. The group is thought to be,
effectively, the military wing of a political splinter group, the
32-County Sovereignty Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Sovereignty Committee vehemently opposes the new Northern
Ireland peace agreement because it leaves the six northern
counties, which constitute a British province, under British
sovereignty. The group wants those counties subsumed in the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Two London newspapers reported that the leader of the Real IRA
was a former weapons expert for the Irish Republican Army who
defected after the IRA decided to observe a cease-fire 13 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary gave no details about the arrested
suspects. But the identity of one was disclosed by his father, a
leader of the Sovereignty Committee in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Francie Mackey, an Omagh City Council member, said
his son, Shane, had been arrested Monday morning. Mackey, a
prominent member of the 32- County Sovereignty Committee, said that
the arrest was harassment and that his son had nothing to do with
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was sorry for the victims, but declined to condemn
the attack categorically. He also said his group had no links with
the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But security officials in Belfast and Dublin say there is a
connection. The identity of the Real IRA leader has been a matter
of widening public concern since the attack. Several British and
Irish newspapers have said he is believed to be a middle-age man
who lives near Dundalk, Ireland, near the border.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two London newspapers, The Express and The Daily
Telegraph, named the leader as Michael McKevitt, former IRA weapons
quartermaster. The papers published a photograph of him on their
front pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegraph reported that McKevitt lived with a leader of the
Sovereignty Committee, Bernadette Sands. Ms. Sands' brother Bobby
became an IRA hero and martyr in 1981, when he starved himself to
death in a British prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegraph said, ``McKevitt was formerly in control of all
IRA arms dumps and the movement of arms, ammunition and explosives
across the border to Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   When he resigned in October from the IRA, the newspaper said, he
said he would not ``use anything in the IRA arsenal for his own
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sands, who was highly visible in the campaign against the
new peace agreement in May, has issued no statements in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread official view, held by the British and Irish
prime ministers, is that the Real IRA does not have the backing of
the main group. That conclusion is based on intelligence officers'
analysis of the relationship between the main group and the
dissident splinters. In addition, the intelligence assessments are
based on information from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Protestant hard-liners assert that the Irish
Republican Army supports the splinter groups. But the Protestant
groups have produced no evidence to support that. They also say
that to them it does not matter whether the IRA is allied with the
splinter groups, that the effect is the same if there is violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Omagh Monday afternoon, several hundred people milled around
and talked quietly near the police barrier that blocked the way to
Market Street, where the bomb exploded. British troops in full
combat uniform, holding automatic rifles at the ready, guarded the
street.
</P>
<P>
   A white-haired Catholic man was looking at the hundreds of
bouquets placed on the sidewalk to express the sympathy of this
town of 27,000, about 70 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Catholics and Protestants were killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder why it should happen,'' a bystander said almost in
a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away a Protestant man who would not give his name
because, he said, he feared terrorist reprisals, said the attack
proved that ``all this nonsense about peace'' was futile. He said
the death penalty should be restored for terrorists, as well as
preventive detention without trial of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Eileen Goldsmith, who described herself as ``a good
Protestant,'' said: ``Everybody worked together, went out together.
Now this is the worst thing that ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On a wall above the bouquets, a hand-written poem had been
taped, apparently by a British soldier's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know why my husband is here,'' it said. ``I want to
gather up my family and run from your town. Pray for the strength
to stay.''

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRESIDENCY _ WASHINGTON _ The prolonged investigations
into President Clinton's personal life and his past financial
dealings have forever changed the presidency. Experts believe that
court decisions requiring the testimony of Secret Service agents
assigned to the president, as well as rulings stripping away
executive privilege from top presidential aides, will cause future
presidents to alter their conduct, making them unreasonably
cautious about everything they say or do while in the White House.
And forcing the commander-in-chief to testify in civil trials and
grand juries, as Clinton did on Monday, could signal a future in
which presidents spend much of their time with lawyers prepping to
take part in court proceedings. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through Whitewater
despite a public that often preferred to hear less rather than more
about presidential scandal. They weathered the backlash of the
Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance from fellow
reporters and their own publications. Now the handful of
journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies for
six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever appearance
by a president before a criminal grand jury. The persistence of
fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely responsible for
keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the country. ``The
heroes are the ones that have kept it alive,'' says Britt Hume, who
anchors an evening report on Washington for Fox Cable News. ``These
people have done tremendously well on this story, and it hasn't
been easy.'' Among them: Susan Schmidt of The Washington Post,
Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Steve Labaton of The New York Times, Pete
Yost of the AP, as well as Jackie Judd and Chris Vlasto of ABC.
(Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   US-ADULTERY _ WASHINGTON _ Despite President Clinton's high
approval ratings in the face of allegations of marital infidelity,
a huge majority of Americans still believe adultery is wrong,
according to polling data. And adultery among the average American
couple is far less common than the flurry of recent allegations
against Clinton and other public figures would suggest, say
sociologists, marriage counselors and clergy. But in cases of
divorce, adultery plays a much larger role. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).

   IRELAND-BOMBING _ OMAGH, Northern Ireland ? Police arrested five

first-ever Viagra assisted rape case. But the case comes as no
surprise here. Although the male-impotency drug is supposed to be
illegal in Jamaica, it's smuggled in because of its soaring
popularity and sold for as much as $20 a pill. Throughout Latin
America and the Caribbean, where male virility is a much-prized
attribute, Viagra has ignited widespread interest. People have even
stepped up campaigns to get indigenous potency products -- such as
the bois bande tree bark -- out to men who might be unable to

   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-one-year-old Nisha Anand spent, who six days
as a political prisoner in one of the world's most repressive
military dictatorships and briefly faced the possibility of
five-years hard labor, returned here Monday with some advice to
other would-be democratic activists:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd encourage any foreigner to go in and try it again,'' said
Anand, a graduate student of international studies at American
University.
</P>
<P>
   Anand, however, won't be traveling back to Burma in southeast
Asia any time soon. One of six Americans and 17 other young people
from around the world, Anand was arrested Aug. 9 for distributing
pro-democracy literature in Burma's capital, Rangoon. She was
deported from the country on Saturday after a seven-hour trial that
found her guilty of violating Burma's harsh civil disturbance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Anand, of Atlanta, said she never once feared for her safety or
that of her fellow prisoners and remained confident throughout the
ordeal that the Burmese military government would release she and
her friends to avoid the glare of the international spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. The military leaders have refused to recognize a
democratically elected Parliament voted on by the people in 1990.
The country's pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has set an
Aug. 21 deadline for the government to comply with the 1990 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it was like for us, it was nothing compared to what
it was like for the Burmese people,'' Anand said. ``We were treated
royally . . . They're the true heroes here . . . I'm glad to be
home. I'm glad to be free. But the people of Burma are not free.
They need our help.''
</P>
<P>
   Anand, a member of AU's Free Burma Coalition, left for Thailand
on July 28 with three other AU students. Initially, the group
planed to make contact with Burmese dissidents living in Bangkok,
visit a Burmese refugee camp in Thailand and perhaps engage in a
protest of the Burmese embassy on the anniversary of a failed
pro-democracy uprising in Burma.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bangkok, the students met other pro-democracy activists
who were planning to enter Burma Aug. 7 to distribute pro-democracy
literature. The students signed up for the three-day trip, securing
student visas to visit Rangoon.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived Aug. 7 and spent the following day scouting the 12
sites around the city where they planned to distribute the
literature, which they smuggled in with their personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Each carried 200 cards that read simply, ``Goodwill Message. We
are your friends from around the world. We have not forgotten you.
We support your hopes for human rights and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cards concluded with the number 888, a reference to the
failed uprising in August 1988 in which more than 3,000 people were
killed, and said, ``Don't forget -- Don't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissident organizers sent the contingent of six Americans to the
most visible sites in the Capital, Anand said, because they
believed that the U.S. government would fight the hardest to have
the group released if they were captured by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Anand said the group fully expected to be arrested or detained,
but believed that authorities would simply put them on their plane
back to Bangkok later in the day on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worst-case scenario was we thought we'd be interrogated for
two to three hours,'' Anand said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, all 18 student activists were arrested and detained in
a police barracks in Rangoon. They were fed and treated well, but
not told what would happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week in jail, it was boring,'' Anand said. ``We sat there
and read.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   While Anand's parents fretted, U.S. State Department officials
and representatives of five other nations worked behind the scenes
to urge the government to deport the captives. U.S. Rep.
Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., a member of the House International
Relations Committee, also traveled to Thailand to lobby for their
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some tense moments, some very tense moments,'' said
Vijay Anand, Anand's father, who lives in Atlanta. ``It's easy to
forget all that, now that she is here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, the captives were rounded up and taken to a military
courtroom with one judge. They had no lawyer present. Government
officials brought witnesses who testified against them for seven
hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the proceeding the judge asked the group if they
pleaded guilty to the charge of violating the Emergency Provisions
Act, a 1950 law used to prosecute political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was smiling the whole time,'' Anand recalled.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes after the judge pronounced a five-year sentence
of hard labor, another official entered the room to say the
sentence would be suspended and the group would be deported
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After her arrival at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
on Monday, Anand and one of her fellow political prisoners, Sapna
Chhatpar(CQ), held a news conference across the street from the
Burmese ambassador's house, where Burmese dissidents had been
holding a candle-light vigil for their safe return.
</P>
<P>
   The two young women, wearing matching T-shirts that read
``Respect all -- Fear No One,'' received praise from members of
Burma's government in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best media we've ever had,'' said Beaudee Zawmin,
liaison officer for the National Coalition Government of the Union
of Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Anand's father, putting aside the anger and frustration he felt
at his daughter's brush with danger, was also touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls have guts,'' he said. ``I guess some good doesn't
come unless there are some sacrifices.''

PLIGHT OF LEADING ATHEIST, OTHERS REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Madalyn Murray O'Hair was a renowned atheist
leader and American cultural icon when she disappeared from San
Antonio in late September 1995 along with her two adult children
and a half-million dollars in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Fry was a green-eyed charmer from Florida with a taste for
whiskey and easy money when he vanished from San Antonio in late
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   One case became a Great American Mystery, the other a forensic
footnote.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the O'Hair disappearance has inspired a book, a
network television special and numerous newspaper and magazine
articles, as well as comparisons to other celebrity disappearances,
including Amelia Earhart and Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   It also fueled relentless speculation about the fate of O'Hair,
her son Jon Murray and daughter Robin. Theories range from
kidnapping and murder, to a self-imposed exile sustained by assets
skimmed from atheist accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a three-year global search by reporters, investigators
and the police, no one seems to know if O'Hair and her children are
dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   Fry, on the other hand, sank without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, family members tried to find him. Missing person
reports were filed in Austin, Texas, and in Florida. Psychics were
consulted. But little effort was made by the police or outsiders to
learn his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my dad were real close. I was the one he raised. So for
him to disappear like this is not normal. Something had to have
happened, and it's been driving me crazy for three years,'' said
his daughter, Lisa Fry, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Fry, then 42, moved to Texas in 1995 to stay with David Waters,
a friend from years past in Florida. Waters, 50, also worked for
O'Hair in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, Waters pleaded guilty to stealing $54,000 from
O'Hair's atheist organizations and is now on probation. He has
prior convictions for forgery, battery and murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Waters said he knows nothing of the two
disappearances, but he believes O'Hair and her children are
probably living it up right now, having executed a long-planned
getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was in the works for a long time. I think they are
kicked back somewhere, very comfortable and having chuckles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said he has written a book, yet unpublished, about the
O'Hair disappearance. He declined, however, to share its
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fry asked to come to Austin and stayed with him briefly
in the summer of 1995, before drifting out of the picture. Waters
said his later attempts to find Fry were futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was having some personal problems. I just kind of
got the impression he was trying to get away from things for a
while,'' Waters said of Fry.
</P>
<P>
   However, acquaintances of Fry say it was Waters who induced him
to travel to Texas in July 1995 with promises of big money and a
place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took him to the airport. He was going up there to Austin to
work with a friend, Dave Waters,'' Fry's daughter recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She said her father described the Texas job as ``a big deal''
that would bring her the ``biggest shopping spree'' of her life
when he returned to Florida. Friends of Fry and family members
interviewed for this story requested that their hometowns not be
published.
</P>
<P>
   But Fry was close-mouthed about the details of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never really say if it was something bad, but I'm
positive it was illegal because most of the stuff he did was,''
Lisa Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the last time she spoke to her father was in a brief
and tense conversation at 2:30 p.m., Sept. 30, 1995. It came during
her 16th birthday party, and her father said he would be back in a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   But Fry never made it home from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a month earlier, O'Hair and her children had abruptly
left their comfortable home in northwest Austin and resurfaced 75
miles to the south in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In their haste, they left their breakfast on the table, their
beloved Cocker Spaniels unattended, and a cryptic note advising
staffers the atheist offices were closed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, a diabetic, also left all her medicine at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following weeks, according to cellular phone records,
they kept in regular contact with anxious atheist officials in
Austin and New Jersey, saying they were taking care of urgent
business but would return.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions during the month, callers said, the
cellular phone was answered by an unknown male, who then handed the
phone to Jon Murray.
</P>
<P>
   But at 12:24 p.m., Sept. 29, 1995, Murray made his last call
from San Antonio. After that seven-minute call to atheist
headquarters in Austin, the cell phone went dead, and neither he,
his sister nor his mother was seen or heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the coincidence of time and place, the two
disappearances could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, a larger-than-life figure who rose to prominence more
than three decades ago for her often-exaggerated role in a landmark
Supreme Court decision outlawing mandatory Bible reading in school.
</P>
<P>
   A combative, irreverent unbeliever, O'Hair spent the rest of her
life battling all forms of organized religion while aggressively
soliciting money for her nonprofit atheist organizations in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But the self-described ``most-hated woman in America''
antagonized atheists as well as believers. By 1995 she was an old
woman battling health problems and a marginalized status in
American atheist circles.
</P>
<P>
   Fry, on the other hand, never rose above obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   A single father, he was devoted to his daughter Lisa. But he
struggled with alcohol and unemployment, and when whiskey loosened
his tongue, he became a big talker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny was a scam artist, so I wouldn't put a lot of things
past him,'' said his ex-wife, Jeanetta Camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a lot of things to make extra money scamming people,
but I don't think he would harm anyone intentionally. But people
change, and I haven't been with the man for many years,'' Camp
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her children and Fry all disappeared right after a
peculiar event. In the early afternoon of Sept. 29, San Antonio
jeweler Cory Ticknor delivered $500,000 in gold coins to Murray in
a bank parking.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had ordered the coins a week earlier and paid for them
with $600,000 wired to a San Antonio bank through a New Jersey bank
from an atheist organization account in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair had invested both personal and organization funds in New
Zealand and had talked about someday retiring there.
</P>
<P>
   But the money transfer apparently hit a snag in New Jersey. So,
according to travel records, Murray, accompanied by a man using the
name Conrad Johnson, flew to Newark on Sept. 21, 1995. The two men
returned to San Antonio the next day, and the money soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the gold coins Murray had paid for arrived by Sept.
29. Murray, however, never returned to take delivery of the final
$100,000 shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Fry made his final phone call home the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Family members say in the nearly three years since, little
information was forthcoming from Waters in Austin. Waters said
there was little he could tell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't help her (Lisa Fry). I assured her that if I had
anything I could do to alleviate her concerns, I would do it,'' he
said.

   O'Hair's other son, Bill Murray, who has been estranged from his
mother since becoming a fundamentalist Christian decades ago, said
he now is convinced his family was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the crowning thing is that over $100,000 in my
brother's name is sitting in a New Zealand account and hasn't been
touched in three years. That pretty much says they are dead,'' Bill
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family of Fry also believe he is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man went down in the water somewhere, or he is buried
somewhere. I just feel it. He would never have left his daughter,''
said Lisa Jones, who was Fry's fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones said she would like to have the mystery resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a book opens and a book closes, and this book has
never closed,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, for Danny's mother, so she can let go. So
she can die knowing her son is gone. I think that's the most
important thing.''

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new Census Bureau study confirms earlier reports
that fewer voters bothered to go to the polls in the last
presidential contest than in any such election since 1968 and
offers some theories about this disturbing indifference to our
civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that getting citizens to take seriously their
important role in the elections that produce our political
leadership and determine our national future is not going to be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   We thought we had found at least a partial answer in the
``motor-voter'' law that took effect in 1995. It made it easier to
register to vote by replacing past complicated procedures with a
simple way to sign up while getting a driver's license or filling
out forms for disability and welfare aid. Residents were also given
the right to simply mail in a registration form without further
fuss.
</P>
<P>
   The reform was successful in getting more people to register
than might otherwise have gone to the trouble. But it was not
successful enough to reverse a pattern of three decades of steadily
declining voter registration and turnout.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census report, ``Voting and Registration in the
Election of November 1996,'' 28 percent of eligible adults who
registered to vote in the year before the election did so when they
renewed or obtained driver's licenses. That figure represented more
voters than registered by any other single method. Another 19
percent registered by mailing in forms.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, registration was 2.3 percentage points lower
than registration for the 1992 presidential election. Approximately
128 million people, or 65.9 percent of those of voting age, were
registered to vote in 1996, the lowest proportion for any
presidential election in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   Without motor-voter, those figures would be even more
distressing.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the numbers of those who actually voted was far
sharper, 7 percentage points lower than in 1992. Just 54.2 percent
of the voting-age population cast ballots in the contest between
President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this so? More is at work here than inconvenience and
inertia.
</P>
<P>
   The Census study tried to find out, but the answers seem
disingenuous and unsatisfactory. When queried, nearly 5 million
people who had not voted said they were simply too busy. Another
3.5 million said they didn't give a fig about the whole process.
Nearly 3 million confessed to not liking any of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   My own theory is that being busy with no time off work is a lame
excuse. We can always find room for things that are really
important to us.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too many people just feel their votes don't count in a
crowded nation of 266 million souls (our population will relatively
soon be twice that of 1950, when President Harry S Truman could be
observed strolling alone in the White House neighborhood like a
regular human being). We have become both cynical and disengaged.
</P>
<P>
   And the more ideological the political issues, the less
interested mainstream voters seem to be. The so-called cutting-edge
moral issues that dominate political debate these days drive only a
minority on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Today's campaigns are rife with simplistic social slogans that
bear little relevance to the everyday complex lives of most people,
who find politicians poor role models for moral guidance.
Meaningless ``family values'' provide insufficient motivation to
make people want to elevate one candidate over another.
</P>
<P>
   They will be moved to vote when they feel that something dear to
them is threatened or could be greatly improved, whether it is
Social Security, tax relief or the highway system. Changing the
process to encourage registration can be helpful, but that alone is
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were unrealistically high for motor-voter, which
was a controversial partisan issue for 40 years before it finally
passed. It has neither lived up to its civic promise nor to its
partisan presumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet strangely, Republicans are still fixated on it as somehow
dangerous to the republic. This, despite the fact that three
circuit courts of appeals have already upheld its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also reject the notion that it makes sense to
smooth the passage to participation for ordinary Americans in the
world's greatest democracy. The GOP fought the concept for years
out of fear that more poor, young and minority Democrats would take
advantage of it than middle-class Republicans familiar with the
old, restricted way of registering. President George Bush vetoed
the motor-voter measure, but it passed a second time after Bill
Clinton was elected.
</P>
<P>
   This summer House Republicans attempted to attach to the
campaign finance bill amendments that would allow states to kill
mail-in registrations and to require photo identification for all
voters. Fortunately, the measures lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, motor-voter provisions have not helped Democrats
over Republicans, as both parties had anticipated. The Federal
Election Commission recently reported that while the number of
independent voters increased under the law, neither major party
seemed to benefit over the other in the 26 states where voters must
declare a party affiliation to register.

 &HT;    Backup job is not Erickson's just yet
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Craig Erickson's Sunday consisted of meetings, a
brief warmup, a couple snaps during an offensive line drill and an
hour of watching Dan Marino and Damon Huard throwing passes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why his No. 2 quarterback had spent practice as a
spectator, Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson didn't answer in
words.
</P>
<P>
   He merely tapped his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing serious,'' Johnson insisted. ``We're just resting
him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins did play two pre-season games in six days, with
Erickson handling the bulk of the quarterback duties, throwing more
than twice as many passes (25) as Marino (12), Huard (12) or Chad
May (8).
</P>
<P>
   That work hasn't produced the kind of results that Johnson or
Erickson wanted. The seventh-year pro completed only 44 percent of
his passes (11 of 25) and threw two interceptions and no touchdowns
for a passing rating of 20.6.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Johnson has refused to name Erickson as the
clear-cut backup to Marino. Johnson says that Huard, a free-agent
who holds the No. 3 spot after the release of Chad May and John
Dutton, still has a shot at moving up the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson shrugs this off. As he explains, he's had to deal with
debate about his play for years, dating back to when he was at the
University of Miami and Cardinal Newman High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to let a whole lot bother me,'' he said. ``Believe
me, I've had a lot worse criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Coaches in the dark: Fans and the media aren't the only ones
who wait until cut-down days to see who survives cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coaches also are kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Johnson wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the coaches want to bring up (who will or won't make
the team) and I am very emphatic with them that they don't
speculate,'' Johnson said. ``That's not their concern. ... I talk
to them about who's playing well, who's not playing well. We do not
discuss who's going to be on the roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson discusses that with one person: himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to affect the coaches in a negative way and plant
a negative seed,'' he said. ``I don't think it's really productive
for a coach to be working with a player who thinks he's going to
get cut. And I don't think it's very productive for a player to try
to make our team when he reads in the paper that he's going to get
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about bulletin board material: How about Dan Marino and
David Hasselhoff, separated at birth?
</P>
<P>
   Two sports magazines have noted the resemblance between the
Dolphins' quarterback and the actor. ESPN Magazine noted the
similarity. Sport went one step further, making the two a ``Sport
morph'' _ a line of mug shots that gradually transforms from Marino
on the left to Hasselhoff on the right.
</P>
<P>
   That feature ended up taped to a board in the Dolphins' locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good deed of the week: The Dolphins brought 2,400
disadvantaged children from South Florida to Pro Player Stadium for
the pre-season home opener Thursday against Tampa Bay.
</P>

BRUINS KEEP TALLAS _ FOR $625,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the second time in less than a week, the Bruins got
considerably more than they bargained for, as they were informed by
arbitrator Claude Foisy Monday that it would cost them $625,000 to
keep netminder Rob Tallas in uniform for the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Thursday that Foisy set Dmitri Khristich's salary at
$1.95 million, about twice his pay last season and roughly
one-third more than the Bruins hoped to pay their 29-goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, it is getting significantly more expensive
by the hour to put an NHL team on the ice. The Bruins wanted to pay
Khristich about $1.5 million. They had Tallas pegged for $440,000,
but only if he spent the year in Boston. They were angling to pay
him only $110,000 if he were to spend the year in the minor
leagues, offering what is termed a ``two-way'' contract.
</P>
<P>
   Foisy's answer: No way on the two-way; if the Bruins want to
keep Tallas on the payroll, be it in Boston or Boise, it will cost
them $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my hands are still shaking,'' said a thrilled Tallas,
reached Mondayat his Rhode Island home. ``I'm totally relieved. I
think it shows the Bruins I'm a strong backup in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins could have opted not to pay Tallas, cutting him loose
as an unrestricted free agent. The league's Collective Bargaining
Agreement allows clubs to ``walk away'' from one arbitration case
per season.
</P>
<P>
   But in an afternoon press release, the Bruins made it clear that
they'll keep the 25-year-old Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad to have this settled,'' said Bruins
president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``Robbie fits into our
plans and he, along with (Jim) Carey and (Byron) Dafoe will battle
for the No. 1 spot at training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to the Bruins to decide whether they also will move
ahead with Khristich next season. They have until Thursday morning
_ 72 hours after their last arbitration settlement (in this case
Tallas) _ to declare a walkaway.
</P>
<P>
   Walkaways virtually never occur, for one simple reason: Unless
an award is outrageously high, to the point of being punitive, a
club is far wiser to trade the player and at least receive
something, if only a draft pick, in return.
</P>
<P>
   What will the Bruins do with Khristich? In all likelihood,
they'll keep him. Remember, two other forwards, Montreal's Mark
Recchi and St. Louis's Pierre Turgeon, received huge awards last
week. Recchi got $4.5 million and Turgeon $4.65 million. Khristich
for less than 50 cents on the dollar is a relative bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put it that way, I suppose it's true,'' said
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``We haven't made a final
decision, but right now we're leaning toward having Khristich back.
I don't want anyone to get the idea we're crying about these
decisions. It's business. We accept that and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas's agent, Jay Fee, whose highest-profile Bruin over the
years was Cam Neely, said he felt he had no option but to go to
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue in our minds was the two-way,'' said Fee, who,
along with Bruin Hall of Famer Bobby Orr, continues to build a long
NHL client list at Boston-based Woolf and Associates. ``When it was
clear they didn't want to change their stance there, we felt
arbitration was the only way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will enter training camp with $3.775 million tied up
in their top three netminders: Carey ($2.3 million), Dafoe
($850,000), and Tallas ($625,000). It's pricey, but remember, the
Sabres will pay Dominik Hasek $8 million for stopping the puck next
year. None of Boston's goalkeepers comes close to matching Hasek's
talent, but their bucks don't equal half of what the Dominator
makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited,'' said Tallas. ``We talked about it, sure, and
if the cards hadn't gone the way I'd wanted, I just would have gone
back again and have done the best I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this is great. I'll be in there in a couple of weeks,
fighting for the No. 1 job. And I hope I'm back in arbitration next
year, fighting for the money that goes with being a No. 1 goalie.

 &HT;    Viagra expected to get blame in rape

<P>
   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ A 70-year-old businessman charged with
raping a young employee goes before a judge here today, and
prosecutors are expected to say that Viagra made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   At an initial hearing last month, prosecutors charged that Keith
Roberts, who takes tourists on boat rides, sexually attacked the
27-year-old woman after swallowing a dose of the wonder drug.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth McLeod, who will represent Roberts at the preliminary
hearing, maintains that the whole thing is a set-up: ``My client is
being framed. The woman wants his money.''
</P>
<P>
   The case _ while certainly alarming to many Jamaicans _ hasn't
stirred as much surprise on this tropical island as one might
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Viagra are not yet legal in Jamaica, yet pharmacists
say they've been bombarded by Viagra-related questions from men _
some desperate, some merely curious. Black markets for Viagra have
sprung up throughout the Caribbean, with the light blue
diamond-shaped pill, manufactured by Pfizer Inc., selling like snow
cones in a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its popularity, many governments in the region are
pushing the anti-impotency drug through the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest is definitely here because many people are asking
for it,'' said Norma Inniss, president of the pharmacy board in the
twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. ``We're hoping to get
approval soon because everyone's talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, Trinidadian customs officials raided several
pharmacies and confiscated hundreds of Viagra pills being sold for
as much as $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in the United States last April, Viagra has become a
global phenomenon in just over four months. Prescription sales
indicate that as many as 3 million American men may have already
popped one of the so-called wonder pills, while Pfizer officials
expect worldwide approval of the drug by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has, in particular, aroused a lot of interest in the
Caribbean and in Latin America, where male virility is a highly
valued attribute. ``We expect the drug to do quite well in the
Caribbean and Latin America,'' said Pam Gemmel, a Pfizer
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials say Viagra doesn't cause men to act
aggressively and that it isn't an aphrodisiac, but that it
increases the flow of blood to the genitals.
</P>
<P>
   In South America, the sale of Viagra has been approved in
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. In late July,
Costa Rica became the first Central American country to approve
Viagra, which will be sold for about $11 a pill by prescription
only.

 &HT;    Children suffering from physical, mental wounds in bomb
aftermath
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The stitches run from just under David Maina's
right ear down under his chin. Surgeons have used bone from his
ribs to replace his jaw, which was blown off in the terrorist
attack on the U.S. embassy nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He's 13 years old. He's in pain. And still his parents haven't
come.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few children were injured physically when the bomb
exploded in downtown Nairobi on Aug. 7. The buildings that bore the
brunt of the blast were office buildings: a bank, a secretarial
school, the embassy. Most of the people injured or killed were
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one question echoing through Nairobi this week is: Who
will heal the children?
</P>
<P>
   For, as David Maina could painfully tell you, not all injuries
are physical. And many children in Nairobi have suffered deep
psychological wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lupita Nyong'o is 15, and she was nowhere near the embassy when
the bomb exploded. Yet this week, her parents brought her to the
site of the carnage to look, to weep and to grieve.
</P>
<P>
   Lupita's friend and classmate, Gloria Mtuiri, who was 16, died
here. So did Gloria's sister, Caroline, who was 17. So did Lupita's
teacher, Mutegi Njiru.
</P>
<P>
   As Lupita stood and looked at the rubble, thoughts of her
friends flooded in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep wondering exactly where they were,'' she said. ''I keep
wondering if they died at once.''
</P>
<P>
   She wondered, too, how school would be without her teacher. And
she remembered the play she and Gloria acted in together. It was
about heaven's gates and hell's fire.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria played an angel.
</P>
<P>
   Lupita is by no means alone in her tortured thoughts. Most of
the more than 200 Kenyan adults who died in the bombing, as well as
the 4,000 or so who were injured, were presumbably related to
children. Families seeking counseling have overwhelmed the staff at
Kenyatta National Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margaret Makanyengo, who as chief of the hospital's mental
health department supervises about 100 counselors, worries about
the children. She spent part of last week trying quickly to train
her staff to treat post-traumatic stress syndrome. Kenya is
normally so peaceful that the syndrome is virtually unknown here.
And counselors are so busy they have not had time to consult their
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Makanyengo would like help for the children, if possible, from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need more child psychologists, perhaps, to come and and
help us start an intervention program,'' she said. ''That is what
we need right now, because we have no experience in this type of
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   She fears that Nairobi's children, left untreated, will in the
future develop problems such as depression, truancy, irrational
anger and drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   She is not the only one concerned. A member of parliament,
Waithaka Mwangi, proposed this week that a portion of a bomb
disaster fund being developed be used to educate the newly
orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims in the secretarial college, Mwangi said,
were single mothers. Their children have no one to care for them
now.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond even the issues of care and education are the attempts of
children to make sense of a disaster that came with no warning and
destroyed so much. All week, parents have been bringing their
children to look at the bomb site because their children have seen
violence only on movies.
</P>
<P>
   Children have to know, said Dorothy Nyong'o, Lupita's mother,
that this is different. ''It needs to be real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lupita's 10-year-old sister, Esperanza, looked quietly at the
devastated buildings. All bombs should be illegal, she said, and a
tear slid down her nose.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are you crying?'' asked her brother, Peter, who is 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lupita walked toward a mound of flowers people had left at the
foot of the bombed-out buildings. Her mother quietly joined her.
They hugged each other. Lupita cried and her mother wiped the tears
from her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   No family members brush the tears from David Maina's cheeks. He
lies alone in Kenyatta National Hospital, having had one operation
to replace his jaw and facing many more.
</P>
<P>
   He was riding a public bus, on his way home from a boarding
school in Nairobi, when the bomb exploded. His father, who lives in
the Rift Valley about 50 miles away, has been notified, doctors
say, but no one from David's family has come to the hospital yet.
No one has any explanation.
</P>
<P>
   David's tongue protrudes awkwardly from the space where his lips
ought to be. His throat hurts him so much that sometimes he cries
out in pain. He misses his mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he's going to be OK.

   MICROSOFT-RULING (Undated) Microsoft urged a federal appeals
court Monday not to allow the public to watch the government's
upcoming pre-trial interviews with Bill Gates, saying it would
create a ``carnival atmosphere.'' The company is appealing a
judge's order last week opening the depositions of Gates and other
executives in the government's antitrust case.The judge, who later
refused to reconsider his decision, cited an 85-year-old law that
requires such interviews be opened in antitrust trials.It was
unclear exactly when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia might make its decision, but a ruling was expected early
this week.

EASING THE WAY ON TWO WHEELS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUE HALPERN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeing the world from the seat of a bike has always appealed to
a certain kind of traveler, but advances in technology have opened
the road to the less rugged, even the less rugged toting children.
</P>
<P>
   When my daughter turned 4, we got her a bike: a metallic blue
two-wheeler with an alligator horn that seemed to signal the end,
for a while, of our days riding en famille. Before she had her own
bike, she would perch in a molded plastic seat that attached to the
rack of my bike or my husband's. That seat went up the East Coast
and down, and out West more than once. It made bike touring with a
small child possible, and it was a sad day when she outgrew it.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I found one day in Tahoe City when I was looking
longingly at a rack of rental bikes and noticed among them an
ungainly contraption called an Alley Cat _ a one-wheeled cycle with
handlebars, a seat and an extremely long, horizontally curved front
end _ bike touring with a child not yet strong enough to power her
own craft is still an option.
</P>
<P>
   We rented the Alley Cat. (We were lucky it was available; we
hadn't called in advance to reserve it, which is advisable as such
instant tandems can be hard to come by.) We attached it to the seat
post of the mountain bike my husband chose to ride, and suddenly we
were looking at a kid-friendly tandem.
</P>
<P>
   My four-year-old climbed on _ her feet just reached the pedals _
and off we went on an impromptu 15-miler to Squaw Valley and
beyond. That was a few hundred miles ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are three Mongoose Alley Cat models: the Shadow ($170),
with a 20-inch wheel; the Shadow II ($200), which is the same as
the Shadow but has a folding front mount that makes it easier to
transport, and the Speedy ($270), a six-speed cycle with grip
shifters, a 24-inch alloy wheel and the folding mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford it, the Speedy is the way to go. It's the most
versatile of the three, more likely to hold a child's interest as
she gets older, and ultimately more suited for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The Alley Cat is recommended for ages 5 to 12, up to 80 pounds.
L.L. Bean, (800) 221-4221, sells the Alley Cat, as do many bike
shops. Mongoose, a division of Brunswick Bicycles, (800) 257-0662,
makes them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though attaching half a bike and carrying a passenger adds
significantly to the lead rider's freight, the weight is offset by
the fact that the passenger is pedaling. Poundage, which is a
serious bicyclist's nemesis, is a given for the bike tourer, who
may carry clothes, shelter and food along for the ride. But there
are easy ways to lighten the load _ products that make traveling by
bike a comfortable way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when a couple of friends and I went up to Vermont's
Northeast Kingdom to ride for a week, we took a bulky, 20-pound
tent that could barely fit on a bike rack. When we finally got it
strapped securely, it was so heavy it threatened to topple the
bike.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the trip, after an all-night downpour that
soaked our bivouac, we retired the tent and checked in to a rustic
inn, defeated by our equipment. Never again. Lately I've been
packing Sierra Design's Clip 3 CD tent ($249); (800) 635-0461. At
just over four pounds, it is one of the lightest three-person tents
on the market. It is simple to set up and take down, airy and
durable. It also comes in a two-person version, the Clip Flashlight
CD ($185).
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a tent and a sleeping bag are carried on a rack that
also supports a set of panniers like Mountain Smith's roomy,
thoughtfully designed Paragon ($130); (800) 426-4075. Clothes and
other gear go into the panniers, which can add 30 or more pounds to
your bicycle. (For long trips it's often necessary to have a set of
panniers in the front and a pair in the back.)
</P>
<P>
   But not all bikes can take racks _ mountain bikes with full
suspension systems, in particular, are unable to accommodate them _
and not everybody likes the feel of a packed bike.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a Yak trailer, a 12-pound device that rides
low to the ground behind your bike, looks like a scooter and
enables you to lug up to 70 pounds of stuff off road and on. The
Yak, which is made by BOB Trailers, (800) 893-2447, takes some
serious engineering time to assemble, but once that's done, the
trailer connects (and disconnects) in about the same time it takes
to recite BOB's corporate mantra: ``Question internal combustion.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Yak, at $265, is not cheap, the cost is comparable to
two sets of panniers and two racks, and it comes with its own
safety flag.
</P>
<P>
   Safety, which is always an issue when you are sharing the road
with cars and trucks, is even more of a consideration when you are
navigating in unfamiliar places. Helmets are crucial, of course,
and recent innovations in helmet construction have made them both
more protective and less onerous to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Giro's new Boreas helmet ($150), (800) 294-6098, for instance,
which was developed for Tour de France cyclists last year, has 22
vents to keep the air circulating. All those holes do not
compromise the helmet's structural integrity, though they do make
it look like Swiss cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Pricey as it is, the Boreas is considerably less expensive than
a neurologist. Still, even a helmet as well made as the Boreas
won't protect you if it does not fit properly. Make sure to have
your helmet fitted before you leave the store where you buy or rent
it.
</P>
<P>
   Many helmets like this one or Bell Sports' more moderately
priced Image Pro, $65, have excellent but complicated retention
straps that are best adjusted at a bike shop.
</P>
<P>
   Not all road shock comes when you fall off your bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   An average stretch of asphalt or macadam sends plenty of
unpleasant jolts through your arms to your shoulders and up your
spine. Padded gel gloves help somewhat, and bikes with front or
rear shocks help a lot, but most road bikes don't come with these.
</P>
<P>
   Softride, which makes bikes without seat posts to reduce spinal
shock, now makes an impact-absorbing stem (the part that connects
the handlebars to the frame). The Softride Stem ($100 to $330),
(800) 557-6387, which has a big spring inside of it, replaces your
pre-existing stem _ an easy operation that can be done by a bike
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's in place, the handlebar remains level while the stem
travels, taking in the bumps and jostles of the road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On that trip through Vermont, one of my friends got a flat, and
no one had a pump that would fit his tire valves. (His valves were
Presta, ours were Schrader.) We should have been carrying a
minipump like Blackburn's Air Stik ($25), (800) 456-2355, which
fits both valve types and inflates on the push and pull strokes.
</P>
<P>
   We also should have been riding on Kevlar tires. The Bike
Nashbar catalog compares specs on an extensive inventory of tires,
(800) 627-4227. Kevlar, which is extremely lightweight, is
remarkably tough; it's what bulletproof vests are made of. It may
be overkill, but it also may keep you from standing on the side of
the road in a storm as we did, with a friend who has lost his ride.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   British Chic at Saks
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue has invited the British to invade New York,
and 25 fashion designers and an equal number of artists have agreed
to storm the store on Sept. 9. A party that night to benefit the
Rainforest Foundation and the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund will
celebrate the influence that contemporary London is having on
fashion, art and music.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, and his wife have lent
their names as honorary chairman and chairwoman. There will be
entertainment throughout the store, and the Met Bar from London's
trendy Metropolitan Hotel will be recreated on the second floor,
complete with its signature red banquettes and 10 bartenders flown
in to mix martinis.
</P>
<P>
   The event is part of a weeklong promotion of British chic that
Saks is calling ``British Invasion, Part II,'' figuring that the
Carnaby Street-Mary Quant-Biba-Twiggy 1960s was the first British
invasion. (Historians might disagree.)
</P>
<P>
   This invasion will feature personal appearances by designers,
with video images flashed on a round wall in the fragrance area, an
exhibition of David Bailey's current and vintage photographs and
fashion mannequins displaying current styles in the store's 35
windows and perched on ledges on the main floor.
</P>
<P>
   Designers expected to attend include Alexander McQueen, Antonio
Berardi, Hussein Chalayan, Stephen Jones, Philip Treacy, Julien
MacDonald and Lainey Keogh. They are among the raft of British
designers whom the store has been carrying. Virginia Antiques, a
vintage couture shop on London's Portland Road, will set up a
temporary outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the event has been percolating for two years, said
Philip B. Miller, the chairman and chief executive of Saks Holdings
Inc. ``We were going to the London Markets and saw a lot of newness
and vitality that we hadn't seen in recent years,'' he said. ``We
wanted to be the first store in America to present in a cogent,
intelligent way a host of British designers, artists and people in
the music world. It's a celebration of their creativity, as
complete a statement as has been made anywhere about contemporary
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting a country's products to help develop business is
something that Bloomingdale's pioneered in the 1970s with a series
of parties and storewide displays featuring the wares of countries
like France, Italy, China, Israel, Russia, Ireland and, of course,
Britain. It worked then.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On-Line Trade Show &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The trade show is going on line. Instead of traipsing through
miles of aisles at a convention center, store buyers will be able
to simply click on to the Internet to see fashion designers' and
manufacturers' offerings through an online trade show called
Fashion Millennia. It should be fully functional by September, said
its organizer, Joanne Roaman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roaman, who runs her own buying office in New York,
explained that there would be no fee to retailers to browse Fashion
Millennia but that manufacturers would pay for a Web site to be
operable for three months. The sites will be designed to individual
specifications with still or moving images. She said that each site
would be password-secured so that the only people with access would
be those given passwords by manufacturers. There will be order pads
on the computer to allow buyers to e-mail orders, if they desire.
</P>
<P>
   The concept seems to be of value mainly to small design houses
that don't put on fashion shows, offering them a forum to be seen
by buyers unfamiliar with their lines. Among the designers who have
already signed up are Felicia Ferrar, Antonio Garcia, Lisa Leonard
and Lisandro Sarasola.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could also be of value to stores that haven't seen a
line,'' Ms. Roaman said. ``This can give them a quick look without
their having to go to a showroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Millennia's Web site address is
www.fashionmillennia.com.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ White sand, white beach mats and umbrellas, white
towels hanging on hooks, models lolling in white swimsuits _ it
might have been a magazine spread, but it wasn't. It wasn't even on
a beach. It was in Calvin Klein's Seventh Avenue showroom: the
designer's way of displaying his new swimsuit line for the cruise
1999 season. And anyone who was interested in the latest swimwear
trends would find most of them there, starting with white.
</P>
<P>
   There was also an emphasis on gray, fashion's favorite color of
the moment but one that may be a hard sell for swimsuits. As chic
as gray is, it doesn't compliment most skin tones, tanned or
otherwise. Still, many designers insisted on showing gray in
swimwear collections in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise is the most important season for swimwear because the
suits are in stores for more than six months, starting in October,
and account for the greatest percentage of swimwear sales. Women
heading for local beaches or backyard pools next summer will find
essentially the same choices as those who go south in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swimwear is very important,'' said Nicole Fischelis, the
fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. ``It's a department we have
all year long. Our cruise catalog will have 25 pages of
beachwear.''
</P>
<P>
   American swimwear manufacturers and designers have been showing
their cruise '99 collections to retailers in Miami and New York for
a month, usually in showrooms but occasionally on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Besides white and gray, the Klein collection had black, brown,
khaki, dark purple, royal blue, aqua and silver. A shiny, wet-look
silver was an unexpected dip into glitz for a designer known for
restraint, who concentrates on tasteful solid colors, rather than
the floral prints so popular in the mass market. The Klein suits
can be daring in cut, however. There are bikinis, and there is a
one-piece suit whose midriff is cut out to give the effect of a
bikini. Some suits are reversible, turning from khaki to aqua or
brown to purple.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the collection consists of variations on the classic
tank suit, including high-necked versions, some with side-slit
miniskirts as coverups. But the one style that most represents the
new season is what designers have dubbed the tankini.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone shopping for a swimsuit next season will find many
versions of the tankini, which has a camisolelike top that extends
to the waist or lower, and a bikini bottom. The top covers the
midriff but can be folded or pulled up to bare more skin. Both
manufacturers and retailers expect the tankini to be a hit with
what they call the missy customer, one beyond her 20s, who may want
a bit of coverage. But it also showed up in collections for the
young, like Oscar de la Renta's Oscar line, Nautica, Jantzen, Baja
Blue and Backflips.
</P>
<P>
   Swimwear also reflects ready-to-wear trends. Right now, that
means layering with sheerness, stretch lace, crochet,
embellishments like embroidery and beadwork, burnout fabrics,
textured surfaces, matte metallics and athletic influences seen in
color blocking, contrast piping, belts and zippers. These will all
be represented when the new styles trickle into stores like waves
lapping at the shore. Florida gets the first shipments, in October.
New York comes next, and then the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo, which is known for sleek, unconstructed swimsuits
designed for athletes, has added a group with inner construction
for women who need a little help. The new line is styled much like
the classic Speedos with racer backs and color blocking, but legs
are not so high cut.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum are sexy unlined suits by
European houses like Missoni, Moschino, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Herve
Leger, Fendi and Tomas Maier.
</P>
<P>
   It's Maier's first collection under his own name and is creating
a wave of excitement in fashion circles. The Paris-based designer,
who was formerly responsible for Hermes swimwear, will be shipping
his suits in October to a limited number of stores in the United
States, including Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a fabric that is light but has a lot of stretch. His
bikinis are very tiny and have matching shorts or skirts to wear as
coverups. His trademark is adjustable shirring at the side of suits
or skirts that can be pulled up to expose more skin _ a detail that
is certain to influence other designers in coming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Maier has even managed to design skirted suits that a young
woman would wear without feeling or looking like her mother. One
has a single shoulder strap and an asymmetrical skirt with shirring
at one side. Another has a very low back crossed by a thin strap
and a skirt slit at both sides over a quite skimpy panty. His
colors are primarily black and white, with accents of orange and
turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has great hopes for the 1999 season; this year has
been a disappointment. Although final sales figures cannot be
tallied until the season officially ends at the end of September,
El Nino adversely affected sales, said Dan Hunt, the marketing
manager of swimwear for Du Pont. Du Pont doesn't make swimwear, but
it keeps a steady eye on sales because it does make the nylon and
spandex fibers that mills turn into swimsuit fabrics. Retail sales
for the 1997 season were $1.4 billion, about 6 percent higher than
for 1996, he said. He anticipated no increase in 1998's sales
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-eight got off to a bad start because of El Nino,'' Hunt
said. ``Manufacturers quit producing when the season got off to a
slow start, so they should be sold out by the end of September,
when it's over. Inventories will be cleaned out, so we expect good
news in 1999.''

BOND INVESTORS CAUTIOUS IN ADVANCE OF FED MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices ended slightly lower Monday,
while shorter maturities edged higher, as investors grew more
concerned about the economic situations of Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were also cautious in advance of Tuesday's meeting of
Federal Reserve Board policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32,
to a price of 99 13/32, leaving the bond's yield at 5.54 percent,
unchanged from Friday. The price of the two-year note rose 1/32, to
100 4/32, for a yield of 5.31 percent, also unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's decision to float the ruble, effectively devaluing it
by a third against the dollar, bolstered the Treasury market as
investors moved from the riskier debt of emerging markets to the
relative safety of U.S. and European securities.
</P>
<P>
   Should such a so-called flight to quality continue, some
Treasury market analysts said, bond yields could fall as low as 5
percent, while the yield on a two-year note might fall by a full
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Most market participants expect no change in interest rates to
come from Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,
the Fed's rate-setting panel. But some analysts and traders are
looking for the central bank to change its bias toward raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers, said Scott Grannis, director and chief
economist at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, Calif.,
``should first pat themselves on the back for a job well done,
because inflation is truly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next they should start to worry, because there are increasing
signs that they have stepped on the monetary brakes too long and
too hard,'' Grannis said. ``If they don't step on the gas pretty
soon, the U.S. economy may be in danger of following Asia into a
recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said it was time the Fed began lowering short-term
rates, to relieve the deflationary pressure felt by commodity
producers, and reduce the dollar's strength against other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury sold $13 billion of new
three-month and six-month bills Monday in its regular weekly
auction.

NIKKEI DROPS ON UNCERTAINTY ON WALL STREET AND IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The stock market fell sharply and flirted with the
year's lows on Monday, pressured by the wobbliness on Wall Street
last week and an expanding global economic upheaval that is now
ravaging Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Further pressuring the market was the persistent fear that the
Japanese government will fail to overcome the country's banking
crisis and a renewed concern about the impact of Asia's troubles on
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Nikkei Stock Average sank below this year's
low of 14,664.44 before rebounding slightly to close at 14,794.66,
down 329.27 points, or 2.18 percent, from Friday. It was the lowest
closing level in two months.
</P>
<P>
   The yen, which hit an eight-year low of 147.35 to the dollar
last Tuesday before a mild rebound to 146.35 yen by the weekend,
fell to 146.45 to the dollar in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders said the weakness on Wall Street last week
contributed to the selling mood in Tokyo. Others said the deepening
crisis in Russia also weighed on the Japanese markets. Although
Japanese financial institutions have relatively little exposure in
Russia, the problems there reinforced a sense that the economic
malaise born in Asia more than a year ago is spreading. Russia's
decision to devalue the ruble came after the Japanese financial
markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, Japanese stock market events are out of the
Japanese government's control,'' said Pelham Smithers, chief
strategist at ING Barings in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Except for its ``price-keeping operations,'' in which the
government sometimes buys shares to strengthen the market, it has
few tools for restoring confidence at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It has already announced tax cuts and extensive public works
programs in hopes of goading the economy into recovery and
restoring investor confidence, and it is currently wrangling in
Parliament with the opposition parties over legislation to overhaul
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   But those measures seem to have done little to ease investors
concerns. Banking stocks have been among the hardest hit in the
selloffs that began in June and keep pushing the Nikkei toward its
lowest level since the ``bubble'' economy collapsed in 1990. That
was hit on Aug. 18, 1992, when the Nikkei sank to 14,309.41.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists worry that if the average penetrates that level, it
will have difficulty finding a new floor. Banking stocks tested
decade-old lows about two weeks ago, according to Craig Chudler,
equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo, and have had
trouble regaining their footing since.
</P>
<P>
   But Chudler also said that if the Nikkei dropped under its
post-bubble low, Japanese politicians might finally realize the
extent of the crisis. ``A Nikkei below 14,500 is far better than
having a U.S. politician or bureaucrat yelling at Japan about what
it should be doing,'' he said. ``The government will panic if that
happens, and maybe that's what's needed.''

JIM MURRAY: A DEITY AMONG SPORTSWRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Times sports columnist Jim Murray died of a heart
attack late Sunday night at the age of 78, and dozens of wannabes
like myself spent Monday trying to describe Jim, and explain what
he meant to the world of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad we didn't have Jim Murray around to do what he always
did _ write the story better than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of those folks who love the sports pages, you
should know about Jim Murray. He was the ranking god of American
sportswriters, and pity the poor New Englander who never got to
read him. Around these parts, the closest thing we ever had to Jim
was the late, great Ray Fitzgerald, who died too young in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Jim grew up in Hartford, Conn., went to Trinity, and got his
first newspaper job as a campus correspondent for the Hartford
Times. He went to Time magazine in 1948 and was one of the original
writers for a startup magazine called Sports Illustrated in 1953.
He began his column for the LA Times in 1961 and won the Pulitzer
Prize for commentary in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Only Jim could go to the Indianapolis 500 and write,
``Gentlemen, start your coffins!'' Only Jim could look at the folks
from Iowa, in town for the Rose Bowl, and describe them as
``thousands of people in calico and John Deere caps in their
Winnebagos with their pacemakers and potato salad looking around
for Bob Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray was hilarious, fair, never preachy. He sought to
entertain and usually succeeded. He was strong, humble, helpful,
and kind to young writers who wanted to be like him. He loathed
self-importance. As one who dedicated his life to the same
profession, I was honored to speak with Jim, occasionally share a
World Series flight, ask questions, and listen to his stories.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 24 years old I was on a writer's charter from New
York to Los Angeles and remember Jim worrying that he was going
blind as we flew west. It turned out Jim did lose his sight for
several years, but even when he couldn't see, Jim Murray described
the action better than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   I called Jim to get a Larry Bird anecdote in 1993. Murray
covered the pulsating Celtic-Lakers Finals of 1984, '85, and '87,
but this was his favorite Bird story: ``The one thing I remember is
Barcelona (1992 Olympics). I decided one day to go out to watch a
baseball game, and it was a long trip. You had to go by train, then
bus, then metro. I get there and who do I see standing in line but
Larry Bird? And he was way back in line, like the 55th guy, just
standing there waiting to get in like everyone else. I thought that
was pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Jim. He could see the ordinary and make it
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the World Series in 1995, I encountered Jim at
Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta. Seizing the moment, I went to the
airport bookstore, bought's Jim's autobiography, and asked him to
sign it as we waited at the gate. I felt like Archibald
``Moonlight'' Graham (one game in the big leagues) getting an
autograph from Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   From Jim's autobiography:
</P>
<P>
   _``I knew one thing no athlete could have was imagination. If he
thought what was at stake he could never catch that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Tommy (Lasorda) never talked, he shouted. He always managed
to sound as if the building were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Managing or general-managing a baseball team is probably the
easiest thing to do in our society next to being a guard at a
railroad crossing where two trains a week come through.''
</P>
<P>
   _``A column is more than a demanding mistress. It is a raging
master. It consumes you. It is insatiable. It becomes more than
you. You are not a person, you are a publicly owned facility.
Available on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim had stories that we could only imagine. When he was Time's
cinema correspondent in the 1950s, he interviewed and wrote stories
about John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart. He also pitched an idea for a
profile of an upcoming actress named Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Jim took Marilyn to a restaurant on Sunset Strip, had dinner,
and conducted his interview. Late in the evening, she asked if it
would be OK if she went home with someone else who was in the
restaurant. She introduced Jim to Joe DiMaggio. Joe D. went home
with Marilyn and Jim went home and wrote his story.
</P>
<P>
   Jim was a columnist to the finish. Last Saturday, he covered the
Pacific Classic horse race and wrote about the comeback victory of
Free House at the Del Mar rack. The veteran horse was a long shot
and Jim concluded, ``It's nice to know getting older has its flip
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The story ran Sunday morning and Jim died that night, his byline
etched on newspapers still resting on coffee tables and kitchen
counters throughout Greater Los Angeles.

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Three years ago, Nancy Wright was struggling
to hold body and soul and two children together on the $237 she
received in her monthly welfare check, supplemented by $187 worth
of food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Wright, 35, is earning almost $1,400 a month as
a supervisor at a fiberglass plant. Though hardly affluent, she can
afford to take her children out for a night on the town. She has
bought a car, and she just returned with her two sons from a week's
vacation in Atlantic City and New York _ the first time she had
left North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to buy them clothes and school supples,'' she said,
rattling off the benefits of her new-found prosperity. ``I can take
them out to get something to eat or go to the movies. I've
accomplished a whole lot since I started working.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright's brightening fortunes are part of a little-noticed
phenomenon among single black female heads of households. Long at
the bottom of the economic scale, these women have seen their
income rise sharply in recent years, pushed by a strong economy,
tight labor market, increases in the minimum wage, more stringent
welfare eligibility requirements and government training programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the latest year for which complete data are available,
the median income for this group was $15,530, a jump of more than
21 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars from the $12,765 the women
brought home in 1993, according to Census Bureau data.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department figures for single black female heads of
families, a slightly different category because it includes only
women with children, show a similar increase in income, rising to
$16,256 in 1996 from $13,489 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes for these women are rising faster than nearly any other
demographic group in the country, in part because they are starting
from such a low base. The median income for white households
(including married, living alone, or single parent) is $47,023. And
a median income of $15,000 still leaves single black female heads
of households squarely in the ranks of the working poor. But the
increases come after two decades when their income barely increased
or even declined. From 1969 to 1993, their medium income fell by
more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that their income is improving is a sign of how much
the benefits of the economic recovery are cascading down to groups
on lower rungs of the economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing much better than they have in years,'' said
Edward Montgomery, chief economist at the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the recent increases in the minimum wage, which
rose to $4.75 from $4.25 in 1996 and rose again to $5.15 last
September. Economists say the bulk of single black mothers are
hourly workers, so an increase in the minimum wage helped boost
their income.
</P>
<P>
   But even without a federally mandated increase in the hourly
minimum wage, these women would still be benefiting from the strong
economy, which is especially robust here in Charlotte, where the
unemployment is less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With such a strong economy, Labor Department data show that
incomes at the bottom of the wage scale have begun to rise even
more sharply than those at the top, seemingly reversing decades of
rising income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to call it a trend in terms of reversing income
inequality,'' said Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman. ``But there is
no question we are heading in a positive direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being pulled into the job market by rising wages,
many of these women are being pushed there by efforts to reform the
welfare system. In 1995 North Carolina received waivers from the
Clinton Administration allowing it to require welfare beneficiaries
to undergo job training. A year later, the state received
permission to set a two-year time limit for a family to receive
cash assistance and to decline to raise welfare payments if a
recipient had another child 10 months after going on the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Since the changes, North Carolina's welfare rolls have dropped
to 65,873 families this past June, from 113,485 in June 1995.
Because about 65 percent of the families on welfare in the state
are black, in 1995 and this year, and because about 60,000 people
who have left the rolls have gotten jobs, single black mothers have
been major beneficiaries of the policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman also said that new Labor Department studies show that
1.7 million people nationally were working last year who were on
welfare in 1996, though she did not say how many of these people
were unmarried black females who are heads of households.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For some, like Sherry Thomas, government training programs made
a huge difference. Divorced in 1992, on welfare and living in
public housing two years later, Ms. Thomas re-entered the work
force through the Job Training partnership Act. The program paid
her tuition at a junior college, covered the day care costs for her
three children and paid her rent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely that was my bridge to standing on my own and not
having to continually depend on the system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two years after subsisting on $278 a month from Aid to
Families with Dependent Children and another $350 in food stamps,
Ms. Thomas is a computer programmer, earning ``in the $30,000
range.'' She has also started a business designing Web sites and
has bought a four-bedroom split-level house.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worrying about addicts and gunfire outside her door,
she now savors the crepe myrtles bursting with pink flowers in her
front yard, and the two apple trees, their branches heavy with
fruit growing out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have bills and everything, but I'm raising my kids in
a better environment, which is something I always wanted to do.''

ANNE SWEENEY NAMED PRESIDENT OF ABC CABLE NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Sweeney was named president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks on
Monday, in an appointment that had been expected ever since her
mentor, Geraldine Laybourne, resigned from the position in May. Ms.
Sweeney had been executive vice president of the division for two
years, reporting to Ms. Laybourne, as well as president of the
Disney Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In her new position, which makes her the highest-ranking woman
in the cable industry, Ms. Sweeney will oversee all of ABC's cable
interests except in sports. They include half-ownership of the
Lifetime network and slightly smaller interests in A&AMP;E, the History
Channel and E! Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   She will also continue as president of the Disney Channel, one
of the fastest-growing basic cable networks, and its spinoff
channel, Toon Disney, and will oversee the ABC network's Saturday
morning children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is progressive when it comes to its cable
division,'' Ms. Sweeney said Monday. ``I expect to be looking at
new properties and at developing properties, as well as continuing
to manage the assets that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Disney/ABC in February 1996, Ms. Sweeney had been
chairwoman and chief executive of FX Networks Inc., a cable unit of
News Corp., since 1993. Before that she spent 12 years working in
various positions at Nickelodeon, when Ms. Laybourne was that
network's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anne's record at Disney Channel has been impressive, with
dramatic growth, breakthrough original kids' and family programming
and record high ratings,'' said Robert Iger, president of ABC,
which is a unit of Walt Disney Co. Ms. Sweeney will report to Iger.

ULSTER POLICE QUESTION FIVE IN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Five men, including the son of a
leader of the political wing of the group that is suspected of
planting the car bomb that killed 28 people and injured 200, were
arrested Monday for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Mackey, son of Omagh councilor Francie Mackey, was
arrested on the outskirts of this market town and taken to the
Castlereagh interrogation center in Belfast with four other men.
Under law, they can be held for questioning up to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Francie Mackey attended an emergency town council meeting Monday
morning and later emerged to say his group, the 32-County
Sovereignty Committee, had nothing to do with Saturday's bombing,
the worst atrocity in 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland.
Mackey also said his son was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, who works at the local hospital where most of the dead
and injured were taken, signed a book of condolences opened by the
council. He said the bombing was unjustified, but he refused to
condemn it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're back to the word game,'' he said. ``No amount of
words from me can alleviate the suffering of the bereaved and
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   High-ranking officials from the British and Irish governments
held a series of lengthy meetings to plot strategy on how to combat
the ``Real IRA,'' the breakaway group that is suspected of planting
the bomb that exploded amid an afternoon crowd of civilians, most
of them women and children doing back-to-school shopping.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, and Pat Byrne, commissioner of the Garda Siochana,
Ireland's national police force, British Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam and Irish Justice Minister John
O'Donoghue said they were prepared to act.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam and O'Donoghue, however, would not elaborate on their
plans, saying that would tip off the people they were aimed
against. Mowlam said the changes being considered would tighten
security at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic, and make it easier to convict someone of membership in an
illegal paramilitary organization.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, talked at length last night by telephone about a
security crackdown in wake of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But while the governments turned the heat up on the group they
believe perpetrated the atrocity, leaders of the Real IRA's
political wing, including Mackey and Bernadette Sands McKevitt,
denied involvement in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Sands McKevitt, who is the sister of the dead IRA icon Bobby
Sands, and the wife of Mickey McKevitt, the alleged leader of the
Real IRA, said Ahern was ``very irresponsible'' in accusing the
group of dissident republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern's government, however, remained unmoved by such
protestations of innocence and said it is considering introducing
internment of suspects without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Omagh, meanwhile, the human cost was still being
tallied. The first of dozens of funerals is scheduled to take place
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kells returned from his vacation to learn that nine of the
dead had died in his clothing shop because the car bomb was parked
in front of the store. One of his salesgirls bent down to retrieve
a pair of shoes from a bottom shelf at the very moment the bomb
exploded. The salesgirl was not seriously injured, but the body of
the woman she was serving was thrown on her by the force of the
blast.
</P>
<P>
   Police also disclosed that one of the dead was a 21-month-old
girl, Breda Devine, who was shopping for shoes with her mother to
be the flower girl in her uncle's wedding next Saturday. Her
mother, Tracey, is one of eight people who remain in critical
condition, among some 100 people still hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gallagher's brother, who served in the local militia,
was shot dead by the IRA 15 years ago. Monday, Gallagher was
preparing to bury his 21-year-old son, Adrian, killed Saturday by
the bomb when he went shopping for a pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son was raised to respect other people,'' Gallagher said.
``He was killed by those who weren't.''

VOL-PROTOUR (Los Angeles) _ The endless summer is a myth. When it
all started in the 1970s, accelerated in the '80s and skyrocketed
in the early '90s, those at the controls of volleyball saw only
upside and prosperty. They saw no sunset, no blustery autumn, no
cold winter on the horizon. The Association of Volleyball
Professionals is barely surviving, as seen by the fact that its
Miller Lite U.S. Championships, which concluded Sunday, plunged
from a $300,000 grand slam to a $50,000 tournament. Years of poor
management forced the Women's Professional Volleyball Association
to scrap its 12-year-old women's doubles tour and the American
Beach Volleyball League to disband its 7-year-old men's and women's
fours circuit this year. Both were overcome by debt. &QL;

GLF-ACADEMY (Los Angeles) _ Like thousands of U.S. servicemen at
the beginning of the decade, Randy Cardoza worried about his
future. After investing nine years in the Navy, budget cuts and
downsizing forced him to look for a new job. At 33, he was an
unemployed aviation electric technician with no real plan for the
rest of his life.Except that he wanted to play as much golf as
possible. Cardoza's love for golf convinced him to take a gamble
that, if it paid off, would allow him to accomplish two goals: find
a new career and satisfy his fondness for golf. Cardoza enrolled in
San Diego Golf Academy, a two-year golf management and
instructional college designed to prepare students for all facets
of the golf industry. &QL;

AMERICANS IN PAKISTAN URGED TO LEAVE, PROMPTING SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The U.S. Ambassador told an anxious
audience of some 150 Americans on Monday afternoon that a charter
plane would be arriving on Tuesday morning to evacuate dependents
of embassy employees and other Americans who wanted to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with a range of threats against Americans and
especially to American officials,'' Ambassador Thomas W. Simons Jr.
said, explaining why embassy families had been ordered to depart
and the State Department had urged all Americans ``to seriously
consider leaving Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was much skepticism among the audience about the
seriousness of the threat, the fact that a charter plane was coming
added to the tension among those faced with deciding whether to
uproot their families on the day the school year begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we leave we are jeopardizing our financial and professional
positions,'' said Kris Steinberg, a high school science teacher at
the International School here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make reservations but we're going to wait to
find out a little bit more,'' said his wife, Eli Abreu, a
seventh-grade science teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued its warning on Sunday, the day it
became widely known that the Pakistani authorities had sent a
suspect in the bombing of the American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam back to Kenya, where he was being interrogated by the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   One man in the audience asked Simons about rumors that the
United States was about to launch an attack on Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi-born millionaire who has pledged a holy war on the United
States, at bin Laden's base in Afghanistan, and thus wants to clear
Americans from neighboring Pakistan. The ambassador said he would
not comment on that.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly an hour, the Americans badgered Simons with
questions, often sounding like reporters trying to get an American
official to be more forthcoming with intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are strongly urged to leave, yet we don't know what we're
running from,'' said one woman, asking Simons if he could be more
specific. He said he could not. He suggested that Washington knew
more than he did.
</P>
<P>
   Simons made it clear, in response to questions, that the
decision to order an evacuation had been made in Washington. And
between his carefully chosen words, there were suggestions that
even Simons, a diplomat with more than 30 years' experience,
thought the State Department had overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This warning indicated to me that people are excited in
Washington,'' Simons said, eliciting mild laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Americans left the auditorium unconvinced and
unhappy. ``I've just gone to a meeting my government held and they
haven't given me one good reason why I should leave, yet they're
bringing in a charter flight to take people out,'' said Mark
Hausfeld, a 40-year-old father of three.

NEW POLITICAL, LEGAL WOES COULD BESET CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's grand jury testimony is over,
but his legal and political problems may just be beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, Clinton faces the prospect of perjury charges because
he testified seven months ago in a deposition that he did not have
an affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, in a report expected to be
sent to Congress, could also outline whether he believes Clinton
urged Lewinsky to lie about their relationship and obstructed
justice, which some Republicans consider an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, while Clinton held a remarkable 70 percent job
approval rating in one recent poll, the same poll shows the public
has a much lower view of his character, which could embolden some
Republicans to call for hearings that could result in new and
embarrassing revelations about the president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the coming months could be as exasperating for Clinton
as the year already has been. If Clinton's grand jury testimony
from Monday is released, as is eventually expected, there will be a
dissection of the president's words that could ignite new turmoil
about whether Clinton purposefully evaded the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide to what could come next:
</P>
<P>
   _Consequences of the president's changed story. This could be a
publicly painful look at how the president may have used linguistic
contortions to maintain he did not have ``sexual relations'' or an
``affair'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, sexual relations was defined as ``contact with
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any
person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's allies have said it is possible Clinton will
say his contact with Lewinsky fell outside the bounds of this
definition, suggesting that oral sex or some other activity didn't
fit this definition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political leaders as well as legal analysts disagree over
whether Clinton could have committed perjury in the Jones
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, who brought the impeachment trials of two federal
judges before the Senate in 1989, said he thinks Clinton probably
has some ``maneuvering room'' and can avoid facing perjury charges
stemming from the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably as a matter of law there is some legal gray area,''
said Baron, of the Boston law firm Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who is
pondering a 2000 presidential bid, said on CNN Monday that if
Clinton admits he lied in the Jones deposition, ``it should be the
basis for his resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some Republicans have asked how Clinton could say in
the Jones deposition that he couldn't remember meeting privately
with Lewinsky in the White House if he is now admitting to some
sort of inappropriate relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch of Utah said
Monday that if Clinton lied in the Jones deposition but told the
truth Monday, Hatch could accept Clinton's apology and would not
seek impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch warned that if other wrongdoing by Clinton is
discovered by Starr, or if Clinton lied to the grand jury, then
Hatch would support impeachment hearings. In any case, Hatch said,
``It sickens me'' that some Clinton backers have argued that
Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton was consensual. Hatch said
Congress may look at ``why did this happen'' and whether there is
an ``emotional'' problem that caused it, apparently referring to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _Report to Congress. While it has been expected for months that
Starr will deliver a report to the House, this action is more
serious than many people may realize. Starr is authorized to
deliver a report to Congress only if he thinks he has found grounds
for impeachment. Thus, the mere delivery of the report signifies
that Starr believes Congress should act against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   _Possible impeachment hearings. After the House receives Starr's
report, it has the authority to accept it, reject it, or hold its
own investigation. This could lead to months of hearings, including
the first public testimony from Lewinsky and others.
</P>
<P>
   _Possible indictment of others. If Starr finds that Clinton
conspired with others to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky or
another woman, Starr could seek indictment of those
co-conspirators. That information, however, would probably be
turned over to the special three-judge panel that oversees the
independent counsel. Those who might be indicted could seek
immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony against the
president, possibly at House hearings as well as before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   _Impeachment and aftermath. Most legal analysts said a sitting
president cannot be indicted, but instead would face judgment by
Congress. If the House recommends that Clinton be impeached, the
Senate would hold a trial. If the Senate convicts Clinton, then the
president would be forced out of office.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Baron said, Clinton would be an ordinary
citizen and could face indictment like anyone else. If things go
that far, Vice President Al Gore would become president and
inevitably would have to deal with the question of whether to
pardon Clinton for whatever charges he might face.
</P>
<P>
   _Political fallout. Having strongly insisted that he did not
have sexual relations with Lewinsky, Clinton has to reconcile his
changed explanation to his aides, his party, and the public.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hillary Rodham Clinton who said on Jan. 27 that it would
be ``a very serious offense'' if a president committed adultery and
lied about it. But, she added, ``that is not going to be proven
true.'' She maintained that the allegations against her husband
were being put forward by ``a vast right-wing conspiracy.''

THUMB TIP COULD LEAD TO DESIGNER ORGANS, DOCTORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thumb tip that doctors engineered and attached last week to
a Massachusetts man could point to much bigger things to come.
</P>
<P>
   If the thumb grows back as firmly and precisely as they hope,
doctors could soon be using a patient's own tissue to design
everything from jaws to windpipes, leg bones to ligaments.
Eventually, researchers predict, they will even grow new hearts and
livers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first instance of our growing an isolated bone or
virtually any other tissue,'' said Dr. Charles Vacanti, who oversaw
the procedure and runs the Center for Tissue Engineering at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. ``This
gives us the potential to predesign or preconfigure any tissue in
any shape, from bones to nervous tissues to liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langer, a professor of biomedical engineering at MIT and
a pioneer in tissue engineering, also was enthused: ``This is very
important, it's incredibly important. But at the same time we need
to see what happens over time with this patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you do something like this in a person, if it works
well, that's a milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's procedure is an outgrowth of work Langer and others
launched 15 years ago, when they began molding polymers into
scaffolds onto which living cells could be seeded. Growth factors
were then applied, causing the cells to multiply, fill in the
scaffold, and form a three-dimensional tissue structure that can be
implanted into the body, where it presumably will attach to blood
vessels and grow on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers a decade ago began using the technique to grow new
skin, and last spring the US Food and Drug Administration approved
the first off-the-shelf living skin to treat leg ulcers. The next
step, Langer and others say, is to show they can use a patient's
own cells to grow new cartilage and bone, and to do it not just to
fill in holes or defects, as they have been doing for years, but to
produce free-standing structures like a new ear, trachea or even
the tip of a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Vacanti has succeeded in doing all that _ in mice, rats, sheep,
rabbits and pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's two-hour operation was the first where he and his
associates tried their technique on a human. The patient,
36-year-old Raul Murcia, lost his thumb down to the first knuckle
in an accident seven weeks ago at the recycling company where he
works in Framingham, Mass. The surgeon who treated him sent to
UMass the inch-long severed segment of thumb, along with bone
membrane from Murcia's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The thumb segment proved too contaminated to work with, so
researchers harvested the cells from his arm, fed them nutrients
and kept them in an incubator, eventually turning a couple of
hundred cells into 30 million, which was how many they felt they
needed to reconstitute Murcia's thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 million cells were then suspended in a solution made of
seaweed, giving it a consistency of gelatin. A piece of sea coral,
which is biologically compatible with the bone membrane cells and
chemically similar to bone, had been cut to resemble the missing
thumb and tucked under the loose skin at the top of the severed
digit. The seaweed solution was injected into the coral, a
procedure that protected the solution while it hardened and ensured
it would grow in the shape of the missing thumb tip.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, Vacanti explained, the cells will
grow like any new bone, strengthening to the point where tendons
and ligaments can be hooked up and cartilage taken from behind
Murcia's ear can be attached. All that should take four months.
</P>
<P>
   Murcia was sporting a small bandage and a removable plastic cast
Monday, and was ``doing very well,'' said Cary Espinosa, who has
been acting as Murcia's interpreter while her husband serves as his
lawyer. The Guatemalan native, she added, is ``a very humble person
and he thinks this is too much attention on him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Michael Yaremchuk, a plastic surgeon at Massachusetts
General Hospital, thinks the attention will be well deserved if the
new thumb works. ``It's a big step forward,'' he said. ``Only a
small amount of bone was used but if it works it tells you there is
a potential to replace bigger bones.''

RUSSIAN RUBLE CRISIS TRIGGERS NEW JITTERS AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: UPDATES lede and 6th graf to note that Russia devalued its
ruble.)   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Recent nervousness in global markets stemming from fears
over the impending devaluation of the ruble is something new.
Russia has repeatedly teetered on the edge of economic ruin in the
years since the collapse of communism in 1991 without causing undue
international alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Except for its extensive mineral resources like natural gas,
Russia hasn't really been a player in the economic big leagues.
Most of its industrial products are inferior, if not downright
shoddy, and therefore uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the tribulations of President Boris Yeltsin's
regime have been greeted calmly abroad _ that is, until now.
</P>
<P>
   Last week as Russian markets plunged over the threat of
devaluation, foreign officials and investors reacted with evident
concern.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble nosedived, U.S. officials said they expected Russia
to survive its problems, and Yeltsin, declaring there was no
crisis, ordered his government to put a strict limit on how much
the currency would be allowed to fluctuate against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the government gave up and let the ruble slide by
about a third. Even before the devaluation, many financial
authorities were skeptical that the earlier artificially imposed
limit could be maintained for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it's different,'' said Paris-based Robert
Vishnogradov, a specialist on the Russian economy. ``The worry is
that further trouble in Russia might be enough to trigger worldwide
difficulties because major economies everywhere are currently
treading on thin ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's banking crisis, worsened by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's warning last week that his country faces a lengthy slump,
rumbles on. Nervousness has grown that Wall Street's recent losses
may foreshadow a bear market. European officials fear their own
hoped-for upturn may be submerged by a big drop on the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Russian economic disintegration could prove to be ``the drop of
water that causes the glass to overflow,'' Vishnogradov said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many analysts insisted that Russia's latest crisis is
mainly psychological, resulting from a general loss of confidence
in Yeltsin, Vishnogradov said there was little doubt the country's
financial system has ``broken down.'' He noted that ``the
government can't meet its bills and is unable to collect taxes
because people simply refuse to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia has continued to soak up foreign loans ``the
way blotting paper soaks up ink,'' he said, estimating that $30
billion from the International Monetary Fund and other sources has
``trickled away'' during the past three years. ``Nobody can really
say what has happened to the money,'' he added. ``It certainly
hasn't helped the national economy or stabilized government
finances.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little reason to fear bankruptcy, he contended, because
``Russia is already effectively bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations by unpaid workers have become a daily event in
Moscow. For some, unpaid wages go back as far as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Russia's industry have reverted to a primitive barter
economy. Last month, a company manufacturing combines sold five of
the harvesters to Bulgaria. The Bulgarians paid for them with a
shipment of 50,000 jars of dill pickles. Workers at the plant
received pickles, instead of rubles, as their back wages.

STORES TURN TO ELECTRONIC DEBITS FOR COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Next time you're asked to endorse a check, it might
not be by your bank.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a push to cut their losses on bad checks, some
retailers are asking check-paying customers for their John Hancock.
The wording varies, but customers are basically giving their OK, if
a check bounces, to electronic collection and the possible
automatic debit of any fees.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic collection, which is quicker and cheaper than
physically sending bounced checks back through the system, has been
around for a couple years but hasn't been widely used because there
were no guidelines, especially in the area of consumer protection,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some merchants that didn't want to start this
because there were no rules,'' said Chuck Floyd, vice president of
education for the American Clearing House Association's regional
office in Phoenix. The non-profit group clears checks for banks,
credit unions and other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The National Automated Clearing House Association developed
rules that go into effect on Sept. 18. In a nutshell, they require
merchants and others who accept checks to notify customers of any
electronic collection, or re-presentment, policy. With such a
policy, merchants who previously had to redeposit returned checks
and wait for them to clear _ again _ can now treat them like an
electronic check and have the amount directly debited from the
customer's account.
</P>
<P>
   For stores, the notice could be a sign posted on the counter;
for utilities, a reminder in the monthly bill. Those who plan to
electronically withdraw bounced-check fees from customers' bank
accounts must go a step further and get written permission from
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 Subway stores in Arizona owned by Phoenix-based Food 2000
Inc. have been using an electronic collection policy for a few
weeks. Clerks stamp the authorization form on the back of each
check, and ask customers to initial it. It reads: ``I understand
this store's check collection policy and authorize electronic
debits to my account in accordance with that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Rick Ueable says the new system is the only reason his
stores are accepting checks again after a two-year hiatus. They
stopped in 1996 because 20 percent of the checks customers wrote
bounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a terrible time collecting them,'' Ueable said.
</P>
<P>
   He said they'd send the returned checks back to the banks and,
when that didn't work, would call customers directly to ask them to
come in and make good on the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't fun,'' he said. ``It really eats up more of your
time than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Subway started taking credit cards instead of checks and even
with credit-card processing fees ``it was far cheaper than trying
to collect on bad checks,'' Ueable said.
</P>
<P>
   Ueable says it's too early to know if the electronic collection
system is cutting Subway's bad check losses.
</P>
<P>
   The national clearing house association estimates that
collection efforts could improve by 25 to 50 percent under
electronic collection. About 258 million of the 65 billion to 66
billion checks written every year bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a matter of reducing costs for the merchant because
they don't have to go through the whole paper process and run it
through the system,'' said Holly Merrill, executive director of the
ACHA in Phoenix. ``They can get their funds sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if there's no money in the customer's account, it
doesn't matter if the returned check is sent back manually or
electronically. So the program isn't targeting fraud as much as
bounced checks that result from lapses in checkbook math or an
ill-timed play on the float.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said there already are big success stories from electronic
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's Food and Drug Centers, which has been using an
electronic system for a couple years, has seen its bad check
write-offs fall to $1.8 million last year from $6 million in 1994,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways Smith's has used electronic collection to its
advantage is to time the resubmission of returned checks, Floyd
said.
</P>
<P>
   With paper checks, the retailer has no control over when they
are run through the account again. With electronic debits, which
are automatically posted the next day, they're more in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might say, `We're going to put them in so they hit on
payday.' '' &QL;

NEW RULES HELP BUSINESSES COLLECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Retailers and other businesses will be able to collect
on bad checks and fees electronically beginning next month under
new rules by the clearing house network used by banks and other
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Here, from the National Automated Clearing House Association,
are answers to some commonly asked questions:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does it mean if a store has an ``electronic
re-presentment'' policy?
</P>
<P>
   A: If your check is returned unpaid for nonsufficient funds, the
merchant can re-present the check electronically. This means an
electronic check transaction is posted to your account instead of
the actual check, which requires a lot of paper shuffling. For
merchants it means quicker collection of their money, assuming
check fraud isn't involved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's in it for me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your bad check clears more quickly (assuming this was a lapse
and your account has been replenished) than it would under the
traditional method, so your name will be quickly dropped from
bad-check writer lists many merchants subscribe to and you can
write checks without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What gives the store permission to electronically debit my
account?
</P>
<P>
   A: Merchants using electronic check collection are required to
provide notice to you before you write your check. As long as this
notice is provided, the merchant can process your bounced check
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can the merchant or billing company add a collection fee and
charge my account for the total of the check and the fee?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The merchant can only seek to recover the face amount of
the check. The company may charge your account for a collection fee
only if you have provided express written authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will my bank or credit union charge a fee for an electronic
check re-presentation?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's up to each financial institution. &QL;

TEXAS HEALTH COMMISSIONER TO STOP START-UP FUNDING FOR SCHOOL-BASED
CLINICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas health commissioner has decided to halt start-up
funding for school-based clinics, claiming they duplicate existing
facilities and force services such as family planning on
communities that do not want them.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Dr. William R. Archer III elicited shock and
dismay from advocates for the clinics that usually serve low-income
children with limited access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state's anti-abortion movement, meanwhile,
applauded the move as a blow for parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   The change is just one of many planned that will alter the face
of the Texas Department of Health, said Archer, an appointee of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he expects the health department to slowly get out
of providing health services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing any more Band-Aids,'' he said. ``I don't see it
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he realizes that the school clinic decision may draw
opposition, but he sees problems with the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, there are historical problems with school health
clinics because they have been viewed a means by which a central
force can come in and implement programs that the community does
not want,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he meant family planning, Archer said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am neither for or against school-based clinics,'' Archer
said. ``I am against duplication of services in a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a community itself values that (a school) as a site for
delivery of services and they want to build that as a medical
deliverer of service, they better look and say, `What are we
duplicating in the community that we might link with before we
invest a lot of money in a medical model for a school-based
clinic?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Barnett, chairman of the Texas Medical Association's
child and adolescent health committee, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it's a duplicative service is specious,'' Barnett said.
``People don't just set up school-based clinics willy-nilly. They
go through a needs-assessment process. They ask, `Is there a
population of children who do not have a medical home or who have
trouble accessing health care?' That's sort of the primary reason
you want to have a primary school-based system.''
</P>
<P>
   The school-based health clinic movement in Texas began to build
up steam about six years ago when the health department started
awarding start-up funding for such clinics in three-year grants of
as much as $125,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that there now are as many 125 clinics
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the health department, the most frequently used
services include minor injuries, health maintenance exams,
immunizations, ear infections, asthma, allergic ear, nose and
throat problems, eye disorders, respiratory infections and mental
health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Those clinics that have received grants previously will continue
to be paid during the term of their grants, but there will be no
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's move will affect mainly the development of new clinics,
particularly those in areas of the state where charitable funding
is scant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several school-based clinics are scattered throughout the
Houston area. Many began with charitable funds; others depended on
the state health department for seed money.
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson oversees operations at the eight clinics operated
by the Harris County Hospital District. Clinics at Jackson Middle
School in the Houston Independent School District and Smiley High
School in the North Forest ISD were started with state money, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't offer family planning or any reproductive services,''
Johnson said. ``We deal primarily with preventive health care and
treatment for minor acute problems such as ear infections.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Price, lobbyist for Texans United for Life, said he thinks
that many of those who are unhappy with the commissioner's decision
are those whose clinics received money.
</P>
<P>
   He said his group opposed school-based clinics because ``by law
you cannot prevent that clinic from abortion counseling and
referrals. You cannot prevent them from dispensing contraceptives
and prescription drugs to teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, however, said that getting out of funding school-based
clinics will be less controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come in and say the model (for the clinic) should be this
way, it doesn't matter what my position is. I'm going to offend
someone in the community, and I don't think that's my job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Institutes of Health are recommending
that state health department get out of providing health care
services entirely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be the safety net and to think that we are going to
have a voice compared to that Goliath over there and compete in
service delivery ... we will never make a difference,'' Archer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he knows that rural areas are a major concern, but
he said the department has funded only two rural clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are trying to do comprehensive care, why would we set
out to fund duplicative sets of facilities?'' he said. ``Should I
fund two more school-based health clinics in the state of Texas? I
don't think that's the best use of our funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Retta Knox, founder and leader of the school-based clinic in the
Panhandle town of Hart, received one of the first state grants. ``I
actually couldn't have started the clinic any other way,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most small school districts aren't going to gamble and don't
have the financial backing to put money into it,'' Knox said. ``The
start-up money allowed me to prove to them it was a worthwhile
project.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clinic is the only health care available in Hart, Knox said,
and it does not duplicate services.

 &HT;    Decades after `Playboy' heyday, playmate shows off again
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ There are a couple ways you could analyze
DeDe Lind.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's a middle-aged former pinup model angling for one
more grab at the glamour and notoriety she enjoyed as Playboy's
August 1967 Playmate.
</P>
<P>
   Or she could be someone who, at age 51, continues to make a
living exhibiting her abundant physical gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Just for fun, let's say it's the latter because, hey, it is a
lot more fun.
</P>
<P>
   That this beach-going, water-skiing, roller-skating, divorced
mother can relaunch her nude modeling career from her Boca Raton
condo at an age when most women are concerned with just keeping
body parts from sagging south, is enough to give aging Baby Boomers
a glimmer of hope. Or a pang of jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Lind sells _ by mail order _ pictures of herself in skimpy
lingerie or bathing suits or nothing at all. Videos shot in the
Cayman Islands and Key West show her posing and frolicking with her
mixed-breed dog, Tasha. The outfits and frilly lingerie she wears
are also for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole outlook is that I don't feel age is a big deal,''
says Lind, who has a few wrinkles that betray her years, but whose
tanned, toned body could qualify her as a senior lifeguard on
``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because I'm afraid of aging . . . I'm just vain,''
she said with a breathy giggle as she sat on the couch in her small
condominium. From her porch you can see a glassy Atlantic Ocean.
Piles of sea shells and pieces of coral collected from shoreline
strolls sit in bowls and trays or on the floor next to the wicker
furniture. She's the portrait of a grown-up beach girl, with her
beaded flip flops, low-cut sarong-style wrap dress and gold sand
dollar medallion hanging on a thin chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age is just a number for me,'' she says. Her age doesn't seem
to bother her fans, either.
</P>
<P>
   Lind still has a legion of followers who remember her first
Playboy photo layout. Wearing a pea-green bikini and a yellow bow
in her poofy blond hair, the photos struck a chord, especially with
soldiers overseas in Vietnam who adored her coquettish, homespun
quality. She wasn't glamorous or intimidatingly gorgeous. She was
cute, petite and approachable. (For the record: 34C-22-33. Turn
ons: Water skiing, horseback riding. Turn offs: Phony people.
Ambitions: To be healthy and happy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Playboy, saw it for the first time when I was
about 14 or 15,'' she said. ``I always wanted to be in Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the photos ran, more than 1,600 letters arrived at the
magazine from fans, most of whom begged for autographed pictures.
To this day, that total ranks Lind as one of the magazine's most
popular playmates ever, said Mary O'Connor, longtime personal
secretary and administrative assistant to Playboy publisher Hugh
Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's as sweet as could be, a girl's girl with a million and
one friends,'' O'Connor said. ``She's a typical Playmate. . . a
real girl next door with the ponytail and braids.''
</P>
<P>
   Playboy wasn't Lind's first modeling job. Discovered by a
photographer at 14 while at a public swimming pool in Burbank,
Calif., she posed for teen magazine covers and acted in commercials
and on The Donna Reed Show, The Rifleman, and Leave It To Beaver.
</P>
<P>
   She got pregnant and married right after graduating from high
school, had a baby at age 19 and was divorced by 20.
</P>
<P>
   A newly minted single mom who had to earn a living, she thought
of posing for Playboy. A photographer had shown pictures of her to
the magazine's editors when she was 17, but when they found out her
age, they told her to come back when she was older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty well developed for my age,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, she finally got her shot as the Playmate of the Month.
It wasn't easy _ she had never posed nude before and was shy about
doing so. But the photographer was easy to work with and made the
job easier.
</P>
<P>
   She married again after her 1967 centerfold ran and continued to
pose for occasional layouts and calendars, but her career cooled.
</P>
<P>
   On her 30th birthday, Lind broke down and cried, thinking her
career was over. ``Very few models other than, say, Cheryl Tiegs,
have much of a career after 30 or 35,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She dedicated herself to being a dutiful mother and housewife.
Lind later moved to Florida in 1984, and was divorced again in
1989. She worked as a restaurant hostess for a while, but it wasn't
until about four years ago that modeling re-entered her life.
</P>
<P>
   Lind rediscovered her fans when she was invited with other
Playmates to appear at a convention called Glamourcon (featuring
pinup art, Hollywood actresses and models).
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that after all this time people would pay
for an autograph,'' she said, noting one fan put one of her poses
on his belt buckle. ``It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   At one show, a Vietnam vet told the tale of how his barracks
were bombed and half the building was destroyed, but he went back
and retrieved her centerfold, which was torn in half by the blast.
``I offered him another one but he didn't want it,'' she said. ``He
said it brought him good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bucha, a president of the Congressional Medal of Honor
Society, wrote a few years ago to say that it was her picture that
hung on the wall of his Army company's shelter. ``I can assure you
that many guys were inspired to make it back (to the U.S.) because
of the pictorial.'' Lind framed the letter and displays it proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Lind began selling her old Playboy photos at conventions,
expanding the selection about two years ago when a boyfriend took
some nude shots during a vacation in Cancun. Though the amateur
images don't have the Playboy look, but they're selling well, she
said. A friend set up a page for her on the World Wide Web
(http://www.getup.net/centerfolds) so fans could place orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep shooting until I can't do it anymore,'' she
said. ``You have to keep yourself out there. I love what I do.''

 &HT;    Bulls, bears and the big board
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The president's testifying about his sex
life, Iraq's acting feisty again and it seems like half the players
in the major leagues are threatening to break Roger Maris' home run
record.
</P>
<P>
   Who has time for any of it? We're all watching The Dow go up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we. It's OK to admit it. Nobody rants about the excesses of
capitalism any more, not since 401(k) entered the national
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, who knew? Some of us wasted too much of our youth
reading Rolling Stone instead of Barron's, Jack Kerouac instead of
Milton Friedman. Some of us were just wasted, period.
</P>
<P>
   So now that we're at least as worried about saving for
retirement as saving the Earth, it's sometimes a little hard to
follow the news about the effect of declining issues on broad
market indicators.
</P>
<P>
   You just want to know if your money's safe, but all you hear is
that the Big Board closed higher as the bulls out-muscled the
bears, but we may be overdue for a correction, so watch the yield
on the long bond.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we bring you The Accent Stock Market Guide, written
by one of your own _ a man who, most of his life, paid as much
attention to the stock market as to, well, the bond market. Or the
Olympic curling competition.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a man who knew absolutely nothing about it until
last week. So be warned: This is not for the sophisticated
investor. And sophisticated or not, you should look elsewhere for
investment advice. But this may just help you translate the advice
you get into something you can understand. THE DOW
</P>
<P>
   The yo-yo that has the nation transfixed is properly called the
Dow Jones industrial average, the stock market's version of the
Nielsen ratings. It's a small sample of influential stocks, 30 big
companies, used to gauge the market's overall performance. The
average is translated into a number that doesn't really correspond
to anything except itself, so a Dow of 8,000 doesn't mean there are
8,000 Dows somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are other indicators, too, drawn from other stock prices.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, for example, is an index of 500 big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow hit 9337, its highest point ever, just three weeks ago.
Then it bumped down and jumped up several times before landing at
8434 last Friday. But that's still up from 7908 at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The people who analyze such things seem to think the drop is
related to spreading economic trouble in Asia and worries about a
drop in corporate profits in America that could be partly caused by
the Asian turmoil. _ What it all means
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and other indicators measure the value of stock based on
the latest day's trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the
American Stock Exchange. Stocks listed on the NYSE (known as the
Big Board) or the AMEX are traded by brokers on the floor of the
exchanges. You're not allowed to join in, so you have to pay a
broker to buy and sell for you.
</P>
<P>
   (There's also the Nasdaq, which, surprisingly, has nothing to do
with automobile racing. Nasdaq listings, including many high-tech
companies, can be bought from security dealers. That's called over
the counter.)
</P>
<P>
   If you own stocks that kept pace with The Dow, you made money
this year but not as much as you would have if it kept going up. Of
course, there is no stock that keeps pace with The Dow. Your stocks
may have gone up and stayed there, or gone higher. Or, they may
have disappeared from the financial radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ So why buy stock?
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a company's common stock, you become one of the
company's owners, except they don't give you an office. What they
do, if you're lucky, is pay you a dividend, which is a share of the
company's profit. That's one way to make money in the stock market.
But big money usually comes from selling stock to someone who
thinks it's worth more than you paid.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of reasons someone might think that: He might see
that the company is increasingly successful, or have a hunch it
will be; he might know something about the company's management or
product plans; or, he might just be a cheese brain. As long as
people keep wanting to pay more for the stock, you can hold onto it
and celebrate every time the price goes up. But you never know when
people will stop wanting to buy your stock, which will make the
price go down. It could even go way below what you paid and not
come up again. Then you're the cheese brain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bulls and bears
</P>
<P>
   Investors, being more polite as well as poetic, prefer to think
of each other as Bulls and Bears. Bulls charge ahead and buy, so a
market with rising prices is a bull market. Bears, named by someone
who was never chased by one, are more cautious. A falling market is
a Bear market. We've been in a Bull market for years, even though
prices have fallen recently. That's at least partly because no one
likes the idea of calling it a Bear market because that might touch
off a panic, which is even worse. So a short-term drop in prices is
called a correction, which sounds much better.
</P>
<P>
   _ You must believe
</P>
<P>
   Bulls and Bears are powerful figures, but the more apt image
might be Peter Pan: The stock market soars only as long as people
believe it will. That's called investor confidence. The biggest
confidence booster is a rise in corporate profits, or some reason
to think they'll rise. That's why investors get excited about new
products or technology. Any hint of a drop in profits has the
opposite effect, but not necessarily on the entire market. That's
why it's smart to spread out investments, not just among companies
but across different types of companies. That's called
diversification. You might lose a little on toothpicks but gain on
dental floss and then pick up a few shares of false teeth, just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   _ Picking a winner
</P>
<P>
   So how do you decide what stock to invest in? That depends what
you're looking for. Stocks that aren't likely to rise can be good
investments if they pay strong dividends and also aren't likely to
go down. Some stocks of big, well-known companies fit into this
category. They're called blue chips. But you can't rely on size or
even reputation, because stock in big companies can take big drops.
Cheaper stocks in smaller companies may more easily double or
triple in price, but may be just as likely to turn into wallpaper
overnight. Anyone who wants to invest money in individual stocks
needs to first invest time in learning about the market and in
deciding how much risk is acceptable. In other words: How much
could you lose before you start crying in front of the neighbors?
</P>
<P>
   _ Flying solo
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to buy a stock, you have two basic choices: Go to
a broker, or sit at your computer. There are lots of discount
brokers on line these days. Discount brokers charge less than full
service brokers but don't offer all the advice. Whether you want a
broker's advice is another matter. You can find plenty of advice in
newspapers, magazines and on the Internet, and you can pay an
investment adviser. Once you decide what you want, you'll pay a fee
to buy and probably another fee to sell. That's another of the
stock market's little catches: You might make a few hundreds
dollars trading stocks but spend just as much in commissions if
you're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mutual interests
</P>
<P>
   Small investors today are likely to choose mutual funds over
individual stocks. It's especially true for 25 million Americans
who contribute to 401(k) retirement plans that allow them to put
off taxes on their savings and interest until they retire. Mutual
funds pool money from many investors; the fund manager picks the
stocks and decides when to buy or sell. The ``load'' you hear so
much about is a fee, which can seriously reduce your earnings. A
no-load fund sounds more attractive, but it can have less-obvious
fees. The main benefit of a mutual fund is that you can leave all
the decisions to a professional. The main drawback is that you're
likely to do just that. Some do a brilliant job. Some don't. There
are high-risk funds that aim for growth and lower-risk funds that
take a more conservative approach, but there's no such thing as a
no-risk mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hauling with history
</P>
<P>
   If this still sounds intimidating, consider the long haul
theory. Stock market fans are quick to point out that the market's
value has always risen over time and that the historic return is
greater than for most other forms of investment. So while stock
prices may drop over a few weeks, months or even years, hang on
long enough and they're almost sure to bounce back and rise even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a catch or two. The long haul can get pretty
long; it took more than 20 years for the market to climb back to
where it was before the Depression. Even then, a rise in the
market's average won't do you any good if you invest in today's
version of whaling ships or Hupmobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Both probably seemed like sure bets in their day, so before you
dive into the market with some high-tech gem touted by your
brother-in-law, you need to think hard about how much you can
afford to lose and how long you can wait to make a profit. And
about whether there's even a vague resemblance between a computer
chip and, say, a whaling ship.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range view best for investors
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for our readers' life savings, Accent also asked
a professional for her thoughts on the stock market. Maria Crawford
Scott is editor of the AAII Journal, which offers advice to the
175,000 members of the American Association of Independent
Investors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should the average investor make of all the stock market
news these days, especially when so much is hard to follow?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of investment professionals don't know what it means
either. A lot of what you hear day to day comes out of Wall Street,
from traders rather than from investment managers. They have
different mentalities. A lot of the feeling you get from the
jargon, the buzzwords, is from a trading perspective, not a
long-term investment perspective. You hear the Dow was down on a
volume of blah-blah. That doesn't tell you whether the economy is
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's making prices drop?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stock prices follow the long-term trend of the economy.
They're based on what people expect. When people realize they're
been too optimistic, prices come down to a more realistic level. As
for what's happening now, some trader could give you an answer
based on day-to-day trades, and that might be correct in terms of
the moment, but it's harder to tell what translates into a
long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if this is the beginning of a downward trend? Should
average investors, especially people who have their savings in a
401(k), be worried?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only if you're in the market and don't understand it. You
need to know how the stock market works so you can adjust your
portfolio to avoid taking risks you don't want to take. If you do
that, you probably won't run into trouble. But if you don't
understand that market, if you don't understand that there are
periods of over-valuation and times the market will fall, then you
can be over-committed to an area or pull out at the wrong time and
be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds like anyone who doesn't know what adjustments you're
talking about should be worried. Is that accurate?
</P>
<P>
   A: You might want to learn quick. Most plans offer information
about risks and ways to lower it. Most employers offer good
information. There are lots of books available. The great thing
about a 401(k) is you don't have to understand all the ins and out
of financial analysis. If you want to just forget about it, you can
go to a lower-risk investment option: Treasury bills or short-term,
fixed-income. But those have risk too, mainly the risk of not
earning as much as you expected so that you don't save as much as
you need for retirement.

 &HT;    Acting superb in Lifetime's poignant `Any Day'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ TV's a strange business. Just when you
think you'll never see a promising new show again, Lifetime _ yes,
Lifetime of all places! _ serves up three potential winners.
</P>
<P>
   The first is ``Any Day Now,'' a poignant, heartwarming show
about race relations that could easily become the season's best _
and most intelligent _ drama.
</P>
<P>
   Debuting Aug. 18, ``Any Day Now'' tells the story of two
childhood friends (one white, one black) who grew up in Alabama
during the height of the turbulent civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   As they got older, the women, Mary Elizabeth (Annie Potts) and
Rene (Lorraine Toussaint), grew apart and didn't speak for more
than 20 years. While a career-minded Rene left to become a
high-powered, Washington, D.C., attorney, the often-bitter Mary
Elizabeth stayed behind, married her childhood sweetheart and had
three children.
</P>
<P>
   The two are reunited when Rene goes back home after her civil
rights leader dad (a quietly dignified Courtney B. Vance) dies. Now
both women must come to grips with the choices they made in life.
While Mary Elizabeth wonders if she made a mistake by having
children at 19, the driven Rene ponders if she'll ever have a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth and Rene also struggle to heal their
relationship, which became strained when Rene didn't support Mary
Elizabeth's pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Potts and Toussaint are superb as the still ill-at-ease friends.
What a joy to watch two old _ well, they're not so old _ pros work.
One moment they're drinking coffee and catching up on old times,
the next they're remembering the trying days when they hurled
epithets at each other.
</P>
<P>
   We care so much for these multilayered characters because
through telling black-and-white flashbacks, we learn how this taboo
friendship developed. The fact that those flashbacks are set in a
racially divided Birmingham (or Bombingham, as it was called in
those days), makes ``Any Day Now'' more interesting and chillingly
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Potts doesn't believe ``Any Day Now'' would work on a major
network. She's probably right. NBC tried in 1991 with ``I'll Fly
Away,'' a well-meaning show about race relations in the South in
the late 1950s. It was canceled after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do a show much like this and dealing with the same
issues in `Dangerous Minds','' says Potts, of the axed ABC
inner-city teacher drama. ``And they didn't give it a proper
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Potts notes that playing Mary Elizabeth is not much of a stretch
for her. She grew up on a farm where a black family lived in a
tenant house. While the husband worked on the farm, the wife was
her family's cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with all of her children,'' she recalls. ``They were
my closest playmates because there wasn't anybody else around. I
was raised by this wonderful black woman, so it was always hard for
me to understand hard feelings between different (races). She
rocked me to sleep every night of my life until I was about 8 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Toussaint, a Trinidad native, says she had no reference points
for racism after coming to the United States when she was little.
In fact, Toussaint had never even heard of The Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first experience with Martin Luther King,'' she
remembers. ``It was my sixth birthday, or something, and my mom was
making a birthday cake. She was standing in the kitchen, icing my
cake and she was crying while she was doing it. I went over to her
and said, `Why are you crying?' And she said, `A very important man
was killed today and his name was Martin Luther King.' And I was
just so angry at him. I wanted to know who in the world had enough
power to make my mother cry on my birthday?''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, a powerful drama called ``Any Day Now''
should bring a few tears to your eyes.

 &HT;    Lifetime's new sitcoms both hip _ and funny
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Talk about girl power!
</P>
<P>
   Forget The Spice Girls. Check out Lifetime's new
I-am-woman-hear-me-roar comedies. Both ``Maggie'' and ``Oh, Baby''
are fresh, clever sitcoms. But, more importantly, they're pretty
funny too.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lifetime's programs are geared toward women, men
should also get a kick out of these somewhat groundbreaking shows.
And it'll be a nice switch to turn on the channel for one night
without having to look at those awful women-in-danger movies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two new entries, ``Maggie'' (Tuesday night at 10) stands
out. Ann Cusack (``The Jeff Foxworthy Show'') stars as Maggie Day,
a bored, 40-year-old woman stuck in a rut. (Think Ally McBeal 10
years from now.) Her cardiologist husband (John Getz) barely
notices her. Her 17-year-old daughter (Morgan Nagler) hangs out all
the time with her best friend, a budding cartoonist who pretends to
be gay.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie takes charge of her life by going to veterinarian school
and working part-time at an animal clinic. There, she meets Richard
(John Slattery), a fun-loving, silly vet who is everything her
self-absorbed hubby isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the twinkle is back in Maggie's eyes. Although that's
a good thing, Maggie feels a tad guilty since she can't stop
thinking about her goofy boss.
</P>
<P>
   As Maggie, Cusack is positively delightful. She has a breezy
style and lighthearted touch that work well here. And the chemistry
between Maggie and Richard is fun to watch. Although we know Maggie
won't give in to her obvious desires, it's fun watching her keep
herself in check.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Maggie'' features a bored married woman, ``Oh, Baby''
(Tuesday at 10:30) is about a thirtysomething career woman who
desperately wants to get hitched and start a family. But Tracy
(``Hope &AMP; Gloria'''s Cynthia Stevenson) is tired of waiting for Mr.
Right to pop the question. After Tracy's dense boyfriend (Daniel
Hugh Kelly) gives her the wrong kind of ring (a friendship ring, as
opposed to one of those 18-karat jobs) she decides to get
artificially inseminated and have a baby on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend doesn't get it, though, since he thinks only
lesbians get pregnant with that ``turkey baster thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Baby'' uses a clever device that has Tracy talking
directly to the viewer while she watches her life unfold on TV.
With a remote in hand, she can pause whenever she wants and add any
commentary she likes.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Maggie,'' ``Oh, Baby'' also benefits from fine casting.
Stevenson is instantly likable as Tracy; Joanna Gleason is
pleasingly sarcastic as a tart-tongued shrink and the ageless
Jessica Walter is in fine form as the skeptical mom.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the broadcast networks can take some lessons from
Lifetime. After all, the cable network is batting 1.000. Two new
comedies. Two funny shows.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Wohlers' problems continue
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Wohlers' 10-day stay at Class AAA Richmond ends
later this week, but the reliever doesn't seem to be getting much
better.
</P>
<P>
   In three appearances since going to Richmond, Wohlers has thrown
2 1/3 innings and struck out four, but he has allowed two runs,
walked seven and thrown six wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a ways to go,'' Richmond pitching coach Bill Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wohlers has only three more days at Richmond, under the deal
he worked out with the Braves when he agreed to return to the
minors. It seems clear that he needs more time in the minors, but
the club is unsure what he wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   If he does want to return to Atlanta, the Braves might have no
choice but to put him on the disabled list. The Braves, trying to
get their bullpen ready for the postseason, are concentrating on
getting another lefthander to go along with rookie John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has two other lefties in the pen, Norm Charlton and Adam
Butler, and additional help might be at Richmond, where Pedro
Borbon has five strikeouts in his last three appearances. Borbon,
who was instrumental when the Braves won the World Series in 1995,
hasn't pitched in the majors in more than two years after elbow
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, tickets, tickets
</P>
<P>
   The best chance to catch the Braves on this seven-game homestand
will be the next three nights, with 40,000 tickets sold for each
game. The Braves expect to sell standing-room-only tickets for
games Friday and Saturday, and they have sold 42,000 tickets for
Sunday night's game and 37,000 for Monday's game, which starts at
1:10 p.m. Also, tickets remain on sale for the division playoff
series; they can be purchased at the Turner Field ticket office,
which opens at 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   The Braves swept the Giants 10 days ago, but San Francisco comes
to town on a three-game winning streak. The Giants took three from
the Marlins over the weekend while Barry Bonds served a three-game
suspension. ``We got the best of both worlds,'' manager Dusty Baker
said. ``We won without Barry, and he got a well-deserved and
unplanned rest.'' The Giants are 5-2 without Bonds in the lineup
this season. . . . The Braves bullpen had a 1.88 ERA on the recent
nine-game road trip. . . . In Richmond, manager Jeff Cox has left
the team for personal reasons. Cox told his players he was leaving
because of his ill mother. Coach Max Venable has taken over.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Bud Selig introduced an expanded playoff format
and two wild-card spots in the winter of 1993, he upset many
baseball purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have thought I defiled motherhood,'' Selig,
baseball's commissioner, said Monday. ``But you don't hear a peep
out of them now. And I have said to many people recently, 'Can you
imagine where we would be this year if we didn't have have the wild
card?'''
</P>
<P>
   With no wild card, baseball's regular season would, for the most
part, be finished. Five of the six division races have been
decided:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Braves lead by 14 1/2 games in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Astros lead by eight games in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Padres lead by 14 games in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees lead by 19 1/2 games in American League East.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Indians lead by 11 1/2 games in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the AL West offers the only race: The Angels lead the
Rangers by 1/2 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is working brilliantly,'' Selig said. ``It is working like
we thought it would. Then I think of the criticism I took
personally. Our fans like it; it is preserving September.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, for example, would be out of the playoff picture
without the wildc ard, but they arrive in Atlanta today for an
important two-game series against the Braves. San Francisco trails
the Cubs by two games. The Mets are half a game behind the Cubs,
and four other teams are within nine games.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, Cubs and Mets all have seen increases in attendance
because of the wild card. The Cubs are up 12 percent over last
year, the Mets are up 23 percent, and the Giants are up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The AL race is not as close, but the Orioles remain seven behind
the Red Sox and have made a strong recovery from a 15 1/2-game
deficit at the All-Star break. Baltimore and Boston play six times
during the final two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now live in a world with 30 teams, and I think you need
more than four in the postseason,'' said Braves president Stan
Kasten, who was on the committee that voted to adopt the wild card.
``Realistically, you have to give enough teams a chance to have
something to work for their entire season. We thought it would
extend the interest in twice as many cities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are a good example of how the system works. The
team is rebuilding, yet it has stayed in the race. Attendance has
increased by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wild-card situation creates hope in other cities,
where in the past, things would have locked up two months ago,''
Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. ``It has created another
dynamic for us. Our fans are looking at progress, and out of the
corner of their eye they are still looking at the wild-card
standings, trying to figure out if, we can get on a seven or
eight-game winning streak, we can get right in the thick of it. In
the other format, they looked at the first-place club and were
waiting for football to start.''

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ For the first 19 years of his life, Doug
Johnson was quite comfortable playing the role of golden boy here.
</P>
<P>
   He was handsome, popular and a superstar athlete here at
Buchholz High. Fellow students admired and envied him. Parents
wanted their sons to be like him.
</P>
<P>
   Professional baseball beckoned with promises of riches, but the
Florida Gators offered him a chance to play quarterback and become
the ultimate hometown hero.
</P>
<P>
   A tough decision? Hardly. Always confident, Doug would simply do
both. For Johnson, it all came so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through high school, I really didn't have to work at
all,'' Johnson said. ``I've really never had to work hard in
anything I ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are over, Johnson concedes. In the past year, reality
has hit Doug Johnson in a series of waves, each one a little
harder, each one making it more difficult to climb to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, things can't get any worse than they did
last year,'' he said. ``It can only get better. At least that's
what I keep telling myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Johnson realized one of his lifelong dreams when he
became the starting quarterback at Florida. He replaced Danny
Wuerffel, the Heisman Trophy winner and perhaps the most admired
player in school history. Then the roller-coaster ride began:
</P>
<P>
   _ He played well with a 7 TD performance against Central
Michigan. Some sports writers dared to link his name with the
Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   _ He played poorly with four interceptions in a 28-21 loss at
LSU. For the first time in his life as an athlete, Johnson received
significant criticism.
</P>
<P>
   _ The criticism grew worse a few days later when it was revealed
he broke curfew partying at a local nightspot the Thursday before
the LSU game. He was suspended from the team and publicly
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Johnson returned to the team, he had lost his job and his
confidence. After throwing two first-half interceptions against
Georgia, he was yanked in favor of Noah Brindise, a former walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharing the job with Brindise, Johnson made the play of the
season when his 63-yard pass to Jacquez Green set up the winning
touchdown in a 32-29 upset of No. 1 Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just when it appeared that the clouds over Johnson's football
career were clearing, his athletic body, the one thing he could
always count on, betrayed him. Johnson had shoulder surgery on May
8 to repair damage to the rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess you could say my life's been pretty complicated
lately,'' said Johnson, who turns 21 on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his junior season at Florida, Johnson is trying to
get his shoulder back in shape. He is in a dogfight for the
starting quarterback job with sophomore Jesse Palmer _ not exactly
where he hoped to be at this point of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, however, has provided unexpected dividends.
Rehabbing the shoulder forced him to give up minor-league baseball
for the summer and remain in Gainesville to work on his
conditioning. As a result, Johnson is physically more mature than
he has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   The hours spent in therapy also forced Johnson to take stock of
his emotional maturity. In retrospect, Johnson realizes he wasn't
ready for the mental demands of becoming a starting quarterback at
the SEC level. After watching Weurffel win the Heisman and just
about every other major award in 1996, Johnson assumed the same
praise automatically was awaiting him.
</P>
<P>
   The summer before the 1997 season, while Johnson was playing
minor-league baseball in West Virginia, he was constantly hearing
from those who already has annointed him as the next great Gator
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had four or five reporters calling every day. I was high on
life,'' Johnson said. ``I was 19 years old, and I was the the
starting quarterback for the defending national championships.I was
eating it up and loving it.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the LSU game, and all the fallout that came with it,
Johnson discovered how quickly the crowd can turn. The love the
Gator faithful had showered on Wuerffel every week, which Johnson
had had for a few precious Saturdays, was nowhere to be found. ''It
was like everybody was waiting for me to mess up.
</P>
<P>
   There's a different feeling when I go out there than when
Wuerffel went out there,'' he said. ``I can feel it. There's not as
warm a feeling. I think they want me to succeed, but they also want
me to carry my weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson learned that the respect and admiration Wuerffel
received came from four years of exemplary behavior, both on the
field and off. Wuerffel had struggled as a freshman with limited
skills. He became a Heisman winner and the school's all-time
leading passer through hard work and personal sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw Danny talking to people and accepting all those
awards, but I never saw how he got there,'' Johnson said. ``Danny
made a lot of sacrifices to be successful. I was thinking all I had
to do was just go out on the field and play well, but that's not
it. That's not even half of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that Johnson has turned an emotional
corner. One of those still waiting for proof is Spurrier. When
others suggest that the events of the past year have matured
Johnson, Spurrier's verbal response is muted. But his body language
is clear: Johnson must prove it every single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel confident we have two quarterbacks capable of playing,
but we don't know how it's going to play out,'' Spurrier said in
his standard assessment of the position. ``If we have to use both
of them to win for the Gators, then that's what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know coach Spurrier wants one of us to step up and take the
job. He's not going to give it to either one of us,'' Johnson said.
``I also know that, no matter what, coach Spurrier will always put
the best player on the field. I have to prove to him that it's
me.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, Doug Johnson's mission is clear. For the first time in
his charmed life as an athlete, he has faced adversity. His
confidence has not been shaken, but it has been tempered. And as
the 1998 season approaches, Johnson has been forced to face this
uncomfortable fact: For the fair-haired boy of Buchholz High, time
is running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people looking back (on my career) and saying,
'That Johnson kid had a lot of potential, but he didn't know when
and where to use it,''' Johnson said. ``I can't let that happen.''

   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ The two-lane interstate that connects Phoenix
to the training camp site of the Arizona Cardinals is a
topographical kaleidoscope. It winds through miles of barren desert
and long stretches of cactus and scrub grass, then passes east of
new-age mecca Sadona, before gently easing into the kind of terrain
more frequently associated with Colorado ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics might suggest that the Cardinals' summer aerie, 7,000
feet above sea level, is the highest this perennial loser will ever
rise. Visible beyond three practice fields ringed by majestic pine
trees, however, lies Humphreys Peak. And at 12,633 feet, the
tallest point in the state is a daily reminder to Arizona players
of the lofty aspirations they harbor for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 100th anniversary for a club once dubbed ``The
Futile Franchise'' during its ramshackle run in St. Louis, and
players would like it to be something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's there for us every day, and it's become a symbol of
where we feel we can go _ all the way to the top,'' fullback Larry
Centers, one of the team's long-suffering veterans, said after a
morning practice last week. ``The way it's been here for too long
is that we've gone through the motions of being a football team.
But this year seems to be different. There's more purpose, . . .
and there's certainly more belief in each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, we're a 'buzz' team,'' Centers said. ``People
are actually talking about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The once-woeful Card have become a chic pick among league
insiders seeking a dark-horse playoff candidate for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 general managers surveyed by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution cited Arizona as the NFC doormat most likely
to surprise fans with a breakthrough performance. All 10 agreed
that Arizona is considered an ascending team.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Cardinals haven't qualified for the postseason
since the truncated 1982 season, the longest current drought in the
NFL, some skeptics can be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Originally founded in 1898 as the Morgan Athletic Club on
Chicago's rough-and-tumble Southside, the team, despite owning the
distinction as the oldest continuously run pro football franchise,
has made just six playoff appearances. No team in existence at the
time of the 1970 merger has fewer playoff appearances than
Arizona's three. Over the last decade, the Cardinals' 55-105 record
is the NFL's second-worst.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year, the Cardinals won just four times, hardly a
victory total that justifies the rampant optimism by team
management and fans in the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams and other players try to make
sure that the Cardinals' nucleus of young talent isn't burdened by
the hideous history. One of the league's classiest players off the
field and a four-time Pro Bowl performer on it, Williams typically
is the last guy into the locker room. He finishes every practice
with a short prayer circle, then follows that with a tutorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years and I never lost faith, so I don't want these
young guys getting down,'' Williams said. ``I measure my own
success by my ability to raise the performance of those around me.
Sometimes that's with words. Sometimes it's by pulling. Other times
it's by pushing. And there are times it's a combination of the
three. I tell the younger players, 'Men, the environment for change
is always present if the attitude is good.' What we've done now is
eliminate all those old excuses for our failures, and we've
accomplished it by keeping a great attitude. I think that message
is pretty well-rooted around here.''
</P>
<P>
   These Cards certainly have more talent than in the past to heed
Williams' sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Oft-criticized owner Bill Bidwill, as easy a target in St. Louis
and Phoenix as Rankin Smith was in Atlanta, still is apt to show up
at practices in a bush jacket and with a scruffy beard, as he did
last week. But he has turned over much of the operation to his
sons, Bill Jr. and Michael, and vice president of player personnel
Bob Ferguson, and the results have been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, with John Butler, now Buffalo general manager, did
much of the scouting leg work during the Bills' four-year stretch
of AFC championships but Bill Polian got most of the credit. With
the Cardinals, the affable Ferguson has drafted well, gone into
free-agency judiciously and persuaded ownership to retain such
valuable veterans as Centers, Williams, defensive tackle Eric Swann
and wide receiver Frank Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The team now has four tailback candidates all superior to '97
starter Leeland McElroy. The addition of mercurial all-purpose
player Eric Metcalf to the tandem of Sanders and Rob Moore provides
a big-play threat. The defensive line is one of the NFL's best
young groups, even without first-round end Andre Wadsworth, who
remains unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year quarterback Jake Plummer, a fan favorite because of
his derring-do while at Arizona State, gives the club a charismatic
drawing card and local hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've sent a message with those (acquisitions),'' said
Sanders, the burgeoning star who played at Auburn. ``We're at the
edge of something real good happening here, and the front office
has done a nice job of saying it's committed and then backing up
those words.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cards could be another season or two away from
challenging seriously, even in a watered-down NFC East. The
offensive line and both safety positions are obvious problems.
Plummer has struggled with the West Coast offense installed by new
coordinator Marc Trestman. The stalled negotiations with Wadsworth
are maddening. The kicking game appears to be weak.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has witnessed the worst of times in Arizona, said
he thinks the team is better prepared to deal with such problems,
however. And he noted that a Cardinals outfit that lost seven games
in '97 by a touchdown or less, including four by 3 points or fewer,
doesn't require much improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life, to me, is like a movie,'' he said. ``Everything goes
frame to frame. One frame can be good, the next one bad. This year,
I see us with lots of good frames.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer whose guidance and support has mattered
most in President Bill Clinton's career _ his wife _ was absent
from the legal team advising Clinton Monday in the White House Map
Room. For Hillary Rodham Clinton, Monday was an extremely painful
day in the history of her marriage and in her husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton will briefly appear in public with the
president and their daughter, Chelsea, when they leave on a 10-ten
day sojourn on Martha's Vineyard. Their departure will surely be
one of the most intensely watched moments of Mrs. Clinton's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the wife, there's a sense of humiliation,'' said the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who met with Mrs. Clinton and her daughter late
Sunday night. ``Hillary is dedicated to her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the speculation that has washed over the capital in
recent days, one question has provoked more conversation than
others: What did the first lady know about her husband's dealings
with the former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, and when did
she know it?
</P>
<P>
   In the days immediately preceding Clinton's testimony, with his
advisers planning a strategy that shifted away from categorical
denials of any improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, some
advisers stressed that one of the most difficult tasks confronting
the president was to divulge an extramarital relationship to Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But several friends of Mrs. Clinton said they found it almost
impossible to believe that she was in the dark about her husband's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That strikes me as ridiculous,'' said one friend who has seen
Mrs. Clinton this month. Another said, ``Come on. She's the
smartest lawyer in town and the president has relied on her from
the beginning.'' Both friends, who spoke on the condition that they
not be named, said they had never asked Mrs. Clinton about Ms.
Lewinsky or had heard her speak about the 25-year-old former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Clinton said he is ``almost certain'' that
Mrs. Clinton knew back in January that the president had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. This friend, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity, speculated that recent leaks to the media
that portrayed Mrs. Clinton as unknowing until now were released to
raise her approval ratings in the public opinion polls. This friend
cited internal White House polling showing that her ratings have
skyrocketed in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said Monday, ``In
general, she hasn't talked about this with us. I can't offer any
evidence of what she knew or when. It's not something we talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Last January, after news of the investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and allegations of perjury became
public, Mrs. Clinton appeared on the NBC News ``Today'' show to
defend her husband. When pressed by her interviewer, the co-anchor
Matt Lauer, with a direct hypothetical question on whether the
American people should seek the resignation of a president who had
an adulterous affair in the White House and then lied to cover it
up, Mrs. Clinton responded: ``If all that were proven true, I think
that would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be
proven true.''
</P>
<P>
   One former White House aide cited this interview as evidence
that Mrs. Clinton did believe there was no improper sexual
relationship between her husband and Ms. Lewinsky. The aide added,
``Those who now say that the first lady knew all along and has been
leading the strategy have to contend with the fact that she then
has to accept responsibility for misleading the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Plumbing the mysteries of a marriage, especially the Clintons',
is a hazardous endeavor. In 1992, Clinton conceded that he had
``caused pain'' in his marriage. And Mrs. Clinton told Lauer:
``We've been married for 22 years. And I have learned a long time
ago that the only two people who count in any marriage are the two
who are in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the depth of her knowledge about her husband's
encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, it is clear that the past few days
have been difficult for the Clinton family. Late on Sunday night,
Jackson, who has become particularly close to Chelsea Clinton in
recent months, was summoned to the White House. He said he talked
and prayed with the first lady and Chelsea for two hours, beginning
at 10:30 p.m. The three of them then briefly met with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bill has a sense of embarrassment,'' Jackson said
Monday, rather than the humiliation felt by Mrs. Clinton. But the
image of Mrs. Clinton as a victim is difficult for some of her
longtime friends, who cherish her role as a trailblazer and as an
advocate for women's rights, to accept. The public, however, is
eagerly embracing the image of a beleaguered first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Her standings in the polls have risen steadily in recent months
as the Lewinsky matter has unfolded. Voters, especially older
Americans and Republican women, who were uncomfortable with Hillary
the policymaker are embracing a first lady who has stoically stood
by her husband in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally her poll numbers are up because she's standing by her
man,'' said Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright, who has met Mrs.
Clinton several times and recently saw her at a Democratic
fund-raiser. ``That's all right because it involves the good kind
of strength and dignity. But it kind of scares me. What are we
telling the next generation of women?''

COMPUTER FIRM ASSURES INVESTORS AFTER ERRONEOUS INTERNET REPORT

   NEWBURY PARK, Calif. _ Officials at YARC Systems Corp. scrambled
Monday to assure investors that an Internet service erroneously
included the Newbury Park company in a recent listing of insider
sales.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is KFLP Holding's intention to sell 80,000 shares of
YARC stock worth about $45,000, which KFLP reported to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Yahoo!, the Internet portal,
erroneously interpreted KFLP's filing as an insider sell-off,
according to officials with YARC, located in Ventura County
northwest of Los Angeles, which makes computer and digital printer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   KFLP is neither a major stakeholder nor an insider of YARC,
according to YARC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Trevor
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yahoo!'s Web site, an insider is ``an officer,
director, or beneficial owner (holder of 10 percent or more) of a
company's stock.'' KFLP owns about 130,000 YARC shares out of 16
million common shares outstanding _ or roughly 8 percent _ and is
thus not an insider, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Yahoo!'s) information was accurate in this case; the
interpretation is wrong,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he has had a difficult time contacting Yahoo! to
correct the mistake and that the Internet company should have a
hotline or other, easier access to ensure a quick response.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! officials could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 53,100 shares of YARC stock were traded Wednesday, two
days after the listing appeared. That was more than five times the
number of shares that changed hands the day the item appeared on
Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd preferred that not to have happened, but it wasn't
catastrophic,'' Marshall said about the post-listing sell-off.

TOURISTS SEEM TO SHRUG OFF CLINTON-LEWINSKY MATTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Fla., S.C.) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Contrary to what politicians and the media were
reporting, the nation was not holding its breath Monday awaiting
word on whether President Clinton lied about his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, if public opinion polls are accurate, already
seemed to know the answer was ``yes'' even before Clinton made his
appearance via closed-circuit television before a federal grand
jury investigating the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House, for example, tourists seemed more
concerned with finding a good place to eat after touring the
presidential estate than finding out if its chief resident had
engaged in improper behavior with Lewinsky or had committed perjury
trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that I think impacts on the country one way
or the other,'' said Scott Webber, a South Carolina visitor, who
was asking a local policeman where he could find ``a good steak''
when he was asked about the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Webber and his wife, Marsha, say they came to terms with ``who
Bill Clinton is'' when they voted for him in 1992 and again in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me whether he lied about it or not,'' said
Marsha Webber. ``I think politicians have lied about much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by other tourists around the White House,
although some acknowledged that they would take a dim view of
Clinton if he tried to obstruct justice by asking Lewinsky to lie
on his behalf. But most seemed as eager as the president to put the
matter behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave him alone is what I say,'' said Shirley Nagey of Miami.
``I think it's a private matter. It doesn't have anything to do
with Whitewater, and it's a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a waste. I mean if it were me, I'd lie,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she would change her mind if it turns out that
Clinton committed perjury or tried to obstruct justice, Nagey said,
``My view is, like I said, this is a private matter, and some
questions just shouldn't be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's between his wife, him and Monica,'' added Nancy Kagy,
another tourist from Miami. ``It doesn't have anything to do with
me or the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, however, said the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship was much more than a private sexual
matter. Some lawmakers described it as an ``abuse of power'' and
``serious enough'' to warrant the start of impeachment proceedings
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about sex. This is about abuse of the office of
president. This is about abuse of power. This is about lying under
oath,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, who, as chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, would help oversee impeachment proceedings if
it comes to that.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch described the allegations against Clinton as more sordid
than the sexual harassment charges leveled by Anita Hill against
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these allegations about Monica Lewinsky are true, it
sickens me,'' Hatch said. ``The most powerful man in the world and
a 21-year-old intern, consensual or not, it's still abysmal, if it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch acknowledged that he would not press for impeachment
hearings if Clinton's testimony proves to be truthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those who does not want impeachment if he tells the
truth,'' Hatch told reporters as Clinton was answering questions
put to him by grand jurors and independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, he has asked for forgiveness and we should
do that,'' Hatch continued. ``I've always been taught to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally hope it works out well for the president,'' Hatch
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, however, was the last thing that Sen. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., was thinking during an appearance Monday on CNN.
He said the president should consider resigning if it turns out
that he deceived the American people about his relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dragged the country through eight months of this deal
because the president hasn't been telling the truth,'' said
Ashcroft, who is considering a run for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Congress would have ``a responsibility to carry
out impeachment procedures'' if Starr's upcoming report to Congress
includes evidence of perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., has been preparing for the possibility of impeachment
proceedings. A lawyer who would serve as the committee's chief
counsel has already been hired, and funding has been earmarked to
begin initial hearings. &QL;

 &HT;    Delta refuses to let pilots have a seat on board, risks alliance
with United
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines won't give its pilot union a voting
seat on the board of directors, a decision that could scuttle plans
for a joint venture between Delta and United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The union had demanded the seat as a prerequisite to contract
change needed to allow the alliance, in which the airlines would
sell seats on each others' flights in a practice called
code-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Delta said its board rejected the demand ``because
of its belief in the principal that an independent board best
serves Delta and its constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Giambusso, chairman of Delta's Air Line Pilots
Association unit, said the union is ``very disappointed'' and will
cease consideration of the needed contract change.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point you could say it's over,'' he said, though he
added the union would entertain any new company overtures. The
union's leadership council meets again in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Delta President and Chief Executive Leo Mullin said he remains
hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will await the view of the union leadership on this and
that will remain to be seen,'' he said. ``I hope they will decide
to give further consideration on this. It's not at all a reflection
on the pilots but a decision in favor of good corporate
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Mullin said Delta and United will proceed with joint
frequent flier benefits, an aspect of the alliance that doesn't
require union approval. As of Sept. 1, the airlines will give
fliers the option of logging miles in either airline's program.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilots based their demand on the fact that United pilots
have a voting board seat, and a belief it would help them protect
members' career interests. The union now has a non-voting
representative not privy to all matters.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin noted that United pilots own a sizable chunk of the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta-United alliance followed similar pairings announced by
Northwest and Continental, and by American and US Airways. But
neither of those alliances is moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some analysts say the urgency behind the
Delta-United deal has waned, which they add could contribute to
hard-line stances by the company and the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's stock closed up $4.31 1/4 at $119.75 on Monday.

 &HT;    Once on brink of bankruptcy, Miami offers up 'realistic' budget
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This cash-strapped city appears to be skating back from
the brink of financial disaster once again, as reluctant city
officials have tentatively approved tax and fee increases that
should balance Miami's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes only after a state board appointed to help clean
up the city's messy books threatened to take over Miami's
government if commissioners didn't adopt a realistic budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the appointed board's intermediary _ called an
estimating committee _ got its first look at the proposed new
budget and gave general approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen this is absolutely a positive step toward
putting the city back on firm financial footing,'' said Alan
Johansen, an accountant representing Gov. Lawton Chiles on the
estimating committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the document still must win approval from the five-member
oversight board, which meets next week to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Miami city commissioners could still wiggle out of their
politically undesirable decision to raise taxes and fees _ they
won't put the new budget to a final vote until September.
</P>
<P>
   Interim City Manager Donald Warshaw, however, believes the
commission will stand firm on raising revenues, and was pleased at
the initial approvals Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step,'' he said. ``Of all the events this is the
most significant because these are the people who have been hired
by the oversight board to really scrutinize the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's financial crisis came to light in 1996 when Mayor Joe
Carollo found the city was near bankruptcy after years of poor
financial management. But Carollo was tossed out of office by
voters last fall during a tumultuous election, only to be
reinstalled two months later after a judge ruled the election was
tainted by massive absentee ballot fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo and the commission submitted a preliminary five-year
budget in the spring, winning the oversight board's approval. Last
month, however, they drew the board's ire with an updated budget,
which contained an estimated $16 million shortfall for 1999.

CLINTON'S LEGAL PERILS EXTEND BEYOND LEWINSKY RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>

 (JT)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton still faces a series of legal
perils that are separate from whether he lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has been
examining not only whether Clinton lied under oath in January about
the relationship, but also whether he engaged in other possible
criminal conduct _ an effort with Ms. Lewinsky and others to
obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses or persuade people to lie,
known legally as suborning perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues include whether Clinton colluded with Ms.
Lewinsky to tailor her story, whether he counseled her to conceal
gifts he had given her and whether he participated in an effort to
help her find a desirable job as a reward for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue of a sexual relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky has occupied most of the public commentary, Starr's view
of the investigation, people close to him say, has always been that
any untruthfulness about the sexual relationship was part of a
wider pattern of deception on the part of the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions concern conversations Clinton may have had
with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, once it became
known that she might become a witness in the sexual misconduct
lawsuit brought against the president by Paula Jones. Mrs. Jones, a
former clerical worker for the state of Arkansas, had sued Clinton,
charging that in 1991, when he was governor of Arkansas, he made a
crude sexual advance that she rebuffed. On Jan. 17 in a deposition
taken by lawyers for Mrs. Jones, Clinton denied having had ``sexual
relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told friends and presumably testified before
the grand jury that in the middle of December she had a
conversation with Clinton in which he told her: ``If two people are
in a room, and they both say nothing happened, how will anyone
know?''
</P>
<P>
   This conversation would have taken place before Ms. Lewinsky had
been subpoenaed in the Jones lawsuit, although Ms. Lewinsky's name
had by then appeared on a list of potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the January 17 deposition, Clinton replied ``I'm not sure''
when asked whether he had discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her possible
testimony. A judge dismissed Ms. Jones' lawsuit in April, but legal
experts have said that Clinton could still be liable for any crime
he committed while the suit was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The precise wording of any conversation the president and Ms.
Lewinsky had about her testimony could be important because lawyers
say there is a thin line between suborning perjury and discussing
hypothetical situations. Ms. Lewinsky provided an affidavit in the
Jones case in which she denied having had a sexual relationship
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also told the grand jury that Clinton gave her
gifts, according to people familiar with her testimony. She has
also told friends that he told her she could avoid turning the
gifts over to lawyers for Ms. Jones if she no longer possessed
them. Investigators are exploring the movement of the gifts _ a
brooch, a shirtdress, a book of poetry and a hatpin _ after Ms.
Lewinsky received them.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts were, for a time, in the possession of Clinton's
personal secretary, Betty Currie, who has also testified before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also trying to determine whether efforts to
obtain a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York were part of a conspiracy
to cover up the sexual relationship by rewarding her for concealing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan, an influential Washington lawyer and close friend
of the president, helped arrange for Ms. Lewinsky to get a job with
the Revlon Corp. in New York. The job offer was withdrawn after the
investigation of a possible sexual relationship between Ms.
Lewinsky and the president was disclosed.

CLINTON TELLS GRAND JURY OF LEWINSKY RELATIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Clinton address at 10 p.m. EDT; will update)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton acknowledged an inappropriate
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in
sworn testimony to a federal grand jury Monday, seven months after
first denying the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The president then prepared to apologize for his conduct in a
nationally televised address to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff Erksine Bowles advised Democratic
lawmakers prior to Clinton's address that the president would
``take full and complete responsibility and express real regret''
for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's lawyer, emerged from Clinton's
testimony in the historic Map Room of the White House to emphasize
that Clinton had testified forthrightly during a five-hour,
25-minute session that included more than four hours of questions
and answers with special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``testified truthfully,'' declared Kendall, a
trusted Yale Law School classmate of the president and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' Kendall added.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton chose to deliver his 10 p.m. EDT explanation
from the Map Room, a formal sitting room adorned with antiques and
dominated by a World War II-era map showing allied troops closing
in on the Nazi capital of Berlin in April 1945.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill charted allied strategy there at the outset of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Kendall made his statement at the White House diplomatic
entrance overlooking the South Lawn shortly after Starr and his
deputies exited the White House and boarded a passenger sedan
without public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's secret testimony was relayed by closed-circuit
television to a 23-member federal grand jury seated in a courtroom
at the federal courthouse a dozen blocks away from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury has been looking into allegations that Clinton
carried on an 18-month sexual relationship with Lewinsky when she
was a 21-year-old intern and then coaxed her to lie about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky initially denied a sexual relationship with Clinton in
a sworn deposition taken in Paula Jones' $700,000 sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton. That lawsuit was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky reversed course after winning immunity from
prosecution from Starr to tell Starr's grand jury on Aug. 6 that
she and Clinton carried on a sexual relationship while she worked
at the White House, according to lawyers familiar with her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had repeatedly denied a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky, who came to work at the White House in June 1995 as an
unpaid intern. Clinton emphatically reiterated his denial in an
appearance at the White House on Jan. 26 with Mrs. Clinton by his
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared, waving his index finger for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, speaking privately, said that Clinton
used his testimony to acknowledge an improper relationship with
Lewinsky without going into details.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials privately portrayed Clinton's admission as
a heart-rending challenge for the first family. Rev. Jesse Jackson,
saying he was invited to the White House late Sunday by the
Clintons' daughter Chelsea, told reporters Monday: ``Suffice it to
say (the president) is in the pain of all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea expressed ``unbroken
devotion'' to the president, adding: ``Fortunately for him, they
are greeting him with open arms and devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles similarly tried to buck up senior presidential aides who
had echoed Clinton's denials early in the scandal. Bowles
emphasized the ``importance of sticking together'' in his remarks
to the senior staff at a Monday morning meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to be there for someone when they're up,'' Bowles
told presidential aides. ``But it's the good ones who are there for
you when you're down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, accompanied by Chelsea, a student at Stanford
University, planned to leave for a two-week vacation on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became the American president to testify before a grand
jury investigating his conduct just two days before his 52nd
birthday.

<P>
   Clinton's testimony was a crucial milestone in White House
efforts to quell a seven-month scandal that has obscured the
president's domestic agenda and hampered his efforts to bolster
Democrats' chances for retaking control of the House in the
mid-term congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's aides say the special prosecutor hopes to present a
report to Congress within three to five weeks on the results of his
four year inquiry into the Clintons' failed 1978 investment in the
Whitewater land scheme in Arkansas, their firing of White House
travel office personnel, the alleged abuse of FBI background
reports on prominent Republicans and the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may recall Lewinsky for a second appearance before the
grand jury before his inquiry ends. Starr's spokesman, Charles
Bakaly, said that prosecutors are near the end of their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to complete the investigation as quickly as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Starr must report his findings to the House Judiciary
Committee which then weighs whether an impeachment inquiry is
warranted. Republican lawmakers in the House are divided, with some
conservatives insisting that the House undertake a full inquiry
into Starr's findings before reaching a decision on recommending
impeachment to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
reiterated at a news conference in Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday that
he did not believe impeachment proceedings are warranted if Clinton
told the truth before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally hope it works out well for the president,'' Hatch
said. Truthful testimony is ``the one thing that he can do that
might not only save his presidency but allow him to finish the
presidency through the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said that Clinton had
hoped that his candor and apology after more than seven months of
denials would help douse a scandal that dogged his presidency and
raised the specter of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks forward to getting this matter behind him,'' McCurry
said shortly before Clinton began his testimony at 12.59 p.m. EDT.
It testimony ended at 6:26 p.m.

<P>
   William Schneider, a public opinion specialist at the American
Enterprise Institute, said that Republicans in Congress already are
acting as though Clinton has ``lost his moral authority,''
dismissing his proposals because he is ``an illegitimate
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider added: ``The bottom line is they're not afraid of this
president anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said that Vice President Al Gore could face problems
in his planned Democratic campaign for president in 2000. ``I think
Al Gore is locked in the truck of Clinton's car _ where Clinton
goes, he takes Al Gore with him,'' Schneider said.

MEDIA FILLS AIRWAVES WITH HYPE _ UNTIL THE LEAKS BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nothing less than what CNN's Bernard Shaw called ``a
presidency on the line,'' reporters spent much of Monday waiting
impatiently for the outcome of President Clinton's unprecedented
grand jury testimony. And by the 6:30 p.m. network news, a
breathless media announced nothing more than what had been reported
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eerie time,'' said NBC's Tim Russert on cable network
MSNBC. There is ``obviously pain in the media because no one has
relished covering a story as squalid as this.''
</P>
<P>
   What made it eerier was the lengthy wait for confirmation of a
story that many news outlets had reported long before the testimony
began about 1 p.m. Minutes after that testimony concluded about
6:25 p.m., the networks announced that the president had indeed met
expectations and acknowledged a relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange symbol of Monday's media vigil, CNN initially ran
an ``elapsed time'' clock showing how long the president had been
testifying. The ticking clock was a metaphor for a day in which
much news from the White House watch was so trivial as to provide
relief from the overwhelming tension.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, MSNBC's Brian Williams reported that a
boombox had been installed in the federal courthouse to keep
reporters from overhearing Clinton's testimony. Less than an hour
later, CNN's Bob Franken reported that it had been removed. Shortly
after 2 p.m., Russert announced that White House staffers _
participating in a kind of gallows-humor wagering pool _ were
betting that Clinton would use the word ``inappropriate'' rather
than ``improper'' to describe his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, news reports suggesting the direction of Clinton's
testimony began to proliferate with Friday's New York Times Page 1
screaming headline: ``President Weighs Admitting He Had Sexual
Contacts.'' By Sunday night, that buzz had amplified into a roar.
(The Political Hotline newsletter noted that last weekend featured
30 hours of special Lewinsky-related television programming.)
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``National Town Meeting'' Sunday night, correspondent
John King reported that Clinton would acknowledge an
``inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.'' At the same
time, ABC anchor Peter Jennings said the ``betting money'' in
Washington was that the president would change his story and admit
to some wrongdoing. On MSNBC, Williams described Washington as a
city leaking like a sieve and predicted that the president would
``admit to some sort of relationship here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story Monday morning, Washington Post media critic Howard
Kurtz compared all this reporting and punditry to ``the pregame
hype before the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the kickoff arrived and Clinton began testifying, news
became very rare. In the search for public opinion Monday
afternoon, a CNN reporter stopped in a Little Rock, Ark.,
restaurant to sample public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I care who the president sleeps with?'' said one woman with
a syrupy Southern accent. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Illinois State Fair near the Springfield home of
``Honest Abe'' Lincoln, another citizen told MSNBC that if Clinton
admitted to a sexual relationship, ``I think he has totally
diminished the office of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day _ and the president's testimony _ dragged on, the
talk inevitably turned to the political implications. On CNN's
``Inside Politics,'' Jeff Greenfield said Clinton was probably
doomed to a ``crippled presidency,'' and former presidential
advisor David Gergen predicted that anywhere from 30 percent to 40
percent of the population would favor resignation or impeachment if
Clinton acknowledged a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the surest sign of desperation to fill the long hours before
Clinton finished answering questions, CNN ran the inevitable
navel-gazing story about the horde of journalists descending on the
White House. Mercifully, the testimony broke up about a half-hour
later and the official leaking began.

SEX INVESTIGATION TO BE FOREVER LINKED TO CLINTON, SCHOLARS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky sex scandal will leave a lasting impression
on President Clinton's long-term reputation and may overshadow the
accomplishments of his administration, two Houston scholars said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect this will be a lasting legacy of Mr. Clinton,'' said
Paul Brace, political science professor at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets precedents in so many different areas. It's
titillating in the extreme; it's comical, tending on your sense of
humor. For all these reasons it will have the effect of dominating
his legacy. I think it will be what he will be mostly remembered
for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the way the memory of Richard Nixon evokes Watergate and
Lyndon B. Johnson is linked to the Vietnam War, Brace said, ``The
thumbnail sketch of the (Clinton) administration will be attached
to this event.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brace said historians may be less influenced by the scandal
than the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other scandals that involved abuse of presidential power
and public policy, Clinton's problems are more personal in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Brace believes scholars may remember Clinton more for such
accomplishments as the elimination of the deficit, economic
recovery, national health care, ending the killing in Bosnia and
opening the trade door to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scholarly community may not be influenced by this legacy,
but I think the public legacy will be (the Monica Lewinsky
scandal),'' Brace said.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising development in the scandal is that public
opinion of Clinton's job performance remains high. An NBC News poll
taken over the weekend showed Clinton's approval rating at 70
percent, significantly higher than his job rating before the
scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not have foreseen that a president could be involved
in a sexual scandal and it not have pulled down his approval
rating,'' said John W. Sloan, political science professor at the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Brace speculated that Nixon would have survived Watergate and
maybe even averted impeachment proceedings if he had the strong
economy Clinton currently enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the polls it seems in many ways that the
Americans are becoming more French in many ways. As long as the
country is moving along very well, people don't really care,''
Brace said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Clinton has a chance of weathering the sex
scandal, especially since, in comparison to past presidential
scandals, the public appears to be in a forgiving mood.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents such as the Teapot Dome scandal so marred Warren G.
Harding's presidency that historians consider him among the worst
presidents in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses S. Grant's administration was so racked with scandal _
Black Friday, Credit Mobilier, Whiskey Ring and Belknap bribery _
that his presidency is remembered for nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant and Harding are generally rated at the bottom mainly
because the scandals outweighed anything they were able to
accomplish during their administrations,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sex scandals are not new to the presidency and the men who held
the office. Thomas Jefferson is said to have fathered children by a
former slave, Dwight D. Eisenhower had an affair with his chauffeur
during World War II and Franklin D. Roosevelt was rumored to have
cheated on his wife while in office.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of the New York Sun described Grover Cleveland as a
``coarse debauchee who would bring his harlots with him to
Washington and hire lodgings for them convenient to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding's father told his son, ``Warren, it's a good thing you
wasn't born a gal because you'd be in the family way all the time.
You can't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   The president best known for his sexual escapades, however, was
John F. Kennedy, who was rumored to have had countless affairs,
including one with star Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said presidents in the past enjoyed a special relationship
with the media that allowed them to keep their sexual trysts out of
the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was off the record; the press simply didn't report any of
this,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media had a kind of gentlemen's agreement not to raise
those allegations publicly, and the same was true with Kennedy,''
Sloan said. ``Kennedy was a well-known womanizer, but the press had
a kind of off-limits attitude about that type of story.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is not true today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kennedy were alive today he would have been involved in
exactly the same scandal,'' Brace said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Brace said presidents were able to control what
journalists wrote about them because Washington press corps careers
were based on access to the president. Reporters, he said, were
more insiders than investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson and Nixon ruptured that cohesiveness with the press
such that the press has never trusted presidents to give them the
story, and now it's adversarial,'' Brace said.

ADVERTISING: RED CLOVER FOR MENOPAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Conn., Ohio, Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An upstart Australian company hopes to capitalize on two trends
_ the aging of female baby boomers and the growing popularity of
dietary supplements _ to promote a new, herbal treatment for the
symptoms of menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Novogen Ltd., a medical research company based in Sydney,
introduced Promensil, a supplement for menopausal women made from
red clover, in the United States in April. It is running a $5
million advertising and promotional campaign to establish the
product in a field already crowded with many other herbal and
prescription remedies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Novogen, the red clover from which Promensil is
made is a source of four plant estrogens that can replace the
ovarian estrogens, or hormones, that decline in menopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   The ads for the product, by Lotas Minard Patton McIver in New
York, feature a black-and-white photograph of a woman and a
four-color picture of Promensil's packaging. The ads contend the
product will help make ``midlife as nature intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time takes away, new Promensil successfully replaces:
estrogens. Safe, natural plant estrogens derived from specially
cultivated Australian red clover,'' the ads continue.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Lancaster, vice president for North America at Novogen,
said the number of women 45 years and older in the United States
who are on the verge of menopause is expected to grow from 9.1
million in 1996 to 10.2 million in 2000 and 13.5 million in 2010.
Of the 10 million or so women in this country now undergoing
midlife changes, he said 8 million have symptoms, 2 million of whom
are taking prescription drugs to manage these symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to establish Promensil as the leading brand in the
market, and we've got to get the message of the health benefits of
plant estrogens out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Novogen has been running ads in health food and medical trade
publications, as well as in health-oriented consumer magazines like
Prevention. Last month it broadened the campaign to magazines like
Better Homes and Gardens, Cooking Light and Martha Stewart Living.
Budgeted at $3.5 million, the ad campaign is scheduled to run
through February.
</P>
<P>
   Novogen, which is 8.5 percent owned by Protein Technologies
International, a subsidiary of DuPont, is not alone in its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Competitive Media Reporting unit of VNU NV,
Enzymatic Therapy, a privately held dietary supplement distributor
based in Green Bay, Wis., spent more than $800,000 in the first
quarter of this year to advertise Remifemin, a product made from
the black cohosh plant, which Enzymatic Therapy says provides
``nutritional support to women experiencing menopause.'' The
company is advertising Remifemin on talk radio and in magazines
like McCalls and Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Amerifit of Bloomfield, Conn., another privately held dietary
supplement company, has been advertising Estroven, its treatment
for menopause, since March in women's and health magazines, on talk
radio, and on television programs such as ``Wheel of Fortune'' and
``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.'' Saying that ``aging is
perfectly natural'' and ``what you do about it should be, too,''
Amerifit's ads say Estroven, which also contains plant estrogens,
provides ``help as natural as the process you're going through.''
Martin Herman, president of Amerifit, declined to quantify spending
for this campaign, which was created by Bozell Worldwide in New
York, a unit of True North Communications.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mark Blumenthal, the executive director of the American
Botanical Council, a nonprofit herbal research group in Austin,
Texas, said the concept of using dietary supplements, rather than
prescription drugs, to treat menopause ``is getting to be a hot
topic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't peaked out yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal called Novogen's $5 million budget a ``big chunk of
change,'' but said ``no one knows their product, and people don't
know how compelling their research really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promensil's research is not as solid from a clinical point of
view as Remifemin's,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors specializing in menopause were even more critical of
campaigns by Novogen and its competitors for their supplements.
Such complaints have increased since Food and Drug Administration
regulation of supplements advertising was eased in 1994 with the
passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wulf Utian, the director of obstetrics and gynecology at
University Hospital in Cleveland, said he was bothered by
contentions made in the supplements' advertising for efficacy,
``claims based on limited or nonexistent scientific scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope consumers will not discontinue an effective treatment
for menopause and take something that has not yet been proven,''
which could put them at risk, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sadja Greenwood, a primary-care doctor in San Francisco and
the author of ``Menopause, Naturally,'' said she was worried about
potential side effects of taking Promensil. ``Red clover is a
foreign food for humans, and you have to be cautious about
introducing it into the diet,'' she said.

PITNEY BOWES SURVIVES FAXES, E-MAIL AND INTERNET

 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Michael J. Critelli well remembers the
uncertainty he faced when he became chief executive of Pitney Bowes
Inc. two years ago. Investors _ and more than a handful of Pitney
insiders _ were worried that faxes would kill regular mail, then
e-mail would kill faxes, and finally all these changes would kill
Pitney's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were saying we'd drop off a cliff,'' Critelli recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the company has kept its footing quite well. Its
meters and fax machines are renting briskly, and its management
services division is finding new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock price and earnings have climbed steadily in the last
few years. So has overall mail volume, fueled by direct marketing
and a flurry of bills generated from Internet commerce. Indeed, the
number of postage meters that Pitney rents went up 5.9 percent last
year, the largest annual rise in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean that predictions of mail's demise _ and thus,
of Pitney's fall _ are wrong? Or are they merely premature?
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly reason for worry. The Postal Service is
insisting that mechanical meters be phased out in favor of more
fraud-resistant digital meters, opening the field wide for
digitally savvy competitors like Neopost, Francotyp-Postalia AG of
Germany and Ascom Hasler Mailing Systems, a U.S. subsidiary of
Ascom Holding AG of Switzerland. These companies have already
carved 15 percent out of Pitney's one-time monopoly in mechanical
meters.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service has authorized E-Stamp Corp., in Palo Alto,
Calif., to test ways of downloading postage stamps by computer, a
method that could go over big with small businesses. (Just on
Monday, Pitney said it was talking to ``other marketers of
computer-based postal products'' about licensing Pitney's
technology, which the company claims it perfected first.)
</P>
<P>
   More rivals with deeper pockets are circling around the
increasingly digital messaging world, too. And many mailing experts
are questioning whether Pitney has what it takes to go up against
Xerox, Microsoft, IBM and the host of other companies that already
seem to have electronic communications down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already, 90 percent of our clients say they get more e-mail
than hard copy,'' said James Lundy, a research director of Gartner
Group, a research organization in Connecticut. ``Traditional mail
and metering are under attack, and Pitney had better figure out
where it fits in the electronic mail equation.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Critelli is trying to do. ``We used to
think solely of helping customers save labor and postage on
outgoing mail,'' he said. ``Now we're looking to compete in every
messaging niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Critelli already has combined old departments and created new
ones. He is pushing Pitney's expertise as a manager not just of
mail rooms, but of any print-on-paper operation. He is doing it all
with one goal in mind: to change Pitney's image from mailing
company to messaging company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your only tool is a hammer, you treat everything as
though it's a nail,'' said William Shannon, director of business
operations for Pitney's new small-office division. ``We're finally
developing a tool kit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pitney, which used to sell mainly through its direct
sales force, is experimenting with direct mail, television sales
and Internet sales. It is about to introduce several software
products that will let customers track incoming materials and
outgoing products, convert bills and other print files to fax or
e-mail, and track when a document has been acted on.
</P>
<P>
   A new division, strategic investments, is figuring out how to
commercialize products that do not fit into existing divisions. One
example: an ergonomics business to help clients reconfigure
buildings to accommodate new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The change is sending shock waves through the company's Stamford
headquarters. ``It's a lot less complacent around here, but it's
also a lot more exciting,'' said Patricia Rutledge, who has been at
Pitney for 28 years and is now director of operations for the
small-office division.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers see the metamorphosis even more sharply. ``People no
longer see the online world as the enemy but as the vehicle for
becoming a really broad-based messaging company,'' said John Kwant,
a director of Pitney's internal consulting group, who joined the
company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that as the worlds of printers,
copiers and computers continue to diverge, all sorts of companies
are trying to broaden their images.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., for decades content to be ``the copier company,''
now touts itself as the ``document-processing company.'' Eastman
Kodak Co. is trying to move out of its picture-taking box to become
the ``imaging company.'' And all the newly defined companies are
moving into one another's niches.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the new Pitney must go up against well-heeled,
high-technology competitors that want to handle all their
customers' document and message processing jobs _ including mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we see managing mail rooms as a good opportunity,''
said Thomas Dolan, president of Xerox Business Services, Xerox's $2
billion outsourcing arm. ``Pitney wants to get into documents, we
want to get into mail, so the competition is going to be intense.''
</P>
<P>
   That threat has not stopped numerous analysts from posting
strong buys on Pitney's stock. Small wonder: Pitney has had 14
consecutive quarters of earnings increases. That, combined with a
hefty stock buyback program and a two-for-one stock split last
year, has pushed its market capitalization, which was just $7
billion in 1996, to $15 billion and growing.

   ``It's still the gorilla in the mailing services business,''
Amit Chopra, of Credit Suisse First Boston, said. And for now, mail
is still a thriving business. ``Sure, interest in the Internet is
growing, but even America Online still sells its services primarily
by mail,'' Robert Reisner, the Postal Service's vice president for
strategic planning, said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies continue to funnel advertising away from television
and print media into direct mail _ often using mailing lists they
pried from the Internet. Mail has even received a lift from
electronic shopping, which generates mailed invoices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet, despite e-mail, has resulted in substantially
more mail, not less,'' said Alexander Henderson, an analyst with
Prudential Securities Research.

REMEMEMBERING SPORTSWRITING GREAT JIM MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a newspaper columnist who would ascend to the pinnacle of his
profession, Jim Murray was such an innovative stylist that he was
responsible for some of the most memorable sporting prose ever
written his own and some of the worst his imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a reflection of Murray's greatness at putting
together clever phrases that inspired a generation of impersonators
who tried vainly to emulate Murray's masterful usage of metaphors
and similes.
</P>
<P>
   There never has been a sportswriter in this country who was
copied as much as Jim Murray, who passed away Sunday evening after
a distinguished Pulitzer Prize winning career with the Los Angeles
Times.
</P>
<P>
   There never has been a sportswriter in this country who
transcended sports more than Jim Murray, whose list of devoted
readers included many people who never cared about athletics until
Murray began dispensing his unique perceptions in a most
entertaining manner in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   There never has been a sportswriter in this country who became
as famous, if not more famous, than many of the superstar athletes
he covered than Jim Murray, who was treated at sporting events as
though he were a member of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was such a towering figure that the athletes themselves
were honored when he chose to interview one of them,'' said Fred
Claire, the former general manger of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray now joins the pantheon of his craft, right up there
alongside the Ring Lardners and Red Smiths and Jimmy Cannons and
Grantland Rices.
</P>
<P>
   His printed trademark was his litany of biting and light-hearted
one-liners, especially those directed at cities. There were a lot
of Chamber of Commerce officials in America who loathed his humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago was a town where Al Capone didn't have a police record
even though he kept the coroner's office on night shifts,'' he once
wrote about the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   He was just as merciless with Philadelphia: ``Philadelphia was a
town that would boo a cancer cure. It was a place to park the truck
and change your socks or go unload a freighter. It was a place even
the British gave up without a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he didn't spare New York: ``You are not safe in
a church, taxi, elevator or lobby. The only safe place in New York
City is Grant's Tomb. Which is to say, Grant is safe, not you.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Los Angeles: ``L.A. is underpoliced and oversexed. Its
architecture has been (accurately) described as ``Early Awful'' or
``Papier-Mache Provincial'' or ``Moorish Nauseous.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Long Beach: ``It was the seaport of Iowa, settled by a
slow leak in Des Moines. It is sinking under the skeletal work of
millions of dollars' worth of oil wells. The only reason for going
to Long Beach is to see if it is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   While Murray enjoyed reporting events in a comical manner
replete with hyperbolic utterances ``the pickpockets were the only
ones who went home winners on Kentucky Derby day'' he also could be
fiercely acerbic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, start your coffins!'' still ranks among Murray's
most fabled lines in one of his early columns he wrote about the
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray was a gentle, unassuming man who never took his
exalted station seriously, and never was a pecking order person who
based his friendships on status.
</P>
<P>
   He was nice to everyone he met, and I first met Murray on a road
trip with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1969, sitting next to him on a
train as we traveled from New York to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, like almost every journalism school graduate of that
era who went into sports, I attempted to write like Murray. But I
found out quickly that his style was impossible to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other authors didn't, and the newspaper business soon
was brimming with a lot of lousy Jim Murray impersonators, which it
suffers from to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray and I would sit together in a lot of pressboxes over
the years, and I'll never forget that Murray was next to me at
Dodger Stadium that mild October evening in 1988 when we both
witnessed one of the more historic home runs in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   It was the opening game of the World Series, and Murray already
had wrapped up a column he had done on Jose Canseco, who had hit a
first-inning grand slam homer that seemed destined to give the
Oakland A's a victory over the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kirk Gibson would become the hero when he hit his dramatic
two-out, game-winning homer for the Dodgers, forcing Murray to tear
up his column and write a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibson slayed both the A's and us writers on deadline,''
cracked Murray.
</P>
<P>
   I remember another time we were seated next to each other at the
Aaron Pryor-Alexis Arguello rematch in Las Vegas when Murray
noticed I was ashen-faced at the start of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sick?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I made a big bet on the fight,'' I admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you are sick,'' he replied tartly.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed talking to Murray about his early newspaper days at
the Los Angeles Examiner, and the characters he met around town
like Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone called Bugsy by his real first name, Ben,'' related
Murray. ``You'd take your life in your own hands if you dared
called him Bugsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray was bedeviled by tragedy in the later years of his
life, losing one son to drugs, losing his first wife, Gerry, to
cancer, almost going blind because of a detached retina.
</P>
<P>
   But not once did I ever hear him complain.
</P>
<P>
   He always was in a civil mood and never whined, although he told
me during the 1996 World Series between the New York Yankees and
Atlanta Braves that the grind of covering such an event had become
too difficult for him.
</P>
<P>
   He did not attend last year's Fall Classic between the Cleveland
Indians and Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at 78, Jim Murray was putting out two columns a week for
the Times, and his final one appeared in Sunday's paper from Del
Mar.
</P>
<P>
   He got married again a few years ago to a supportive lady named
Linda McCoy, and he had seemed quite content the last time I saw
him about six weeks ago at a boxing press conference at the Friars
Club in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had brought him to the Friars that day, and that also was
the last time I saw Jim,'' said Bill Caplan, the fight publicist
and friend of Murray for 35 years. ``When I drove him back to his
home afterwards, I did something I had never done before. I hugged
him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He was the easiest columnist
to sell a story to of any I've ever worked with. I'm going to miss
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So are a lot of other people.

 STAMFORD, Conn.: Securities Research.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moreover, Pitney has had plenty of time to plan for change. As
far back as 1992, George Harvey, then the chairman, was forming
task forces, hiring outside consultants, even sending anthropology
students to study how customers process messages _ all to figure
out whether desktop computers and changes in the way people
communicate meant that mail was on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were drawing all kinds of doomsday scenarios,''
recalled Meredith Fischer, vice president for corporate marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Warding off those scenarios took a toll on Pitney. The company,
already struggling with the aftermath of some bad investments in
overseas businesses, took numerous write-offs relating to training
and factory retooling.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Postal Service issued regulations that prevented Pitney
from collecting postage money from customers in advance, a practice
that had enabled Pitney to earn more than $25 million a year in the
``float,'' or interest income.
</P>
<P>
   Although operating earnings remained healthy, by 1995 investors
had had enough and share prices plunged. ``We gave them too many
bad surprises,'' Critelli recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the task forces came back with a few surprises of
their own. Digital technologies, they reported, were adding new
ways of communicating, yet not replacing old ones, so Pitney was
not facing a zero-sum game. But if Pitney was to be a player in a
digitally integrated world, they said, it could no longer let its
mailing, fax and other divisions do their own thing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Critelli has been transforming the company from a
decentralized group of stand-alone businesses into Team Pitney.
</P>
<P>
   He has combined its office-equipment sales forces so that
customers could have one-stop shopping for copiers, faxes and
mailing equipment. Last year the mailing systems and
financial-services division, which helps customers finance major
Pitney Bowes purchases, moved to a joint profit-and-loss statement.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president for fax sales, a division that has better
long-term relationships with customers than the copier division,
just became vice president for copiers.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney's executive leadership council, once a tiny group of
senior people, now includes more than a dozen managers, who meet
monthly. Last year Critelli created a central planning department.
And he ruled that divisional chief financial officers, including
European ones, be appointed out of Stamford. ``We want them to be
loyal to the company, not just to the people who hired them,''
Critelli said.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important for driving the culture change home,
he has changed compensation plans so that managers have a personal
stake in the whole company's performance, not just their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really an incentive to help each other out now,''
Suzanne Grey, the new vice president for corporate strategy, said.
</P>
<P>
   The newly knit teams are already going after new markets. Small
businesses are a prime target. Two years ago Pitney teamed up with
Brother Industries _ a big move into collegiality for what had been
a pretty insular company _ to introduce the Personal Post Office, a
set of low-end mailing machines aimed at small businesses, and it
has been fervently pursuing that market ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The company is testing a Pitney Bowes Visa card, and is offering
to help small businesses create direct mail and Internet campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the move to digital meters looks as if it might be a
financial blessing for Pitney. They require fewer inspections and
rarely need repairs. They enable customers to reload postage by
telephone, a convenience that will allow Pitney to raise its rental
charges, and to collect reloading fees.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, companies reload their meters five times a year.
``Even at just a $10 fee, that's $50 per meter that goes straight
to the bottom line,'' Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney, said.
</P>
<P>
   Digital meters will enable Pitney to offer customers the option
to print logos or marketing messages along with postage. They will
also let the postage on, say, prepaid return envelopes, carry
electronic code that can send signals back to the mail's originator
when they are mailed _ for example, it could signal to a utility
company that is about to cut off a customer's electricity that a
return envelope, presumably with a check, is in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Envelopes, stamps, all kinds of documents are going to get a
whole lot smarter,'' said Maynard Benjamin, executive director of
Papercom Alliance Inc., an inter-industry group formed in 1995 to
study how the Internet will affect the use of mail. The question,
of course, is whether Pitney will continue to grow smarter with
them.

COMMENTARY: IT'S TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (af)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is now clear that President Clinton looked the American
people in the eye last January and lied. Monday he acknowledged the
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he earlier
denied. He has betrayed his family, his party and his country. But
we now have three stark choices: Impeach him, forgive him or limp
along with him, berating him at every step and never allowing
anyone to forget what he did. There is no stomach in the country
for impeachment. There is too much at stake for the country to limp
along for two more years. It's time to forgive _ not for his sake,
but for ours, not because his affairs are unimportant, but because
ours are more important.
</P>
<P>
   It's time now for the first Democratic president since FDR to be
elected for a second term to actually  &UR; begin &LR;  his second term. That
means Clinton has got to give up this crazy notion that his primary
political role is to be Al Gore's campaign manager for the year
2000 election and to instead start fulfilling his own agenda,
whether it's Social Security reform, education reform, child-care
reform, campaign finance reform, tobacco legislation or expansion
of free trade _ all of which will require his stepping on some
traditional Democratic constituencies. The president talks a good
game on many of these issues, but he has yet to really put his
shoulder to the wheel behind most of them or to put them in
concrete legislative form.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the president to make clear exactly what his Iraq
policy is, which simply is not clear anymore. What is clear is that
the administration is playing games _ trying to shift
responsibility for Iraq policy from the White House to the United
Nations, which is to shift it to nowhere. What is clear is that
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has signaled the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, that the administration does not
want to stir up Saddam Hussein with any surprise inspections right
now. If the Clintonites walk away from their responsibilities on
Iraq it is the end of their foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is time that the leaderless Republican Party developed a
serious domestic agenda (beyond arguing that shrinking government
and ending abortion will solve all our problems), as well as a
foreign policy befitting a superpower. Since Bill Clinton came to
office the Republicans have spent much of their time just living
off his misbehavior. On foreign policy they have either offered
drive-by criticism, in which they drive by the White House, shout
some epithet and then drive on, or adopted utterly irresponsible
positions. These range from base pandering on the Middle East to
indulgence of fringe congressional Republicans who want to hold up
key foreign-policy funding for institutions like the IMF unless the
U.S. stops all support for family planning, to mindlessly slashing
the State Department's budget _ an outrage at a time when America's
global responsibilities, and economic opportunities, have never
been greater.
</P>
<P>
   Without a serious Republican foreign policy, it makes it so much
easier for the Clintonites to be unserious too.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time now we have defined this era as the post-Cold
War era. That is, we have defined this era by what it is not. It is
not the Cold War. But it is time we define it by what it is. It is
an era of stunningly rapid change in everyone's workplaces, jobs,
communities, educational demands and government responsibilities.
It is an era in which corporations have never been bigger and yet
individuals have never been more empowered _ to do good or ill. It
is an era in which America has no single big enemy, but many, many
smaller ones. It is an age when the gap between rich and poor is
widening faster and faster. It is an integrated era in which the
biggest threats to U.S. stability come from a weak Japanese
economy, which we can't control, and a computer chip problem called
Y2K, which we can't see.
</P>
<P>
   It is an era in which the U.S. and the world needs a president
who  &UR; gets &LR;  these issues. The good news about Bill Clinton is that
he does get them. The bad news is that even before the Lewinsky
affair, this president was having trouble developing, and passing,
the legislation for this new era. But he may now be getting a
second chance to begin his second term _ a chance  &UR; he &LR;  doesn't
deserve but we do.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hoping for too much that Bill Clinton will take this
opportunity to be the president he has the potential to be. But
Lord knows it's time.

MEDIA FILLS AIRWAVES WITH HYPE _ UNTIL THE LEAKS BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nothing less than what CNN's Bernard Shaw called ``a
presidency on the line,'' reporters spent much of Monday waiting
impatiently for the outcome of President Clinton's unprecedented
grand jury testimony. And by the 6:30 p.m. network news, a
breathless media announced nothing more than what had been reported
days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eerie time,'' said NBC's Tim Russert on cable network
MSNBC. There is ``obviously pain in the media because no one has
relished covering a story as squalid as this.''
</P>
<P>
   What made it eerier was the lengthy wait for confirmation of a
story that many news outlets had reported long before the testimony
began about 1 p.m. Minutes after that testimony concluded about
6:25 p.m., the networks announced that the president had indeed met
expectations and acknowledged a relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange symbol of Monday's media vigil, CNN initially ran
an ``elapsed time'' clock showing how long the president had been
testifying. The ticking clock was a metaphor for a day in which
much news from the White House watch was so trivial as to provide
relief from the overwhelming tension.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, MSNBC's Brian Williams reported that a
boombox had been installed in the federal courthouse to keep
reporters from overhearing Clinton's testimony. Less than an hour
later, CNN's Bob Franken reported that it had been removed. Shortly
after 2 p.m., Russert announced that White House staffers _
participating in a kind of gallows-humor wagering pool _ were
betting that Clinton would use the word ``inappropriate'' rather
than ``improper'' to describe his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, news reports suggesting the direction of Clinton's
testimony began to proliferate with Friday's New York Times Page 1
screaming headline: ``President Weighs Admitting He Had Sexual
Contacts.'' By Sunday night, that buzz had amplified into a roar.
(The Political Hotline newsletter noted that last weekend featured
30 hours of special Lewinsky-related television programming.)
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``National Town Meeting'' Sunday night, correspondent
John King reported that Clinton would acknowledge an
``inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.'' At the same
time, ABC anchor Peter Jennings said the ``betting money'' in
Washington was that the president would change his story and admit
to some wrongdoing. On MSNBC, Williams described Washington as a
city leaking like a sieve and predicted that the president would
``admit to some sort of relationship here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a story Monday morning, Washington Post media critic Howard
Kurtz compared all this reporting and punditry to ``the pregame
hype before the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the kickoff arrived and Clinton began testifying, news
became very rare. In the search for public opinion Monday
afternoon, a CNN reporter stopped in a Little Rock, Ark.,
restaurant to sample public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I care who the president sleeps with?'' said one woman with
a syrupy Southern accent. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Illinois State Fair near the Springfield home of
``Honest Abe'' Lincoln, another citizen told MSNBC that if Clinton
admitted to a sexual relationship, ``I think he has totally
diminished the office of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day _ and the president's testimony _ dragged on, the
talk inevitably turned to the political implications. On CNN's
``Inside Politics,'' Jeff Greenfield said Clinton was probably
doomed to a ``crippled presidency,'' and former presidential
advisor David Gergen predicted that anywhere from 30 percent to 40
percent of the population would favor resignation or impeachment if
Clinton acknowledged a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the surest sign of desperation to fill the long hours before
Clinton finished answering questions, CNN ran the inevitable
navel-gazing story about the horde of journalists descending on the
White House. Mercifully, the testimony broke up about a half-hour
later and the official leaking began.

A MYSTICAL AURA OVER GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 23)  
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cool mist from the nearby Caucasus Mountains enveloped the
stately Sveti-tskhoveli Cathedral as a bus full of Orthodox monks
pulled up in front one afternoon last spring. After stepping off,
they formed a single file led by the local bishop. Bearded and clad
in flowing robes, they walked slowly around the cathedral, their
chants adding to the evocative spirituality that surrounds this
place.
</P>
<P>
   After completing their circuit, the monks entered the cathedral
and greeted priests inside. As they offered a benediction beneath
the frescoes and towering dome, three young nuns beside the altar
began to sing in lilting harmony, sounding as if they could compete
with any doo-wop combo in the world. A while later the monks filed
out, stopping to kiss gold-framed icons of Georgian saints.
</P>
<P>
   A mystic aura hangs over Sveti-tskhoveli, about 15 miles north
of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, and over the many other
churches and monasteries that dot Georgia's verdant countryside.
During a 10-day trip there, I made a special effort to visit these
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, Georgia's famous religious buildings constitute
a magnificent architectural and ecclesiastical heritage. Their
ascetic facades, great domes, towering round spires, intricate
relief sculptures and majestic interiors have made them a central
part of the Georgian consciousness, contributing to a sense of
nationhood that has held this land together through successive
invasions and conquests.
</P>
<P>
   They teach a visitor much about the history of a country that is
again emerging as a force in regional politics and hopes to become
a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has not had an easy time of independence, which it
declared in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union. A nation of
4.5 million about the size of West Virginia, it has been shaken by
civil conflict. Even today nearly one-fourth of its territory,
including some famous Black Sea resorts, is controlled by
separatist groups.
</P>
<P>
   These regions and places near them are out of bounds for most
visitors, but much of the country is completely peaceful, thanks
largely to the wise leadership of President Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists who are beginning to arrive in small numbers are
rediscovering Georgia's wonders: high mountains and vast expanses
of meadows, unspoiled villages of warmly hospitable people and a
remarkable architectural tradition that reached its peak in dozens
of churches, cathedrals and monasteries where visitors are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Georgian Orthodox Church is full of legends
as rich and amazing as its edifices. Touches of the secular and
even the pagan are often close to the surface. One of the grand
columns supporting Sveti-tskhoveli, for example, is ringed with
carved grapevines, a vivid tribute to Georgia's age-old love of
wine.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern facade, which dates from the fifth century, two
carved bulls' heads emerge boldly from the masonry, apparently
reflecting pre-Christian beliefs. And on the northern facade is a
carving of an arm and hand, with the fingers clutching a bevel.
This is not a freemason's symbol, as it first appears, but a
reference to an eerie tale from the 11th century, when much of the
present cathedral was built.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story, a renowned architect named Arsukidze was
commissioned to rebuild the original fifth-century basilica. He
succeeded triumphantly, creating what one historian has called a
``masterpiece of the early Georgian Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   But a royal minister who had been Arsukidze's mentor was
outraged that his pupil had so brilliantly surpassed him, and
ordered his right hand severed as punishment. An inscription above
the carving reads: ``This is the hand of Arsukidze, servant of God.
Pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is only one of many connected with this cathedral.
Another is about Sidonia, a first-century convert to Christianity
who is said to have died from the emotion that surged through her
as she clutched Christ's robe. Sidonia's brother was said to have
bought the robe from a Roman soldier, and in death she held it so
tightly that it could not be pried from her grasp. She was buried
with it beneath what is now the floor of Sveti-tskhoveli.
</P>
<P>
   This story, according to Georgian theology, makes
Sveti-tskhoveli the second most sacred place in the Christian
world, following only the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in
Jerusalem. To symbolize the tie between the two, a scale model of
the Holy Sepulcher was built inside Sveti-tskhoveli 700 years ago.
The gold that originally covered it was later stolen by Tamerlane,
but the model, which is about the height of a man, remains full of
intricate detail.
</P>
<P>
   Like most foreigners who come to Georgia, I began my trip in
Tbilisi, the capital. Only a few years ago Tbilisi was in ruins as
rival factions fought for control, bringing the country to its
knees and leading many to wonder if it could survive. Today the
headquarters of one faction is a school, while another is being
renovated and is to emerge next year as a luxury hotel. Buses run
regularly and restaurants are opening.
</P>
<P>
   Tbilisi's main avenue, Rustaveli Prospekt, reflects the city's
contrasts, with chic boutiques facing a hotel overflowing with
refugees from civil conflicts. It is an enjoyable place to walk,
but I preferred the old town, a warren of streets and buildings
that is also home to the Sioni Cathedral, the seat of Georgian
Orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a church on this site since about 600 A.D., and
most of the existing edifice dates to the 13th century. Its walls
and ceilings are completely covered with murals, including some
startlingly modern ones on the high rear wall. Facing the altar is
an elaborate wooden throne whose armrests are supported by carved
griffins, mythological beasts not normally associated with
Christianity. The Georgian patriarch sits here when he comes for
mass.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I visited, a priest in an immaculate white-and-orange
robe was kneeling in prayer. A trio of novices chanted from one
corner, and a quartet of kerchiefed young women answered with their
own chants from another corner. Hundreds of small candles flickered
through the dim light, and the scent of incense hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a vendor of icons refused to sell me or my Georgian
friend a hand-painted portrait on wood of St. Nino, one of the
great figures of Georgian Christianity. She did not think a
foreigner would properly revere it, and after interrogating my
friend decided that she, too, was insufficiently religious to
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   St. Nino was a young woman from Cappadocia who, in the third or
fourth century, set out to spread the Christian faith. Guided by
what she said was divine inspiration, she made her way to Georgia
and was able to cure the beloved monarch, Queen Nana, of what had
been considered a fatal illness.
</P>
<P>
   Later she is said to have saved Nana's husband, King Mirian,
when he was lost in a wilderness and abandoned by the pagan idols
to whom he prayed for deliverance. After these incidents the royal
family embraced Christianity and decreed it to be the official
state religion.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Nana and King Mirian are buried at the Samtavro monastery
on the outskirts of the town of Mtskheta, only a few miles from the
Sveti-tskhoveli Cathedral. Samtavro is a tranquil and intimate
place, a complex of four buildings set among grassy groves. I was
greeted by a group of nuns sitting outside drinking wine in memory
of one of their departed companions. They told me that St. Nino
herself had often prayed at this site.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Samtavro church, made of flat stone bricks and
topped with a classic round steeple, dates to the first half of the
11th century. Frescoes that once covered the walls, like many in
Georgia, were whitewashed by 19th-century czarists or 20th-century
bolsheviks. The church has some fine details of carved stone, but
the simple coffins of the two ancient monarchs are its most
affecting feature.
</P>
<P>
   From Samtavro I drove to the top of a high cliff outside
Mtskheta, which was Georgia's ancient capital, to visit one of the
country's oldest churches. The Dzhvari Church of the Holy Cross was
built in the sixth century, supposedly on a spot where St. Nino had
overseen the destruction of pagan idols and erection of a Christian
cross 200 years earlier. A small and harmonious gem of early
Georgian architecture, not in perfect condition, it has mercifully
been left alone by restorers.
</P>
<P>
   Reliefs on the facade depict early Georgian monarchs, including
one kneeling in front of Jesus Christ and the archangels Gabriel
and Michael. Icons decorate the walls inside, among them several
portraits of St. Nino and her patron, Queen Nana.
</P>
<P>
   But Dzhvari is not an intricately ornamented church, and it
conveys an air of quiet religiosity. Its location and sweeping
views over the confluence of two rivers, as well as its role as the
symbol of Christianity's triumph in Georgia, combine with its
austere architecture to make it a deeply memorable place.
</P>
<P>
   No trip to Georgia is complete without a visit to the ancient
wine-growing region of Kakheti, where every village claims to
produce the world's finest wine. Georgian wine is available at
cafes and restaurants, but is best sampled in private homes. In
places like Kakheti, where villagers feel almost insulted if
visitors will not sit down and share their wine, it is a challenge
to balance thirst and good manners with sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   Before sitting down to sample the local wine, I stopped at the
ruins of the sixth-century fortress and cathedral complex at
Ninotsminda. The walls, built to protect the complex from Persian
invaders in the 16th century, are in fine condition, and what
remains of the cathedral is even older than the one at Dzhvari.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of my visit was a climb up the four-story bell
tower, in which each floor is designed in a different style and
each has a fireplace around which monks warmed themselves for many
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Tbilisi, I realized that I had not visited the city's
most visible church, the Metekhi Church of the Virgin, which is
perched on a rocky hill overlooking the old town. I was especially
interested in it because of its connection with one of Georgia's
greatest leaders, Queen Tamara. Together with St. Nino and Queen
Nana, she reflects a remarkably strong female influence over the
course of Georgian history.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th, 12th and early 13th centuries were Georgia's golden
age. The age was launched by the formidable king known as David the
Builder, who defeated Muslim armies and captured Tbilisi but
established a policy of religious tolerance and encouraged art and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   It reached a peak under David's great-granddaughter Tamara, who
ruled from 1184 to 1212 and presided over an epoch that produced
the national epic poem, Shota Rustaveli's ``The Knight in the
Tiger's Skin.'' Rustaveli dedicated the poem to her, and some
historians suspect they were lovers.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a church at the Metekhi site since the earliest
days of Georgian Christianity. On the same site another Georgian
heroine, St. Shushanik, was buried after being tortured to death
for refusing to renounce Christianity in 544.
</P>
<P>
   David the Builder erected a palace here, and here Queen Tamara
married her second husband, an Ossetian prince whom she chose after
divorcing the ambitious Russian plotter who had been imposed on her
by courtiers. In the 19th century czarist authorities built a
prison on the site, where many revolutionaries and dissidents,
among them Maxim Gorky, were incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   The present edifice, built in the 13th century, is made of
sandstone blocks and topped with a golden cross. While certainly
not the most moving of Georgia's churches, it is perhaps the most
symbolic. Inside there are four portraits of Queen Tamara,
including a full-length one in which she wears a richly jeweled
crown, an intricately embroidered robe and golden bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church stands an imposing equestrian statue of King
Vakhtang Gorgasali, who ruled in the fifth century and played an
important role in consolidating Georgian Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Standing under it you can see not just the old town but the
surrounding hills. Try to ignore the enormous and tasteless British
Airways billboard that defaces what was once a regal hillside, and
gaze out at the towering, inspiring statue of Mother Georgia, the
all-inclusive national symbol and perhaps not coincidentally a
female. She holds a sword in one hand to symbolize Georgia's will
to resist enemies, and a wine goblet in the other to show the
pleasures she offers to her friends.

CROWD ADDS CADENCE TO THE SOAP OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outside the White House gates Monday, many of
President Clinton's constituents came to debate, to protest, and to
say the sex-and-coverup scandal is a national soap opera they hoped
would end.
</P>
<P>
   The day's saga even had a theme song or two.
</P>
<P>
   Bolaman Sarumi played his rhythm-and-blues recording ``Let
President Clinton alone. Let him be'' on a boombox and passed out
free cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to send a message to America that people should
just let the president do his job,'' explained Sarumi, 45, from
Sacramento, who recorded the tune with his group, Bola-Monet.
</P>
<P>
   One man, who appeared to be homeless and refused to give his
name, alluded to the daytime drama. ``We've only got one life to
live. We're all sinners,'' he kept repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds who gathered outside the White House while
Clinton was inside testifying for the grand jury said they didn't
care if the president had had a sexual relationship with former
intern Monica S. Lewinsky and lied to the country about it. Few
said the president should be impeached over the matter, and most
said they wished it would all go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who's had an affair would lie about it. It's not a big
deal,'' said Susan Gandy, 35, a homemaker from Kershaw, S.C., who
stopped by the White House during a day of sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Gandy and other
tourists _ as well as nearby workers on lunch breaks _ were greeted
by a throng of television reporters doing standups on the lawn and
several demonstrators yelling or singing.
</P>
<P>
   Six protesters, calling themselves the Clinton Snowjob Removal
Squad, offered their own song to the tune of ``O, Susannah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's coming from the White House with a girl upon his knee
... Oh, I'm freezing in a blizzard of Clinton lies. The snow job's
piled up so high that now it's reached my thighs,'' they sang,
prompting laughter from tourists _ and reporters _ encircling them.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby 17th Street, passing drivers honked their car horns at
four demonstrators whose signs read: ``Peaches for impeachment''
and ``Perjury is an impeachable offense.'' The group, calling
themselves the Clinton Investigation Commission, passed out peaches
with stickers saying ``Monday, Aug. 17. Impeachment begins...''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Derek Anunciation, 31, a pastor from Huntington Beach,
Calif., gripped the White House fence as he prayed on his knees:
``The Bible says our leaders are not just chosen by us; they're
chosen by God. We need to trust God's judgment that he picked the
right person to lead us.''
</P>
<P>
   One man slashed at his throat with a screwdriver, leaving his
neck bloody with a superficial flesh wound. The 26-year-old was
sent to a hospital for treatment; US Park Police would not release
his name. Police said no charges were filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the man shouted that the United States should be
worried about Iraq or Iran _ it was unclear which country he
mentioned _ instead of the president's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   But most people had comments similar to Richard Bursch, a
management analyst on his lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everybody else, I think Clinton hasn't told the whole
story, but he has done a great job as a president,'' Bursch said.
``The economy is stable. President Clinton has supported some very
important policies, including ones on education and racial
relations, and I don't think anything else matters.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 20, 1997, as an ebullient Bill Clinton took
the oath of office for the second term that he hoped would secure
his place in history, he returned to a theme that had been at the
core of his claim to be a new kind of Democrat, declaring: ``Each
and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal
responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our
neighbors and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one year later, Clinton learned that Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr was investigating allegations that the president had
started a sexual affair with a White House intern in 1995, and then
tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Had the man who won the presidency speaking out for the people
who ``play by the rules'' once more surrendered to a lifelong
compulsion to bend and break them?
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, Clinton was still in denial about the
affair, one close friend of the president said Monday, and only the
pained reaction of aides and advisers as he began to acknowledge
the truth to them over the weekend seemed to make the situation
real.
</P>
<P>
   How a man of such surpassing intellect and such protean
political talents could indulge in such reckless conduct _ at a
time when he knew a special prosecutor was already scrutinizing his
administration and his own re-election still hung in the balance _
remains the most puzzling question about William Jefferson Clinton.
But it is not a new question, and in some ways it was entirely
predictable that this president should have come to this pass, his
promise once again shadowed by his shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton has always been convinced he could outsmart,
outtalk, outcharm and outlast any adversary, and very often, enough
to confirm that conviction, he has. In the darkest days of the 1992
primaries, he dared to campaign on a platform of personal
responsibility, despite widespread questions about his own marital
fidelity, marijuana use and draft record, and widespread doubt that
his answers were candid or complete. In his first term, he shifted
ground on issues so many times that even his best friends sometimes
confessed they did not know where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again in the risky running melodrama of his public
life, he has treated the truth as an a la carte menu.
</P>
<P>
   Last Jan. 21, as news of the allegations involving Monica
Lewinsky came out, Clinton told National Public Radio: ``I don't
know any more about it than I've told you, and any more about it,
really, than you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, one friend said Monday, ``The president told me
he never had sex with Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such sweeping elisions of reality lie far beyond the
ken of conventional political analysis. But professionals who have
studied the arc of Clinton's life and career have suggested some
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people wish to think well of themselves,'' wrote Stanley
Renshon, a political scientist and psychoanalyst at New York
University in his 1996 study of Clinton, ``High Hopes.'' ``However,
Bill Clinton appears to have come to believe the  &UR; best &LR;  of himself,
and either to avoid or discount evidence from his own behavior that
all is not as he believes it to be. He attributes to himself the
most sincere and best of motives. His errors, when acknowledged,
are the result of basically correct efforts gone temporarily awry,
misunderstandings that, if one knew more of what  &UR; he &LR;  knew, would
disappear or be mitigated, or else are attributable to naivete and
inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton comes by his capacity for denial and
compartmentalization naturally. They were among the qualities that
allowed his widowed mother, Virginia Kelley, to persevere after
Clinton's father died three months before he was born, and that
allowed Clinton to make what most critics regarded as a splendid
State of the Union address just days after the intern scandal
broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When bad things do happen, I brainwash myself to put them out
of my mind,'' Mrs. Kelley wrote in her autobiography, published
after her death in 1994 under the president's review. ``Inside my
head, I construct an airtight box. I keep inside it what I want to
think about and everything else stays behind the walls. Inside is
white, outside is black: The only gray I trust is the streak in my
hair.''
</P>
<P>
   But gray is Clinton's favorite weapon. It has been central to
his successes _and to his setbacks. As governor of Arkansas and
then as a presidential candidate, he succeeded in blurring old
distinctions of ideology, proclaiming himself neither liberal nor
conservative but ``new.'' As president, he at first promised both a
tax cut and new spending, then raised taxes instead. Two years
later, he apologized for raising taxes too much, claiming liberal
Democrats had forced him to do so, a claim at sharp variance with
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who pledged not to raise taxes ``to pay for my
programs,'' (he raised them to cut the deficit) who said he had
never ``broken the laws of my country'' (he tried marijuana as a
Rhodes Scholar in England), who defended his campaign finance
practices by saying he had never ``changed government policy solely
because of a contribution.'' His reputation for shading the truth
grew so encrusted that he faced semi-serious questions from
reporters over trivial matters, from his golf scores to whether he
really shot two ducks on a New Year's outing in Arkansas, or just
carried in some shot by others.
</P>
<P>
   Innumerable times, Clinton has accepted responsibility and
forsaken blame. After his 1980 defeat after one term as governor of
Arkansas, his political consultant Dick Morris advised him that the
key to a comeback was to apologize for past mistakes. Clinton
resisted repeated entreaties to say he was sorry, devising his own
folksy formulation for a television commercial: ``When I was a boy,
my daddy never had to whip me twice for the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only daddy Clinton knew was an alcoholic stepfather
who sometimes beat his mother, not him. And the president has spent
a great part of his life being whipped, often quite publicly, for
repeating his own mistakes. In his very first run for office, in
1974, his girlfriend Hillary Rodham, sent her father and brother to
help on his congressional campaign, not only because she was tied
up as a lawyer on the Watergate investigation in Washington but
because, associates have recalled, she worried about the rumors of
his multiple romances on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, faced with allegations by Gennifer Flowers of a 12-year
sexual affair, Clinton said, ``That allegation is false,''
acknowledged causing pain in his marriage and largely put to rest
an issue that had derailed the 1988 campaign of Gary Hart. But
under oath in his deposition in the Paula Jones civil suit this
year, the president acknowledged sexual contact with Ms. Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Clinton has occasionally articulated a personal
hierarchy of relative wrongdoing, once blurting out in a
conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One that it was the
moneychangers in the temple who really made Jesus mad, not the
adulterous woman, of whom Jesus said in the book of John: ``He that
is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who was forced to resign on the day of the president's
renomination _ after his own affair with a prostitute became
public, wrote in his book, `Behind the Oval Office,'' that despite
his legendary outbursts of rage at advisers, Clinton ``doesn't
really blame others for his own errors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton savages himself for his mistakes,'' Morris wrote.
``He doesn't articulate his responsibility because his mind is so
filled with self-criticism.''

these changes would kill Pitney's profits. Actually, the company

STUDENT DEPORTED BY BURMA SAYS TRIP MADE HER AN ACTIVIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ On the road from Rangoon, a city so tense
people would not look her in the eye, to her living room in
Portsmouth, where she was blinded by television camera lights, an
activist was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I considered myself an activist before this
trip,'' said Anjanette Hamilton, 20. ``I guess I am one now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton came home Monday after an odyssey in which she was
sentenced to five years' hard labor by a Burmese court, but was
instead deported. Another trial awaited her after her arrival at
Newark International Airport early Monday morning: The naturally
shy young woman faced cameras and microphones and even appeared on
``Good Morning America'' to champion the cause of democracy in
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, known as Angie, had been visiting Burmese refugee
camps in Thailand when her group, 18 activists from six Western and
Asian nations, decided to cross the border to mark a 1988 uprising
in which 3,000 Burmese were killed. Tourist visas in hand, they
signed up for a two-day tour of Rangoon, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Aug. 8, the anniversary of the uprising, ``it was
very eerie, the city was very quiet and people were afraid to look
at us,'' Hamilton said. ``We went into one restaurant and the whole
place cleared out. There was a sense of fear and intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, hoping the city would be more relaxed, Hamilton
and the other activists took to the streets. For five minutes at a
time, they would dash down a road handing out prodemocracy
leaflets, wearing T-shirts that said, in Burmese and English,
``8/8/88: Don't forget. Don't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Hamilton looked relaxed in her American University
T-shirt. She will be a sophomore in the fall, and it was at
American that she joined a group called the Free Burma Coalition.
The organization is so devoted to ending the repressive military
regime that has held power since 1962 that its members, like
Hamilton, were willing to face detention and even prison in Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigners, picked up while handing out the leaflets, were
well-treated in detention, though kept away from embassy
representatives for several days. Even when she received the prison
term Hamilton remained calm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had confidence in our governments' ability to get us out of
there,'' she said. ``I thought maybe we'd be there a few months. It
was not that appealing, but I thought I could deal.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hamilton, putting herself at risk for the sake of a cause was
an obvious choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is completely illegal, and the only reason it's
there is because they have guns and weapons,'' she said. ``If you
don't do anything to help, you can't really feel good about
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she left the United States, Hamilton told her parents
that she would stay on the Thai border without entering Burma.
Though the group's reversal of that decision produced days of
suspense and drama, Hamilton's family stand by her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 20, she's really an adult, and it's her choice,'' said
Hamilton's mother, Alison. ``I think they know it was a little
naive, and I hope she wouldn't go into a country like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton can never return to Burma, where she would face
immediate imprisonment. But she intends to continue working for
democracy in the Southeast Asian nation. A February fund-raiser is
already in the works, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, however, she plans to recover from jet lag
and visit with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes me realize how much I love everyone here,'' she
said.

GORE ON FAMILY VACATION IN HAWAII AS CLINTON FACES LONGEST DAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton appeared Monday before the
grand jury hearing evidence in the Monica Lewinsky investigation,
hardly anybody had a better reason to be closely tuned in than Al
Gore. But in fact the vice president was about as far away from
Washington as he could get and still be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Hawaii with his wife, Tipper, and several of their
children, taking his annual August vacation, a trip that had been
`in planning' for at least three months, according to Jennifer
Devlin, a press spokeswoman for Mrs. Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president and his family always take a two-week
vacation at this time of year,'' Ms. Devlin said. ``He's staying at
a private home on one of the islands _ we're not saying which one _
and his schedule is private except that on August 25 he'll do a
Democratic fundraiser in Honolulu and also will speak to a meeting
of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he spend the day on the beach or next to the television?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing on that,'` Ms. Devlin replied.
</P>
<P>
   Any comment on the day's Washington events?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Lewinsky investigation, Gore has made no
noticeable effort to distance himself from the president but
neither has he crisscrossed the country aggressively speaking out
in defense of Clinton. Rather, he has taken the position that the
president's denial of wrongdoing seemed straighforward enough and
he saw no reason to question it.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores arrived in the islands on Aug. 11 and will depart on
Aug. 26 for San Francisco, where they will participate in several
Democratic Party events before returning to Washington on Aug. 28.
Ms. Devlin said the couple have a sentimental attachment to Hawaii,
having spent their honeymoon there in 1970 and having subsequently
returned a number of times.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on Wednesday, the Gores were spotted swimming with
dolphins in a pool at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the island of
Hawaii _ but not until after security personnel had plunged in
first to check things out.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore meets with Hawaii Democrats on Aug. 25, he likely will
face a warm and eager audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii has traditionally been dominated by Democrats. But
because of cutbacks in military spending, a decline in the farm
sector and a sharp falloff in tourism from Asia, the state is one
of the few that face economic hard times and polls indicate that,
as a result, Democratic candidates throughout the islands will need
all the help they can get in this year's elections.

RUSSIANS WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEIR NEST EGGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also RUSSIA-ECON and RUSSIA-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Monday's de facto devaluation of the ruble and
rescheduling of government debt is supposed to spare the Russian
government financial ruin. Then there is Valeriya Yan, who is not
being let off so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ms. Yan set a goal: to raise $24,000 so she and
her husband could buy a two-room apartment for themselves and their
10-year-old son, away from the tiny one they share with two
parents. She gave up teaching for a mindless but more lucrative job
routing calls for a paging service for $300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, a welder, is seldom paid, but they managed
nevertheless to squirrel away several thousand dollars' worth of
rubles. Monday afternoon she was hitting the currency shops that
glut Moscow's Arbat, converting her rubles into German marks at a
rate that only hours before seemed exorbitant. By her calculations,
the family nest egg bought one-third fewer marks than it would have
Monday morning, before devaluation was announced. ``I'm simply in
shock,'' she said. ``I'm doing this because I don't know what's
going to happen to my money.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the answer is simple: Ms. Yan's rubles, along with
everyone else's, will buy a lot less from now on. After striving
for weeks to hold the key exchange rate at about 6.2 rubles per
dollar, the government gave up and announced Monday morning that it
would let the ruble sink as low as 9.5 rubles per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, currency traders who had been selling dollars for
6.3 and 6.4 rubles raised their rates to 7.5, 8 and even the
maximum 9.5 rubles per dollar. Rates for German marks and other
major currencies took similar routes.
</P>
<P>
   The harder questions, however, are where the value of the ruble
will eventually settle, and who will be most hurt by the change.
The government offered no hint in its announcement Monday, and so
millions of Russians are wrestling with the same dilemma: whether
to convert their rubles into a stable currency, and suffer a big
and immediate loss, or hold onto them and risk losing even more to
devaluation and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Monday that there was no way to predict how many
rubles would buy a dollar in six months _ or in six weeks. Even
controlled devaluations like the ones announced Monday can easily
spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the price, Russian consumers could suffer most broadly
because devaluation raises the prices of imports _ and in Russia,
some 50 per cent of consumer goods and services are imported.
</P>
<P>
   The share of imports has risen swiftly in everyday commodities
like food, automobiles and household goods, where the availability
of better-quality Western products has been among the few widely
enjoyed benefits of capitalism _ and one that may now diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, where dollars are an unofficial second currency and as
much as 80 per cent of consumer products are imported, could suffer
disproportionately. The city is a center of Western investment and,
as Ms. Yan's nervousness demonstrates, a place where the dollar can
sway even purely local commodities like real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are already calculating that the banking and
currency problems spell the end of a boom that has changed the
Moscow skyline and created thousands of high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Russian hasn't felt it up till now,'' said Jesse
Loeb, a trader in the Moscow office of Regent European Securities.
``You're starting to see a major cash crunch on the street economy,
and that's going to get worse now. You're going to see a lot of
Mercedes 500s and 600s for sale. You'll be able to buy them for the
price of a Nissan. Whoever's in possession of cash now is king.''
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation has an upside, but largely for corporations, and
only some of them at that. Exporters like the oil industry gain,
because devaluation makes exports cheaper and thus more
competitive. Importers suffer, as would many companies whose
revenues are measured in rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Though Moscow was neck-deep in rumors Monday, there was scant
evidence of panic or even, at most places, lines of worried bank
customers. Some banks posted signs saying they had closed, like a
downtown Mezhkombank with a sign saying ``technical reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Many automatic teller machines did not work, or dispensed only
rubles. Currency traders interviewed Monday generally reported that
their business declined after rates were raised. But some said
business was greater than usual, and one reported a customer who
sought to change $50,000 in rubles into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers of big-ticket items closed, perhaps out of
confusion over what their goods were worth. And on the western edge
of downtown, near the gingerbread-style station that serves trains
to Belarus, an unemployed handyman named Kolya Nikolayev was
competing with a nearby currency window, trying to buy dollars from
queued-up customers for resale at a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   Like more than a few Russians, Nikolayev said the latest crisis
worried him not even a bit. ``Maybe it's because it's happened so
many times,'' he said. ``And because I have no money. I won't lose
anything.''

LAWYERS PLAY KEY ROLE IN PRESIDENT'S HISTORIC TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton testified before a federal
grand jury Monday, six lawyers played a role in the historic moment
_ three on his side, three as prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five hours, the president responded to questions
from the team headed by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Like
their boss, Starr's deputies have spent much of their careers
working for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who grew up in Thalia and Centerville before moving to
San Antonio, was appointed four years ago to take over the
investigation of President Clinton's business dealings,
specifically the failed Arkansas land deal called Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia under President Reagan, and President Bush
tapped him for solicitor general, the lawyer who argues government
cases before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   While working as independent counsel, he kept his $1
million-a-year law practice until he took a leave of absence in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's top deputy in Washington is Jackie M. Bennett Jr., who
supervises day-to-day operations, staff attorneys and paralegals,
and FBI computer and security experts.
</P>
<P>
   As senior trial lawyer in the Justice Department's Public
Integrity Division in the 1990s, he oversaw the department's
investigation and prosecution of San Antonio Rep. Albert
Bustamante, who was found guilty of bribery and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Emmick joined Starr's staff a year ago after spending
almost 16 years in the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. For
seven years, Emmick was head of the office's public corruption and
government fraud section.
</P>
<P>
   Emmick was involved in the secret taping of Monica Lewinsky in
January. That tape was used by Starr to convince Attorney General
Janet Reno and a three-judge panel to expand his investigation to
include a possible cover-up of the president's relationship with
the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's side of the room Monday, were two law partners _
David E. Kendall and Nicole K. Seligman _ and Charles F.C. Ruff,
the White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his voluble client, Kendall prefers not to speak
publicly, especially to reporters. In a speech to the American Bar
Association, he told colleagues that he lives by three words when
dealing with the press: ``Off the record.''
</P>
<P>
   A Quaker who grew up in Indiana, Kendall was arrested 10 times
at civil rights protests during the Mississippi Freedom Summer in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Wabash College in 1966, and two years later
attended Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship. In 1971,
Kendall graduated from Yale Law School, where he overlapped a year
with Clinton and two years with Hillary Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-journalist, Seligman is defending her second client under
attack by an independent counsel. In the mid-1980s, a few years out
of Harvard Law School, she was paired with Brendan Sullivan to
defend Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Although friends say she is more politically in tune with
Clinton than North, Seligman keeps her politics private. She was
managing editor of the Harvard Crimson and worked for the Asian
Wall Street Journal before returning to Harvard for her law degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Lewinsky investigation is the second inquiry of a
president in which Ruff has been involved. He was a prosecutor in
the Watergate case that brought down President Nixon in 1974. This
time, he's sitting alongside the president as White House counsel _
Clinton's fifth in almost six years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike cast Ruff as a lawyer of
intellect, fairness and integrity, and some White House aides
grumble that he does not pay enough attention to the political
impact of his advice to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff has used a wheelchair since contracting a paralyzing
disease while working in Africa in the 1960s. In addition to his
days as a Watergate prosecutor (he was the fourth and final head of
that investigation), Ruff has worked as an associate attorney
general and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

JULIAN GREEN, PROLIFIC AND IDIOSYNCRATIC NOVELIST, 97 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD E. NICHOLLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julian Green, the prolific and highly idiosyncratic novelist,
playwright and memoirist who was the first American elected to the
Academie Francaise, France's gallery of 40 literary luminaries,
died on Thursday in Paris. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who had his first novel published in 1927, is believed to
have had the longest career of any major 20th-century writer. His
life was distinguished, and to a great extent defined, by startling
contrasts and contradictions. Born in Paris on Sept. 6, 1900, of
American parents, he was fascinated by his ancestors but visited
the United States infrequently, spending most of his life in
France. All but a few of his books were written in French, and he
came to be regarded as one of the preeminent stylists in the
language, on a level with Paul Valery, Marcel Proust and Andre
Gide.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the few modern writers to have his collected works
published in Gallimard's Pleiade library during his lifetime.
Although he knew many of the century's leading French writers, and
was an amused observer of their internecine battles, his own
novels, such as ``Moira'' and ``Each in His Darkness,'' owed more
to Dickens, Balzac, Hawthorne and Poe. His books consistently
received substantial attention in France, yet only intermittent,
modest coverage in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Green balanced a native reticence with a profound need to
publicly explore his psyche, to chart his long, deeply tormented
struggle to master physical desire and submit to faith, eventually
publishing 14 volumes of his journals as well as five frank volumes
of memoirs. (He and Gide, longtime friends, traded diaries so that
they could read what each had said of the other.) He was both a
devout Roman Catholic and a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Green was the youngest of seven children. His parents were from
long- established Southern families, and he recollected in a 1991
interview with Alan Riding in The New York Times that when his
father was sent to Europe in 1895 by an American firm, his mother,
given the choice between Germany and France, had decided that they
should live in Paris because ``the French had been defeated in 1870
and would understand the Southerners.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother's longing for the idealized world of her childhood,
for plantations populated by gracious ladies and courtly gentlemen,
and her stories of that lost world, made a powerful impression on
Green. ``She told us all about the splendid victories,'' he said.
``But she was always bursting into tears. She didn't tell us until
very late in the day that we had lost the war.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's success as a businessman provided the family with a
life of privilege in a well-to-do neighborhood of Paris. In ``Green
Paradise,'' the first of a quartet of memoirs devoted to his youth,
Green wrote that while his childhood appeared unremarkable, by the
age of 5 or 6 he had begun to sense a ``monstrous hunger,'' a vague
but persistent and increasingly frantic yearning for sensual
pleasure. He was horrified when, as an adolescent, he found this
free-floating appetite becoming focused on his male schoolmates. He
described the sensation as ``desire mingled with terror,'' and the
disabling power of passion was to become a constant refrain in his
work.
</P>
<P>
   He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1914. His mother died that
year, severing him, he said, from life's ``more amiable aspects.''
Devastated by the loss, he later identified his longing for the
unquestioning love she represented, and the need to dissipate the
``inexpressible solitude'' following her death, as formative
elements in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Few writers' lives have spanned so long or turbulent a period,
or been as productive. And no modern writer has charted, with more
ingenuity or energy, in more diverse ways, the weird landscape of
erotic obsession, the corrosive effects of repression or the
struggle to achieve faith in a disbelieving age.
</P>
<P>
   Green remained a courtly, serene eminence into his '90s,
writing, giving interviews and still visible around Paris. He told
an interviewer in 1990 that he could now, after a long struggle,
await death with serenity. He was looking forward, he said, ``to
standing before God ... finally to know exactly who I am, free of
all the illusions, the little lies, knowing I am going to
purgatory, and knowing I will be very happy.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Green followed France's struggle during the early years of World
War I with fervor. Impatient to serve, he joined the Red Cross in
1917 and drove an ambulance on the Italian front. He eventually
talked his way into a French artillery regiment and was a member of
the Allied occupation force in Germany. Discharged in 1919, he
enrolled in the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   While he later recalled having been fascinated by American
society, he felt isolated. He described those years as ``some of
the saddest of my life.'' It was also when a recurrent fascination
with writing displaced most other interests. He left the university
without graduating in 1921, returning to France.
</P>
<P>
   He moved back in with his family, beginning a lengthy struggle
to master his craft. Unwilling to sublimate his desires, he
renounced his faith and ``threw myself into the streets in search
of sensual pleasure.'' He was, he said, ``crucified in sex.'' Green
wrote at night, in rooms ``so small and badly lighted,'' he later
noted, ``that I had to supplement the electricity with the light of
several candles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a resonant image. The flickering light of another time
seems to fall across Green's narratives: many of his 18 novels
share with the works of such writers as Poe and Hawthorne a
fascination with extremes of behavior, corrosive secrets, obscure
passions, violence and guilt, all generated by intense, obsessive
relationships. Like the writers he admired, he had little interest
in rendering the day-to-day realities of his times or in grappling
with social themes. He did, however, study Freud and incorporate
many of the insights of the new field of psychoanalysis into his
character studies.
</P>
<P>
   His first novel, ``Avarice House'' (1926), inspired by stories
he had heard from his American relatives, deals with an innocent
young woman growing up on an isolated Virginia estate, slowly
destroyed by her mother's ferocious cupidity. The 18-year-old
heroine of his poignant novel ``Adrienne Mesurat'' struggles to
escape from the stifling proprieties of her provincial society and
tyrannical family, throwing herself into an affair that leads to
betrayals, violence and insanity. The book, published in 1927, won
the Femina Prize in France. It received enthusiastic reviews in the
United States, sold 20,000 copies, and was a selection of the
Book-of-the-Month Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Journey'' (1929) traces the complex aftermath of a
violent assault on a young woman by a frustrated lover. After
reading it, the playwright Maurice Maeterlinck described Green as
``a subterranean Balzac who trawled his miner's lamp through
shadows far denser than those to which we have become accustomed.
And what a beautiful light, when at certain moments, he comes out
of the darkness and looks at the view.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's early success, and the acclaim of such writers as T.S.
Eliot and Gide, seemed to have little impact on his imagination:
his novels (between 1926 and 1940 he produced roughly one a year)
continued to plumb extremities of behavior, dwelling on violent
encounters and characters who were often hapless victims of their
appetites. These claustrophobic, intense tales were narrated in a
prose of great precision and simplicity. Green labored to create a
distinctive style. It was particularly challenging, he told Riding,
because in modern French ``there are very few words. In the 16th
century there were 50,000 words. Today the French only use about
4,000 words. But it means there is just one word to describe a
certain thing, not two. You have to find `le mot juste.' ''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s he studied Buddhism, and his novels became more
fantastic. At the time Green knew many writers, took an interest in
the arts, and yet deftly remained outside the battles convulsing
the literary world. He and Gide developed a strong, if guarded,
friendship. Gide described Green as having ``a somber genius,'' and
wrote in his ``Diaries'' that Green ``is one of those for whom one
would demand the best of oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   As war approached, Green left Paris in 1940 and settled in
America. He prepared radio programs in French for the Allies, and
taught creative writing at several universities, including
Princeton and Harvard. He published little during this period aside
from ``Memories of Happy Days'' (1942), an elegiac memoir of his
childhood and youth that dwelt on his spiritual conflicts. He
rejoined the Roman Catholic Church in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Green's output picked up when he returned to France after the
war. But while his novels remained somber studies of romantic
excess, often dwelling on sexual obsessions, they began to exhibit
a more direct emphasis on faith. ``Moira'' (1950) and ``Each Man in
His Darkness'' (1960), generally considered his most accomplished
novels, deal with extreme events. In ``Moira'' a young man rapes
and then murders a girl; in ``Each Man in His Darkness'' a man
struggling to suppress his homosexuality is drawn into a series of
increasingly tormented relationships before being murdered by a
would-be lover who has become obsessed with him. But both novels
conclude with subtle suggestions of redemption and of the power of
faith to ``obstruct the terrible mechanism of destiny,'' in Green's
words. The protagonist of ``Darkness'' dies in serenity, having
found, the narrator says, ``a region of light.'' Hermann Hesse
described Green's novels of this period as the productions of ``a
Christian Kafka.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 Green's first play, ``South,'' was produced in Paris.
More followed, and he diversified further by writing several
screenplays. Green had issued the first volume drawn from his
``Journals'' in 1938 (he had begun keeping a daily journal in 1926,
setting down not only his meditations on faith and the flesh but
musings on literature and art and recollections of his family and
friends). In the 1940s and '50s additional volumes appeared with
regularity. Their prose was so exact and pure and their expression
of faith so serene and deeply contemplative that some critics
compared them favorably to Pascal's ``Pensees.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 his battle between ``intensely carnal and profoundly
religious sides'' of his character ended when he renounced sex.
Sexuality, he told a French interviewer, ``is an obstacle that
stands between God and man.'' He also prepared four additional
volumes of memoirs about his childhood and youth. (They were not
released in the United States until the 1990s.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Green was elected to the Academie Francaise, becoming
its first foreign member. The academy, which was founded in 1635 by
Cardinal Richelieu, restricts its membership to 40 writers, called
the immortals, elected by members and approved by the president of
France. Members are chosen primarily for their devotion to
preserving the beauty and purity of the French language.
</P>
<P>
   Green never ceased writing: his work eventually included not
only the novels, ``Journals'' and memoirs, but five plays, six
collections of essays and two works of history. It was not that he
was prolific, he told Riding, it was just that ``I am very old.''
His last major work brought him full circle. In the massive novels
``The Distant Lands'' (1991), ``The Stars of the South'' (1993) and
finally ``Dixie'' he recreated the antebellum South as his mother
had described it to him in tales that fired his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son, Jean-Eric Green.

U.N. MEDIATOR FAILS TO WIN IRAQ'S COOPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations told the Security Council
Monday that its mediator in Iraq had failed to persuade Baghdad to
resume cooperation with the two agencies trying to find and
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, diplomats and other
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq said it would not let inspectors visit sites they had not
already been to until they declared the nation free of nuclear,
chemical and biological arms and the Security Council lifted its
trade embargo, these sources said. The mediator is Prakash Shah, a
former representative of India at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's U.N. representative, Nizar Hamdoon, confirmed Baghdad's
refusal to change its position and said the inspection agencies had
been ``unjust and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon added that this was ``why we have decided to stop all
cooperation'' with the two agencies, the U.N. Special Commission,
known as Unscom, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative here, Bill Richardson, said it was now
up the Security Council and the secretary general to respond
adequately. He said the council would not allow Iraq to goad it
into ``precipitous action.'' But, he added, Iraq has ``put itself
in a box,'' so that ``sanctions are going to stay forever, or until
it complies fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Security Council condemned Iraq's action, saying
it breached the resolutions ending the Persian Gulf War as well as
the agreement that Secretary-General Kofi Annan reached in February
with President Saddam Hussein. That accord averted fresh air
strikes by the United States and Britain against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Shah was sent to Baghdad to persuade Iraq to change its mind.
But the only incentive he could offer was a vague suggestion from
Annan that if Iraq ended its latest standoff, he would favor ``a
comprehensive review'' of sanctions, though he could offer no
guarantee that the United States and Britain would permit any
easing.
</P>
<P>
   With none of its members apparently ready for another military
confrontation, the Security Council reacted calmly to news of
Shah's failure. Slovenia's representative, Danilo Turk, who hold's
the council's rotating presidency this month, said the group might
make ``an expression of opinion'' after Shah reported in person
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the council began drafting a reply to the inspection
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, by keeping the arms inspectors from visiting new
sites, Iraq is declaring that it has been disarmed and that from
now on, inspection agencies have the right to monitor only those
industrial plants they have already visited.
</P>
<P>
   The council is expected to avoid new threats at this stage and
instead will tell the inspectors to press on with their normal work
and report any obstruction they encounter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The calculation, among American and British diplomats at least,
is that by continuing to confront the council in this way, Iraq
will eventually exhaust what good will it has and force all members
to recognize its defiance, paving the way for a possible renewal of
military action.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Secretary of State Madeleine Albright implied,
writing on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Monday, when she
said that the inspection agencies ``have been clearly mandated by
the Security Council to carry out the necessary measures to disarm
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the council fails to persuade Saddam to resume
cooperation,'' she continued, ``then we will have a free hand to
use other means to support Unscom's mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   While the atomic agency thinks Iraq's nuclear weapons programs
have been effectively eradicated, Unscom is uncertain whether all
chemical and biological weapons have been accounted for after it
found traces of the nerve agent VX in missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
   After first denying that it had ever made VX, Iraq admitted
making 3.9 tons of the nerve gas but said it had never been placed
in a weapon.

RUSSIA TAKES DRASTIC STEPS TO RESCUE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: RUSSIA-SAVINGS, RUSSIA-ASSESS)  
(lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government moved hastily Monday to avert
financial collapse with a series of drastic measures, including
delaying payments for 90 days on foreign debt owed mostly by banks,
a restructuring of government bonds and the sacrifice of the ruble
to market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Monday night at 6.43 rubles to the dollar, off slightly
from Friday's level, the value of the Russian currency is now free
to float as low as 9.5, a risky step _ tantamount to devaluation _
that many fear could trigger a new round of inflation. It could
also wipe out as much as a third of the ruble's purchasing power in
an economy heavily dependent on imports.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing the ruble marks a major change in strategy for
President Boris Yeltsin's government, which after seven years of
economic reforms could point to a stable currency and a low rate of
inflation as its two major achievements. But that policy has been
overwhelmed by a crisis brought on by Russia's other economic
realities, including the insolvency of its risk-prone banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came over the weekend after Russian officials had
once again asked the nation's foreign allies for more financial
aid. Coming one month after a major drive, spearheaded by
Washington, to put together a $22.6 billion package of loans and
credits to Russia, the request was denied, and top Russian
officials on Monday acknowledged that further help from the West
was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday morning, Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko said the steps had been made necessary by the
near-collapse of Russia's banking system last week, and by the
exodus of foreign capital from Russia's markets. Foreign investors
have shunned markets here, spurred in part by the Asian financial
crisis and a drop in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures are tough ones, quite radical ones,'' said
Kiriyenko, a 36-year-old banker whose three months in office have
been marked by continuing crisis. ``But they are inevitable ones.
We do not have the right to put them off.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the ruble's downward drift hit the streets, more and
more Russians headed for banks or currency-exchange booths, looking
to retrieve their savings or convert rubles into dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official exchange rate shifted only slightly from
6.31 to 6.43 rubles to the dollar after a day of light trading on
the local currency market, some traders were offering rates as weak
as 9 rubles to the dollar, which some analysts took as hint of a
steeper devaluation to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we don't know where the ruble will settle down
and when,'' said Charles Blitzer, director of emerging-markets
research at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, Inc. ``They are
allowing it to float, and will try to use monetary policy and
currency interventions to control it. But it remains to be seen
whether they will be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the government on Monday allowed the ruble to float
within a band that now ranges from 6 to 9.50, whereas the ruble's
previous band had held its value at between 5.27 and 7.13.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which late last week was trying hard to downplay
the imploding crisis in Russia's banking system, swung into action
over the weekend amid fears that the crisis would spark a run on
the banks, and spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last Friday, when a run on the banks was starting, there
was not much they could do,'' said Holger Mueller, banking analyst
at the Moscow office of the investment concern Fleming UCB. ``By
defaulting on foreign creditors, they would like to protect the
Russian population, but I think it is quite dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, on Monday cut
Russia's long-term foreign-currency debt rating two notches from a
B_ to a CCC. Other rating agencies followed suit but noted that in
announcing the 90-day moratorium on privately held foreign debt,
the government said the obligations would be honored.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Russian economist, the package was discussed
over the weekend with officials from the International Monetary
Fund and leading Western governments. But it is not known which
elements were supported by Russia's Western allies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night John Odling-Smee, the IMF director in charge of
Russia, met with Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's special envoy to
Western financial institutions. After the meeting Chubais said the
crisis program had received lukewarm support.
</P>
<P>
   ``International monetary organizations, naturally, were not
enthusiastic about our proposal to restructure the state debt,''
Chubais told the RIA news agency. ``But they showed understanding
of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the very last moment we hoped we would be able to avoid
such steps,'' said Chubais, the architect of Russia's privatization
program. ``But unfortunately last Friday it became clear we could
not avoid them.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, was to protect the Russian banking system
from an ``unmanageable chain of bankruptcies,'' and Russia's own
budget from ``disastrous scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Russian banking crisis erupted last week, economists
debated whether the government would opt to restructure its
domestic debt, default or at least defer its foreign loans or
devalue its currency. In the end, as several experts noted, they
chose all of those steps.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday, Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the IMF, stressed the importance of promises made by
Russia last month when the fund approved a new $22.6 billion
package of credits and loans. He pointedly mentioned a series of
revenue-raising and budget-tightening measures due to go before the
Duma, Parliament's lower house, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be especially important for the Russian authorities to
take all necessary steps to strengthen the fiscal position,''
Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Western economists said that unless accompanied by tough
new controls imposed on some of Russia's banks, the moratorium on
bank-held debts could be interpreted abroad as a bailout for those
politically well-connected institutions that until now have thrived
on risky loan strategies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that they could not use this opportunity to
solve these problems,'' said Al Breach, chief economist at the
Russian-European Center for Economic Research. ``If they don't, the
whole thing smacks of rule by oligarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve leading Russian commercial banks announced Monday that
they would pool together to resolve their inter-bank debts and
protect depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Several banks were reported to have received special credits
from the Central Bank late last week to keep their operations going
and to protect Russian depositors, who by one estimate have $4
billion in savings deposited in private commercial banks. Eighty
percent of private Russian savings are held by the giant Sberbank,
which is fully guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's package also includes a restructuring of an estimated
$60 billion worth of Russia's domestic debt _ in particular bonds
known as GKOs and OFZs due to mature before Dec. 31, 1999. Details
of those conversions will be released on Wednesday, but experts on
Monday were expecting a variety of options, which could include a
schedule of payments staggered over several years.
</P>
<P>
   For foreign investors, the bitterest pill is the 90-day
moratorium on the foreign debts now held mostly by major Russian
banks that by late last week were already defaulting on payments.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium applies explicitly to forward ruble contracts and
loans backed by Russian government securities _ two loan mechanisms
favored by Russian bankers that have been undercut by the collapse
of Russia's financial markets and the weakened ruble. It is not
clear if the moratorium will apply to the $850 million in
syndicated loans that come due in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the IMF package was approved last month, the Russian
government has been criticized for its failure to coordinate its
response to the crisis and to clearly articulate its policy. On
Monday, Yeltsin named Boris Fyodorov, the tough-talking head of the
Russian Tax Service, as a deputy prime minister in charge of
macroeconomics, a post that some had expected to be filled by
either Chubais or Yegor Gaidar, Yeltsin's first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had said Friday that he would not interrupt his August
vacation for fear that a sudden change in plans would stir panic.
But as the crisis quickened, he returned to a country house near
Moscow over the weekend, where he held several meetings with top
officials.
</P>
<P>
   At its special session Friday, the Duma, dominated by a
Communist-led opposition, is expected to lash out at the Kiriyenko
government for the failure of its policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is total bankruptcy,'' said Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Ryzhkov, who served as prime minister of the Soviet
Union and heads a small opposition party, said: ``The collapse has
come. This will bring numerous disasters to the people.''

that voter turnout two years ago was the lowest since 1948. Roughly

CLINTON'S DAY: HISTORIC? DRAMATIC? SHAKESPEAREAN? ALL THAT AND

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a typical August day in the capital _ air
heavy with humidity, skies pewter-gray, a thunderstorm in the
afternoon, traffic slack. Vacationers' Bermuda shorts outnumbered
locals' business suits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was also a momentous day, a day like no other in the
republic's long history. For the first time ever, a president was
giving testimony to a grand jury investigating possible criminal
conduct on his part. Sitting in the ground-floor Map Room at the
White House, where Franklin D. Roosevelt kept track of the struggle
against Hitler and the Axis, Bill Clinton was grilled by his
nemesis, Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, in the kind of
taut, face-to-face confrontation that few presidents ever endure.
</P>
<P>
   Historic? Dramatic? Shakespearean in its grand conflicts? That
and more. The president's predicament, and especially the
suggestion that he had been lying from the start about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, rasped against national myth.
Truth-telling is a salient feature of American heroes, and even in
a cynical age, the images of ``Honest Abe'' Lincoln and George
Washington, who could not tell a lie, lurk in the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a play without an audience. The few who gathered
outside the White House and the E. Barrett Prettyman Court House,
where the grand jury sat, linked by closed-circuit television to
the Map Room, saw nothing and heard nothing. There were no shadows
on the wall or echoes on the wind for imagination to feast on.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the horde of camera crews on the White House lawn,
Cynthia Young, a 26-year-old social worker from Philadelphia,
sensed the magnitude of the occasion but said she felt curiously
unplugged. ``It's kind of strange walking around here and not
knowing what is actually happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government, as is its wont, ground on. The Treasury
Department sold $5.79 billion in three-month bills at an average
discount rate of 4.910 percent; the Parole Commission met in
suburban Chevy Chase, Md., to discuss its budget, and the
Environmental Protection Agency considered ways to enable people to
use home computers to detect impurities in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone in Washington waited and waited, all day long _
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, lawyers, bureaucrats,
reporters, tourists _ for word that the testimony had ended. Then
they waited some more for the president's speech to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians were on their guard, especially Republicans. But
some Democrats, including both members of Congress and presidential
aides, said privately that they felt betrayed, having doggedly
upheld Clinton's early denials only to be told at the last minute
that he was changing his story.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the president's private lawyer, Donald Kendall, came
out into the White House driveway to make what on one level sounded
like a perfunctory statement but on another sounded like a polemic
salvo in this war of words. A certain contempt dripped from his
description of a ``four-year, $40-million'' investigation that had
reached into Clinton's ``private life.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House, aides passed the four hours and more
that the president testified, accompanied only by three lawyers, by
telling each other raunchy jokes and making ribald puns _ the same
jokes, the same puns that lobbyists and others exchanged at water
coolers around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like election day,'' one presidential adviser said,
``except there aren't any exit polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Another remarked: ``Everything is on hold. You wait, hope it
goes well, but you can't do much.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can always spin. In Washington, that never stops
completely.
</P>
<P>
   So the White House let it be known that Erskine Bowles, the
chief of staff, had done his best to rally the troops at the senior
staff meeting on Monday morning. He stressed ``the importance of
sticking together,'' two participants said; he apparently did not
echo the other half of Benjamin Franklin's famous injunction to his
colleagues at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, ``We
must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson reported that he had been asked to come
to the White House at 10:30 on Sunday night, meeting for more than
two hours with Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Clintons' daughter,
Chelsea, and then with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill has a sense of embarrassment,'' Jackson reported
later. ``Hillary, as the wife, there's a sense of humiliation.
Hillary is dedicated to her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   On days like this in Washington, there is often some bizarre
incident on the periphery, and so there was Monday. As a group of
10 tourists, standing outside the iron fence running along the
north side of the White House, debated the pros and cons of the
Lewinsky matter, a man in a white shirt, sandals and jeans listened
silently. Then he bolted away, shouting that the group was
discussing the wrong issue. What mattered, he said, was starvation
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares about Clinton and Lewinsky when there's thousands of
people dying,'' he yelled, and started slashing at his own neck
with a screwdriver. Within a minute or two, Secret Service agents
put handcuffs on him.

</P>
<P>
   It was probably the most perilous day faced by the Clintons
since they met the challenge of Gennifer Flowers' allegations in
New Hampshire in 1992, one of those days with the potential to
leave an indelible mark on history. It could lead to impeachment
proceedings, even to a presidential resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Washington reacted to it with that curious mixture of
fascination and distaste, like a young student confronting
something particularly gross in biology lab, that has characterized
the nation's response all along.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent the day in the private quarters of the White
House. Monica Lewinsky's whereabouts was one of the day's minor
mysteries. But another of the president's closest confidants, Vice
President Al Gore, was vacationing with his family about as far
away as he could get while staying in the United States. Aides
reported that he was somewhere in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Few have as much at stake as Gore, whose political future is
unalterably linked to Clinton's. If Clinton approaches the end of
his term in 2000 in good shape, Gore's chances of winning the
presidency will be substantial; if not, not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is this,'' one of the vice president's intimates
said, talking a little politics because it helped to pass the time,
``will Al Gore be George Bush, inheriting the magic mantle of
Ronald Reagan, or will he be Hubert Humphrey, drinking from Lyndon
Johnson's poisoned chalice?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chose the Map Room for his testimony and for his
subsequent nationally televised speech because of its very
ordinariness. Aides said that he wanted nothing at all showy.
</P>
<P>
   The room, where some of Clinton's infamous fund-raising coffees
were held, is decorated with American antique furniture in the
Chippendale style from New England and Philadelphia, with a Heriz
rug on the floor. A portable lap desk that belonged to Thomas
Jefferson is in the room, as is the last combat situation map drawn
for President Roosevelt, nine days before he died.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the president's testimony was transmitted across
town to the Prettyman court house, which is named for a former
federal appellate judge. Audio and video were carried on an
underground fiber-optic cable, scrambled to prevent eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   At the courthouse, between 16 to 23 grand jurors, seated in the
spectators' section of Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's courtroom,
watched on two large television sets. Reporters were kept 80 feet
away lest they overhear anything. It was not immediately known
whether the jurors availed themselves of a special telephone link
to suggest questions to Starr.

<P>
   MADRAS, India _ Among great melodramas about politically
powerful women _ the Evitas and Imeldas, the risen and fallen, the
adored and despised _ India these days offers Jayalalitha Jayaram,
a former movie star whose fickle control over a 27-vote bloc in
Parliament threatens to topple the five-month-old Hindu nationalist
government.
</P>
<P>
   Notoriously imperious, clad in ornate capes, Jayalalitha, as she
is known, was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, a state in south
India, from 1991 to 1996, when she was voted out of office in
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish displays of sudden wealth gave credibility to
allegations of corruption, and she faces charges in state courts in
eight serious scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Her political resurrection occurred after the national elections
in February.
</P>
<P>
   With no single political group any longer dominant in India,
regional parties have assumed extraordinary importance. Her state
party, the All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam, won 18 seats in
Parliament and then, in an alliance, picked up nine more.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won 178 seats but
needed to forge a coalition with 18 smaller parties to form a
government. Jayalalitha's 27 votes made her Bharatiya Janata's
biggest partner.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition governments often make for the strangest of
bedfellows, and the challenge is always to keep enough fellows in
the bed. Bharatiya Janata has long declared itself a party of good
governance. But its mating with Jayalalitha's party made it seem
compromised and left it vulnerable to the demands and tantrums of a
woman preoccupied with the prospect of prison.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, in what has become a staple of Indian headlines,
Jayalalitha, 50, threatened to abandon the coalition. She promised
a major announcement but then delayed it, saying ``appropriate
decisions'' would be made at ``an appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest complaint is that she was ignored during the
settlement of an interstate water dispute, but she has made no
secret of her chief problem with the agreement. She said there had
been an implied promise to invoke an article of the Constitution
that permits the national government to dismiss a state government.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil Nadu's current Chief Minister, Jayalalitha's archrival, is
Muthuvel Karunanidhi, himself often accused of ethical lapses and
moral amnesia. If the government had dismissed him, the state's
willpower to pursue criminal cases against Jayalalitha might well
have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her urgent need is to get out of these cases,'' said Cho
Ramaswamy, a journalist whose own roots are in the Tamil film
industry and who once was one of Jayalalitha's closest friends.
``She wants to bring down the central government, but she doesn't
realize that no matter who is at the center, they will not be
kindly disposed to this. Jayalalitha is not so politically sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   What she has been is one of India's mythic characters, whose
loves and triumphs and humiliations have been an ongoing public
soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm perceived as a strong and ruthless woman, it's because
life has turned me into someone like that,'' Jayalalitha recently
told an Indian film magazine in one of her infrequent interviews.
``If I hadn't been tough, I wouldn't have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Educated in a convent, she dreamed early on of being a doctor or
lawyer. Instead she made her debut in Tamil movies at 13, pressed
into the career by her mother, herself an actress. ``I hated every
minute of being in films,'' Jayalalitha once reflected morosely.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, the voluptuous teen-ager, big-eyed with a
dimpled smile, began playing her many lead roles as a spirited
heroine. Soon she was chosen to appear opposite the swashbuckling
M.G. Ramachandran, the biggest star in Tamil films.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two appeared in 28 movies and, though Ramachandran
was married, it was widely believed that Jayalalitha was his
leading lady off screen as well.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he also would prove wildly popular as a politician.
Though he was a Brahmin, he was a champion to the lower castes and
rural masses. Elected Chief Minister, he brought Jayalalitha,
another Brahmin, into the All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam
as something of an apprentice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ramachandran remained her mentor until his death in 1987
is a matter of some dispute. The writer Valampuri John, who was a
friend to both, said the actor considered Jayalalitha disloyal at
the end and ``instructed that there be no communications with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth, at his funeral she clung to his coffin
despite the protests of many in his entourage. At one point she
boarded the carriage that slowly transported the coffin, but she
was pulled off and, by her account, taunted, punched and cursed.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha then tried, but failed, to stake claim immediately
to Ramachandran's political base. She has recalled falling into
depression, a condition that did not abate until she befriended
Sasikala Natarajan, the woman she has lived with off and on for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. Natarajan, once a maker of videos, as her chief
adviser, Jayalalitha was elected Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in
1991, and she finally seemed to have joined Ramachandran on the
common man's pantheon of heroes.
</P>
<P>
   She felt comfortable on a pedestal. She demanded fealty. Others
were made to stand while she sat. People bowed when greeting her.
Plywood cutouts of her image, some of them eight stories high, were
placed in busy intersections here in Madras, the state capital.
Posters portrayed her as a Hindu goddess or the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs of loyalists attacked Jayalalitha's opponents. One of
those opponents was a Harvard-educated economist and political
maverick named Subramanian Swamy. He investigated Jayalalitha and
began passing evidence of her alleged corruption to prosecutors
here and in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made a public statement that she would crush me like a
mosquito,'' Swamy said. ``I must have escaped 12 attacks that might
have ended my life.''
</P>
<P>
   V.S. Chandralekha, a state official, made a critical remark
about Jayalalitha's government. Ms. Chandralekha was removed to a
lesser job. Then, nine days later, someone tossed a bottle of acid
into her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say for sure that Jayalalitha did this, but she would
have knowledge about who did and she did not bring them to book for
this,'' said Ms. Chandralekha, whose face has been reconstructed
with skin grafts.
</P>
<P>
   The queenly Chief Minister seemed to be accumulating new wealth.
Some began to call her friend Ms. Natarajan ``the walking jewelry
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha adopted one of her friend's nephews as her ``foster
son,'' and when he married she gave him a spectacular wedding
party. Like a movie set, entire avenues in central Madras were
recast as scenes from Tamil mythology. Regiments of mounted
horsemen marched in parade. Lunch was served to 12,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marriage was almost a confessional statement of her
corruption,'' said Ramaswamy, the journalist. ``It was her undoing.
People were disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tamil politics have long revolved around larger-than-life
personalities, and disgust has had a shorter shelf life than might
be imagined. Now, in India, the world's largest democracy, with
nuclear weapons at the ready and the rupee at a record low, the
fate of the national government may well rest upon the whims of
Jayalalitha.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Bharatiya Janata emissaries have repeatedly made
pilgrimage to Jayalalitha's residence, trying to soothe her hurt
feelings. Coincidentally, perhaps, a government official who has
pursued tax cases against Ms. Natarajan has been removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha has refused all requests for interviews. Oddly
enough, a new confidante has been speaking for her _ Subramanian
Swamy, the political maverick who once brought corruption charges
against her.
</P>
<P>
   Her alleged wickedness now seems to him no more a character flaw
than a bad hairdo. For him, like others, the bigger goal is to
bring down the governing party. Swamy has been trying to steer
Jayalalitha toward the once-dominant Congress Party, now headed by
Sonia Gandhi, the reluctant heir to the Nehru family's political
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the Congress would be any more
responsive to Jayalalitha's petulant demands, though Mrs. Gandhi
has said some discussion has gone on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jayalalitha is in a terrible dilemma,'' Swamy said
sympathetically. ``She asks herself: `Do I pull down this
government? And if I do, will something worse for me take its
place?'''

EX-KLAN CHIEF GOES ON TRIAL IN 1966 KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Miss.)   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, for the fifth time in 30 years, a former imperial
wizard of the Ku Klux Klan went on trial accused of masterminding a
firebombing that killed a black civil rights leader in 1966. This
time, prosecutors say they are confident that the jury in
Hattiesburg, Miss., will reach a different conclusion from the four
that deadlocked in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very optimistic,'' Mike Moore, Mississippi's attorney
general, said about the trial of the former Klan wizard, Samuel H.
Bowers, 73, of Laurel, Miss. ``This is not going to be easy. It is
not a slam dunk. Bowers was tried several times. Still, I don't
think the state ever got a fair trial back in those days. And I
think there was some jury tampering going on. But because we have
new evidence and new witnesses I think we have a good chance for a
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The home of Vernon F. Dahmer (pronounced DAY-mer) was firebombed
on Jan. 10, 1966, because, prosecutors say, Dahmer had helped
register black voters in Hattiesburg. Four Klansmen were convicted
in Dahmer's murder, but Bowers went free. He served six years in
prison after his conviction on federal charges in three other civil
rights slayings in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In May, state and Forrest County prosecutors cited new evidence
and new charges against Bowers and two other men. Bowers and
Charles Noble are charged with murder and arson. Deavours Nix,
another former Klansman, is charged with arson. Trial dates have
not been set for Noble and Nix.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the deadlocked juries in Bower's trials in the 1960s,
Monday's jury pool of more than 400 registered voters included
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that black people are registered to vote, and can sit on
juries and black political power is mobilized,'' said David
Ingebretsen, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union Mississippi, ``pressure can be brought to bear on elected
officials to have a trial like this. That is all a direct result of
the civil rights movement.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has now testified before the
grand jury. So have Monica Lewinsky and dozens of other witnesses.
So where does the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr, which began as an inquiry into a real-estate deal four years
ago, go now?
</P>
<P>
   Starr could still call witnesses before the grand jury to see if
they can contradict Clinton's testimony. He might recall Ms.
Lewinsky for that purpose. It is especially likely that Starr would
summon deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, a key Clinton
advisor, since he fought in court here for the right to question
him.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next few weeks, Starr is expected to shift most of
his attention from evidence collecting to evidence sifting as he
combs through the facts and testimony for any ``substantial and
credible information'' that ``may constitute grounds for
impeachment.'' It is his duty under the Independent Counsel law to
report that evidence to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Using that ``credible'' information as his foundation, Starr
would write a report focused on what he considers ``impeachable
offenses,'' including relevant testimony and facts. Unless he finds
evidence of such offenses in the other issues he has investigated,
starting with the Whitewater land deal, he would probably limit his
report to the Lewinsky matter: to allegations that Clinton had an
affair with Ms. Lewinsky and subsequently attempted to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachable offenses include ``treason, bribery or other high
crimes and misdemeanors,'' according to the U.S. Constitution, a
category left intentionally vague by the framers of the document.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when he was the House minority leader trying to impeach
Justice William Douglas, Gerald Ford called an impeachable offense,
``basically whatever a majority of the House of Representatives
considers'' it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Before turning his report over to the House, Starr would have to
make one last request to U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, who presides over the grand jury. Since grand jury
testimony is secret, Starr would have to ask the judge permission
to release all or part of the testimony to the House. Leon
Jaworski, special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation,
received such permission from Judge John Sirica in 1974 when he
forwarded a report to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Starr would try to indict Clinton is constitutionally
unclear, but his supporters and critics say he is disinclined to
pursue an indictment, a tricky legal and political move that could
prompt drawn-out court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any prosecutor would relish a trial against the
president,'' said Judge Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel in
the Iran-Contra investigation. But Starr is free to indict others
in the case, if the evidence warrants it, and that could enable him
to name the president as an unindicted co-conspirator, as
Jaworski's grand jury designated Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Over on Capitol Hill, the House has been making preliminary
arrangements to receive the report, a prospect that pleases neither
Republicans nor Democrats who view it as a risky complication in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Once Starr is ready to submit the report, he is expected to
contact House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Gingrich would ask
Starr to hold off for about 10 days, until the House can establish
new rules for how to handle the report, said a House Republican
aide familiar with the leadership's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which the full House would have to approve, would
grant the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over the report, a
precedent that was set during Watergate. And they would allow only
the 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee _ a
wildly partisan bunch _ to have access to the report, an attempt by
congressional leaders to diminish the potential for leaks to the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   Once that groundwork has been laid, Starr would turn over the
report and the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., would assume a role that is not unlike that of a
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members would read the report and do one of two things
_ ignore it or go forward with a preliminary ``review.'' The
committee could hold public or closed-door hearings and begin
calling witnesses to determine whether an impeachment inquiry is
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   If a decision is made to move ahead, the full House would vote
on a ``resolution of inquiry,'' which is when impeachment
proceedings would formally begin.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, most likely after the November elections, the
Judiciary Committee would intensify its investigation as it tries
to decide whether there is enough evidence of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' against Clinton to constitute an impeachable
offense. The panel could hold more elaborate hearings, summon grand
jury witnesses, as well as call new witnesses and expert witnesses.
It could ask Clinton to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a judicial proceeding where you have to show
probable cause, or some threshold,'' said Michael Dorf, a law
professor at Columbia University. ``The House itself defines the
threshold of evidence that they deem impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is ultimately a political decision, with legal
overtones. It is not a process which most politicians regard with
enthusiasm, especially when the target is a president, like Nixon
or Clinton, who has been re-elected solidly. The only president
whom the House has ever impeached was Andrew Johnson, Abraham
Lincoln's vice president who became president on Lincoln's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the lessons to come out of the Watergate
hearings is that the House took its responsibility quite seriously
and they understood that in order to to have credibility with the
people they would have to act on motives other than just
politics,'' Dorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the committee is satisfied with the evidence, the panel
would vote on articles of impeachment, followed by a full House
vote on impeachment. A simple majority vote is all that is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the process would shift to the Senate, which would conduct
an impeachment trial presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist. The votes of two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 senators _
are required to convict and remove a federal official from office.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 16 impeachments in American history, most of
them judges. Only one president has been impeached by the House:
Andrew Johnson. The Senate failed to convict him by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Starr submits his report to the House, however, it's
not quite over for him.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel must piece together an exhaustive second
report for the three-judge panel that appointed him. This report,
which is mandatory, will offer a full accounting of what he did,
and what he found, during the past four years, beginning with his
investigation of the Whitewater land deal. The judges would decide
whether to make that report public.

U.S. INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE BOMBING SUSPECT WILL COOPERATE WITH
THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: AFRICA-PAKISTAN)  
(js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement officials said Monday that a key
suspect in the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi had been
interviewed at length by American investigators, but had not
admitted any role and had not implicated Osama bin Laden, the
shadowy Saudi-born extremist thought to have inspired the bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the officials said they believed that the suspect,
Mohammed Saddiq Odeh _ initially identified as Mohammed Sadik
Howaida _ was an important figure in the Nairobi bombing plot and
had knowledge of most of the details.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they expected that Odeh would eventually
cooperate with American authorities. Pakistani officials said he
had cooperated when apprehended, shortly after landing in Karachi
on a flight from Kenya on Aug. 7, the day of the nearly
simultaneous bombings at the embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the officials did not dispute reports from Pakistan
that Odeh had voluntarily confessed there, and that he had
identified several collaborators, calling bin Laden the driving
force behind the bombing and his spiritual guide in an Islamic holy
war against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Taliban militia, which has protected bin
Laden at a stronghold in Afghanistan, previously said he had
pledged not to engage in terrorism while living under Taliban
protection and had nothing to do with the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was arrested when Pakistani immigration authorities found
that his face did not match the photograph on his Yemeni passport.
The document, in the name of Abdull Bast Awadah, was apparently
stolen. Afterward, Odeh took responsibility for the Nairobi bombing
and said he had visited Kenya over the course of several years to
plan the attack, Pakistani authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Pakistani national newspaper, The News, said Odeh
was a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer who had helped supervise
technical details of the bombing plot. Other reports said that he
was married to a Kenyan and that his home base during his visits to
Nairobi was Mombasa, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Odeh had told his Pakistani interrogators
that he was a follower of bin Laden. ``Osama bin Laden is our
supreme commander,'' Odeh was reported to have said, ``and by
blasting the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
we have shown our determination to meet our pledge to the Muslim
world.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kenyan authorities and the FBI issued a statement
suggesting that Odeh had grown taciturn since American officials
returned him to Kenya on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Saddiq Odeh has not admitted any responsibility in the
bombings in Nairobi or Dar es Salaam,'' they said in the statement.
``Nor has he implicated anyone else in those events.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility that American authorities have been
handed an important suspect who could help solve the case has
raised optimism among law enforcement officials. They are
meticulously assembling evidence in a manner that suggests that the
government would be prepared to try the plotters in an American
court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first planeloads of evidence from the Nairobi bombing
arrived at the FBI's main crime lab over the weekend. Officials
said experts had identified the explosive in the Kenya blast, but
no one could confirm earlier reports identifying it as Semtex, a
Czech-made explosive.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation in Nairobi continued, some high-ranking
American officials were planning trips to Africa this week.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was to visit Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam on Tuesday to express support for the bombing victims and
to display American resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bring a message of friendship, made deeper by our
shared grief,'' Ms. Albright said before departing from Washington
Monday, ``and of support in doing all we can to ease their
suffering and help them start anew.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director, Louis Freeh, is also expected to visit Kenya
and Tanzania this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan officials are likely to raise the issue of victim
compensation and financial assistance. Although some officials have
estimated that the blast caused more than $500 million in losses,
authorities have no detailed estimate of damages.

RUSSIA HAD TO DO SOMETHING, ADMINISTRATION CONCEDES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Russian government was denied additional
assistance from the United States and several other allies over the
weekend, causing it to take the steps that the Clinton
administration had opposed: allowing the ruble greater fluctuation,
imposing a moratorium on repaying foreign debt owed mostly by banks
and restructuring much of the government's debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``These particular choices were Russian choices in an
exceptionally difficult environment,'' a senior administration
official said Monday. ``We certainly expressed concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials acknowledged that the Russians,
faced last week with a spreading banking crisis, had little choice.
``Given the inability to restore confidence, some change was
necessary,'' said another administration official.
</P>
<P>
   A package of loans and credits totaling $22.6 billion announced
last month by the International Monetary Fund was supposed to buy
Russia time to enact the reforms that might restore investor
confidence. But as the currency and security markets continued to
weaken after the IMF package was unveiled, the strategy announced
Monday seeks to buy time another way, by lessening Russia's debt
burden and restoring confidence in its ability to get its fiscal
problems under control.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's view is that no further funds would be
forthcoming and that the onus is on the Russian government to
implement economic reform, according to both administration and IMF
officials who say that foreign aid is no substitute for Russia
cleaning up its own financial house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is critically important that the Russian
authorities move quickly to take actions to restore confidence,
including the adoption of a careful and cooperative approach in
dealing with its creditors and the full implementation of the
measures outlined in the Russian stabilization program agreed with
the IMF,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a statement
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Having little leverage over the direction of events in Russia,
officials in Washington went to great lengths to reassure investors
that the United States was not abandoning Russia. ``We wanted to be
frank about the pros and cons,'' said one administration official.
``But there were no easy choices. It was the Russians' choice, but
now that Russia has made its choice, we're committed to working
with them to advance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the current crisis go back to the early 1990s when
Russia was battling hyperinflation. The Russian government switched
from simply printing money to finance the budget deficit to issuing
bonds. The deficits kept growing, at one point reaching about 7
percent of the value of its economy. As the debt ballooned, nervous
investors were only willing to buy short-term instruments. That
meant that the bulk of domestic debt matured quickly and constantly
had to be refinanced.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Russia has suffered a series of blows, namely
a collapse of oil and commodity prices as well as the economic
contagion from Asia. As investors grew more nervous, interest rates
of 100 percent to 200 percent were required to entice buyers.
Russia found itself in a classic debt trap: The investor requires a
high rate of return to invest in government bonds, raising the cost
of servicing the debt and the possibility of a default.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the IMF package clearly had failed to restore
confidence, the Yeltsin government opted for a combination of
time-honored, but risky, escapes. First, the prospect of a devalued
ruble could trigger inflation, which shrinks existing debt values.
Second, the government announced that it would restructure the
ruble-denominated debt, which involves involuntarily forcing the
holder of short-term maturity debt to accept longer-term
maturities.
</P>
<P>
   This tactic is analogous to a borrower taking a three-month IOU,
but later forcing the lender to accept a note for several years _
and at a new interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   The new maturities, interest rates and other details of the
restructuring are expected to be announced Wednesday, the Russian
government said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Initial reactions indicate that Russia's dramatic gestures may
work. It is certainly not a case, as in Japan, of too little too
late. Financial markets reacted relatively well Monday and
investors seem to be waiting to learn more details. Whether the
Russian gamble works will be evident in next few weeks. Investors
are waiting to see whether the run on the banking system and the
currency subsides. The political fallout in Russia will focus on
how the population views the government breaking its promise to
prevent a return of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time to abandon Russia,'' said Robert Hormats,
managing director at Goldman Sachs. ``It's a time to help them deal
with some of the critical issues that led them to take these
measures.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before he addressed the nation, President
Clinton called in some of his closest aides over the weekend and,
one-by-one, told them the news that for months they had feared was
true: that he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings, which took place Saturday and Sunday, were
described by close Clinton associates as informal and involving
only some of his aides. And only in some cases, they said, did
Clinton express regret for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of public denials and private anguish over
the inquiry by Kenneth Starr, it was those confessionals that
helped Clinton fully come to terms with the toll the sex scandal
has wrought on his friends and on his presidency, according to two
close people close to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It him him hardest on Sunday,'' one close friend said. ``This
was a very, very difficult weekend for him. Nothing is more
important to him than his place in history. He is worried that this
investigation will eclipse everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while Clinton's associates were telling reporters that he
might acknowledge having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, the
friend said he was still ``in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four days ago, he said, ``the president told me he never had
sex with Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who met with the president _ and who had loyally stood by
the president _ expressed feelings that they were betrayed, sullied
and even humiliated, according to people close to Clinton. One
friend said there was ``a lot of disappointment,'' and that it was
the aides' reaction that was most distressing, and caused the
president to ``beat himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even if the American public forgives him for bending the
truth in explaining his relationship Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton now
faces a problem closer to home: repairing relations with aides,
friends and Cabinet members who for months have steadfastly, and
publicly, defended him. Collectively, these people face hundreds of
thousands of dollars in legal bills related to the investigations
that have punctuated his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, was unequivocal
when the Lewinsky matter first broke, declaring, ``The president is
outraged by these allegations. He's never had any improper
relationship with this women.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he now feel like a chump?
</P>
<P>
   Monday, McCurry sidestepped the question, saying he was still
figuring out how he feels. But he seemed to acknowledge his
discomfort. ``I'm not so self-preoccupied to be thinking about how
I feel,'' he said in an interview. ``I think it's important that
the president talked to the American people because whatever
position I'm in, they're in much the same position. I'm sure all
the rest of us will sort out how we feel in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, an outside adviser who has been one of the most
aggressive Clinton defenders, spoke of his disappointment in an
interview Monday night: ``My disappointment is not personal. I'm a
friend and a supporter and I will stand by him in a difficult time
like this. My disappointment is that his presidency should be
judged as a great one and we've got to work even harder now for his
legacy because of what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hillary Rodham Clinton, who ridiculed the allegations as
the product of a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Clinton's most
unwavering defenders include Ann Lewis, the communications director
who for years has been close to Mrs. Clinton, and two senior aides
who have been with Clinton since the 1992 campaign, Paul Begala and
Rahm Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday night if he feels betrayed, Emanuel said, ``This
guy is dealing with something very personal. He is taking
responsibility for it. Where I come from you don't choose high and
low moments around your friends. I'm a staff person and I'm going
to be loyal to him. He and I have a history together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis, who had insisted that Clinton was not making any
distinctions between different forms of sex, said in January, ``Sex
is sex. Even in Washington, I've been assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ms. Lewis refused to talk about her own feelings
about the president, saying, ``I'm not going to go there. It is
more appropriate today for people to hear the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest profile members of the administration, no doubt,
will also be sorting out their feelings. In January, Clinton
assured his Cabinet he was innocent and Madeleine Albright, the
secretary of state, stepped out on the White House driveway to back
him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the allegations are completely untrue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll second that. Definitely,'' said William Daley, the
commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Third it,'' said Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services.
</P>
<P>
   The last seven months have been particularly trying for some of
Clinton's defenders who, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said they suspected he was guilty but pressed on, or tried to
convince themselves of his innocence, not wanting to abandon him.
Some, like Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel, have been
careful to preface their defenses of Clinton with phrases like,
 &UR; ``If he says he didn't do this, &LR;  I believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever their inner suspicions, they went out there,'' said
Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff. He said he has
spoken with some current White House aides whose only solace Monday
was that their ordeal may finally be ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to some who said it was almost a relief,'' Panetta
said in an interview. ``Their greatest fear was if this had to go
on for another six or seven months and what it was doing to them
and to the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta, who was Clinton's budget director and a longtime
congressman from California, said he was personally disappointed in
the president. But most of all, he said, Clinton owes his staff
``an eye-to-eye'' apology. ``You don't want to hang your staff out
there with false statements,'' he said. ``When you're asked to spin
something that's not truthful, that's where you have to draw the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person close to Clinton said the president this weekend
fully began grappling with many of the emotions his friends have
dealt with for months. ``He had to deal with the mixed emotions of
relief and anger and remorse.'' He said that Clinton relied
particularly on Hillary Rodham Clinton this weekend to keep up his
spirits over the weekend. As she has in the past, she was described
as focused on the task before facing them, preparing for the grand
jury's questions and for an address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a perceptible shift in tone in recent weeks among
Clinton's staunchest defenders, particularly at the White House,
where aides have been less energetic in defending Clinton and in
condemning Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, the former senior adviser to Clinton,
said he expected Clinton's defenders to become even more angry as
time wears on. ``I can imagine in the short run being numb by the
crush of events,'' he said. ``A kind of battle fatigue takes over.
Where it may get difficult is in the coming days when people have
to confront what happened and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   For some people the anger is already open. Dee Dee Myers,
Clinton's former press secretary, said she did not specifically say
the president had not had an affair, but did speak out in support
of him when the scandal erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel disappointed in him, I'm angry,'' she said. ``He put
people through hell, including the staff and people who are my
friends. The president has to apologize or they have to quit. The
president has to be truly, truly contrite. I'm sure he didn't
intend to hurt or embarrass them. But he did.''

   KINSHASA, Congo _ Rebels again cut electricity and water to this
capital of 5 million people on Monday, heightening fears about an
imminent attack. As the threat intensified, support for President
Laurent Kabila apparently grew.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the blackout began, the government acknowledged its
loss of control over the huge Inga hydroelectric dam. On Friday,
government ministers privately reported that the dam had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The dam supplies most of this country's electricity, as well as
power to nearby areas of other countries. Senior government
officials faulted Rwanda for the loss and called the rebels' use of
the dam an example of state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Didier Mumengi said that the government was
fighting the rebels, in small groups southwest of Kinshasa, and
that it would establish an emergency plan on Tuesday to provide
electricity and water here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rwandan aggressors have brought their genocidal culture
onto our territory,'' Mumengi said, adding that Congo was
``prepared to fight Rwanda and to take and finish the war in
Kigali,'' its capital.
</P>
<P>
   The government campaign to depict the rebels as tools of Rwanda
appeared to be working. Some residents voiced strong support for
Kabila and rising anger with the Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rwandan Tutsi want to establish a Tutsi empire in the
Congo,'' an economics student, Jean-Felix Tshobo, said. ``Last time
we were sick of Mobutu and so we welcomed the rebels here. But this
time it's different. We're ready to take arms if they come here.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurgency recalls the movement that led to the fall of
Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator for more than 30 years. But this war
is producing different reactions. It has galvanized support for
Kabila, whose popularity had tumbled after he had cracked down on
political liberties and demonstrated a lack of diplomatic skills.
And the fighting has led to a surge in nationalism, fueled by
government propaganda and animosity toward the Tutsi, who propelled
Kabila to power but from whom he later distanced himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations here indicate that the ethnic Tutsi rebels are
being viewed as invaders. In a country that has avoided the
murderous ethnic rivalries that have erupted elsewhere in Africa,
that could prove explosive.
</P>
<P>
   On a sleepy summertime campus at the University of Kinshasa,
Mapasahi Ndengo put the final touches on a wood panel that he was
transforming into a checkerboard. ``We need peace in our country so

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON'S TESTIMONY IN THE PAULA JONES LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are President Clinton's answers, given on
Jan. 17 in a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit, to questions about his relationship with a former White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky, who had been subpoenaed by lawyers
for Mrs. Jones:
</P>
<P>
   On Being Alone
</P>
<P>
   Q. At any time were you and Monica alone together in the Oval
Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the
legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the
weekends. I typically worked some on the weekends. Sometimes they'd
bring me things on the weekends. She _ it seems to me she brought
things to me once or twice on the weekends. In that case, whatever
time she would be in there, drop it off, exchange a few words and
go, she was there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So I understand, your testimony is that it was possible,
then, that you were alone with her, but you have no specific
recollections of that ever happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that's correct. It's possible that she, in, while she
was working there, brought something to me and that at the time she
brought it to me, she was the only person there. That's possible.
</P>
<P>
   On the Subpoena
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she tell you she had been served with a subpoena in this
case?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I don't know if she had been.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that
Monica Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ever talk with Monica Lewinsky about the possibility
that she might be asked to testify in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she was, I
think maybe that's the first person told me she was. I want to be
as accurate as I can.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you talk to Mr. Lindsey about what action, if any, should
be taken as a result of her being served with a subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever talked to Monica Lewinsky about the possibility
that she might be asked to testify in this lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure, and let me tell you why I'm not sure. It seems
to me the, the, the _ I want to be as accurate as I can here. Seems
to me the last time she was there to see Betty (Currie) before
Christmas we were joking about how you-all, with the help of the
Rutherford Institute, were going to call every woman I'd ever
talked to, and I said, you know _ And I said that you-all might
call every woman I ever talked to and ask them that, and so I said
you would qualify, or something like that. I don't, I don't think
we ever had more of a conversation than that about it, but I might
have mentioned something to her about it, because when I saw how
long the witness list was, or I heard about it, before I saw, but
actually by the time I saw it her name was in it, but I think that
was after all this had happened. I might have said something like
that, so I don't want to say for sure I didn't, because I might
have said something like that.
</P>
<P>
   On the Gifts
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, have you ever given any gifts to Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't recall. Do you know what they were?
</P>
<P>
   Q. A hat pin?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't, I don't remember. But I certainly, I could have.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A book about Walt Whitman?
</P>
<P>
   A. I give _ let me just say, I give people a lot of gifts, and
when people are around I give a lot of things I have at the White
House away, so I could have given her a gift, but I don't remember
a specific gift.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has Monica Lewinsky ever given you any gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A. Once or twice. I think she's given me a book or two.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she give you a silver cigar box?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did she give you a tie?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, she had given me a tie before. I believe that's right.
</P>
<P>
   On Having a Relationship
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Monica
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you
beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think I used the term ``sexual affair.'' And so the record
is completely clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as
modified by the court.
</P>
<P>
   A. I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I've
never had an affair with her.
nn
</P>
<P>
   On Getting Lewinsky a Job
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it your understanding that (Ms. Lewinsky) was offered a
job at the U.N.?
</P>
<P>
   A. I know that she interviewed for one. I don't know if she was
offered one or not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever talked to (U.N. Ambassador) Bill Richardson
about Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that, I believe that Monica, what I know about that
is I believe Monica asked Betty Currie to ask someone to talk to
him, and she, and she talked to him and went to an interview with
him. That's what I believe happened.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever had a conversation with Vernon Jordan in which
Monica Lewinsky was mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   A. I have. He told me that he called _ he mentioned in passing
to me that he had talked to her, and she had come to him for advice
about moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did he say that she had said to him in response?
</P>
<P>
   A. He just said she seemed like a bright, energetic young woman
and she had certain interests, and he made some suggestions to her
and suggested where she ought to go for interviews. That's all I
know about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you do anything, sir, to prompt this conversation to take
place between Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can tell you what my memory is. My memory is that Vernon
said something to me about her coming in, Betty had called and
asked if he would see her and he said she would, he said he would,
and then she called him and then he said something to me about it.
I'm sure if he said something to me about it I said something
positive about it. I wouldn't have said anything negative about it.
I didn't have any negative knowledge. I mean there would be no
reason for me to be negative about it. Vernon liked to help people.
He was always trying to help people.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My question, though, is focused on the time before the
conversation occurred, and the question is whether you did anything
to cause the conversation to occur.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think in the mean _ I'm not sure how you mean the question.
I think the way you mean the question, the answer to that is no,
I've already testified. What my memory of this is, if you're asking
did I set the meeting up, I do not believe that I did. I believe
that Betty did that, and she may have mentioned, asked me if I
thought it was all right if she did it, and if she did ask me I
would have said yes, and so if that happened, then I did something
to cause the conversation to occur. If that's what you mean, yes.

(JT)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the interminable television coverage of all that was not
known about President Clinton's testimony during his long afternoon
in the White House Map Room Monday, one moment seemed to exemplify
the bizarre challenge facing the 24-hour-news networks: the arrival
at the White House of the independent counsel's sedan.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, the only action for most of the day _ a day
on which MSNBC and CNN were devoting almost undivided attention to
the mostly invisible doings in Washington. So the approach of
Kenneth Starr's car shortly before 12:30 p.m. was greeted with the
kind of rapt attentiveness the networks usually reserve for the
coffin at the funeral of a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the back seat,'' Frank Sesno of CNN interrupted an
interview to announce. (``He traditionally travels in that
fashion,'' Sesno added as an aside.) A few minutes later: ``Ken
Starr, if I may now interrupt, is getting out of the car, putting
on his jacket.'' Then more: ``It seems to be, if we can judge from
this distance, a somewhat leisurely, relaxed Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour Monday, the two cable news networks tried
mightily to eke high drama out of an event that no reporter or
camera was allowed to witness. They televised portentous headlines,
played scary music, interviewed experts with ``former'' after their
names and replayed the greatest hits from their videotape libraries
of the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   They did their best to create suspense: Would Clinton change his
story? Did Starr have the goods? Would the prosecutors and the
defense lawyers get into a spat? ``Stay with the people who brought
you the year's biggest story,'' one MSNBC promo urged. On CNN, Mary
Tillotson signed off from ``CNN &AMP; Company'' cheerily: ``More on the
president's legal and political problems tomorrow. See you then.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN took a novel approach, as if covering an athletic event like
the Tour de France. It parked a scoreboard in the upper right-hand
corner of the television screen. Under the heading ``President
Clinton's Testimony,'' a clock tracked the number of hours and
minutes elapsed. A mysterious second category, entitled ``Status,''
was followed most of the day by the answer ``Testifying.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, anchors seemed to strive for dignity (at a
time when the news media have been accused of everything but).
Brian Williams, the MSNBC anchorman, assured his viewers that
nobody was having any fun. Other networks skipped wall-to-wall
coverage for much of the day in favor of occasional discreet
interruptions of their regularly scheduled soaps. ``We're trying
hard to be pillars of accuracy today,'' said Dan Rather, the CBS
anchorman, popping in briefly about 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In early evening, with Clinton already having completed his
testimony, reporters were still reading tea leaves: Clinton's
lawyer, David Kendall, emerged from the White House shortly before
6:45 p.m. and, stationing himself at the awaiting microphone,
anticlimactically announced that any comment on Clinton's testimony
would have to come from Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is much to be added to what he said,'' Bob
Schieffer, the CBS reporter and analyst, replied bluntly when
Rather invited him to do some analyzing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As might have been expected, television coverage of the day
began bright and early. On the morning news programs, pundits were
out in force. In fact, much of the day was whiled away with
interviews with presidential historians, presidential biographers,
bureau chiefs, former White House special counsels, former
prosecutors, former senior Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and anchors scrambled to explore every conceivable and
not-so-conceivable angle. How would Clinton's testimony affect his
marriage? Where are the heroes of today? How was Wall Street
reacting? How about the folks at a ``popular lunch place'' in
Little Rock? At the Illinois State Fair? At the Richard M. Nixon
Presidential Library?
</P>
<P>
   The pundits could generally be counted on to adhere faithfully
to their appointed roles. Partisans of the president took pains to
point out how much money Starr's office had spent. Those with more
conservative affiliations invoked the gravity of the situation and
used phrases like ``the linchpin of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whatever it was Clinton was in there saying, pundits
commented on recent news reports that he would testify that he had
had an inappropriate relationship but had not committed perjury.
``No American with 20 neurons working simultaneously in their brain
is going to accept such a puerile and nonsensical explanation,''
said Mona Charen, a syndicated columnist speaking on ``CNN &AMP;
Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time news looked as if it might surface, reporters and
anchors jumped. MSNBC reported that officials had stationed a
boombox playing classical music in the hall outside the courtroom
where the grand jurors were sitting, lest reporters overhear any
rumblings from the closed-circuit telecast of the president's
testimony. CNN then reported a new development: ``There will be no
boombox after all,'' Bob Franken reported, looking amused.
</P>
<P>
   CNN quoted Paula Corbin Jones' husband as announcing that Mrs.
Jones was ``taking a wait-and-see attitude.'' Anchors periodically
stepped in to say things like ``President Clinton is in his 54th
minute of testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   To fill time, there was plenty of familiar old video footage:
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in that infamous slow-motion hug, Starr
smiling tightly as he steps into and out of various cars, Linda
Tripp emerging from the grand jury room, Clinton earnestly speaking
to the country early this year about the sexual relations he did
not have with ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   At every commercial break came the music, sounding variously
like the background for a chase scene or an original soundtrack for
a made-for-television movie about child abduction. There were
fancy, computer-generated schematics of the White House, showing
the Map Room and tracking the fiber-optic hookup transmitting
Clinton's testimony to the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been very, very quiet,'' John Palmer, a reporter
for NBC, announced glumly about one hour into Clinton's testimony.
``It already seems like a long afternoon.''

MICROSOFT WARNS OF `MEDIA CIRCUS' IF PRESS, PUBLIC ATTEND
DEPOSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Monday warned a federal appeals court that the
depositions of chairman Bill Gates and other executives will turn
into a ``media circus'' if reporters and the public are allowed to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is overseeing
the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, ruled a week ago
that the depositions must be open to the public. Various news
organizations had requested access to them, citing a 1913 law
called the ``Publicity in Taking Evidence Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft quickly appealed, saying valuable trade secrets would
be at risk if 25 remaining depositions are open to the public
reporters. Twenty have already been taken, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides creating a ``carnival atmosphere,'' the presence of
reporters and the public might bring up issues of confidentiality
that only the judge can settle. That raises the prospect of
frequent delays that will disrupt and prolong the taking of
depositions with just a few weeks remaining before the trial,
schedule to start Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, discussions continued Monday among Microsoft, the
government and the news organizations about what procedures to
follow if the depositions are indeed open _ when and where they
will be taken, how many extra people will have to be accommodated
and whether any recording devices would be allowed, among other
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever terms they agree on will be submitted to Jackson for
his approval. The discussions were said to be nearly complete
Monday, but if an agreement was reached it apparently didn't reach
Jackson in time for him to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Jackson rule on requests by Microsoft and the government
that he postpone the start of the trial for two weeks because of
the delays that already have occurred in the deposition process.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also asked Jackson to issue a summary judgment
dismissing the government's claims, a prospect that is regarded as
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state antitrust regulators filed suit against
Microsoft on May 18, accusing it of violating the Sherman Antitrust
Act by ``tying'' its Internet browser to its Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers had no real choice but to accept the browser
because they had no practical alternative to Windows, which is
installed on the vast majority of new computers sold today, the
government argues. Microsoft's actions amount to an abuse of
monopoly power that has harmed competition in the market for
Internet browsing software, where Microsoft is steadily gaining on
the leader, Netscape Communications, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations echo those of an earlier federal lawsuit that
said the tying of the browser to the operating system violated a
consent decree Microsoft entered in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that it didn't ``tie'' the two software
products together; rather, it ``integrated'' the browser into the
operating system in a way benefits consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge appeals panel ruled in Microsoft's favor in June.
Although the ruling came in the consent-decree case, the issues so
closely paralled those of the second case that Microsoft and many
outside observers viewed it as a major victory for the company.

VOTE CLOSES OUT GLENFED'S 64 YEARS AS GOLDEN STATE ABSORBS AREA
THRIFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a short statement adjourning Monday's
shareholders meeting, Golden State Bancorp Chief Executive Stephen
Trafton quietly ended the 64-year existence of Glendale Federal
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred shareholders in nearby Glendale sat in silence
as a Golden State executive read aloud that 98.4 percent of votes
cast favored its merger with First Nationwide Holdings in San
Francisco, the owner of California Federal Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 billion merger, which already received approval from
regulators, is expected to close on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The deal creates a thrift with $52 billion in assets, $28
billion in deposits _ the fourth-largest in California _ and 359
branches. The new company will retain the Golden State Bancorp name
but operate California Federal Bank branches. Only a handful of
former Glendale Federal executives will stay.

<P>
   Current Golden State shareholders will end up with 58 percent of
the new company, while owners of First Nationwide _ mainly
billionaire financier Ron Perelman and his top assistant, Gerald
Ford _ will get a 42 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   But some shareholders at the meeting weren't clear about the
benefits of the merger to minority shareholders and expressed
concern about Perelman. When asked what he knew about the reclusive
billionaire, Trafton called him a ``value builder'' and a ``tough
financier'' but said he has only met him once, to the chagrin of
many in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Other shareholders were upset that the stock price has dropped
substantially from a high of $35.5625 on June 9 to a low of $21.75
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Trafton explained that the general market downturn hurt the
company's stock and the exercise of options and conversion of
preferred stock to common shares increased the number of floating
shares and diluted its price.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``the fundamental values (of the company) have not
changed since we presented them to you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders also wondered whether Trafton's exercise of his
stock options, of which 333,333 remain out of 2.1 million, shows a
lack of confidence in the new company. Trafton explained that he
wanted to diversify his holdings, so he cashed out his Golden State
stock and invested the money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Trafton and Richard Fink, vice chairman of Golden State, will
stay with the new company to handle the lawsuit both thrifts filed
against the federal government. The lawsuits stem from the
government's breach of contract that led to the thrifts losing
hundreds of millions of dollars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Final oral arguments on the case will be made in September and a
ruling is expected by year's end, Trafton said. But any decision
likely will be appealed by the losing side, Trafton warned, and
shareholders should not expect to benefit until after the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Trafton and Fink have 3-year and 2 1/2- (one-half) year
contracts as litigation managers to which they are paid $600,000
and $400,000 a year, respectively. They also will get 0.25 percent
of any pretax windfall they get from the lawsuits, which some
analysts have said could be about $1 billion. That comes out to
$2.5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Trafton gets a lifetime pension of $1 million a
year and Fink $325,000 annually. When they die, their wives will
get half of the yearly pension.
</P>
<P>
   These golden parachutes aren't unreasonable, said Keith Davis,
director of compensation at SNL Securities, a Virginia-based
research firm specializing in the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   Trafton will be paid less than his annual salary at Golden State
while Fink will be paid at about the same level, he said. Their
pensions also aren't too far out of line from that of other
employees, who will get more than half of their annual salary as
their yearly pension if they stay for at least 30 years.

division is finding new customers. ``Now we're looking to compete

The crowd was larger than it was on the festival's first two days;
28,000 tickets were sold, some for as little as $10 each. The music

   (NYT6) VALDEZ, Alaska -- Aug. 17, 1998 -- SCI-ALASKA-THAW-2,
8-17 -- The permafrost, ground that is perpetually frozen, is
thawing in Alaska's interior, and pockets of underground ice
trapped in the frost are melting with it. Over thousands of miles,
big patches of forest are drowning and turning gray as the ground
sinks under them and swamp water floods them. Roadside utility
poles, destabilized by the melting, tilt at crazy angles. So do
trees, creating a phenomenon known as drunken forest. (William K.

REALTY IN L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BLISTERING HOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The real estate market in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley area matched the summer's torrid heat wave during July with
home sales and prices rising like mercury in a thermometer, a trade
group says.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of single-family homes in the San Fernando Valley jumped
18.5 percent and the median price, the point at which half sold for
more and half for less, jumped 22.2 percent, the Southland
Association of Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales in the Santa Clarita Valley, a much smaller
market, skyrocketed a record 61.3 percent and the median price
jumped 9 percent, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The hot market shows no signs of cooling in the immediate
future. Pending escrows, an indicator of sales in the pipeline,
increased 15 percent and 44 percent from July '97 in the San
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that appears to be holding sales in check is a
tight market.
</P>
<P>
   The number of active listings in the San Fernando Valley fell
7.4 percent last month and plunged 28 percent in the nearby Santa
Clarita Valley compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nima Nattagh, an analyst at Experian, a real estate market
research firm, said that second-quarter sales in Los Angeles County
rose 21 percent from year-ago levels, indicating that the market
has broad-based strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly is one of the best housing markets we've had so
far in the 1990s. The market will probably continue at this pace
for another four or five months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, escrow closed on 1,316 single-family homes in the
San Fernando Valley, an increase of 205 from July 1997 but only one
more than in June. The median price was $204,000, up $37,000 from a
year ago but $4,000 less, a decline of 2 percent, from June's
median.
</P>
<P>
   The local condominium market also gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, escrow closed on 315 condos, up nearly 7 percent
from July 1997. The median price soared 41.5 percent to $123,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Realtors groups said there is no shortage of buyers but they
are resisting paying more than properties are worth. For example,
owners tacking two, three or more percentage points on top of what
the market suggests are not selling their properties, said Bud
Mauro, president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Realtors
group.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that appraisers are ``increasingly'' resistant to
loans being made on property that is overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, loans are closing in schedule but Realtors have to
do a lot of explaining and justifying of the price to convince the
appraiser,'' he said.

FOR RUSSIA, OLD PROBLEMS, NEW ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even foreign observers who have watched Russia reel from crisis
to crisis since the Soviet collapse in 1991 have acquired the
Russian habit of quoting Marx's famous dictum that history repeats
itself, first as tragedy and then as farce.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Russian ruble plunged Monday to a new nadir, raising
the spectre of economic, political, and social meltdown, both
stalwart humor and a sense that the trauma was just another chapter
in a long crisis were lacking among many observers. This time,
market strategists said, things are different _ both for Russia and
for the global economy in which the former communist giant now
participates.
</P>
<P>
   From tremors in Brazilian debt markets to worries among Hong
Kong traders about a possible devaluation of their own currency,
world markets have shuddered at Moscow's latest turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials at the International Monetary Fund are
wondering where they went wrong since agreeing to lend Russia $22.6
billion barely a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, economists rushed to declare Russia the latest victim
of Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Russia's currency shed more than one-third of its value
against the US dollar, as the central bank lowered the band in
which the ruble trades to 9.5 rubles per dollar. The move was in
effect a devaluation, reversing months of defiant statements from
Moscow that such a &UR;  &LR; measure &UR;  &LR; was not needed. While the official
rate rose only slightly to 6.43 rubles per dollar, banks and
exchanges, jammed with panicked Russians, jacked up their rates for
dollars to as high as 9.5 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has lurched through plenty of scares in the last seven
years, ranging from currency collapses and government reshuffles to
tax collection shortfalls and unsustainably high interest rates.
But it has always had fast sources of assistance and rescue _ the
IMF and the World Bank, German banks, foreigners who buy its
high-yielding Treasury bills, even George Soros, the billionaire
financier-philanthropist, who secretly lent millions to the
government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those avenues may now be exhausted _ and a review of Russia's
previous currency crisis yields insights about what the future may
hold for the post-Soviet state.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, 1994, a day christened Black Tuesday, the ruble
underwent what was then its steepest one-day decline, plunging more
than 25 percent &UR;  &LR; after the central bank failed to regulate a
liquidity crisis among Russian banks. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the world's newest emerging market had almost no
government debt traded on foreign markets. Moscow had not yet
rescheduled tens of billions in Soviet-era debt owed to the world's
governments and banks. And Russia had plenty of leeway to tap
international funding from groups like the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken but not defeated by Black Tuesday, reformers pushed ahead
with privatization and vowed to undertake major reforms in areas
ranging from tax laws and collection to budget subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has made some progress in recent years _ but in the wake
of its latest crisis, never has it seemed so far from real
stability. ``This time, it is a much broader and much more
significant event,'' said Charles R. Blitzer, head of emerging
market research at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Since Black Tuesday, the Russian &UR;  &LR; government has become one of
the biggest issuers of debt among emerging nations. &UR;  &LR; In
partnerships now deemed risky, its nascent blue-chip companies
allied with domestic banks and issued billions of dollars in
Eurobonds. Far-flung regions unknown to the world issued their own
debt. Traders laughed off the stock market's double-digit swings,
boasting that the toughest could stomach them and win. For 1996 and
1997, Russian stocks handed investors triple digit dollar gains.
</P>
<P>
   Against a stable currency and government committed to economic
reform, investors grew optimistic about Russia's chances to grow.
Bumps along the way were cushioned by international lenders, mainly
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   That picture changed Monday. As investors and foreign officials
wrestled with uncertainty over how far the ruble will fall, how
Moscow will restructure banks near default, and whether the crisis
will spark a major government reshuffle and panic in the streets,
Russian officials acknowledged that new loans were at worst
unlikely _ at least in the amounts seen in the past _ and at best
only a temporary fix to deeper problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Black Tuesday, Russia has now stepped close to the abyss
of being locked out of foreign markets for years. In declaring
Monday a 90-day moratorium on some payments due to foreign
creditors, Moscow came one step shy of default _ a huge no-no for
any country desiring to borrow abroad in the near future. The move
prompted Standard &AMP; Poor's, the ratings agency, to downgrade
Russia's already noninvestment grade long-term foreign currency
debt to an ugly CCC. Russia's rating is now below that of troubled
Indonesia. For a country with $135 billion in foreign currency
obligations and $60 billion in short-term domestic debt, the blow
is severe.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Russian Eurobonds _ debt issued for
international markets _ plunged 30 percent in trading Monday on
fears their issuers, which include banks, companies, the regions,
and the government, would default.
</P>
<P>
   When the IMF granted Moscow its latest aid package on July 17,
most countries' emerging debt traded at around 575 basis points, or
5.75 percentage points, over US Treasuries. Monday the figure had
risen to nearly 1,000 &UR;  &LR; basis points. Long-term bonds for Brazil,
Argentina, Bulgaria, and Ecuador all fell Monday, victims of
Russia's woes.
</P>
<P>
   For emerging market economies like Brazil, the ruble devaluation
may ultimately result in higher borrowing costs and bigger current
account deficits.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible knock-on effects that could not have
happened after Black Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong and Venezuela, with troubled currencies, could face
their own devaluations in the wake of the ruble's fall _ especially
if traders question the wisdom of spending billions to prop up
ailing currencies, as Russia did in previous weeks. And Central and
East European countries with exports to and investments in Russia
could find their balance sheets ruffled.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IMF, which performed an about-face Monday in
switching to muted support for the ruble's devaluation, came under
renewed criticism for having insisted Russia adhere to austerity
measures in the wake of a recession. Just as it failed to see
Asia's crisis coming, so it would appear that the IMF failed to see
Russia's dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble devaluation is also an about face for Russia. A stable
currency had been a showpiece of the Russian economy in recent
years, trumpeted by President Boris N. Yeltsin and US officials as
evidence that Moscow was finally getting its act together. Having
gotten hyperinflation earlier this decade under control, privatized
many crown-jewel industrial assets, created nascent stock and bond
markets, and attracted a few foreign investors, Russia seemed
headed on the right path.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists now deem that progress a chimera.
</P>
<P>
   As during Black Tuesday, there are widespread fears that a
free-falling ruble will spark inflation, social unrest, and
political instability. From the need to restructure bankrupt and
inefficient enterprises to reigning in government spending, the
problems of years past remain.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the solutions that materialize will likely
reflect Russia's new linkage to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems in Russia are not unlike the problems Mexico
had,'' Mariscal said. ``It will require a global, orchestrated
solution.''

LAWYER FOR DEAD SERB DEMANDS PAYMENT FOR HIS FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (af)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A Bosnian Serb who died this month in a cell while being
tried by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the
Netherlands, bled to death because he did not get proper medical
care, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Dusan Vucicevic, said the tribunal was guilty of
negligence and of causing the ``wrongful death'' of his client. He
said he would demand that it pay damages to his client's family in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   His client, Milan Kovacevic, a former politician and medical
doctor in Prijedor, Bosnia, died on Aug. 1 at age 57 from what the
tribunal called a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Vucicevic is a Serbian-American who practices law in Chicago and
is also a physician who attended his client's autopsy. In a
telephone interview from his office, he contended that Kovacevic
had not died of a heart attack but had bled to death because of
errors by the prison staff.
</P>
<P>
   He said other inmates had reported that in the crucial hours
before Kovacevic died, the prison guards had initially ignored his
cries of pain and the calls of other prisoners who had been
awakened and alarmed by his screams.
</P>
<P>
   When the prison doctor arrived an hour later, the lawyer
contends, the doctor misdiagnosed Kovacevic's crisis as a kidney
problem and gave him a painkiller instead of rushing him to the
nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said the autopsy had shown that Kovacevic had not
died of a heart attack but of a ruptured major blood vessel in his
abdomen, which could have been repaired surgically.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report has not yet been released, and the tribunal's
press office has declined to answer further questions, saying it
must await the outcome of an internal investigation. The prison
authorities have also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal prison just outside The Hague is a separate cell
block on the grounds of a Dutch jail, but it is run by a warden and
guards who are appointed by the United Nations. The Dutch jail
provides basic services, like meals and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden death of Kovacevic came as a shock to the tribunal.
Although he suffered from high blood pressure and had earlier had a
stroke and a heart attack, the cardiologist and psychiatrists who
had treated him had deemed him well enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   He had been arrested by NATO troops, and his high-profile case
was important to the tribunal. As its first trial involving charges
of genocide in Bosnia, the case was expected to set important
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opened on July 6. Among other charges, Kovacevic was
accused of complicity in genocide because of his role in 1992 in
helping to organize detention camps near Prijedor, Bosnia, in which
numerous Bosnian Muslim inmates were tortured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   But with his death the case has been closed. On Aug. 1, about
six hours after Kovacevic died, the tribunal spokesman, Christian
Chartier, said he had died of a ``massive heart attack.'' The death
certificate, dated Aug. 1, says only that Kovacevic died of natural
causes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said it was unforgivable that the patient had not
been sent immediately to the nearby hospital. In February the
hospital had found that Kovacevic had an aneurysm, or widening, of
a major blood vessel. ``That aneurysm was never treated,'' the
lawyer said. ``It was like a time bomb ticking in his body. We
repeatedly asked for treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy on Aug. 4 showed that it was that blood vessel, the
aorta, that ruptured and caused an abdominal hemorrhage, the lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chartier has denied that the tribunal has been lax in its care
of Kovacevic or any of its other 26 detainees, many of whom have
physical and mental health problems.

HOMERUN HITTERS MCGWIRE AND SOSA FACEOFF IN 2-GAME SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Standing in a formidable line at the ticket window
outside Wrigley Field Monday morning was Tim Foil, a Chicago sales
representative, who was under as much pressure in his way as Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa have been in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa, as a large segment of the American population
is aware, are neck-and-neck in pursuit of Roger Maris' home run
record, with 47 each. And now they will go head-to-head as their
teams, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs, meet in a
two-game series starting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Foil was hoping to get some of the last tickets for what was
certainly going to be a sold-out series. ``This series is huge,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are McGwire and Sosa going after a record, but the Cubs
are also in contention for the playoffs _ imagine, it's August and
they have not folded _ and they have a long tradition of battling
the Cardinals, their virtual Western neighbors, in a rivalry akin
to that of the Yankees and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother is flying in from Boston to see it,'' Foil said.
``I have to get him tickets _ or I may have to pay his plane
fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Foil smiled wanly. ``But there is an upside if I don't get him
tickets,'' he said. ``Maybe he'd stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in line was Jim Berman of suburban Winnetka, Ill., who
identified himself as a stay-at-home dad. He was seeking three
tickets for Tuesday's game, for him and his 9-year-old son and
6-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there something particularly exciting?'' he said. ``Tell me
about it. I'm not much of a baseball fan. I take my kids to one
game a year. I just picked this one more or less out of a hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman was told about McGwire and Sosa. ``Don't they have
something like 65 homers apiece?'' No, he was told, just 47. But
both are on pace to at least match Maris' mark of 61, which has
withstood challenges for 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Wrigley Field, Frank Maloney, director of ticket
operations, said that yes, there was something special about this
series as far as sales were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sell out _ and that means we're going to sell
all 38,000-plus seats as well our 2,000 standing-room-only tickets
_ and for two weekday games,'' he said. ``That's highly unusual.
And most of the tickets have been sold for about two months in
advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he had received telephone calls from angry fans who
reported that scalpers were selling $12 bleachers seats for $85 and
$21 box seats for $150. Cubs tickets generally sell well, but Sosa
has certainly heightened the intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has been edging up on McGwire ever since he hit 20 homers
in June. On Aug. 10 in San Francisco, Sosa hit his 45th and 46th
homers to tie McGwire for the first time. McGwire hit his 47th the
next night against the Mets, and then Sosa tied him again on Sunday
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire comes in as a red-headed Paul Bunyan, Sosa is a
late-comer to national fame _ and local adoration. He was traded
from the White Sox to the Cubs in 1992, and until this year he was
often regarded as a great but undisciplined talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a selfish player,'' Barry Holt, a Chicago lawyer, had said
the night before. ``He'd swing at bad pitches and rarely hit the
cut-off man on throws from right field, and he'd steal bases in
blowouts just to pad his statistics. But he's a changed man this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt wondered if Michael Jordan might have had some effect on
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa saw how Jordan was respected as a professional,'' Holt
said, ``and then there was that invitation from the president of
the Dominican Republic. He asked Sammy, who is from the Dominican,
to ask Jordan if he'd visit that country. And he did. Jordan said
he'd try to make it. Sammy talked about the respect that Jordan
commanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Murphy, the proprietor of Murphy's Bleachers, a tavern at
the corner of Sheffield and Waveland Avenues, across from the
Wrigley Field bleachers, said she liked Sosa's smile and
good-natured attitude. She was also looking forward to a lot of
people showing up in her bar wearing Cardinals red.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of Cardinal fans in here _ St. Louis is about 400
miles south, only about a five-and-a-half-hour car ride,'' she
said. ``It's a rivalry that's been going on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Cardinals of Hornsby and Frisch and Grover
Cleveland Alexander and the Cubs of Grimm and Hartnett and Riggs
Stephenson battled for National League pennants in the 1920s and
30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come up here, and we go down there,'' Murphy said. ``And
Cardinal fans are friendlier than Mets fans. I don't know. Maybe
it's just us. Because we haven't forgiven them for 1969.'' That was
the year the Cubs appeared to be headed for post-season play for
the first time since the 1945 World Series _ until the Mets
dramatically overtook them.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, the director of ticket operations, said that when the
Cubs play in St. Louis, it sometimes looks as if half of the fans
in Busch Stadium are wearing Cubs blue. And when the Cardinals
visit Chicago, half of the fans in Wrigley are wearing red.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jim Frey was the manager of the Cubs in the 1980s,''
Maloney said, ``he complained that I sold too many tickets to
Cardinal fans. I told him, `Jim, how do I know someone's a Cardinal
fan when I sell a ticket?'''
</P>
<P>
   When Foil got to the ticket window, he was told that there were
only a handful of single tickets left for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``I guess I'll sit in left field and my
brother will sit in right field.'' It didn't seem like such a
terrible idea to him. But Berman, not a fan, did not want to sit
apart from his children.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the ticket seller, ``Is there a game on Thursday?''

 &HT;    Where there's Hope, there's strong support for Clinton
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPE, Ark. _ A place called Hope is still full of just that, and
residents of the Arkansas town where President Clinton was born are
hoping their hometown boy will survive the most challenging moment
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Clinton had an ``innapropriate relationship''
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and whether or not he lied
under oath, Hope residents say Clinton should stay in office and
finish what has been, they say, a stellar presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody could have done as good as he has,''
said Gary Johnson, who runs the Hope Visitor Center, a sort of
shrine to Clinton. ``He doesn't have to stand for that criticism.
He could have come home a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But indications that Clinton would admit that the relationship
was not pure were a disappointment, Johnson admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me, but it's politics. That doesn't make it right,
but President Clinton has done a better job than anyone else would
have done in his shoes. I don't think the public is going to have a
lynch mob waiting for him tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Hope aren't even all that focused on Clinton's
historic testimony before a grand jury. They're relaxing after a
blockbuster watermelon festival that attracted 50,000 folks to
town. And the local paper, the Hope Star, ran the story of Clinton
testifying on page 2 of Monday's paper. The watermelon festival got
the front page, accompanied by a picture of Gov. Mike Huckabee
playing the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every president has had affairs,'' said Rebecca Jones,
21. ``If you have that much power, you think you can do anything.
But I don't think it's affected what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry Hatfield, who was taking a smoke break outside Wal-Mart,
said telling the truth is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hope it works out and he continues to be president,''
said Hatfield, 61, who was born and raised in Hope. ``I wish it
hadn't happened, but I still think Ken Starr was out to get him.
And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't get him for this, then
he'll try to get him for something else, like campaign financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonizing Starr, the special prosecutor who has been
investigating Clinton for years, is a favorite activity here.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who they should get _ Starr,'' said Luther Lee Scoggin,
who was mowing lawns down the street from one of Clinton's boyhood
homes. ``I don't think Clinton did it. Even if he says he did, I
don't think he did. I think he is just trying to get past this.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a bumper sticker some Hope cars sport that says, ``Pray
for those who hate our president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton does have his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a disgrace,'' said the Rev. Billy Porter.
``Here's a guy we trusted to lead the country, and he talks about
family values _ it just looks bad. It ain't right.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Porter says an admission helps him forgive Clinton,
his feelings about him won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't trust him now,'' he said. ``I could overlook who he
goes to bed with, but if he'll lie about this, he'll lie about
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to think this will end his presidency though.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in trouble, but he'll wiggle out of it,'' Porter said.
``He always does.''

 &HT;    News Web sites spin network of information on testimony
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frenzied Internet search for information about President
Clinton's testimony began hours before Clinton's afternoon
testimony. Web sites for major news organizations were stretched to
the breaking point while online-only publications began posting
exclusive information early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the early morning, Matt Drudge, the one-man publishing
machine behind the Drudge Report (http://www.drudgereport.com),
took to the Web with allegations independent counsel Kenneth Starr
planned to play some of the Monica Lewinsky/Linda Tripp tape
recordings ``to provoke a reaction.'' Although critics say Drudge
is hardly a bona fide journalist, he was the sole source of news
early in the day for a public hungry for any scraps of information.
Drudge's Web site was frequently busy and difficult to access.
</P>
<P>
   It was Drudge who broke the news that the online magazine Salon
(http://www.salonmagazine.com) had an exclusive on Clinton's
testimony. Once word spread, Web traffic at Salon came to an
instant standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Until the story was posted mid-afternoon, a simple message
across the top read ``Stay tuned for exclusive report on the
president's testimony.'' The article appeared around 3 p.m., with a
Washington dateline and no byline except a tag at the end noting
the contributions of Salon's Little Rock correspondent Murray Waas,
who was given a byline later in the day. The story largely revolves
around first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in helping prepare
her husband's testimony. Waas writes that Hillary Clinton helped
orchestrate a defense that combined an admission of ``inappropriate
relations'' with Lewinsky, followed by an aggressive assault on
Starr's investigation as ``a political assault on his presidency
masked as a legal inquiry.'' Waas' story also delves into the
Clintons' complex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   While Salon delved into the back-room strategies of Clinton's
testimony, the traditional news organizations focused on facts and
whether Clinton would address the nation following his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, only MSNBC (http://www.msnbc.com) and Fox News
(http://www.foxnews.com) were reporting that Clinton would make an
address on television.
</P>
<P>
   Despite daylong server problems attributed to heavy traffic and
a busy start page that made access difficult, if not impossible, at
times, MSNBC was still reporting that a speech to the nation was a
``virtual certainty,'' according to an unnamed White House source.
Fox News was one of the few news sites to attribute its quotes
including a telling comment from spokesman Mike McCurry during a
White House briefing saying, ``I think the president needs to talk
to the American people, but that may happen soon enough.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN Interactive (http://www.cnn.com) prepared for the onslaught
by stripping down its start page to bare bones text and one picture
allowing more users to access the page and access it quicker. CNN
chose not to run the news of the speech until after the official
announcement was made. Immediately after that, CNN posted a story
quoting unnamed sources saying Clinton would speak from the same
room in the White House in which he testified and would admit to
his relationship with Lewinsky and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   CNN spokesman Kerrin Roberts said CNN predicts the site will
surpass its previous daily record of 15.5 million page hits.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton completed his testimony, all the major news
organizations posted Web stories quoting unnamed White House
sources detailing the testimony and the mood in the White House as
well as what Clinton might say in his speech. Major newspapers were
posting an Associated Press story allegedly detailing the early
drafts of the speech.

SCHOUREK IN THE ROTATION; SO IS AVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The guillotine blade that has been hanging over the Red
Sox rotation since Pete Schourek arrived dropped Monday afternoon,
and perhaps to his surprise, Steve Avery's neck remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, the lefthander acquired on waivers from Houston 12
days ago, is scheduled to make his first start for the Red Sox
Thursday afternoon in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But Schourek didn't bump Avery from the rotation. John Wasdin is
returning to the bullpen, though Monday's rainout against the Texas
Rangers, which was rescheduled Tuesday day as part of a
split-admission doubleheader (1:05 p.m., 6:05 p.m.) means he'll
draw another start Saturday in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams doesn't want to bring back either
of Yirdfsu day's starters, Pedro Martinez (Game 1) or Bret
Saberhagen (Game 2) on short rest, so for this week Wasdin will be
the sixth man in a six-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a demotion,'' Williams said diplomatically. ``It's a
better utilization of the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Red Sox using at least three relievers a night in a
stretch of seven games until Sunday, when they needed just two
calls to the bullpen, Wasdin is in a better position to lighten the
load on the relievers than Schourek, who made two relief
appearances last week but requires special treatment because of his
history of elbow problems.
</P>
<P>
   And Avery already has proven he is of little use out of the pen,
with a 9.53 ERA in 10 appearances earlier this season. Wasdin
became the choice by process of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Schourek) made two good relief stints, but are we pushing it
too much?,'' said Williams. ``Maybe that's not the best way to
handle him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek has pitched exclusively as a starter the last four
seasons for the Reds and Astros. He was an 18-game winner for the
Reds in 1995 before his elbow gave out, and he isn't assuming
there's anything permanent about his place in the Boston rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a start,'' he said. ``Obviously, I'm going to have to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was the fifth man in Houston's rotation, and odd man
out when the Astros traded for Randy Johnson. He was 7-6 with a
4.50 ERA for the Astros, and one of his best starts came June 5
against the Royals, when he allowed just two hits in seven innings
and struck out a season-high eight in a 1-0 loss to Tim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   There shouldn't be added pressure making his first start for the
Sox, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if it were my first appearance, but I've had two out of
the pen, so I've gotten my feet wet, so to speak,'' Schourek said.
``I've got to concentrate on what I'm doing on the mound, not who
I'm doing it for. If I take care of my job, everything should be
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, who complained bitterly when he was demoted to Pawtucket
in June, then handled a second demotion with equanimity in July,
chose the high road again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's to the point where I want to start, yeah, but I want
to win more,'' said Wasdin, who was 1-2 with a 6.16 ERA in six
starts but had allowed three runs or fewer in four of the five
starts he made since rejoining the rotation last month, when Korean
Jin Ho Cho was demoted.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, meanwhile, in the aftermath of his three-inning meltdown
Sunday, talked about how he expects to be pitching elsewhere next
season. There is little chance, he said, of the club picking up his
$3.9 million option for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt like he were on trial every time he pitches, he
said, ``Yeah. It doesn't affect me performance-wise, but in between
starts, you come in here and wonder if you'll get another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a knock at my friends and other players, but you
look at Wasdin, and he's on more solid ground than I am. (Schourek)
came over, and it was, `When's Avery coming out of the rotation?
That's frustrating. The questions aren't there when I make two good
starts, but make a bad one, and it's time to get rid of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery acknowledged there's pressure that comes ``from looking
over your shoulder.'' That had nothing to do with his nine-hit,
three-walk, six-run outing Sunday against the Twins, he said, but
it has made his tenure here more uncomfortable than it already was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my (groin) injury last year, it's kind of been, `What
have you done for me lately?''' Avery said. ``Not so much from Joe
(Kerrigan) and Jimy, but from you guys (reporters), the fans. All
of a sudden everything changes. It's like a report card once every
five days, instead of once every month or two.''
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as it has been to win here this season, Avery said,
he expects that he'll be better off elsewhere next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been a real good fit here for some
people,'' he said, ``and that's probably not going to change much
before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans, you guys, Dan (Duquette), I understand. I haven't
pitched as well, so stuff like that happens, I guess. I don't think
my option will be picked up. That's not a big deal to me. I'll sign
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have to try and go someplace and work things out without
worrying about the same stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery, who never has had arm trouble but is not the same pitcher
he was in his early years with Atlanta, still hasn't accepted that
he has to become a finesse pitcher in the Frank Tanana mode, the
way Kerrigan has counseled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I want to throw this way the rest of my
career,'' he said. ``I've had some success doing it. But I don't
think it's the style I want to keep up. If the changeup's not
there, or my location, I can't afford any mistakes. I've got to be
perfect with every pitch. It's hard to pitch that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Told later that he was still in the rotation and Wasdin had been
bumped, Avery shrugged and said, ``I guess I don't pay attention to
that stuff. I'll just worry about when I'll pitch.''

HEWLETT-PACKARD'S QUARTER PROFIT EXCEEDS WALL ST. EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After disappointing Wall Street in five of the
six previous quarters, the Hewlett-Packard Co. reported financial
results Monday that exceeded analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the bottom line, there was little to celebrate in
Hewlett-Packard's fiscal third quarter. New orders grew just 1
percent from the comparable quarter a year earlier. In addition,
company officials said further restructuring efforts would likely
result in a charge of about $100 million in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said cost controls
and strong financial management had helped strengthen earnings in a
difficult business climate. The company also said that it remained
cautious about future performance because of the continued
financial turmoil in Asia, as well as concerns about economies in
eastern Europe, Latin America and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shares of Hewlett-Packard rose sharply late Monday. The
company reported its results after the regular close of the New
York Stock Exchange, but its shares moved higher in late composite
trading to close at $55.25, up $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had great expense control, but we're not out of the woods
yet,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. With
year-to-year order growth of just 1 percent, ``the risk is you have
another weak fourth quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its third quarter, which ended on July 31, Hewlett-Packard
earned $621 million, or 58 cents a fully diluted share, compared
with $617 million, or 58 cents a diluted share, in the comparable
quarter a year earlier. Per-share earnings reflect an increase in
the number of shares outstanding, to 1.08 billion from 1.06
billion. Revenue grew 5 percent, to $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While earnings were essentially flat, Wall Street analysts had
expected Hewlett-Packard to earn 54 cents a share, according to
First Call, an investment research company that tracks analysts
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Milunovich, the Merrill Lynch analyst, said the company's
revenue actually came in a bit below his expectations, but that
costs rose far less and the company had unusually high ``other''
income, including interest, which accounted for most of the
4-cent-a-share difference.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard officials said that Asia remained very weak,
with no improvement in sight, and that pricing pressures in the
U.S. market for personal computers and printers had eroded earnings
as well. They said the company took a less aggressive stance on
personal computer pricing than in the second quarter, with the
result that it lost some potential sales, but the PC unit returned
to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quarter's slight increase in net earnings, flat earnings
per share and decline in profit margins are disappointing,'' Robert
Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said in a
conference call with securities analysts. ``We were below our plan
in these and other key dimensions of performance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a more positive note, Wayman said operating expenses grew
just 4 percent in the quarter, compared with 18 percent in the
second quarter, and 13 percent in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Currency effects, temporary plant closures, reduced hiring, and
the drop in the company's stock price, which reduces the cost of
stock appreciation rights, all contributed to the improved
operating cost performance, he said. The company cut its temporary
work force by 1,000 in the quarter, compared with an increase of
2,700 in the third quarter of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard said orders for the quarter were $10.5 billion,
a 1 percent increase over last year's third quarter. Orders in the
United States grew 4 percent, to $5.0 billion, while orders from
outside the United States were down 1 percent, at $5.4 billion. In
Europe, orders were $3.3 billion, up 6 percent in dollars and 10
percent in local currency. In the Asia-Pacific region, orders
declined 19 percent in dollars and were down 6 percent in local
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard officials said their goal for revenue growth was
in the mid to high teens, but that this performance was not
possible until world markets stabilize.

   &UR; EUROPE'S IDEA IS NOT SUPER
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Last year, Kaiserslautern became the first German club to win
the Bundes-H liga in its first year of promotion. This was a
remarkable accomplish- ment, since most newly promoted teams
require at least a year to establish themselves against the
country's best compe- tition.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Otto Rehhagel, had been dis- missed from Bayern
Munich after what man- agement considered a disappointing second-
place finish in 1996. Rehhagel guided Kaisers- lautern to promotion
in 1997, then won the Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   The second-place team in the Bundesliga in 1997-98? Once again,
Bayern Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Underdog-makes-good is a universal story line not only in soccer
but in all sport, and is especially compelling in the context of
the club system used by nearly every country. Even if the club
system has been adapted to differing cultures and financial
philosophies, it always retains the basic sporting traits of
promotion/-relegation and usually respects the integrity of all
clubs, regardless of size.
</P>
<P>
   In the US, professional sport is controlled by a small number of
rich owners, who dole out franchises for profit. In most other
coun- tries, there is just the opposite scenario. Each and every
village has the right to enter the national competition in any
sport, with L promotion/-relegation determining who is in the top
divisions. This precept short-circuits franchising efforts and
allows sport to operate as a meritocracy and to retain its soul.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Europe's biggest clubs are threatening to form a
Super League, which would exclude not only the Kaiserslauterns but
dozens of other formidable teams. Oppo- nents of the project fear
that the medium-H sized and small clubs will deteriorate, player
development will be ignored, teams' identities will suffer, and
national team competitions will be marginalized. Proponents of the
Super League say that such a league is an inevitabil- ity, and
since they control digital television in Europe, they should be the
ones to profit.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to brand TV moguls Silvio Ber-H lusconi, Leo Kirch,
and Rupert Murdoch as the patronizing villains. Berlusconi's AC
Mi-H lan has twice been relegated in Italy's Serie A in recent
years, and finished in ninth and 10th place the last two years, yet
Milan would be among the 16 teams in the Super League. Bayern
Munich and Borussia Dortmund L  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  would
represent Germany, leaving champion Kaiserslautern out. There are
dozens of other examples of worthy teams being jilted.
</P>
<P>
   The Super League presumes that such a project is needed. This
ignores the Champi- ons Cup, which has been modified into a
Champions League, and which will be further modified to satisfy the
elite ``breakaway'' clubs.
</P>
<P>
   If the sporting elements _ meritocracy, promotion/-relegation _
are removed from the equation, soccer will no longer exist as we
know it. The sport's value might actually be increased by the huge
television revenues that are being proposed, but this will be an
artificial boost.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiserslautern president Herbert Kessler made a formal protest
regarding the pro- posed Super League last week. Fortunately, the
bullying policies of Berlusconi and Co. are being resisted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HDsub1,s5,14 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Who's the future king?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; xr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Michael Owen  &LR; got Liverpool off to a fast Premier League start
by setting up  &UR; Karl- &LR; H  &UR; Heinz Reidle  &LR; and scoring the game-winner
in a 2-1 victory Sunday at Southampton.
</P>
<P>
   But though Owen was crowned the future king of soccer during the
World Cup, Inter defender  &UR; Francesco Colonnese  &LR; believes he is
overrated, especially compared with Inter's 19-year-old midfielder,
 &UR; Andrea Pirlo &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``If Owen is worth 100 billion lire, Pirlo is worth 200 billion,
that's for certain,'' Colon-H nese said after facing Owen in an
exhibition recently. ``There is really no comparison be-
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  tween the two. I realized quickly that he
wouldn't trouble me technically because he can only go one way. He
is very fast but not strong. This kid is certainly destined to im-
prove, but he doesn't seem to me to be top- class.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pirlo and  &UR; Nicola Ventola &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 20, will be battling to
find starting positions with Inter, raising questions about the
develop- ment of young Italian players. The top teams are not only
stockpiling young talent, but they also are signing more top
foreigners than ever. Teams will be obliged to justify their
investment in outside talent, leaving the L youngsters on the
bench.
</P>
<P>

   United takes stand
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United will likely meet Brazil's Vasco da Gama for the
InterAmerican Cup cham-H pionship. United won the CONCACAF L
Champions Cup tournament, defeating To-H luca of Mexico, 1-0, on
 &UR; Eddie Pope's  &LR; 41st-min-H ute goal Sunday at RFK Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vasco da Gama will be protecting a 2-0 lead in the return leg of
the Copa Liberta-H dores final against Barcelona in Guayaquil Aug.
26.
</P>
<P>
   United's victories over Leon and Toluca in the tournament should
help develop a rivalry between the United States and Mexico, which
the Mexicans believe will aid the progress of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The win also could clinch the US national team coaching position
for United's  &UR; Bruce  &LR;   &UR; Arena &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has little more to prove in
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever takes over the US team will not have it easy. Arena
realizes he will have to revamp the squad. Hopefully for him, he
can find someone with half the talent of  &UR; Marco  &LR;   &UR; Antonio
Etcheverry  &LR; to lead the way.

   Changes afoot in Brazil
</P>
<P>
   Corinthians have emerged as Brazil's top team and their coach,
 &UR; Wanderley Luxem- &LR; H  &UR; burgo &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has justifiably been named to succeed
 &UR; Mario Zagallo  &LR; as national team coach.
</P>
<P>
   Luxemburgo will also have to bring in new talent. He is expected
to add Corinthians'  &UR; Fe- &LR; H  &UR; lipe &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 21, who is considered at least
the equal of  &UR; Roberto Carlos &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Pedrinho &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 20. Both Felipe
and Pedrinho have been with Corinthi- ans since age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Corinthians forward  &UR; Marcelino Carioca &LR; , &UR;  &LR;  who once became so
frustrated about his na- tional team prospects that he offered to
be- come a US citizen, will also likely join Luxem-H burgo. It is
unimaginable how Marcelino, 28, would have been regarded in the US.

LOW-WAGE EMPLOYEES SEEK BENEFITS FROM NEW ORLEANS' TOURISM BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Jacqueline Smith, a 40-year-old hotel maid, knows
all too well the hard reality that lies behind this alluring city's
tourism boom.
</P>
<P>
   While the city's hotels command premium rates, thousands of
workers who carry the industry on their backs _ housekeepers,
banquet waiters and laundry-room employees _ work for wages that
keep them below the poverty line. Ms. Smith earns $5.98 an hour
cleaning rooms at the Wyndham Hotel. The $700 a month she takes
home is hardly enough to support her three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it to survive,'' said Ms. Smith, a high school dropout
who says she is too busy working and rearing children to return to
school. ``Who likes to clean up behind someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans is hardly alone in moving toward a tourism economy
that creates mainly low-skill, low-wage jobs. But its size and
prominence have made it the focus of a campaign by the AFL-CIO to
organize workers in one of the nation's fastest-growing sectors:
tourism, hotels and casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The effort represents an important new direction for labor, as
three unions that have feuded in the past cooperate in what they
term a ``wall-to-wall'' organizing drive that seeks to unionize all
of the hotel industry's 16,000 workers here, rather than those in a
few selected work places. The American Federation of Labor and
Congress of Industrial Organizations hopes to increasingly employ
such industrywide, citywide drives.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the citywide campaign recalls the industrial
unionism of the 1930s, the organizers are pursuing a strategy
rarely used since the 1960s. They are asserting, as the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. did when he marched with Memphis, Tenn.,
sanitation workers in 1968, that unionization converges with civil
rights when it aims to bring economic justice to a mainly minority
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these crushing ironies here that aren't acceptable in
terms of basic social and economic justice,'' said the director of
the organizing drive, Wade Rathke. ``The industry is wildly
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hilton here is one of the most profitable hotels in the
chain, and room rates in New Orleans are rising about the fastest
in the nation. Yet workers are caught in a minimum-wage
service-sector situation where they don't make enough to live on.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 11 percent of the nation's hotel workers unionized,
both business and labor are closely watching the organizing drive.
New Orleans officials have long boasted that the tourism boom,
aided by an immense convention center, has created a tide that is
lifting all boats. But the unions are basing their organizing drive
on a different premise: that the boom has been a bust for many
hotel workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a union because it will help get us benefits,'' said
Ms. Smith, who says she earns too little to afford the health
insurance offered by her employer.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Langkopp, executive vice president of the New Orleans
Hotel and Motel Association, said: ``I don't know that the
employees are unhappy. I doubt very seriously that a lot of people
are grossly underpaid, especially when the big problem I keep
hearing about is hotels can't get enough help.''
</P>
<P>
   In searching the nation for places to mount major organizing
drives, the AFL-CIO selected New Orleans because its hotel industry
appeared to offer one of the best _ or worst _ examples of the
chasm between haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   While the tourism explosion has created thousands of jobs, few
pay well. Industry experts estimate that at a New Orleans hotel
with 1,000 rooms and 700 employees, the manager might earn $120,000
to $150,000 a year, the five assistant managers $80,000 and the 50
or so supervisors $30,000 to $45,000. But the vast majority _ the
housekeepers, waiters and kitchen prep workers _ earn less than
$15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry where 5 percent of the people are chiefs and
90-95 percent are indians,'' said Stanley Turkel, a hotel industry
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders argue that the city's hotels can afford to pay
more because the average room rate _ $104.96 per night, according
to the Smith Travel Service _ is by far the highest in the South
and the fifth highest in the nation, higher than the rates in
Chicago, Miami and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, housekeepers in New Orleans hotels are paid
less than $6 an hour on average, which is less than in any major
city, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Orange, a Baptist minister who marched in Memphis
with King and is working in the New Orleans campaign, said the
inequities were both economic and racial. The work force, he noted,
is overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, while the managers are
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workers I saw in Memphis in 1968 were better off than the
workers I see here in 1998,'' Orange said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hotel managers criticized the unionization effort and
defended their pay scales, saying they were high enough to attract
housekeepers and other workers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tomey, manager of the 1,100-room Sheraton, which has a
reputation for above-average pay, said, ``We certainly want to make
sure that employees get everything they need in working conditions
and competitive pay. But we'd prefer not to have a third party
between us.''
</P>
<P>
   With backing from the AFL-CIO, the three unions cooperating in
the drive _ the service employees, the hotel and restaurant
employees and the operating engineers _ have a $1 million annual
budget and 25 full-time organizers. But the campaign by the
Hospitality, Hotels and Restaurants Organizing Committee is
progressing slowly as hotels fight back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In April, for example, one Sheraton manager sent out a
memorandum asserting that ``the union pushers'' were hungry for
dues money and taking the workers for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This union will stop at nothing to try to get its hands on
your money,'' the memorandum said. ``They want you to believe that
the whole city of New Orleans is knocking down their doors just to
get in. Nothing could be further from the truth. This union is
broke. They need your money.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the drive has had one big victory and one defeat. In
January, 648 waiters, cooks and other workers at the Ernest N.
Morial Convention Center voted by a ratio of 3-to-1 to unionize.
But in February, the Superdome's food workers, who are employed by
Aramark Corp., a Philadelphia-based contractor, voted, 273-128,
against unionizing.
</P>
<P>
   In June, federal labor officials ordered a new election after
finding that Aramark had improperly influenced the vote.
</P>
<P>
   John Wattenberg, an Aramark spokesman, said, ``Aramark doesn't
believe that it is necessary to unionize our workers in New
Orleans, as we prefer dealing directly with them, without
third-party involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Toomer, a 60-year-old banquet waiter at the convention
center, said he had voted to unionize because he earned less
working a lunch or dinner than he did 30 years ago, after factoring
in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the workers voted to unionize, Toomer said:
``It's like anything else. If you kick a dog long enough, it's
going to bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many outspoken union supporters, Toomer said his employer
had cut back his hours to punish him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels have put the fear of God in them,'' said Jacquelyn
Clark, a union organizer. ``When I visit people, they often tell
me, `I can't talk to you. I'll get fired.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits employers from retaliating against any
worker for supporting a union.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, a 27-year-old housekeeper who spoke on the condition
that only her middle name be used, complained that she earned just
$5.78 an hour after six years on the job. Only through Medicaid and
food stamps can she support her three children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that her hotel often gave her only three or four
days of work a week in the summer lull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do my best,'' she said, standing in front of a neatly kept
house desperate for a paint job and roof repairs. ``I try to make
the money stretch out. It's nothing to live off of.''

<P>
   Bank stocks, among the sizzlers in the stock market's bull run
of the last few years, have been battered in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The villains are varied _ financial turmoil abroad, concern
about how easily some banks will deliver on the promises of their
mega-mergers, escalating worries from regulators about bad loans
both here and abroad. The extent of the drubbing is sobering.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-July, bank stocks have fallen twice as much as the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. The S&AMP;P money-center banks
index, representing the country's largest international banks, has
plunged 15.3 percent since July 15. Its counterpart, the S&AMP;P index
of major regional banks, has sunk 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn has far outpaced the 7.8 percent drop in the broad
stock market and exceeds the weakness among other financial
services companies sensitive to market sentiment, namely investment
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are of many minds about the outlook for banking stocks,
with some sounding alarms and others remaining cautiously
optimistic. But investors' opinions have been more unified. They
have punted their bank holdings over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   To wit, a brief stroll through the wreckage:
</P>
<P>
   Suntrust Banks, down 23 percent; Banc One, down 22 percent;
First Chicago, down 21 percent; BankBoston, down 21 percent; First
Union, down 19 percent; Citicorp, down 17.5 percent; Bankers Trust,
down 16.3 percent; American Express, down 16 percent; Nationsbank,
down 15 percent; BankAmerica, down 15 percent; Norwest, down 15
percent; Wells Fargo, down 14.3 percent, and Chase Manhattan, down
11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks posted a solid rebound Monday. And the fact that the
bottom has fallen out of some bank stocks with such unforgiving
rapidity may be just another sign that investors are too quick to
flee stocks in an uncertain market.
</P>
<P>
   Some stock analysts suggest that the sell-off in bank stocks has
been overdone because of inflated fears about a possible downturn
in the American economy and further spillover from the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of these companies have been oversold unless you
believe the U.S. is going into a recession on the heels of problems
in emerging markets,'' said Diane Glossman, a stock analyst with
Lehman Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Dickson, a stock analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, sided
with Ms. Glossman. He noted that the stock price of any bank he
covers with a market capitalization of more than $2 billion has
doubled since the end of 1994. That performance was due, he said,
to a historic reversal in the way that banks do business.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1967 and 1992, banks did not earn high enough returns to
justify their borrowing costs, Dickson said, culminating in the
commercial real estate debacle of the late 1980s. Since 1992, banks
have been earning far more than their borrowing costs, leading to a
run-up in stock prices _ a trend he said would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent decline in bank stocks appears due to the belief
that the banking industry will destroy value,'' he observed in a
research report issued last week. ``However, we expect the group to
continue to create value as the banks are well positioned to
continue to perform at or above the strong operating levels
witnessed in the first half of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all bank stock analysts are as sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe investors are starting to realize that these stocks are
still cyclical,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Mitchell
Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Banks historically earned money off the spread between what they
paid for money and the rate they charged customers for that money.
But in recent years, they have concentrated on fees earned for
various services.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tended to believe that as banks replaced spread income
with fee income, a new era in bank earnings had arrived,'' Peabody
said. ``Now people are starting to see that there are some credit
risks associated with fee income _ for example, from activities
like trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks with exposure to the tattered economies of Southeast Asia
and other emerging markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe were
among the first to scare off investors this year. Their ranks
include Chase, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan, BankAmerica, Bankers Trust
and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Now investors are focusing on economic woes overseas that may
wash ashore here, and stocks of other American banks are being
savaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Asia could continue to put sustained deflationary
pressures on industrial economies like the U.S. and that will have
an impact on the credit quality at banks,'' said Judah Kraushaar, a
Merrill Lynch stock analyst. ``People are starting to ask what
happens if market-sensitive earnings come under increasing
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drag on bank stocks has been fears about how sound some
of the multibillion-dollar mergers will prove to be. Analysts and
bank advisers said that the financial merits of Nationsbank's
merger with BankAmerica and Travelers Group's merger with Citicorp
are not in question as much in three other big deals: Banc One's
acquisition of First Chicago, Norwest's acquisition of Wells Fargo,
and Suntrust's acquisition of Crestar Financial.
</P>
<P>
   There are doubts that Banc One can achieve the cost savings
described as an important part of its merger. Norwest's purchase is
fraught with doubts about how compatible it is with Wells.
</P>
<P>
   And Suntrust is seen as possibly overpaying, offering stock
valued at more than $9 billion at the time the deal was announced.
If the unease about any of these deals proves to be well founded,
profits will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, many investors have already fled or are
hovering around the exits. Stay tuned.

&HT;        CLINTON TESTIMONY BRINGS OUT THE FRINGE ELEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 -- While President Clinton was inside
describing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky Monday afternoon,
the scene outside the White House took on an almost anticlimactic
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of reporters and camera crews huddled beneath
their colored umbrellas inside the compound, waiting for word of
what Clinton had said, outside the gates stood a normal smattering
of tourists, passersby and protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the most bizarre acts appeared to have nothing
to do with the Lewinsky scandal. One young man stabbed himself with
a screwdriver on the sidewalk just north of the White House after
screaming something about the Persian Gulf, the Associated Press
reported. The man, who was taken away in an ambulance, was believed
to be in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street in Lafayette Park, a handful of anti-nuclear
protesters assembled to push their cause, just as they have since
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And on the sidewalk in front of the White House, several Clinton
supporters and opponents carried signs and hawked somewhat unsavory
T-shirts outlining their position on the seven-month-long scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe there aren't more people out here,''
complained a 20-something law school student from Fairfax, Va.,
just outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At $15 apiece, he was selling T-shirts bearing fake quotes from
Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Lewinsky --
suggestive of the oral sex allegations surrounding the affair.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed to have sold about 20 shirts in his first half hour
outside the White House, beginning around 3 p.m., two hours after
Clinton had begun his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But another protester took exception with the way Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr has handled the investigation. With two
wooden signs strapped over his shoulders, one in front of him, one
behind, he compared Starr's tactics to ``McCarthyism'' and said the
entire scandal was driven by Paula Corbin Jones' ``piggy bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Four more protesters huddled underneath a few branches as a
driving rain began to fall just after 4 p.m., forcing them to fold
up their cardboard placard hailing the day as: ``The patriot vs.
the Perjurer'' (Starr vs. Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Inside the gates, the press remained huddled under their
umbrellas. Outside, most of the crowd left for cover from the rain,
leaving the bemused law school student still wondering why there
wasn't more commotion.

 &HT;    Some gas customers online again after fire hits pipeline
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Utility company workers restored about
half the natural gas flow into South Florida on Monday, following a
lightning-sparked fire that crippled a 1,400-mile pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Florida Gas Transmission Co., which owns and
operates the line, said they expect to have 80 percent to 90
percent of the gas flow restored by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working now, and that's good news,'' said Bill Swank, a
spokesman for Florida Power &AMP; Light Co., the state's largest
utility and a major customer of the pipeline. ``We believe we have
sufficient energy to meet the demands ... throughout the week.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the fire-induced gas shortage on Saturday and
Sunday, FPL lost about 10 percent of its generating capacity. Eight
of FPL's 15 electric plants use generators that run on natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, a lightning bolt sparked a fire near a gas
compression station in Perry, about 50 miles southeast of
Tallahassee. The spectacular fire ruptured the pipeline, destroyed
six homes and injured four firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster cut off all natural gas shipments to Central and
South Florida, prompting FPL to urge its 3.6 million customers to
conserve energy until the pipeline is fixed. FPL, a subsidiary of
Juno Beach-based FPL Group Inc., repeated that request Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking our customers to continue their conservation
efforts through mid-week,'' said Swank. This is the first time FPL
has made such a request since February 1996, when South Florida was
in the grip of an unusual cold spell.
</P>
<P>
   The utility asks that customers reduce their electricity use by
raising thermostat settings, shutting off electric water heaters,
closing curtains and blinds, and turning off nonessential lighting
and electrical appliances. Business also are asked to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   FPL idled eight generating units after losing its natural gas
supply. The company met demand by converting some gas-fueled
generators to burn oil, relying on coal-fired and nuclear power
plants, and buying power from other utilities. It doesn't expect
the supply problem to hurt third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers for Florida Gas Transmission continued Monday
to build bypass lines around the ruptured pipeline. The natural gas
line runs long the Gulf of Mexico, from Corpus Christi to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made significant progress over the weekend,'' said Elaine
Thomas, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron Corp., which jointly
owns Florida Gas Transmission with Sonat Inc. of Birmingham, Ala.
``We've got about 50 percent of the volume flowing back to Florida
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-inch pipeline can move about 1.5 billion cubic feet of
compressed gas each day.

THREE PREMIERES WITH PROMISE ON LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable is basking in its own little season before the autumn guns
start booming for the big broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime coughed up a couple of comedies, ``Linc's'' and ``Rude
Awakening,'' last month. HBO carried Jerry Seinfeld's stage act and
has a movie curiosity, ``The Rat Pack,'' on Saturday. The Family
Channel just became the Fox Family Channel, with a fusillade of
original shows.
</P>
<P>
   FX found a spicy variety series in ``Penn and Teller's Sin City
Spectacular.'' Ready or not, Comedy Central has a fresh batch of
``South Park'' episodes, beginning Wednesday, and they lead into a
new sketch comedy series called ``The Upright Citizens Brigade.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, it's Lifetime, the ``Television for Women''
channel. (Men can attend, but their pictures will be posted and the
police have their instructions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie'' and ``Oh Baby'' (at 10 and 10:30 p.m.) are Lifetime's
first original comedy series. ``Any Day Now,'' at 9 p.m., isn't the
channel's first drama series, but its predecessor was long ago and
mercifully forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   This trio might stick. All three shows are well cast and
smartly, if not spectacularly, written. Even the comedies are about
something. And the usual cable budget-paring is only minimally
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Flip-flopping the normal TV procedure, Lifetime runs the hour
drama ahead of the comedies. That might not be wise. ``Any Day
Now,'' starring Lorraine Toussaint and the underrated Annie Potts
as interracial buddies in Birmingham, Ala., has its assets.
Lickety-split pacing isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's pilot has Toussaint, as a high-powered lawyer in
Washington, D.C., returning to Birmingham for the funeral of her
father, a prominent civil rights attorney. She decides to stay and,
along the way, revives her long-severed friendship with Potts, a
housewife.
</P>
<P>
   So on one level, ``Any Day Now'' zeroes in on a close friendship
between women. But it also means to be a barometer of racial
progress. Frequently using flashbacks to cut to 1962, when the lead
characters (played by Shari Dyon Perry and Mae Middleton as
children) forged their friendship, it tries to reflect where we've
been and where we are.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious effort yields moderate results. It's not that the
show overstates the fact of racial discrimination in 1962, but it's
laced into the pilot too thickly and obviously. Conversely, the
present might seem a bit Pollyannish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Day Now'' might just need to work out the kinks. Any new
show with signs of intelligence behind the camera, as well as
talent in front of the lens, deserves a chance to find its stride.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the comedies, ``Maggie,'' is a sort of diary of a
mad housewife. Ann Cusack, less famous than her siblings Joan and
John, is threatening to fall apart as she hits the big four-oh.
</P>
<P>
   She won't, of course. Comedies that dark aren't on TV, or even
under the sofa. Instead she'll persevere, Lifetime-style, in a home
where her self-obsessed teenage daughter (Morgan Nagler) and her
equally oblivious husband (John Getz), a prominent cardiologist,
take her for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie'' has a gimmick, albeit borrowed from ``Ally McBeal,''
or perhaps from James Thurber. Maggie's active imagination leads to
warped realities _ Jack Wagner of ``Melrose Place'' pays regular
and passionate visits to Maggie's kitchen _ and they're on the
screen to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie has returned to school to become a veterinarian, and her
part-time job at a clinic fires her fantasies about the whimsical
vet (John Slattery) who might or might not become her lover in
future shows.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Maggie'' rates about a B, ``Oh Baby'' is a B-plus. Of the
three new series, ``Oh Baby'' is most conspicuously lodged in the
relative freedom of cable. Its chief plot engine is artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Dimpled Cynthia Stevenson, who couldn't quite keep ``Hope &AMP;
Gloria'' afloat on NBC, despairs when her boyfriend (Daniel Hugh
Kelly) gives her a turquoise friendship ring after three years.
</P>
<P>
   First she gives him an ultimatum, then she retracts it and
decides on single motherhood via artificial insemination. That's as
far as we get tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Baby'' has a sprightly gimmick of its own _ Stevenson,
addressing viewers directly, wields a remote control and stands
beside a TV monitor to guide us through her chaotic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about nine minutes left,'' she tells us cheerily at
one point, ``so I'm just going to fast-forward right to my nervous
breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a sentiment for the '90s. Zip right to the nervous
breakdown, fast-scan through it, then check your mascara and take a
meeting.

CLINTON RELYING ON THE SOFT HEART OF AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Will it work?
</P>
<P>
   Never has an American president gone on television to apologize
for having an extramarital affair, for lying about it for seven
months, for letting his family and friends defend what, it turns
out, was indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are forgiving,'' said Alan Wolfe, a
sociologist at Boston University. ``We like to give people a second
chance, and Clinton will get one because he's been a naughty boy,
and you have to forgive naughty boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the president testified Monday to a grand jury about his
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky, 70 percent of the American people said they approved of
the way Clinton was doing his job. That high level of customer
satisfaction, combined with the country's fatigue with the story,
and its soft heart for contrition, might just pull the president
through the tightest bind of his political career, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The key may not even be what the president said in his brief
address Monday night, but what Hillary Rodham Clinton does.
Americans will be much more likely to forgive the president if Mrs.
Clinton, however humiliated by her husband's behavior and her own
public pronouncements of his innocence, continues to stand by his
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude will be: If she can forgive, so can we,'' said
Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College.
``Without Hillary lies the abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been on the edge of disaster before, only to be
saved by a public confession and apology. In 1992, his presidential
campaign, rocked by reports that he had carried on a 12-year affair
with Gennifer Flowers, Clinton appeared on CBS's ``60 Minutes''
with his wife and said he was sorry for ``wrongdoing'' and causing
pain in his marriage. Nine months later, the country elected him
president.
</P>
<P>
   Schier said the president's strategy of stonewalling for seven
months about the Lewinsky affair probably served the purpose of
inoculating the public from its sting and making people more likely
to forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that people are sick of this story and completely
revolted by the details helps the president in an odd way,'' Schier
said. ``They really want to forgive him, move on, and close this
sordid chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   But not at any cost, said J. Bryan Hehir, a professor at Harvard
Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forgiveness will be contingent on a clear, unambiguous
statement of fact by the president and a recognition by all the
parties that he really did do something wrong,'' Hehir said.
``People will only forgive if there is something relevant at stake,
if there is something that needs to be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists like Hehir say forgiveness is rooted deep in the
Hebrew and Christian social traditions, but is far less notable in
the political arena, where it's much more common to seek justice,
or even revenge, than forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there such a thing as political forgiveness? Receiving it
depends on two conditions: genuine political confession and
repentence,'' said Donald Shriver, past president of the Union
Theological Seminary in New York and author of ``An Ethic for
Enemies: Forgiveness in Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have been much better at repenting than
individual politicians. South Africa's new government, under
President Nelson Mandela, has forgiven the perpetrators of
apartheid atrocities who came forward and confessed. In the 1980s,
the US government apologized and made reparations for the World War
II internment of Japanese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan was vague in his apologies for the Iran-contra
affair, which tarnished his presidency. And President Nixon didn't
exactly apologize for the Watergate scandal that traumatized the
nation and brought down his presidency. He said he felt deep
``regret'' if anybody had gotten hurt by it.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had survived an earlier close call: Accused in 1952 of
making personal use of an $18,000 Senate slush fund, Nixon went on
television and said the only gift he had kept was Checkers, a dog.
The public believed him, and Nixon's spot as the vice presidential
candidate on the GOP ticket was secured.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book, ``One Nation, After All,'' Alan Wolfe
surveyed thousands of middle-class Americans and found them far
more tolerant and forgiving of their neighbors than he had guessed.
He said he has been equally surprised by Americans continuing
support for Clinton throughout this sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows the limits of our tolerance,'' Wolfe said.
``When this all started, I thought we were living in Nathaniel
Hawthorne's Massachusetts.''

THREE PREMIERES WITH PROMISE ON LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable is basking in its own little season before the autumn guns
start booming for the big broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime coughed up a couple of comedies, ``Linc's'' and ``Rude
Awakening,'' last month. HBO carried Jerry Seinfeld's stage act and
has a movie curiosity, ``The Rat Pack,'' on Saturday. The Family
Channel just became the Fox Family Channel, with a fusillade of
original shows.
</P>
<P>
   FX found a spicy variety series in ``Penn and Teller's Sin City
Spectacular.'' Ready or not, Comedy Central has a fresh batch of
``South Park'' episodes, beginning Wednesday, and they lead into a
new sketch comedy series called ``The Upright Citizens Brigade.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, it's Lifetime, the ``Television for Women''
channel. (Men can attend, but their pictures will be posted and the
police have their instructions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie'' and ``Oh Baby'' (at 10 and 10:30 p.m.) are Lifetime's
first original comedy series. ``Any Day Now,'' at 9 p.m., isn't the
channel's first drama series, but its predecessor was long ago and

   Hunt for next Bear &QL; 
a futile undertaking
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was probably appropriate. In a year that saw the Golden Bear,
Jack Nicklaus, growl one last time, then finally take his leave,
nobody leaped forward to occupy the void. If there is indeed a next
Jack Nicklaus lurking on the PGA Tour, he refused to identify
himself in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   We heard nary a peep from any of the wanna-Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods? Nope. Phil Mickelson? Nope. Justin Leonard? Nope.
David Duval? Nope. Collectively, the best and the brightest of
golf's new ``it'' generation took a deflating, humbling oh-fer in
the four majors. And it's probably too late for Mark O'Meara, 41,
Vijay Singh, 35, or Lee Janzen, 33, to enter the chase.
</P>
<P>
   One of two things has happened here: Either the burden of
expectations weighted down Tiger and his wealthy young friends,
allowing the aforementioned late bloomers, grinders all, to steal
the headlines, or we have grossly underestimated what it's going to
take for anyone to retrace Nicklaus' Himalayan trail.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely more the latter than the former. Based on the hard
evidence of late, chances are there will be no next Nicklaus, in
terms of either quantity or quality. It's far too much to ask. I
mean, look at what having to be the first next Nicklaus has done to
Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Some major numbers, indeed
</P>
<P>
   Jack's uniqueness screams out in those 18 majors he won between
1962 and 1986. His durability, proof of his unabashed passion for
golf, speaks no less loudly in his streak of 154 consecutive majors
entered, a 36-year run that concluded when he skipped this summer's
British Open. Before the past weekend, he hadn't been a no-show at
the PGA Championship since the Kennedy presidency.
</P>
<P>
   His absence at Sahalee went largely overlooked, with all the
attention having already been focused on the end of his impossibly
long run when he sent his regrets to Royal Birkdale. But that's not
to say he wasn't missed. Nicklaus' specter dogs every one of the
feisty lads who want _ and whom, by all accounts, we want _ to be
like Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Nicklaus' Slam titles came at the PGA, with three of
those victories in a five-year span. As hard as it is to picture
anyone on the tour today playing nonstop for almost four decades,
it's at least as difficult to see anybody dominating one of the
majors to that extent.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, no active, currently competitive player _ Tom Watson
missed the cut at all four majors for the first time in his career;
Nick Faldo was a forgotten figure as well _ has more than a couple
of Slam titles to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Tiger is only 22, Duval and Leonard 26, Mickelson and
Ernie Els 28. But by the age of 28, Nicklaus had already won seven
majors. And the year he turned 23, he took the Masters and the PGA.
It wasn't just an advertiser's clever nickname. The guy was a bear.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth noting that the best single interlude of this
year's Grand Slam circuit, O'Meara's out-of-nowhere dual
breakthroughs notwithstanding, would still be Nicklaus' keeping
himself in contention at the Masters through the early holes of the
fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Limping along on a deteriorating hip, he couldn't sustain the
charge, but the brief, glowing reminder of what he used to be
should have been duly noted by those who would dare dream of
replacing him as the game's ranking icon.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tiger is no Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   With Mickelson looking more and more like the next Norman,
dragging his spikes, Woods remains the obvious candidate despite
his disappointments of late. Tiger's last round at the British and
his first round at the PGA _ both 66s _ told us he is learning to
rein in his huge game. More maturity should beget more consistency
and steady his weekend nerves, which can put him back on a
championship track in '99.
</P>
<P>
   He will win a goodly number of majors before he's done. He won't
come within sniffing distance of 18, however.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best tribute to Woods' talent surplus is the
Player-of-the-Year charge O'Meara has had. Being neighbors, the two
practice together extensively. It's a bit much to call O'Meara's
sudden tardy arrival at the tour's summit a total coincidence.
Tiger's influence has clearly ratcheted his steady game up several
notches. In their odd-couple case, the child definitely appears to
be the father of the man.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods can't carry golf by his lonesome. As influential as he
has become, bringing unprecedented interest in the sport to
neighborhoods where Big Berthas aren't a hot commodity, the
industry at large is in a worrisome slump. Several high-profile
golf companies, Nicklaus' publicly held one included, are teetering
on the brink, and others have seen their stock prices tumble.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably no more than a normal ebb in the flow, another
market correcting itself after a crazy growth spurt. Nonetheless,
the timing has been poor all around. O'Meara, Janzen and Singh
picked the wrong moment to say hello _ just as Jack was saying
goodbye.

STOCKS IGNORE GLOBAL FEARS, RISING STEEPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street shrugged off Russia's currency
devaluation, another decline in Japanese stocks and news coverage
of President Clinton's grand jury testimony Monday, pushing major
market indexes higher and helping the Dow Jones industrial average
post its largest one-day gain in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors _ apparently deciding that they had absorbed all
the bad news they could handle and that all those negatives were
reflected in current stock prices _ dived back into stocks, pushing
the Dow up 149.85 points, or 1.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip index, led by gains in Merck, Eastman Kodak and
American Express, closed at 8,574.85.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.92 points, or
nearly 2 percent, to 1,083.67, and the NASDAQ composite index, an
important technology-stock barometer, rose 27.85 points, or 1.56
percent, to 1,818.04.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong showing, the gain was not broad based, and
some stock strategists called it only a short-term rebound.
Overseas, shares were mostly lower as investors took a less
sanguine view of the Russian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, which is considered the most vulnerable to Russia's
travails, stocks fell 0.8 percent as 20 of the 30 stocks in the DAX
index declined. In London, stocks rose 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 2.18
percent, to its lowest level in two months, largely reflecting
concerns about further weakness in that economy and the region. On
Tuesday morning, the Nikkei rose 280.41 points, or 1.9 percent, to
stand at 15,075.07 at midmorning.
</P>
<P>
   Most other Asian markets fell Monday; Hong Kong and Australia
were closed.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a litany of bad news has battered stocks in the
United States, pulling major market indexes down 10 percent and
more from highs reached a month ago. Investors have been rattled by
corporate earnings disappointments and by Asian economics, in
particular Japan's deepening recession, which has raised fears of a
currency devaluation by China, which might deepen Asia's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The political scandal surrounding President Clinton has also
weighed on the market, which fears uncertainty. But on Monday, as
Russia floated the ruble, effectively devaluing it, and the public
awaited news of Clinton's grand jury testimony and Japan's
benchmark index reached a two-month low, investors finally saw
bargains and started buying shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this kind of economy, you need high interest rates to kick
the equity market'' down, said Mitchell Held, co-manager for U.S.
economics at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went down too far too fast,'' said Harvey Hirschhorn, chief
economist and investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham
Investment Management in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of buying opportunities for people who
continue to believe the economy is OK,'' Hirschhorn said. ``Russia
has been a risk out there. It's a smaller economy. The ruble has
been declining in value for years, and another partial collapse
isn't going to make or break the German banks.''
</P>
<P>
   American financial exposure to Russia is relatively limited.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Russian trading system stock index fell 4.8
percent Monday. Among funds trading in the United States, the
Templeton Russia Fund fell 15/16, to 16 11/16. The Lexington Troika
Dialog Russia fund remains near a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the funds saw steeper declines in May when the
Russian central bank raised overnight interest rates to defend the
ruble and when oil prices slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's renewed appetite for stocks, several analysts
said the market could soon fall further. ``I think this is a rally
to sell into,'' said Byron R. Wien, U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is becoming narrower and narrower; you could see
this coming back in June,'' Wien said, noting that almost 75
percent of the issues on the New York Stock Exchange are down 20
percent from their highs this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, only 31 Big Board stocks reached new highs, compared
with 265 new lows. Advancing issues narrowly exceeded decliners on
trading volume of 584.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The limited breadth of the advance leaves the market vulnerable
to further declines, Wien and other economists said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more corporate earnings disappointments are
expected, and Wien said he believed that analysts had yet to reduce
earnings forecasts enough to take account of that.
</P>
<P>
   While the market seemed to shrug off Clinton's problems Monday,
the scandal is presenting difficulty, Wien said, adding: ``You
don't want the American presidency preoccupied with survival. You
want it to take on world initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's problems also illustrate that much of the rest of the
world, outside the United States and Western Europe, is in a
downturn, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downward trend we're in is not broken,'' said Steinberg,
who forecasts that the stock market's slide will cause a profound
slowdown in consumer spending in the second half of the year.

CBS FILLS PRESIDENT'S POST AT ENTERTAINMENT DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS named Nancy Tellem president of the network's entertainment
division Monday, the position vacated in April by her longtime
associate, Leslie Moonves, who is now the chief executive of CBS
Television.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tellem becomes the second woman to head a network
entertainment division. Jamie Tarses is president of ABC
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tellem had previously headed both CBS' Business Affairs
office and its in &UR; - &LR; house &UR;  &LR; production company. In both positions
she worked closely with Moonves, and she will continue to report to
him in her new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Leslie and I complement each other with respect to our
talents,'' she said. ``We've always taken a team approach and we'll
continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tellem will be in charge of the day-to-day operations of CBS
Entertainment, but Moonves, who has led the department since 1995,
will continue to be involved, he said Monday, with ``all the
biggest deals we make.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that might mean anything from a contract with a big star
to the negotiations for a package of feature films. But Moonves
said he would now be freed up to concentrate more on the other
divisions he is in charge of including CBS News and CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy has a great business background and she is an
exceptional manager of people,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves noted that the entertainment side of the business
remains his first love and for that reason _ and the fact that he
is the only chief executive of a television network based on the
West Coast _ he will retain an active role in CBS' entertainment
decisions, such as which shows are programmed and how they are
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that point, Moonves made a series of other
personnel moves Monday in conjunction with promoting Ms. Tellem.
For example, Kelly Kahl, the executive in charge of program
scheduling for the network, was promoted to senior vice president
and will continue to report to Moonves. Chris Ender, the head of
publicity for CBS in Los Angeles, was also promoted to senior vice
president and he also will continue to report to Moonves.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves also promoted to senior vice president the department
heads of comedy and drama development, Gene Stein and Nina Tassler;
the head of the movie department, Sunta Izzicupo; the head of
casting, Peter Golden; the head of current programs, Terry Botwick;
and the head of East Coast Entertainment, Mitch Semel.
</P>
<P>
   All those executives will report to Ms. Tellem.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer whose guidance and support has mattered
most in the president's career _ his wife _ was not by his side
when Clinton made his televised address to the nation Monday night
or part of the legal team advising the president earlier Monday in
the White House Map Room. Still, according to several advisers,
Hillary Rodham Clinton has played a pivotal role in crafting
Clinton's public and private testimony in what has been an
extremely painful day in the history of her marriage and her
husband's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   According to one close associate of the president's, Mrs.
Clinton helped write her husband's short speech and played an
instrumental role in strategy meetings throughout the weekend.
``She has been the strength as usual,'' said the associate, who
asked not to be named. ``The incredible fact is that she helped
write the speech. How'd you like to have a wife like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's central role in helping her husband to prepare
for his fateful grand jury testimony has coincided with reports
that Mrs. Clinton had only learned in recent days that her husband
was acknowledging an improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Indeed, as the president and his advisers shifted their strategy
away from categorical denials of any improper relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, some advisers stressed that one of the most difficult
tasks confronting the president was to divulge an extramarital
relationship to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the wife, there's a sense of humiliation,'' said the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who met with Mrs. Clinton and her daughter late
Sunday night. ``Hillary is dedicated to her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the speculation that has washed over the capital in
recent days, one question has provoked more conversation than
others: What did the first lady know about her husband's
relationship with the former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky,
and when did she know it?
</P>
<P>
   Several friends of Mrs. Clinton said they found it almost
impossible to believe that she was in the dark about her husband's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``That strikes me as ridiculous,'' said one friend who has seen
Mrs. Clinton this month. Another said, ``Come on. She's the
smartest lawyer in town and the president has relied on her from
the beginning.'' Both friends, who spoke on the condition that they
not be named, said they had never asked Mrs. Clinton about Ms.
Lewinsky or had heard her speak about the 25-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Clinton said he is ``almost certain'' that
Mrs. Clinton knew back in January that the president had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. This friend, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity, speculated that recent leaks to the media
that portrayed Mrs. Clinton as unknowing until now were released to
raise her approval ratings in the public opinion polls. This friend
cited internal White House polling showing that her ratings have
skyrocketed in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said Monday: ``In
general, she hasn't talked about this with us. I can't offer any
evidence of what she knew or when. It's not something we talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton will depart with the president and her
daughter for a 10-day family vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Then,
in early September, the president will accompany Mrs. Clinton on a
trip to Ireland, where the first dady is scheduled to participate
in a conference on women in emerging democracies. Then, the First
Couple will travel to Russia. On all of these travels, every glance
and gesture between and Mrs. Clinton will be subject to intense,
and for Mrs. Clinton, excruciating scrutiny by the news media.
According to one friend, Mrs. Clinton is furious over the media's
dissection of her marriage and the invasion of her privacy by both
the press and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, after the investigation into Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and allegations of perjury became
public, Mrs. Clinton appeared on the NBC News ``Today'' show to
defend her husband. When pressed by her interviewer, Matt Lauer,
with a direct hypothetical question on whether the American people
should seek the resignation of a president who had an adulterous
affair in the White House and then lied to cover it up, Mrs.
Clinton responded: ``If all that were proven true, I think that
would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be proven
true.''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: POINT GUARD GETS INSTINCTS FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are times when the night job is not all that
much different from the day job. Four people want her attention,
her assistance, her touch. Suzie McConnell Serio's role is to
deliver, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be much of a reach to call her the mother of all point
guards? Probably not. A decade ago, she became the career college
assist leader at Penn State. She was a gold medalist at the 1988
Summer Olympics and is the author of one of the more inspirational
stories in contemporary professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after her previous competitive experience, having had
four children who now range in ages from 1 to 7, McConnell Serio
came back this season to wear No. 4 and take charge of the four
players around her in the Cleveland Rockers' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she feels as if the last half-dozen years raising her
children and coaching a girls' high school team was the equivalent
of honing her pure point-guard skills for the Women's National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to take care of my teammates, sort of like the way I
take care of my children,'' she said before the Rockers dropped in
on the New York Liberty on Monday night at Madison Square Garden
for a preview of a possible playoff showdown next week. ``If you
think about it, there are similarities, because while I'm trying to
take care of one, I'm also trying to not slight the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion continued with her passing around words like
``nurture'' and ``control'' and ``discipline,'' and that got
McConnell Serio to remembering that she had better check in on her
husband, Pete, and the kids back at their apartment in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It was Peter Serio, actually, who looked at her one day last
summer and nodded at the women running around on the television
screen at their Pittsburgh home. ``You're still as good as they
are,'' he told his wife, who was cradling a newborn at the time.
``You should think about playing next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten sometimes excruciating and always laborious months later,
McConnell Serio walked into the visitors' locker room at Cleveland,
into the embrace of her opening-night opposite, Teresa
Weatherspoon, the tireless Liberty point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome back,'' Weatherspoon told the woman to whom she was
competitively linked for a half-dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Teresa was at Louisiana Tech, it was always her and Suzie
and the question of who was the best point guard in the women's
game,'' Peter Serio said.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were teammates on two Olympic teams until McConnell
Serio began turning over diapers at a faster rate than the Knicks'
point guards relinquish the ball. Weatherspoon figured she had seen
the last of pony-tailed Suzie Mac. ``It never even entered my mind,
her coming back, after she had four kids,'' Weatherspoon said.
``But when Suzie McConnell sets her mind to something, she's going
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The serious workouts began last January, McConnell Serio running
the Pittsburgh streets with her players at Oakland Catholic,
announcing her intentions to no one but Peter.
</P>
<P>
   There were time constraints, nagging injuries, lingering doubts.
But there came, in April, the WNBA tryouts in Chicago, where
McConnell Serio's body fat was down to 12 percent and she could
again experience the exhilarating feeling of the dribble, of having
having every young wannabe frantic for her to make something good
happen for them. It felt, she had to admit, like the best times at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I had control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along, my wife's only 5-5, 120 pounds,'' said
Peter Serio, himself a coach of high school girls. ``Her eyes and
her mind have always kept her apart.''
</P>
<P>
   A common male complaint about women's basketball is that ``they
don't finish,'' meaning that all the selfless teamwork doesn't
compensate for the inability to punctuate a play from
high-percentage air space.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but was it really last summer when the Garden
management's Liberty game plan was to drape curtains around the
arena so it wouldn't look empty? The escalating crowds for the
women's summer league suggest that the sport is reaching an
audience more interested in basketball as a team sport than a
three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the women's game offers that team quality you usually
don't find with the men,'' Peter Serio said.
</P>
<P>
   When she planned her return, McConnell Serio said she didn't
want to play unless she could be what she once was. On Monday she
was named the WNBA player of the week. She plans to play next
summer, continue to make her point with the pass, with a
nourishment that is reminiscent of Magic, or mom.

TRAVEL NEWS AND NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Aug. 23)  
 (JT)  
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   &UR; Russian Companion For the Queen Mary &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers to Southern California have a new attraction to visit
this summer: a Soviet submarine. The Povodnaya Lodka B-427, a fully
restored diesel-powered vessel that once patrolled the Pacific from
its base in Vladivostok, is docked alongside the Queen Mary in Long
Beach. Visitors can tour the same torpedo room and cramped bunks
where Soviet seamen once worked and lived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, which is also called the Scorpion, was
commissioned in 1973, measures 300 feet long and has a displacement
of 2,475 tons when submerged. It accommodated a crew of 78, most of
whom had to sleep in shifts because of the shortage of bunk space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Australian company bought the submarine after it was
decommissioned in 1994 and put it on display at the National
Maritime Museum in Sydney. In June the vessel was moved to Long
Beach, where it will be moored for five years alongside the Queen
Mary, now a luxury hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the submarine is $10; to the Queen Mary $13, and
slightly less for seniors and children. A combination ticket to
both ships plus an exhibition of artifacts from the Titanic is $25.
The Queen Mary is at 1126 Queens Highway. Information: (562)
435-3511.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Cautious Opening To Lebanon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After Washington lifted its 10-year ban on travel to Lebanon in
July 1997, United States airlines were still not permitted to fly
there or sell tickets to Lebanon-bound Americans and non-United
States citizens for travel even on foreign airlines. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright emphasized that Lebanon remained very
dangerous and urged United States citizens not to go there except
for ``compelling reasons.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June of this year, President Clinton authorized United
States and foreign carriers in this country to sell tickets to and
from Lebanon, but there is still no direct air traffic between the
two countries. British Airways, Air France, Swissair, KLM,
Alitalia, Sabena, Lufthansa, Royal Jordanian and Olympic Airways
fly to Beirut, and Middle East Airlines, the Lebanese national
carrier, flies between Beirut and many European and Middle Eastern
cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But would-be tourists should bear in mind that President Clinton
did not necessarily endorse travel to Lebanon. In fact, while the
last terrorist attack on a Western target in Lebanon occurred six
years ago, and the country's brutal 16-year civil war ended in
1990, the latest State Department consular information sheet
continues to warn United States citizens of potential dangers.
Americans have been ``targets of numerous terrorist attacks in
Lebanon,'' the notification says, adding: ``The perpetrators of
these attacks are still present in Lebanon, and retain the ability
to act.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But having urged the removal of all impediments to travel, the
Lebanese government is pleased with President Clinton's recent
move. ``The ruling makes it easier for tourists who want to visit
our beaches and archeological sites,'' said Hala Abi-Saleh, a
spokeswoman for the Lebanese Embassy in Washington, ``and makes it
easier for Lebanese in this country to return home on visits.'' In
fact, Albright lifted the travel ban in part because many Americans
with dual passports were traveling to Lebanon anyway, but lacked
consular protection because they refrained from registering with
the United States Embassy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the travel agencies that specialize in Lebanon and the
Middle East are Profile Travel and Tours, Washington, (202)
463-2015, GB Travel and Tours, Paterson, N.J., (973) 742-5900, and
Kutrubes Travel, Boston, (617) 426-5668 or (800) 878-8566.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lebanon has posted an array of tourist information on
its Web site, www.embofleb.org.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tiepolo in Paris, 300 Years Later &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Until Oct. 15, visitors to Paris can view the painstaking
restoration of three frescoes by Giambattista Tiepolo at the Musee
Jacque-mart-Andre. The museum, opened in 1996 and still something
of a secret to many tourists, is the only museum in France with
frescoes by the Venetian master. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Henri III's Arrival at the Villa Contarini'' is part of a
collection of 18th-century art purchased by Edouard Andre and his
wife, the portraitist Nelly Jacquemart, in 1893 to decorate their
mansion, which became the museum, at 158 Boulevard Haussmann in the
eighth arrondissement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A circular staircase in the marble winter garden leads to the
scaffolding where six restorers are uncovering the original blue,
pink and yellow pastels used by Tiepolo when he painted the
frescoes in the mid-1750's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The works _ one central fresco and two side panels _ depict
spectators on balconies viewing Henri III's arrival in Venice,
where he visited Federigo Contarini, the doge, in 1574. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three other Tiepolo frescoes decorate ceilings elsewhere in the
mansion: ``The Announcement of Henri III's Arrival'' in the dining
room, ``Hercules' Triumph'' in the study and ``Peace and Justice''
in the boudoir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The artist will be the subject of the first special exhibition
since the museum's inauguration. It will run from Oct. 20 through
Jan. 20 and will also include drawings and sketches by Tiepolo from
numerous European and American museums. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until then, lectures by the chief restorers are given every
Thursday at 4 p.m. The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The restoration takes place during museum hours except on weekends.
The permanent collection includes works by Chardin, Fragonard,
Botticelli, Rembrandt and Van Dyck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $8 (including an audio tour of the museum), $6 for
students and children. The tearoom in the mansion's dining room is
open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Information: (33-1)
42.89.04.91.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spiffy New Theater In Lancaster County, Pa. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sight and Sound's new Millennium Theater will open Sept. 1 in
the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country with a new production of
the biblical drama ``Noah.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The theater has been built in Lancaster County on the site of
the old Sight and Sound Entertainment Center that was destroyed by
fire in January 1997. The new theater has 2,000 seats (600 more
than the earlier theater), larger side stages and better sight
lines. Access to the theater has been improved with the
installation of a traffic light at the entrance and the expansion
of Route 896 to ease the traffic flow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Noah,'' which originally opened at the Sight and Sound
Entertainment Center in 1995, includes a cast of more than 50
actors, about 80 live animals (camels, donkeys, llamas and
chickens) and about 125 animatronic animals. The latter, operated
by computer, include lions and tigers and bears. New sets,
including an ark five stories high, have been built since the
fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday and Saturday, ``Noah'' will be presented at 1, 4:15
and 7:30 p.m.; Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 1 and 4:15 p.m.
The theater is closed Sunday and Monday. Tickets range from $32 to
$37, depending on the day of the week, and can be purchased at the
box office, Route 896, Strasburg, Pa., (717) 687-7800. More
information is available at www.noahonstage.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Oregon, a Portrait of Tribal Life &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Tamastslikt Cultural Institute, a new $17 million center
that presents the story of the Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla
tribes of the Pacific Northwest, opened July 31 on the Umatilla
Indian Reservation, near the old Oregon Trail in northeastern
Oregon. The institute's name (pronounced tuh-MUST-slikt) means
``interpret'' in the Walla Walla language. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The facility _ a long, low building of wood and stone _ fronts
an 18-hole golf course and blends into a backdrop of rolling hills.
The building houses changing and permanent exhibitions, a cafe and
a store selling Indian art. There is also a theater in which the
story of the different tribes' creation by the coyote is told
through the recorded voices of female tribal elders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using dioramas, sound and video _ as well as artifacts like
moccasins and beaded dresses _ the exhibits illustrate tribal
history and contemporary tribal life. One exhibit documents the
huge herds of horses once kept by the Cayuse, Walla Walla and
Umatilla, and the gradual shift away from a horse-based society
that was triggered when 300,000 pioneers emigrated along the Oregon
Trail between 1843 and 1873.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The institute is the last in a series of five interpretive
Oregon Trail centers built across a 350-mile stretch of northern
Oregon over the past nine years. The other centers are in Ontario,
Baker City, The Dalles and Oregon City, south of Portland. The
Tamastslikt Cultural Institute is off Interstate 84, six miles east
of Pendleton. Admission is $6; $4 for seniors, students and
children under 12. Information: (541) 966-9748. For information
about the other Oregon Trail centers, call (800) 332-1843.

 &HT;    Fastball legend's nickname will go to his team
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ After more than a month of voting in the
contest to rename the minor-league baseball team Nolan Ryan wants
to bring to Round Rock, his son Reid announced the new name Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (Drum roll please.)
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock Express.
</P>
<P>
   The moniker comes from Nolan Ryan himself, the right-handed
Texas hero who was nicknamed the ``Ryan Express'' for his
locomotive-like fastball. The name is, as the future hall of
famer's oldest son pointed out, another in a long line of tributes
to the man _ the legend _ who is revered for his rectitude as well
as his celebrated career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't surprise me,'' Reid Ryan said at Damon's restaurant
in Round Rock, which was packed for the announcement with parents,
baseball fans, and children in baseball caps. ``When they had a
chance, the people of this area chose to honor Nolan Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   As more than a hundred people looked on, with their stomachs
full of free food and drink, Reid Ryan with the help of a couple of
young fans unrolled the banner that stated the Express would be
``rolling into town the spring of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some at the restaurant said they were pulling for one of the
other three options on the ballots that have been circulating for
more than a month: the Fire Ants, the Round Rock Rattlers, and the
Texas Outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,862 votes, the Express garnered 628. In second place
was the Texas Outlaws with 487; third was Reid Ryan's favorite, the
Texas Fire Ants, with 417; and last was the Round Rock Rattlers
with 400 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Estevan Uriegas, 8, said he liked the Rattlers the best. His
11-year-old brother, Marcelo, said was rooting for the Outlaws.
Their father, Rudy, seemed to shy away from one name rather than
embrace the others: ``Fire Ants _ that one I might have had a
problem with.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also 930 write-in candidates for the team, a
minor-league affiliate of the Houston Astros. The Round Rock
Pioneers topped the write-in list with 55 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Nolan Ryan started it, it should be named for him,''
said Doris Harvey, who with her husband Dan, makes several trips a
year to Houston to see the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tie with the team's famous owner, the Express
is a fitting name because trains following the Union Pacific tracks
rumble along U.S. 79, where the stadium is expected to be built. If
voters in November approve a measure that would allow the city to
finance its portion of the stadium with hotel-motel tax revenue,
the team, currently the Jackson (Miss.) Generals, will play its
first game in Round Rock in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the team name was announced, 7-year-old Casey Strong said
he liked the Rattlers the best. After the announcement he said he
had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Express now.''

   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As Long Beach City College began classes on
Monday, Schea Cotton was looking for a fresh start and a way to
forget the pitfalls of his past.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, one of the most celebrated high school basketball
players in the history of Southern California, announced last week
that he would attend LBCC this fall. His decision came after he had
signed three letters of intent for three different colleges. But
the NCAA revoked his eligibility to play Division I basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard-fought battle,'' Cotton said. ``I chose to go
to LBCC because I wanted to put an end to all of that and get a
feeling of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``all of that,'' he means his past, clouded with perpetual
sidetracks and expectations that never were met.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 swingman is said to have NBA potential. He has
considered entering the NBA draft, but has yet to play one minute
of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, 20, had his latest pitfall on June 5, when the NCAA
denied an eligibility appeal and deemed his SAT scores
unacceptable. Cotton originally had taken the SAT and failed, but
he and his family argued that he had a learning disability called
test anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   So SAT officials allowed him to re-take the test, designed for
those with learning disabilities. The test had no time limit and
bigger print. Cotton passed.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA Eligibility Clearinghouse invalidated the score and
said it did not receive proper documentation on Cotton's
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton had previously signed letters of intent with Long Beach
State in the fall of 1996, with UCLA in the spring of 1997, and
with North Carolina State this spring.
</P>
<P>
   For more than six months, Cotton said he had studied for the SAT
four hours per day on five days a week. When he learned that his
score was invalid, he was stunned. He had a difficult time, not
showing his disappointment and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to keep an even keel with everything,'' he said.
``When I heard about the test, I kind of felt devastation at first,
but eventually, I just learned to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cotton has moved to a two-year college, which is a
five-minute drive from his home in West Long Beach and close to St.
John Bosco High School, where he starred as a freshman and junior.
He played at Mater Dei as a sophomore, missed his senior season
with a shoulder injury and played last season at St. Thomas More
Academy, a prep school in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He will have to complete 48 credit hours at LBCC to be eligible
to play for a Division I school. He finished eight hours this
summer, but will need at least a year and a half to complete the
other 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   LBCC coach Gary Anderson said Cotton will add ``a special
element'' to his team, which frequently graduates players to
four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he expects Cotton to play one season at LBCC, then
go to the NBA. But Cotton said that is not his plan. ``That would
be putting the cart, before the horse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, the highest profile prep star ever to enter LBCC, did
not talk in detail about his past. He focused on his future,
upcoming season at LBCC and his key philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my motto is 'you have to take what you have, to get
what you want,''' Cotton said. `` ... Right now, I'm really
ecstatic about coming here to play in front of the hometown. It
really means a lot to play in front of people you know are on your
side.''

HARTSBURG READY FOR DUCKS' CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before Craig Hartsburg was fired by the Chicago Blackhawks
last April he said the team, which missed the playoffs for the
first time in 29 years, needed a ``total overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before the Mighty Ducks go to training camp,
don't count Hartsburg among those who believe that Anaheim is in
need of a major tuneup even though the team is coming off the most
disappointing season in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to say that would be wrong, said Hartsburg, who became
Anaheim's third head coach in 14 months when he was hired on July
21. ``That's not the coach's job. I know there are quality people
here and I'm excited about the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have yet to make a major free agent signing, have a
unproven defense corp and very suspect depth. But Hartsburg, who
signed a three-year contract worth just over $1.2 million, at least
has the dynamic offensive duo of Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne to
work with after having virtually no offensive talent in Chicago
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a team that can skate and generate offense, he said.
``The area we need to focus on is to become a solid defensive team.
Our defense as a team needs to improve and not just the defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, who filled the NHL's last coaching vacancy after
Butch Goring turned it down, obviously is happy to have another
job, even if it's with an organization many consider to be in a
state of disaray as it begins its sixth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an outsider I didn't have that opinion, he said. ``I know
(former general manager) Jack (Ferreira) and I'm excited about
working with (new president and GM) Pierre (Gauthier). So I
couldn't ask for a better situation.
</P>
<P>
   Like the deposed Pierre Page, Hartsburg is a former employee of
Ferreira in Minnesota. After finishing a 10-year career as a
defenseman with the North Stars, Hartsburg, three times an
all-star, was hired by Ferreira as an assistant coach for the
1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   Being Ferreira's friend didn't mean much in the way of job
security for Page, who lasted only 10 months. But Hartsburg did get
a good review from from Gauthier, who had yet to take over the GM
role when the coach was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``As team and franchise, he's the franchise's guy, said
Gauthier, when asked if Hartsburg could be considered his choice as
well as Ferreira's. ``I know Craig, he's a solid hockey man and
he's really grown as a coach. I feel very comfortable with him
being here. I did interview him when he came through the second
time around, and Jack had my full support in hiring him.
</P>
<P>
   But after his experience in Chicago, Hartsburg doesn't come to
Southern California with any preconceived notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be here for 20 years, but I'm not worried about
anything else but making the (Ducks) a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was worried (about job security) I'm not going to do a
good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be intense and have fun. If you're not enjoying
it why bother.
</P>
<P>
   After four years as an assistant in Philadelphia and one very
success head coaching stint in the Ontario Hockey League (47-14-5
with Guelph), Hartsburg was 104-102-40 in three years with the
Blackhawks. Chicago made the playoffs twice before the miserly ways
of Chicago owner William Wirtz caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed and hurt, he said of being let go with
two years left on his contract. ``But I had to move on ... I knew
I'd be back. I'm excited about the future, not worried about the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago GM Bob Murray sounded apologetic when he announced
Hartsburg's firing, a move that most believe was ordered by Wirtz,
who was no doubt unhappy with his coaching calling for a
``overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig Hartsburg sold out his soul to try to get this team
going, Murray said. ``The things he tried to motivate this team ran
the gamut and nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   But words such as that don't mean much to Hartsburg, who is
known for his stoic personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let myself get up or down by what is said ... good or
bad, he explained. ``I don't pay a lot of attention to what is said
(in print), what's said behnd closed doors means more to me.
</P>
<P>
   Already Hartsburg has had some private conversations with
Kariya, who was on the receiving end of a Gary Suter cross-check
that ended his season last Feb.1. Suter, Hartsburg and the
Blackhawks were soon public enenmy No. 1 among Ducks fans,
especially when Suter and Hartsburg doubted the severity of
Kariya's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't set off angry words (on both sides) we wouldn't
be worth a darn, he said. ``(But) to me it's over and done with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Paul about it. I was protecting my side, they
were protecting there's. Emotions were a little high and things
were said on both sides that probably shouldn't have been said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was protecting Gary Suter, this year I'm only
concerned with protecting Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what Kariya and Hartsburg have said in private, but
before Hartsburg was named coach the Anaheim star said he could
play for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hold a vendetta against everybody who says something
bad about ... you can't hold grudges, it's impossible, you just
can't function in the sports world. Everybody says something to
everybody else and you've got to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have a problem with him personally, you've got
to take what's on the ice and leave it there.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg now only expects the Ducks to leave it all on the ice
for him.

HAROLD RUTTENBERG, 84, UNION OFFICIAL WHO SWITCHED TO MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Md., Israel)  (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold J. Ruttenberg, a research director for the United
Steelworkers of America who changed sides, became a business
executive and remained outspoken on labor-management issues, died
on Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his son Edward.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenberg's switch to management was at a fairly lofty level.
As The New York Herald Tribune put it in 1958, he was ``the
brilliant research director and economic wizard for the United
Steel Workers and the right-hand man of Philip Murray,'' the
president of the steelworkers union from 1942, when it was founded,
until 1952. Murray was also president of the Congress of Industrial
Organizations from 1940 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In his years with the union, Ruttenberg broadened a thorough
working knowledge of steel company employment and wage statistics.
When Ruttenberg quit the union in 1946, Murray said that he had
been an invaluable associate.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenberg was hired by Cyrus Eaton, the financier, to be an
executive of Portsmouth Steel Co. After three years in management
there, Ruttenberg (pronounced ROOT-en-berg) went on to be,
successively, president, chairman _ or both _ of four other
American companies. He was also chairman of Rehovoth Instruments
Co. in Israel from 1968 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   At his death he was chairman and chief executive of American
Locker Group Inc. of Jamestown, N.Y., which makes and markets
coin-operated metal lockers and plastic security mailboxes. He had
held the posts since 1973, when the concern was called AVM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in the labor world and in management, Ruttenberg
was a perennial advocate of improving ties between the two sides.
He believed that giving unions a greater role in management
operations would enhance productivity and he favored a guaranteed
yearly wage for union workers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Ruttenberg reminisced about his switch to management in
a letter to The New York Times. He said that the leadership of the
steelworkers union had let him and two others resign from the union
rather than have the union agree to pursue a policy that the three
``had advocated of assuming responsibility along with management
for increasing productivity as employment benefits increased so
that the union could restrain steel price increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1958 speech he contended that steelworkers needed ``steady
jobs with 52 regular paychecks a year'' more than they needed
higher hourly wages.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech he also criticized David J. McDonald, the
steelworkers union president, for ``sidetracking the dynamic
concept of the annual wage'' and for resisting the development of
any meaningful tie between wage increases and heightened industrial
efficiency. In that speech, Ruttenberg also criticized top steel
industry executives as failing to display leadership in the same
direction.
</P>
<P>
   He was the co-author, with Clinton S. Golden, of the 1942 book
``The Dynamics of Industrial Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Edward, of Pittsburgh, Ruttenberg is
survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Katherine Monori; his
son James of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Ellen Rabin of Lemoyne,
Pa.; a brother, Stanley, of Bethesda, Md., and 10 grandchildren.

ON THE DAY OF RECKONING, PAIN, HOPE TO MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a day fraught with peril for the presidency of
Bill Clinton, the people's business had to take a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States of America, as you know, is
occupied in the Map Room today,'' the White House press secretary
Michael D. McCurry, told reporters as he began his morning
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The day of reckoning had arrived. The scandal that Clinton had
so meticulously boxed off from the nation's business would suddenly
become part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The story that began in the cold of winter seven months ago cast
a dark shadow over the White House, and the weather provided a
metaphor for the occasion: hot and humid before turning cloudy and
rainy.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most loyal among Clinton aides suspended with any
pretense that it was business as usual at the White House.
Publicly, they promised to soldier on and let the American public
be the judge. Privately, they expressed hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me physically ill,'' said one female midlevel aide.
``How can the president have any moral authority to talk about
issues when his feet are made of sand?''
</P>
<P>
   A midlevel male aide said, ``People aren't concentrating on
whether they feel betrayed or not, but it's what do we do now, how
do we get back on track?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another said, ``We all just want to get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond their words, their faces were long and their smiles
seemed forced, even at the surprise birthday party for a press
aide, Elizabeth Newman, over hot dogs, chocolate cake, and
champagne in plastic cups.
</P>
<P>
   Some staff members expressed anger and sadness for themselves
and for the Clintons. Others felt frustration. In a few cases,
there was bewilderment that their boss would risk what they all had
worked so hard to accomplish, but mostly there was determination to
weather the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Several aides said they would wait to hear Clinton's televised
explanation Monday night before they began to sort out their
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   That address followed a long and embarrassing day for Clinton
that took him back to the place where he sought refuge seven months
ago, the Map Room. It was there in January, as the Lewinsky scandal
swirled around him, that he rehearsed his State of the Union
speech. Monday, he spent more than five hours there testifying
before a federal grand jury that watched on a secured, one-way
video feed.
</P>
<P>
   Before his testimony, Clinton spent two hours with his lawyers
going over last-minute preparations. He later looked glum as he
participated in his normal morning briefings with the chief of
staff, Erskine Bowles, and the national security council adviser,
Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles was left to cheer up the troops. At a senior staff
meeting, he told aides to stick together: ``It's easy to be there
for someone when they're up, but it's the good ones who are there
when you're down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles also told them, according to one person who was there,
``Everyone makes mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Bowles, his deputy, John Podesta, and other
administration officials worked the phones, providing courtesy
calls to the president's Cabinet and his political allies and
supporters on Capitol Hill, notifying them of Clinton's address and
rallying support behind him.
</P>
<P>
   One staff member who is among the longest-serving in the Clinton
White House said: ``I don't feel betrayed. I feel sad. I feel sad
for him, I feel sad for his family. It's got to be just hell to
live through this publicly _ for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The female midlevel aide compared the situation to counseling a
girlfriend about having an extramarital affair. ``Honesty is best,
but it hurts a hell of a lot and it causes a lot of other stuff to
happen that you can't forecast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to be proud to say that we served in the Clinton
administration, or is it going to be something you have to explain
away and is going to be an albatross on your resume?'' she asked,
adding, ``I hope not.''

   Desperate to Ease Crisis, Russia Devalues the Ruble
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government moved hastily to avert financial collapse
with drastic measures that included a devaluation of the ruble. The
step eased the pressure on Moscow to defend the ruble's value by
spending billions in dwindling foreign currency, but it also means
the ruble's purchasing power has been radically reduced, which will
hurt Russian consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the anti-crisis program,
which also includes a 90-day moratorium on some debt payments, had
been made necessary by the near-collapse of Russia's banking system
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the Russians had little
choice in taking such steps, even though $22.6 billion in aid from
the International Monetary Fund announced last month had been
designed to buy Russia some time to restore confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Stocks Near 1998 Lows
</P>
<P>
   The stock market in Tokyo fell sharply and flirted with the
year's lows, pressured by the wobbliness on Wall Street last week
and an expanding economic upheaval that is now ravaging Russia.
Further pressuring the market was the persistent fear that the
Japanese government will fail to overcome the country's banking
crisis and a renewed concern about the impact of Asia's troubles on
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds End Little Changed
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices ended slightly higher while short-term
maturities ended slightly lower, reflecting investor concern about
Russia and Japan as well as caution ahead of Tuesday's meeting of
Federal Reserve policy-makers. The 30-year bond yielded 5.54
percent, unchanged from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Women TV Executives Move Up
</P>
<P>
   CBS named Nancy Tellem president of the network's entertainment
division, the position vacated in April by Leslie Moonves, now
chief executive of CBS Television. Ms. Tellem becomes the second
woman to head a network entertainment division. Jamie Tarses is
president of ABC Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney Channel, was named
president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks, making her the
highest-ranking woman in the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Seller's Earnings Drop
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us earnings fell 63 percent in the latest quarter,
reflecting the No. 1 toy retailing company's failure to find a hit
product that could help it offset declines in sales lost to
discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Haulers in $1.3 Billion Deal
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management said it would buy Eastern Environmental
Services for $1.3 billion in stock, a deal that would expand the
geographic reach of the largest U.S. waste disposal company by
giving six landfills on the East Coast. Eastern Environmental
shares fell 4.3 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital Buying Met Life Unit
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital said it had agreed to buy Metropolitan Life
Insurance's commercial finance division. Terms weren't disclosed
but the price was estimated at $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Effort to Organize Tourist Industry
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is campaigning to organize workers in one of the
nation's fastest-growing sectors: tourism, hotels and casinos. The
effort, now focused on the booming tourist industry in New Orleans,
represents an important new direction for labor.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hemmed in by prosecutors and reaching for political
forgiveness, President Clinton testified for more than four hours
at the White House on Monday before admitting in an extraordinary
address to the nation hat he had carried on a relationship with a
former White House intern that he said was ``not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton did not directly acknowledge a sexual
affair with the intern, Monica Lewinsky, after seven months of
emphatic denials. But he said, ``I did have a relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he e had misled his wife, but added, ``It is private, it
is nobody's business but ours. Even presidents have private
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of Clinton's testimony were not immediately
disclosed. But his lawyer, David Kendall, issued a brief statement
describing Clinton's liaison with Ms. Lewinsky as ``inappropriate
contact.'' It also appeared that Clinton declined to give detailed
answers about some aspects of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky,'' Kendall said. ``As to a very few
highly intrusive questions with respect to the specifics of this
contact, in order to preserve personal privacy and institutional
dignity, he gave candid, but not detailed answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In testifying and then speaking to the public, Clinton tried the
riskiest high-wire act of his career, trying to balance legal and
political burdens. Two days short of his 52nd birthday, he sought
to protect his presidency and elude legal jeopardy by acknowledging
an intimate relationship in the White House with a subordinate less
than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been working on the brief public speech for several
days, his advisers said, operating on the belief that Americans
were not interested in the details of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky but did want him to own up to having made mistakes.

THINGS CHANGE WINS ADIRONDACK AT SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A gray filly named Things Change showed
Monday just how much things can change for 2-year-old horses trying
to make the big leagues of racing at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   When they ran the first of the three major stakes for juvenile
fillies at Saratoga three weeks ago, Call Me Up was the winner,
followed by Brittons Hill, Fantasy Lake and Round Robin.
</P>
<P>
   When they ran the second race in the series Monday, the
Adirondack, only Brittons Hill made the first four, while the
newcomer Things Change was winning and getting her name on the
marquee for possible stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Things Change is a daughter of Stalwart out of the Gato del Sol
mare Romanticat, and this was only her third race. But she has
stepped smartly into her career: second at Belmont Park on July 11,
first at Saratoga on Aug. 2 and first again Monday over Extended
Applause, who has run in the money in all five of her starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little worried at first because in the paddock she was
very quiet,'' said Jose Santos, who has ridden Things Change in all
three of her races. ``But as soon as she stepped onto the track,
she was pumped up. I decided to let her stalk the pace, and
thankfully she had just enough kick to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rice, who trains the filly, said that the race had set up
well for Things Change because she had the speed to withstand the
fast fractions set by the leader, Blushing Deed, with Round Robin
dueling. The early leaders ran the first quarter of a mile in a
zippy 21 3/5 seconds and half a mile in 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But Things Change drove from sixth place into second as they
turned for home, caught the tiring Blushing Deed in the deep
stretch and won by a length over Extended Applause, who had three
lengths on Brittons Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The volatile nature of young racehorses could be seen in the
changing fortunes of the four who had run well in the Schuylerville
on July 29. Call Me Up, who won that race, finished this one in
seventh place. Brittons Hill slipped from second to third. Fantasy
Lake, third in the Schuylerville, ran sixth this time. And Round
Robin dropped from fourth place to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Things Change ran the six and a half furlongs in
1:18, paid $8.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next big date for the 2-year-old fillies is Sept. 4, in the
Grade I Spinaway at seven furlongs for $200,000.

NEW LEAF BLOWER PRESENTED AS QUIET SOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It resembles a ray gun from an old TV show,
generates no pollution, makes little noise and could fix Los
Angeles' disputed ban on leaf blowers, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The electric-powered leaf blower presented to City Council
members was developed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, which hopes will solve problems with the leaf blower ban and
earn the city money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are enthusiastic that we are on the right track toward
finding a viable solution that meets the varying needs of our
city's residents,'' said DWP General Manager David Freeman.
``Everyone is eager to advance this prototype into the
commercialization stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the city hopes to be able to cash in on the
prototype by convincing a manufacturer to develop and sell them
across the country and provide a royalty to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly hopeful that will be the case,'' said
Angelina Galiteva, who was in charge of the project for the DWP.
``We think there will be a market for these blowers across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The blower, with red and blue wires coiled along a plastic tube,
generates as much force as the gas-fueled machines, officials said.
A battery pack weighing up to 27 pounds powers the device.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, she said, the DWP would agree to buy a number of
devices to replace its own gasoline-powered leaf blowers.
</P>
<P>
   The city has banned gas-powered leaf blowers in residential
areas, but gardeners have gotten around the law by using _ or
saying they are using _ methanol fuel to run the blowers.
Prosecutors said gardeners must provide a declaration of their own
and one from the person who modified the machines to run on
methanol.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who has pushed for the ban, said
she is trying to find a way to close the loophole. She is waiting
to hear from the California Air Resources Board to determine if the
city can issue a ban on the use of methanol.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she was enthusiastic about the electric leaf
blower, developed by AeroVironment Inc., in consultation with the
DWP and a Leaf Blower Task Force appointed by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   AeroVironment developed the prototype under a $60,000 contract
with the DWP as part of its public benefits program required under
the new state law deregulating the electric industry, Galiteva
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Water and Power Commissioners has set aside $1
million for two years for this program.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone was pleased with the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It solves the problem of noise and emissions, but it still
doesn't deal with the dust that is blown,'' said Jack Allen of
suburban Pacific Palisades, a member of the Leaf Blower Task Force.
``We still are going to have the problem of gardeners blowing
leaves and dust on neighboring properties and then driving off.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he complained the task force had little significant
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we were window dressing,'' Allen said. ``We
didn't look at all the alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Galiteva said the group was shown alternatives the agency
felt would be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to come up with a machine that has zero emissions
and the same power as the ones now in use,'' Galiteva said. ``We
did that. The existing electric machines don't generate enough
power unless they are noisier than what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners and others praised the device, but said they remain
concerned over the existing prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support anything that will let us do our job,'' said Adrian
Alvarez of the Latin American Gardeners Association. ``But, we want
to keep our jobs now. We have families to feed. We aren't your
opponents, but we want some kind of compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez urged the council to suspend its existing law until the
new machine can be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Zambrano of AeroVironment said his firm wanted to have at
least one month of further testing around the area and would need
through December to develop specifications for a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he estimated, it would take a manufacturer three to
six months to gear up to produce the machine because it is made
with readily accessible items.
</P>
<P>
   It is much quieter than gasoline-powered blowers, with a decibel
level of 64 at 50 feet, which officials described as two or three
times louder than normal conversation. That compares to the 70
decibel level of gasoline-powered leaf blowers, said to be
comparable to a loud party.
</P>
<P>
   The device can operate 10 to 45 minutes depending on the size of
the batteries used, and expels air at a velocity of up to 150 miles
per hour, officials said.

5 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN NORTHERN IRELAND ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change number of arrests from six to five in 1st graf and
head; no other changes)  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ British police arrested five men
Monday in towns near this city for questioning in the car bomb
attack here on Saturday that killed 28 people and injured 220.
</P>
<P>
   The blast, the deadliest in 29 years of sectarian violence in
this predominantly Protestant British province, is widely believed
to have been the work of a group that calls itself the Real IRA, a
splinter group whose members left the Irish Republican Army this
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland pledged to hunt down the killers
and made it clear that they thought that the Real IRA was
responsible for the attack. The group is thought to be,
effectively, the military wing of a political splinter group, the
32-County Sovereignty Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Sovereignty Committee vehemently opposes the new Northern
Ireland peace agreement because it leaves the six northern
counties, which constitute a British province, under British
sovereignty. The group wants those counties subsumed in the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Two London newspapers reported that the leader of the Real IRA
was a former weapons expert for the Irish Republican Army who
defected after the IRA decided to observe a cease-fire 13 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary gave no details about the arrested
suspects. But the identity of one was disclosed by his father, a
leader of the Sovereignty Committee in Omagh.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Francie Mackey, an Omagh City Council member, said
his son, Shane, had been arrested Monday morning. Mackey, a
prominent member of the 32- County Sovereignty Committee, said that
the arrest was harassment and that his son had nothing to do with
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was sorry for the victims, but declined to condemn
the attack categorically. He also said his group had no links with
the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But security officials in Belfast and Dublin say there is a
connection. The identity of the Real IRA leader has been a matter
of widening public concern since the attack. Several British and
Irish newspapers have said he is believed to be a middle-age man
who lives near Dundalk, Ireland, near the border.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two London newspapers, The Express and The Daily
Telegraph, named the leader as Michael McKevitt, former IRA weapons
quartermaster. The papers published a photograph of him on their
front pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegraph reported that McKevitt lived with a leader of the
Sovereignty Committee, Bernadette Sands. Ms. Sands' brother Bobby
became an IRA hero and martyr in 1981, when he starved himself to
death in a British prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegraph said, ``McKevitt was formerly in control of all
IRA arms dumps and the movement of arms, ammunition and explosives
across the border to Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   When he resigned in October from the IRA, the newspaper said, he
said he would not ``use anything in the IRA arsenal for his own
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sands, who was highly visible in the campaign against the
new peace agreement in May, has issued no statements in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread official view, held by the British and Irish
prime ministers, is that the Real IRA does not have the backing of
the main group. That conclusion is based on intelligence officers'
analysis of the relationship between the main group and the
dissident splinters. In addition, the intelligence assessments are
based on information from Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Protestant hard-liners assert that the Irish
Republican Army supports the splinter groups. But the Protestant
groups have produced no evidence to support that. They also say
that to them it does not matter whether the IRA is allied with the
splinter groups, that the effect is the same if there is violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Omagh Monday afternoon, several hundred people milled around
and talked quietly near the police barrier that blocked the way to
Market Street, where the bomb exploded. British troops in full
combat uniform, holding automatic rifles at the ready, guarded the
street.
</P>
<P>
   A white-haired Catholic man was looking at the hundreds of
bouquets placed on the sidewalk to express the sympathy of this
town of 27,000, about 70 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Catholics and Protestants were killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder why it should happen,'' a bystander said almost in
a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away a Protestant man who would not give his name
because, he said, he feared terrorist reprisals, said the attack
proved that ``all this nonsense about peace'' was futile. He said
the death penalty should be restored for terrorists, as well as
preventive detention without trial of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Eileen Goldsmith, who described herself as ``a good
Protestant,'' said: ``Everybody worked together, went out together.
Now this is the worst thing that ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On a wall above the bouquets, a hand-written poem had been
taped, apparently by a British soldier's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know why my husband is here,'' it said. ``I want to
gather up my family and run from your town. Pray for the strength
to stay.''

CELLUCCI TO PRESS CIGARETTE MAKERS FOR TOXIN DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an attempt to bypass the tobacco industry's legal
fight against Massachusetts' ground-breaking ingredient disclosure
law, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci will Tuesday propose regulations
requiring cigarette makers to publicly reveal toxins in cigarette
smoke, administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Cellucci will unveil his plan,
which would mark a new national front against the embattled
industry, at a morning meeting of the Massachusetts Public Health
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations would require any cigarette maker
selling products in Massachusetts to annually list by brand the
toxic substances in the smoke emitted from its products.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci-appointed council, which is required to set a date
for a public hearing regarding the proposal, must approve the
regulations before they can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to say no,'' said one source of the council's
expected decision to go along with the acting governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   But observers who have followed the battle over the state's
tobacco ingredients disclosure statute _ the so-called Tolman Law _
say that any implementation of the regulations will face a vigorous
legal challenge from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Approved in 1996, the Tolman Law _ named after its sponsor,
Senator Warren E. Tolman, a Watertown Democrat _ would require
tobacco companies to disclose the ingredients in cigarettes, snuff,
and chewing tobacco. Administration officials familiar with the new
regulations say Cellucci's move is an attempt to enact a key
section of the law that has been tied up in a federal court
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry won an injunction last year on the law's
implementation, arguing that it would be forced to give up vital
trade secrets if it had to make public the ingredients in its
products.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials are confident they can argue that
requiring the manufacturers to disclose toxic substances in
firsthand and secondhand smoke would not be forcing the industry to
divulge trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see the tobacco industry argue that the poison
produced by their products are trade secrets,'' said Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger, whose office will be responsible for
defending any challenge to the regulations. ``We will be happy to
defend this initiative, as we have the Tolman ingredient disclosure
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's move on the regulations is his first major
anti-smoking initiative. He and former governor William F. Weld had
generally ignored tobacco control issues and had even opposed some
major initiatives, such as the 1992 referendum to raise taxes on
cigarettes for an anti-smoking program.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Weld also scoffed at Harshbarger's
multibillion-dollar suit in 1995 against the tobacco giants to
recover medical costs from smoking-related diseases. With similar
suits winning concessions in other states, Massachusetts stands to
gain a huge windfall from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Administration sources said Monday that Cellucci's regulations
would focus on 12 toxic substances, such as ammonia, hydrogen
cyanide, mercury and other toxic trace metals, tar, nicotine, and
carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci proposal comes several days after a US appellate
court in Virginia ruled that the federal Food and Drug
Administration had no authority to regulate tobacco products.
President Clinton had declared cigarettes drug-delivery devices
and, therefore, should come under FDA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci administration health officials said that another court
ruling in Boston last year bolsters the administration's proposed
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st District Court of Appeals ruling said that Massachusetts
has the right to regulate tobacco products as long as it did not
require any warnings on the package. A federal statute already
mandates such warnings.

MAN SAYS HE NEVER HID HIS PAST AT NAZI CAMP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Reimer, the retired businessman accused of
participating in Nazi atrocities and then concealing his actions to
immigrate to the United States, testified Monday that he had never
hidden the fact that he had worked in the Trawniki concentration
camp in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not conceal anything,'' said Reimer, 79, a thin
white-haired man who maintains he was not a Nazi but a Soviet army
lieutenant captured by the Germans in the early days of the war and
then plucked from the misery of his prisoner-of-war camp to work as
a bookkeeper for his German captors.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has charged that at Trawniki, which was a
training camp for Nazi troops as well as a place of forced labor
and random death for its Jewish inmates, Reimer was a decorated
officer who took part in mass murders there and helped in the
liquidation of Jewish ghettos elsewhere in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Reimer _ and for the Justice Department lawyers
who want his U.S. citizenship revoked _ is that he gave various
accounts of his wartime experience during questioning over the last
47 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his three days of testimony in federal court in Manhattan,
Reimer insisted he was a mere clerk with no military duties and no
role in Nazi persecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer, who was born in Ukraine, applied for a visa to the
United States in 1951, after working for several years for the
American Red Cross as a driver in postwar Germany. He has testified
that he does not remember much of what he told investigators in
Germany who were charged with weeding out Nazis and their
collaborators among the visa applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are contradictory. At least one report from that
period shows that he said he was a prisoner of war at Trawniki and
worked there as a clerk, according to his lawyer, Ramsey Clark.
Another, based on his statements to the investigators, does not
mention Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   The more current record is just as ambiguous. Reimer testified
that he did not hide his past in interviews with the Justice
Department in 1980, when he was questioned as a possible witness in
proceedings against another Nazi war-crimes suspect, John
Demjanjuk, a retired Cleveland autoworker. Reimer said he did not
know Demjanjuk and was sent home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Justice Department contacted him again. At that
interview, Reimer agreed with the investigators that he had
concealed parts of his past.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, however, he said he did so because he
was confused and flustered. ``I had forgotten what I put in my visa
application to come to this country,'' Reimer said. ``I believed
what they told me.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his interrogators ``put words in my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers will start their cross-examination of Reimer
on Tuesday.

INFORMIX LEADER SENSES GAIN AFTER FILL OF PAIN  
 BY JAMIE BECKETT 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - INFORMIX   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
It's a good thing Bob Finocchio is a marathon runner _ he's needed
the endurance since becoming chief executive of Informix a year
ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each time it seemed the troubled database-software maker had
turned the corner, new problems cropped up.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past year, Informix had to restate sales due to
accounting problems, a costly and embarrassing move for a large,
public company.
</P>
<P>
   Its share of the database market slipped from 6 percent in 1996
to 5.6 percent in 1997 and is expected to fall slightly this year,
according to IDC Research. Informix is No.3 after Oracle with a 39
percent share and IBM with 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Informix's stock _ which hit an all-time high of $35.88 in
February 1996 _ slid to an all-time low of $4 in December 1997. It
closed at $5.56 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   To run a marathon, ``you have to be able to plow through pain,''
Finocchio said. ``There are a lot of parallels to running the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Finocchio said he believes the worst pain is past.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Informix reported a second-quarter profit of $12.3
million _ three times what analysts were expecting. Revenues were
$174.2 million. For the first time since he took the job in July
1997, Finocchio is making positive predictions.
</P>
<P>
   He told analysts recently he expects revenues in the second half
of 1998 to be bigger than both the second half of last year and the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a terribly daring forecast: Except for 1997, Informix
typically has a strong second half. But the positive prediction is
a big step for Finocchio, who has been reluctant to raise
expectations during a grueling year.
</P>
<P>
   There are other encouraging signs:
</P>
<P>
   _After more than a year of cutting jobs or losing employees to
rivals such as Oracle, Informix is growing again. Since the
beginning of the year, the company has expanded its staff by about
10 percent to nearly 3,600.
</P>
<P>
   _Last month, the company announced it has several new customers,
including DDI Corp., one of Japan's largest telecom carriers, and
Korea's seven national libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _For the first time, the company is creating a unified marketing
theme, and it has hired a new vice president for corporate
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Informix has a future today that wasn't possible a year ago,''
Finocchio said.
</P>
<P>
   But what is emerging is a much different company from the
high-flying Informix of the past. It's a lot more cautious, with
strict controls intended to prevent future financial blunders. It's
also a lot more humble.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a rival to giant Oracle, the company has lowered
its sights. ``We don't have to be a $5 billion company to make
money,'' Finocchio said.
</P>
<P>
   One way Informix got in trouble was selling databases at
cut-rate prices to anybody who would buy one. Now the company wants
to focus on higher-profit niche markets like electronic commerce,
retailing and media, where it believes its technology gives it an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like us to be viewed as the BMW of the database
industry,'' said Finocchio. ``Our challenge is to go to customers
where the database is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Oracle and other competitors such as IBM and Microsoft,
which sell software applications and tools as well as databases,
Informix is betting solely on the database.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy some say is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The database isn't the center of the universe anymore. It's
only one link in the (software) chain,'' said Merv Adrian, vice
president at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are looking for a package of products _ not just
a database but also applications, tools and services _ to track an
entire operation such as customer service or human resources.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Adrian expects Informix will retain current customers but sees
difficulty winning new ones without a broader product line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider them a competitor anymore,'' said Mark
Jarvis, senior vice president of marketing at Redwood Shores-based
Oracle. ``The era of the pure database company is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Murphy, publisher of the California Technology Stock
Letter, thinks Informix's niche strategy will pay off. ``They're
doing the right thing, walking away from the commodity end of the
business where Microsoft is chopping up prices and heading to
e-commerce and places where people have to manage new data types.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is also focused on achieving financial stability,
which is essential to regain Wall Street's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent the past year trying to come out of a
financial tailspin that began when it discovered that salespeople
eager to boost their commissions had booked business that wasn't
complete. Eventually, it had to restate results, lowering reported
revenues by $278 million between January 1994 and June 1997 and
lowering earnings by $236 million for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   After the restatement last November, the company reported two
consecutive profitable quarters. But then it faced the
embarrassment of restating again _ this time after a dispute with
auditors over how the company recognized sales to customers who
installed Informix databases in other products for resale.
</P>
<P>
   The second restatement, in May, reduced first-quarter revenues
by $6.2 million to $161 million and turned a $4.9 million profit
into a $400,000 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The company is determined not to slip again. New Chief Financial
Officer Jean-Yves Dexmier has instituted strict financial controls
to sharply divide sales and accounting functions. Among other
things, Dexmier created an in-house audit group that reports
directly to the board of directors and a management committee
responsible for reviewing all major sales. Most sales reviews
include a visit to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing what they should be doing,'' said James Pickrel,
an analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``Their growth rate won't be as
exciting as some investors are looking for, but it's good for the
long term.''

HP'S Q3: HO-HUM AGAIN  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - HP   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
In what has become a depressing routine, computer giant
Hewlett-Packard turned in another lackluster financial performance
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blaming Asian turmoil and falling PC prices, HP reported a tiny
increase in earnings and only 5 percent revenue growth for the
third quarter that ended July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Palo Alto company said net income was $621 million, compared
to $617 million for the same period a year ago. Earnings per share
were 58 cents, the same as last year, when there were fewer
outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly revenue was $11 billion, up from $10.5 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   HP warned last month that it was about to disappoint Wall Street
for the ninth time in 10 quarters. The earnings came in just above
analysts' diminished estimates of 54 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly not pleased with our Q3 results,'' said Chief
Financial Officer Bob Wayman.
</P>
<P>
   However, HP appeared to make good progress in reigning in
expenses, which were just 4 percent higher than in last year's
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company has slowed the pace of hiring and also saved some
money by temporarily closing some facilities in early July.
</P>
<P>
   HP has been particularly plagued by weakness in Asia, mainly in
Korea and Japan, which are major markets for its semiconductor and
communications testing and measurement equipment. HP's revenue from
the Asia Pacific region dropped 13 percent in U.S. dollars during
the quarter, while orders declined 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   HP said its PC business continued to suffer from ``intense
pricing pressure.'' Despite good growth in unit sales, revenue from
PCs was flat during the quarter as customers shifted to
lower-priced PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest spot in HP's lineup was its Unix servers _
computers designed to manage corporate networks. Both the high-end
and mid-range models showed ``excellent revenue growth,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   HP estimated that revenues for the fourth quarter will exceed
those reported yesterday. ``But our planning assumptions for fiscal
year 1999 have revenue growth below the mid- to high teens that
we've achieved over the long term,'' said Wayman.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will continue to pare expenses by limiting
hiring and curbing employee travel.
</P>
<P>
   HP also has announced plans to close its operations worldwide
for two weeks in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a tough situation,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst
Daniel Kunstler. ``They're really trying to cut expenses, because
they're not planning for any explosion of the top line.
</P>
<P>
   ``HP remains a good company, but they're sort of caught right
now. The environment in which they operate simply isn't very
hospitable, and there's no easy way to break out of that.''

INCYTE SAYS IT WILL MAP DNA WITHIN A YEAR  
 BY ILANA DEBARE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - INCYTE   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. said yesterday it plans to map most of
the human genome within one year, part of a drive to capture an
emerging new market for data on gene variations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palo Alto-based Incyte announced plans to achieve that goal by
purchasing a British firm called Hexagen for $5 million in cash and
1 million shares of stock, a total purchase price of about $41
million.
</P>
<P>
   The company will incorporate Hexagen into a new division to be
called Incyte Genetics, which will issue its own stock and will
specialize in selling information about gene variations _ data that
can be useful in figuring out why identical drugs affect people
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte's one-year timetable for genetic mapping is much faster
than the government-funded Human Genome Project, which set 2005 as
its goal for a thoroughly documented map of human genetic material.
</P>
<P>
   It also would be faster than Incyte's main commercial
competitor, Perkin-Elmer Corp., which last spring formed Celera
Genomics Corp. and promised to produce a gene map within three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perkin-Elmer rattled some cages with their decision to enter
the field, but this (acquisition) reaffirms Incyte's leadership
role in the technology needed for gene splicing,'' said Richard van
den Broek, a biotechnology stock analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte is a leader in the field of genomics, a part of the
biotechnology world focused on finding and analyzing the 120,000 to
150,000 genes that make up human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said their main division will continue to sell
general gene-mapping equipment and software, along with genomics
data that can help drug companies develop new products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the new division will market software and data about
genetic variations _ tiny differences within similar genes that can
determine how individual people respond to diseases or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   These variations are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or
SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a response to our customers in the pharmaceutical
industry,'' said Incyte CEO Roy Whitfield. ``There is a lot of
enthusiasm in the industry for creating a database of SNPs, which
can tell us why certain drugs work for some people but not others,
or why drugs have side effects for some people but not others.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield said the new division also will map out most of the
human genome _ naming and locating all human genes _ within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte was founded in 1991 and has more than 700 employees,
including 500 at its Palo Alto headquarters and 80 in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few biotechnology startups that has generated a
profit. For the quarter ended June 30, Incyte reported net income
of $5.2 million (18 cents per diluted share) up from $1.3 million
(5 cents) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte's new business unit that is focused on gene variations
won't generate any revenues until 1999 and won't generate any
profit until 2002, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably one reason why the company decided to issue
separate common stock known as tracking stock for the new division.
Other companies that have issued tracking stock for their
subsidiaries include General Motors, which issued separate stock
for its EDS software division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Incyte is that it's a company that earns
money, unlike much of their competition,'' said van den Broek.
``They probably have more earning-sensitive investors and may have
wanted to shield them from uncertainty about earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Incyte officials said they intend to plow $20 million to $30
million of the firm's money into the new gene-variation division,
on top of the initial $40 million purchase price. Then they intend
to raise another $130 million to $140 million from outside sources,
such as drug industry investors or licenses from drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte's stock fell $2.25 to close at $30.63 yesterday. &LR;

 WASHINGTON: made mistakes. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the public focus on Monday was on sex as the airwaves
filled with chatter about the president, little was learned about
the less titillating but legally more threatening question of
whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice by possibly covering up
the relationship. He has denied that accusation, which associates
of Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent prosecutor, has said
is at the center of the inquiry by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 12:59 p.m., Clinton met with prosecutors in the Map
Room on the ground floor of the White House. His testimony was
videotaped and transmitted by live closed-circuit television to a
grand jury at the federal courthouse, just blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers were also in the room, Clinton sat alone in a
gilt chair before a table by a bank of windows, facing off against
a cadre of prosecutors who, his associates say, he believes is bent
on destroying him.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether the president lied under oath in
denying an affair with Ms. Lewinsky last January in his deposition
during the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit. Beyond the nature of
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr has been
investigating whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice and suborn
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took several breaks from his testimony on Monday to
confer with his lawyers in the doctor's office next door to the Map
Room. At about 3:30, he took a break that lasted roughly an hour,
one Clinton ally said.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the Lewinsky accusations has consumed seven
months of Clinton's presidency, his aides have acknowledged.
Clinton viewed his own place in history as riding in part on his
performance Monday and its impact on public opinion, one of his
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican congressional leaders have said that an
acknowledgment by Clinton that he had not told the truth about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky might blunt the threat of
impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill. Erskine Bowles, the White
House chief of staff, called Democrats on the Hill this evening to
rally support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Clinton heads off such hearings, it is far from
clear whether he will put his second term back on track, or put to
rest smirking speculation about his private life and inflamed
doubts, reflected in public polls, about his truthfulness. More
fundamentally, it was uncertain whether the presidency itself has
been diminished by a tawdry spectacle that on Monday drew so much
attention that one television camera monitored the scene from the
top of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   With a grave expression and a brief wave, Starr left the White
House through the Diplomatic Entrance at 6:40 on Monday evening.
Moments later, Kendall stepped through the same door and made brief
remarks by the rain-slicked White House drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure'' to the four-year inquiry into the Clintons'
Whitewater real estate investment, he said, adding that it had
culminated ``in an investigation of the president's private life.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides picked up on Kendall's call for closure,
declaring that the president's statement on Monday would satisfy
any public interest in the long-running Lewinsky drama, and any
sense of aggravation with Clinton for his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are not pounding on the door for details,
they're pounding on the door for closure,'' one senior
administration official said. ``He doesn't owe them details, he
owes them an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   The official compared Clinton's remarks Monday night to his
acknowledgment on national television in January 1992 of ``causing
pain'' in his marriage. Clinton, then campaigning in New Hampshire
for the Democratic nomination, had been accused of an affair with
Gennifer Flowers, a singer in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering, rainy Washington day, White House officials
abandoned almost any pretense of the business-as-usual approach
they have taken during the head-snapping swerves and reversals of
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior staff meeting on Monday morning, Bowles reminded
the staff of the importance of sticking together. According to Mike
McCurry, the press secretary, Bowles quoted his own father, saying
``it's easy to be there for someone when they're up, but it's the
good ones who are there when you're down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare admission by the White House that the president's
spirits had sagged. One friend said that the president avoided
focusing until Sunday on the implications of his testimony. ``It
hit him hardest on Sunday,'' the friend said. ``This was a very
very difficult weekend for him. Nothing is more important to him
than his place in history. He is worried that this investigation
will eclipse everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton and his daughter,
Chelsea, remained at the White House on Monday, and were believed
to have met with him after he testified.

<P>
   Oracle Corp. caused quite a stir in local PR circles last week,
when it abruptly replaced a PR firm it had just hired, Avalanche,
with its former agency, Applied Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche was the new kid on the PR block. It had only been
formed in January, when Palo Alto-based Cunningham Communications
teamed up with Hill &AMP; Knowlton and Ogilvy, Adams &AMP; Rinehart to take
on Oracle's multimillion-dollar account.

   Avalanche had stepped into this demanding role after Oracle
forced Applied to compete for the PR contract it had held for the

Oracle beaucoup coverage of the Network Computer, which never took
off.

   But for reasons glossed over in the official release, Oracle
decided last week that Applied, not Avalanche, had the right stuff
to lead its global PR effort.
</P>
<P>
   PR pros weren't surprised that Avalanche fell, because no one in
the biz had ever tried what it set out to do _ fuse three different
companies into one firm. Nor did it help that this novel alliance
would be working for Oracle.

   ``There were bets on the street how long Avalanche was going to
last,'' said one PR insider. ``Everyone on the street knows Oracle
is the client from hell.''

BEHIND THE HIGH-TECH PUBLIC RELATIONS GAME AT ORACLE CORP.

Behind every great tech company stands a public relations firm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oracle Corp. caused quite a stir in local PR circles last week,
when it abruptly replaced a PR firm it had just hired, Avalanche,
with its former agency, Applied Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche was the new kid on the PR block. It had only been
formed in January, when Palo Alto-based Cunningham Communications
teamed up with Hill &AMP; Knowlton and Ogilvy, Adams &AMP; Rinehart to take
on Oracle's multimillion-dollar account.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to create one PR firm with global and local
high-tech savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche had stepped into this demanding role after Oracle
forced Applied to compete for the PR contract it had held for the
five previous years _ a period during which Applied helped get
Oracle beaucoup coverage of the Network Computer, which never took
off.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons glossed over in the official release, Oracle
decided last week that Applied, not Avalanche, had the right stuff
to lead its global PR effort.
</P>
<P>
   PR pros weren't surprised that Avalanche fell, because no one in
the biz had ever tried what it set out to do _ fuse three different
companies into one firm. Nor did it help that this novel alliance
would be working for Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were bets on the street how long Avalanche was going to
last,'' said one PR insider. ``Everyone on the street knows Oracle
is the client from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hodskins, the Cunningham exec who led Avalanche, said her
firm resigned the account after Oracle replaced former marketing
chief Karen White _ who signed the Avalanche deal _ with Gary
Bloom, who brought Applied back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The management we were working with changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle spokesman Kevin McGuirk demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had nothing to do with management changes,'' he said.
``After six months of trying to make this happen, we had to get a
different agency in there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; PR Postscript: &LR;  There's no such thing as losing in the PR biz
these days. Every PR firm in the region is turning business away,
as the Bay Area's 3,000 to 5,000 PR pros try to keep up with the
demand for hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as an unemployed high-tech PR person,''
said Barry Shulman, who runs a recruitment firm in Mill Valley that
bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Wanna work at home? No problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two- and three-year &UR;  &LR; `seasoned' people _ and I use
the term &UR;  &LR; advisedly _ who are billing $100 to $150 an hour for
elementary work,'' like cold-calling reporters in search of
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Didja realize? &LR;  In doing a recent column item on IBM, I asked
for a local head count. IBM spokesman Dave Berman said IBM employs
8,600 people in the Bay Area, with the largest chunk at the
disk-drive division in San Jose and two nearby research outposts.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Big Blue a larger local payroll than Intel, Silicon
Graphics, Apple or Chevron, according to The Chronicle 500, a list
of the Bay Area's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Mudfest: &LR;  Berkeley-based Net Studio has found four computer
industry notables to judge its recently announced Mud Brick
contest, which will reward the ugliest Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will announce today that ugly is in the eye of these
beholders: New York industry analyst Esther Dyson, San Mateo
newsletter editor David Coursey, Bay Area radio and television
personality John C. Dvorak and humor columnist Lincoln Spector.
There's still time to nominate a site for the Mud Brick award
before losers are announced in September.

HORSE-RACING COLUMN: NEW AD CAMPAIGN FOR RACING TAKES THE LOW
ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The marketing specialists hired to save
horse racing from its deepening troubles reviewed their ``first 100
days'' on the job the other day and found them to be a howling
success.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that public awareness of racing had more than
doubled since they arrived on the scene April 1 and set up a
``league office'' in Atlanta. They announced that racing now
surpassed the awareness level of tennis and was moving closer to
golf. They took some credit for the crowd of 81,000 that jammed
Belmont Park in June to watch Real Quiet shoot for the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   They even claimed credit for the fact that auction prices for
yearlings had jumped by 15 percent at last week's Saratoga horse
sales.
</P>
<P>
   They proclaimed these signs of success during a well-rehearsed
report by Tim Smith, the commissioner of the National Thoroughbred
Racing Association, and several of his vice presidents and
advertising deputies, who spoke at the 46th annual Round Table
conference of the Jockey Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was held Sunday morning at the Gideon Putnam Hotel in
Saratoga Springs, not far from Saratoga Race Course, where the
130th season of racing is booming. And they can probably take
credit for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was right, coming after two thrilling Triple Crown
series in a row that went down to the wire. And the audience was
right, too: several hundred of racing's most important owners and
breeders, who have been told for years that they must form an
alliance to solve the sport's problems of declining attendance and
declining interest at a time when team sports are exploding.
</P>
<P>
   The self-congratulations began when the stage was turned over to
Smith, an articulate and engaging lawyer from Atlanta who won the
job of commissioner from racing's second search committee in four
years. The earlier committee searched and found Brian McGrath, who
beat out a promoter from professional wrestling but who unhappily
lasted only nine months before that ``league office'' was
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was endowed with five or six vice presidents and an
advertising budget of $22 million, and he spent some of it
searching for a slogan. He found one when Steve Bowen of the New
York-based Merkley Newman Harty advertising agency came up with
``Go, Baby, Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bowen created a series of television spots starring Lori
Petty, an actress who shrieked the slogan while running up and down
the sideline of the homestretch before telling the heavens, ``Pay
the lady, pay the lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the advertising was described to the Round Table
conference as ``hip, cool, slightly naughty'' and intended ``to get
attention.'' It was aimed at picturing horse racing as a ``social,
sensual'' sport in which ``you don't just get escorted to your
seat.'' Also, as the only sport with live, legal wagering.
</P>
<P>
   But the commercial took the low road to reach a young, new
audience and was so implausible that you might wonder how it got by
the fathers of racing and breeding when they auditioned it. They
included Dinny Phipps of the Jockey Club; William Farish, the
chairman of Churchill Downs; Tom Meeker, the president of Churchill
Downs, and Robert Clay, the owner of Three Chimneys Farm in
Kentucky, none of whom would appreciate being portrayed as hip,
cool, slightly naughty.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody who attended the meeting reported that the reaction had
been ``Well, since everybody hates it, maybe it'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked for Bowen, who said at the Round Table conference:
``You can feel the excitement of thoroughbred racing is beginning
to permeate the culture out there. Entertainment people are
starting to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He backed up that contention by showing film clips of the Triple
Crown with Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone and Donald Trump
among the crowds, and reaching a neat, dramatic high when the
trainer Bob Baffert, wired for the moment, shouts to his horse,
Real Quiet, the magic words: ``Go, Baby, Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also announced a new series of handicap races next year on
the Fox Sports network. Will racing make any money for awarding the
rights to major races to Fox? No. Who pays the production costs?
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, then, how extensive a sampling was used to determine that
the awareness of racing had doubled since the marketers arrived?
Just 400 people in four cities. Many of them presumably hip, cool,
slightly naughty.
</P>
<P>
   The league office likes to quote Albert Einstein, ``The
definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again
and expecting a different result.'' How about trying something new
and proclaiming success after the first 100 days? &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Following is a list of the times when President
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as previous presidents
in the last two decades, have provided testimony. Clinton is the
first president to testify in a criminal investigation of his own
conduct, but other presidents have testified in criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony by the Clintons:
</P>
<P>
   June 12, 1994: President and Mrs. Clinton provide sworn
testimony to Robert Fiske Jr., the independent counsel
investigating the Whitewater matter. The president and Mrs. Clinton
are questioned separately in the White House. Clinton spends 90
minutes answering questions from Fiske and his deputy. Mrs. Clinton
is questioned for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   April 22, 1995: President and Mrs. Clinton are questioned in the
White House by the new Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, and his aides. Clinton's interview lasts about two hours.
Mrs. Clinton's interview also lasts about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 16, 1996: Mrs. Clinton testifies for more than four hours
before a federal grand jury in Washington investigating the
disappearance and sudden recovery of billing records from her
former Arkansas law firm that detail some of Mrs. Clinton's legal
work on Whitewater-related matters while at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   April 28, 1996: Clinton gives videotaped testimony in a criminal
trial involving his former Whitewater business partners, James and
Susan McDougal. He testifies for more than three hours in the White
House as a defense witness for the McDougals. All copies of the
taped testimony are ordered sealed until played at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   July 7, 1996: Clinton gives a sworn deposition in the trial of
two Arkansas bankers charged with making illegal donations to his
1990 campaign for governor. The testimony is videotaped in the
White House and lasts for two hours 20 minutes. The deposition is
given at the request of the defense. The tape is ordered sealed
until played at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 14, 1998: Mrs. Clinton is questioned at the White House for
about 15 minutes by Starr and deputies concerning the White House's
gathering of FBI background files on political appointees from past
Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 17, 1998: Clinton is questioned for six hours in his
attorney's office by lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones in her sexual
misconduct suit against him. The deposition is videotaped. He is
asked, among other things, about Monica Lewinsky, a former intern
at the White House, and he denies he had a sexual relationship with
her. In March, Mrs. Jones' lawyers release excerpts from the
president's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   April 25, 1998: Starr and his deputies question Mrs. Clinton for
nearly five hours at the White House about her work as a private
lawyer for the failed savings and loan at the center of the
Whitewater investigation. The session is videotaped so it can be
presented to an Arkansas grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17, 1998: Clinton is questioned for five and a half hours
in the White House Map Room by prosecutors for Starr about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The questioning is videotaped and
broadcast via closed-circuit television to the Washington grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony by Previous Presidents:
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan: Agreed in November 1987 to respond to written
questions from Lawrence Walsh, the special counsel in the
Iran-contra scandal. After leaving office, he gave videotaped
testimony in 1990 in the Iran-contra trial of John Poindexter, his
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter: Testified on videotape for two prosecutions:
one in 1978 in a federal gambling conspiracy case against a Georgia
state legislator, and another in 1980 in a grand jury investigation
of Robert Vesco, the fugitive financier. In 1979 he gave a
four-hour deposition at the White House to a special counsel
investigating accusations of financial improprieties at the Carter
family's peanut warehouse. And in 1980 Carter gave a deposition to
the Justice Department about his conversations with Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti about an investigation into whether
Carter's brother, Billy, had violated the Foreign Agents
Registration Act.
</P>
<P>
   President Ford: While in office gave a videotaped deposition in
the trial of Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, who was accused of trying to
assassinate him, after the court rejected a White House proposal
that he submit a written statement. Ms. Fromme was convicted in
1975.

PICKING YOUR STUDENT'S PC  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
As summer winds down, it's time for students and their parents to
start thinking about school supplies. Things like binders, paper,
pencils _ and computers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once a luxury item for the well-heeled household, a personal
computer is fast becoming a must-have item for students from
elementary school through college.
</P>
<P>
   The question no longer is whether to have a computer. Now, it's
what kind of computer to have. Do you need a state-of-the-art PC
with the latest Intel Pentium II chip, or is an entry level system
good enough? Should you get a desktop computer or a notebook? And
what about software and the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Many middle schools and high schools now recommend that students
have computers so that they can type assignments and do online
research. Colleges are going further, in some cases requiring
students to have a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges have put library resources on the Internet and are
making class material available online. (The University of
California at Los Angeles is asking all professors to create a Web
site for each class they teach.)
</P>
<P>
   Computer-makers, who know a profitable trend when they see one,
have launched unprecedented campaigns to capture as much of the
emerging educational market as they can.
</P>
<P>
   _PC leader Compaq Computer has created special centers in 5,000
Radio Shack stores across the country to promote its Creative
Learning Series PCs. All the systems in the series come with a
bundle of 15 educational software titles from companies such as the
Learning Company and Broderbund.
</P>
<P>
   _Dell Computer ( &LR; www.dell.com &LR; ), the largest direct seller of
PCs, has a program that lets students lease a multimedia desktop PC
for as little as $64 a month, or a Pentium II-based notebook for
$75 a month. For an extra $11 a month, students can get a DVD
drive, which takes discs that hold many times more information than
a CD-ROM. (That way if a class gets boring, you can stop taking
notes and watch a DVD movie instead.)
</P>
<P>
   _Gateway ( &LR; www.gateway.com &LR; ), another leading direct seller,
announced a program last week that allows students to order
customized Gateway systems from Barnes &AMP; Noble-run campus
bookstores. Gateway and Barnes &AMP; Noble plan to offer the program
this fall in about 100 universities.
</P>
<P>
   _Apple Computer, long a leader in the education market, offers
special prices on computers and peripherals through campus
bookstores at more than 300 colleges and universities. Apple also
has started offering discount prices to higher-education students
through its online store at  &LR; www.apple.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   What should you expect to pay for a back-to-school PC? That
depends on the needs of the student. A fourth-grader, who will use
a PC for word processing, CD-ROM encyclopedias and Web surfing, can
get along nicely with an entry-level system costing as little as
$1,200 including monitor and printer.
</P>
<P>
   A third-year engineering student, however, likely would use a PC
with a fast Pentium II chip, gobs of memory and a big monitor. If
you buy direct from Dell or Gateway, such a system may cost about
$2,200.
</P>
<P>
   College students also should seriously consider a notebook. Some
universities, such as Wake Forest, even require incoming students
to have one for note taking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Notebooks have the obvious advantage of portability, so they
can be taken to class, to the dorm and even home for the holidays.
But they also have a couple of big drawbacks: They're more
expensive than comparable desktop systems; they're heavy, averaging
between 6 and 7 pounds (more expensive models are lighter); and
they're easily stolen.
</P>
<P>
   For less than $2,000, you can get a notebook based on a Pentium
II, with a 12.1-inch screen, a CD-ROM drive and 2 or 3 gigabytes of
hard disk storage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a computer, your student probably will need a
color printer ($200 and up) and an Internet connection. A home
Internet account will cost about $20 a month, but many colleges now
give students free Internet access in their dorms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Basic software for schoolwork includes a good word processor
and an encyclopedia. You can get both in Microsoft's Home
Essentials (street price under $90). It comes with Word 97 and the
Encarta 98 encyclopedia.

   Once-downtrodden Buccaneers now reach for the stars
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TAMPA, Fla. _ Before the Tampa Bay Buccaneers can think seriously
about Super Bowl XXXIII, they have to figure out a way to beat
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Buccaneers got a whiff of the playoffs, and
they liked the smell. But they were 0-3 against the Packers, the
third defeat coming in a second-round playoff game at Lambeau
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Like other NFC teams, the Bucs believe the road to the Super
Bowl goes through Green Bay. And they are confident they have the
pieces in place to overthrow the Packers and win the NFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, we were raw and hungry, and we ate the
appetizer,'' says Bucs guard Jorge Diaz, a three-year veteran from
Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville and a Katy native. ``This season, we want to
eat the whole meal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa-St. Petersburg area is excited about the Buccaneers,
who reached the playoffs last season for the first time since 1982.
They proved they weren't just happy to be there by beating Detroit
in a wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, we were the Tampa Bay Yucks,'' says
Warren Sapp, one of the best defensive tackles in the NFL. ``Now,
it's great to be a Buc. We came from the ruins of this league.
Everybody laughed at us. They're not laughing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for everybody to be excited. This organization has
waited too long to have a team like this. We realize what's at
stake. We represent a part of Florida that's waited too long to
have a winner. We're going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are sky-high. Fans and media believe the Bucs are a
bona fide Super Bowl contender. The players are trying to not get
caught up in the hype, but it's almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have realistic expectations, you understand
what you're trying to do,'' coach Tony Dungy says. ``I think our
players understand. But if they start thinking like the fans, we
could get into trouble. It's good for the area to have this
excitement, but the players have to keep it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality is that Green Bay is favored to win the NFC Central.
Although the Packers lost several important players through free
agency, they remain loaded. And as long as Brett Favre is the
quarterback, they will be favored to reach a third consecutive
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got an excellent team with outstanding coaching and
great offensive weapons,'' Dungy says. ``They've also got a lot of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be a situation where they're going
to come back to the rest of us. We're going to have to improve to
catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated predicts Tampa Bay will reach the Super Bowl.
If that happens, the Bucs will have overcome a lot of hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Before they move into their new Raymond James Stadium, Tampa Bay
will have to play on the road against Minnesota and Green Bay. And
just surviving the NFC Central _ the league's best division _ may
be the most difficult assignment of all.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, Bucs, Vikings and Lions made the playoffs last
season, and all are capable of doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it sweet to have our measuring stick right in our own
division,'' Sapp says. ``We have six division games against
playoff-caliber teams. Hey, I want to play the roughest schedule
because it'll benefit us in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs have gone from 6-10 to 10-6 in Tony Dungy's first two
seasons as coach. Dungy is loved by his players and respected by
the rest of the league. If the players become a mirror image of
their coach, they will not be prone to the emotional peaks and
valleys that can derail talented teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two seasons, you've seen us improve and take the
steps necessary to reach the next level,'' Diaz says. ``We learned
a lot last season by getting playoff experience. We know what it's
like to overcome hard times. We've grown up a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you can sense it in the locker room, that everyone is
ready to lay it on the line to reach our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Rich McKay was promoted to general manager and Dungy was
hired as coach, the Bucs' philosophy hasn't changed. They use the
draft to build the team. Owner Malcolm Glazer opened the vault to
sign players to long-term extensions.
</P>
<P>
   When they have a need they don't fill in the draft, they will
use free agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, the Bucs identified two areas of concern: They
needed to bolster the receiving corps to give quarterback Trent
Dilfer better targets, and they wanted to add depth at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta receiver Bert Emanuel, a restricted free agent, was
signed. The Buccaneers used their top draft choice on receiver
Jacquez Green. They traded up in the second round to get cornerback
Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the components are where we want them,'' McKay says.
``We started with defense. Then, we made sure to have a sound
running game. We had to get a quarterback we liked and make sure he
could play within our scheme. And we wanted speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs have a rare combination of speed and power on both
sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Their running game is built around 248-pound fullback Mike
Alstott, who has missed the first three preseason games because of
a hip injury, and 5-8, 178-pound halfback Warrick Dunn, the NFL's
Offensive Rookie of the Year last season.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Emanuel and Green at receiver with Reidel Anthony gives
Tampa Bay one of the speediest units in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The defense features linemen who explode off the ball and
linebackers who run like backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a coach who likes speed,'' Dungy says.
``Speed gives you a chance to make big plays. That's one of the
things we didn't have two years ago. But speed and quickness are
such an important part of this game that we've constantly gone
after it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs are confident they won't be one-year wonders. They feel
they have too much talent on offense, defense and special teams to
go backward. They have a coaching staff that knows how to handle
players.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that could interrupt their playoff plans
would be an inordinate number of injuries to key players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a close-knit team,'' McKay says. ``Tony creates a
working environment that brings the players together. It's peaceful
and family-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to a Bucs game is going to be an event. Every seat for
every game is sold out at the new stadium, and so many luxury
suites were sold, they decided to add more. And those sold
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   In one end zone, the Glazer family forked over $3 million for
Pirate Cove. The area will include a pirate ship more than 100 feet
long. Cannons will shoot confetti when the Bucs score. Cheerleaders
will dance on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the stadium is a state-of-the-art scoreboard
that features several screens. Fans can come early to watch
pre-game shows or other games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything starts with the head man,'' Sapp says, referring to
Dungy. ``He's great to play for. You never find him too high or too
low, yelling, ranting and raving. Whenever you have somebody like
that steering your ship, it's a lot easier to do the things we need
to do to be great in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your head man is that calm and collected, it trickles
down. He's not a dramatic, in-your-face guy, and we appreciate
that. He just expects each man to do his job. He gets a lot of
productivity with that philosophy.''

 &HT;    Possible Rudolph sighting reported
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ V olunteers looking for Birmingham bombing
suspect Eric Robert Rudolph hid in the night and watched houses as
a man they believed to be the fugitive _ or a decoy _ twice
approached in what appeared to be a food raid, retired Green Beret
Bo Gritz said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal spokesman said Monday that Gritz has agreed to call
them with any news of sightings, but no such calls had come.
Investigators had no comment about the report.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said that on Sunday his volunteers received
``intelligence'' about a ``series of homes ... where people have
observed Eric Rudolph going in and out, securing food and a
sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were allowing it to happen because he hadn't stolen
anything else,'' Gritz added.
</P>
<P>
   So, Gritz claimed, three volunteers, with night vision
equipment, set up on three houses and a trail. A 15-foot creek
separated two of the men from the other, so they developed a code
for ``intruder'' by placing their fingers over a flashlight to make
spheres of light, he said. At about 9:30 p.m., an ``intruder''
rushed by and they chased him up the trail shouting ``we're part of
Bo Gritz's team and we're here to help you; we had food for him,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said he was asked to come to Andrews by a member of the
Southeast Bomb Task Force and to appeal to Rudolph to surrender and
face charges in a Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic
that killed an off-duty police officer and severely wounded a
nurse. He is wanted for questioning in a series of Atlanta
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Through his shortwave radio show, Gritz called for volunteers to
commit a week to ``Operation Cross,'' which means to ``Convey
Rudolph Obligingly (and) Safely (into the) System.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, they hope to have convinced Rudolph that his odds of
survival are better in court, where he could face the death
penalty, than hiding in the woods where federal agents and bounty
hunters are also tracking him. They will not, however, force him
in. But Gritz said he would muster ``all the mental judo'' he could
to bring Rudolph in willingly.
</P>
<P>
   All of Gritz's volunteers _ numbering about 37 in the woods _
agreed to waive the reward of up to $1 million for information
leading to Ruolph's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz has agreed to allow two media photographers to accompany
the search in a pool agreement to share their videos and
interviews. In return, other reporters are barred from the
Nantahala Forest command post and can't ask questions. Each
morning, Gritz recounts the previous day's events to the television
photographers, who then drop off the video to a producer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gritz said the second alleged sighting occurred about
4:30 a.m. in the pouring rain when the same team ``reset the whole
mousetrap.'' This time, however, one of the volunteers lay down by
the door, which was set up higher on a deck, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, as the intruder came around to the door, the
volunteer stood up and announced he was unarmed and with Gritz'
team, the former Vietnam soldier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy bolted _ ran down around the deck and up the trail,''
Gritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz admitted it was ``strange'' the man came back a second
time. Asked if it was Rudolph, Gritz replied: ``If it wasn't, it
was an excellent imposter.

IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL, A DAY SOMBER AND SURREAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a day that made everyone miserable: gray,
drizzly, a muggy oppressive haze contributing to the surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was on the brink of economic collapse; Iraq continued to
defy the United Nations; a suspect in the devastating embassy
bombings that killed hundreds in Africa, including 12 Americans,
was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   But there was only one issue that commanded the attention of the
media and official Washington on Monday: President Clinton's
unprecedented testimony from the White House via closed-circuit
television to a grand jury probing perjury and obstruction of
justice allegations.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:59 p.m., EDT, a minute earlier than planned, Clinton
entered the historic ground-level Map Room beneath the White House
residence. The Map Room served as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
situation room during World War II and the maps that plotted global
troop movements still show the allies advancing on Berlin as they
were the day before Roosevelt's death.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 5 1/2 hours, the president answered questions about
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Later, the president sat in the Map Room again to make his address
to the nation, conceding he misled Americans when he denied a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the day, the White House remained quiet and
somber.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles sought to bolster
senior White House aides at their Monday morning meeting with a
saying his father taught him as a child in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's easy to be there for someone when they're up,
but it's the good ones are there when you're down,''' White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said. ``And Erskine told us that we have a
lot of important work to do and the president and the American
people expect us to do our jobs. And I think that reflects the
attitude of the staff here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Many senior staff members kept their dates for scheduled
vacations, adding to the quiet that enveloped the official White
House. The Clintons originally intended to leave for a two-week
break to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., on Saturday but now will leave
today.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the White House, a crowd of cameras, hurried crews and
anxious television anchors gathered at Pebble Beach, the gravel
outcropping on the North Lawn where the television networks are
stationed. The humidity forced television reporters to mop their
faces between takes.
</P>
<P>
   The fevered atmosphere that erupted in January, when the scandal
began, appeared to have dissipated somewhat. But so many reporters
tried to crowd into McCurry's office that his first meeting with
the press was moved to the more formal briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry described Clinton's mood as ``confident and determined
to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the strangeness was the crowd gathering outside the
White House fence.
</P>
<P>
   A man shouting ``remember Iraq'' tried to puncture his throat
with a screwdriver and was carted away to an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you care about Clinton, just remember the Iraqi. Just
remember the Iraqi nation ... gonna die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of wilting demonstrators dressed in winter coats and
scarves carried placards saying ``Stop the Blizzard of Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man walked back and forth in front of the White House
wearing a bright yellow T-shirt emblazoned on the back, ``Clinton,
Liar, Coward, Adulterer, Perjurer, Traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN initially ran an ``elapsed time'' clock on its programs to
keep track of how long Clinton answered prosecutors' questions but
dropped it as the hours ticked by.
</P>
<P>
   Former staff members continued to offer unsolicited advice on
news programs and in appearances, suggesting that Clinton apologize
to the nation and that Congress and independent counsel Kenneth
Starr begin to put this issue to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through seven months of hell. It's weakened the
presidency. It's undermined confidence in our judicial system. It's
bankrupted a lot of staff people who have had to testify. I think
it's challenged families with their kids. And, it's produced
gridlock in Congress,'' said former chief of staff Leon Panetta,
appearing on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   And the paradox of Clinton continued: on the lowest day of his
presidency; the president hit his highest approval ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of those polled believe he is doing a good job.
Almost an equal percentage believe he lied about his relationship
with Lewinsky when he denied an affair. And, the stock market,
whose bullish rallies have helped bolster Clinton's popularity,
rose by 149 points.

CHOOSING A CALCULATOR NO EASY EQUATION  
 BENNY EVANGELISTA 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRONICLE, PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
If you have a middle or high school student in the house, chances
are you'll be making a calculator purchase in the near future.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're not talking about a little $10 job that can add, subtract,
multiply and divide.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated graphing calculators that cost $50 to $200 and let
students see their complex calculations plotted on a little screen
are becoming de rigueur &UR;  &LR; for students beyond first-year algebra.
</P>
<P>
   More and more schools and universities are requiring graphing
calculators as the devices become integrated into class curriculums
and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the right calculator is the one recommended by
the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   If a math professor, for example, is using the overhead
projector to demonstrate a problem using a Texas Instruments
calculator ``and you're using a Casio, you're own your own,'' said
Megha Shyam, owner of DaVinci Technologies, a Corvallis, Ore.,
developer of calculator-software upgrade programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who take SAT tests are required to have a graphing
calculator,'' Shyam said. ``If you don't have one, you're out of
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leading brands are Texas Instruments and Hewlett
Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some engineering schools are recommending the high-end Hewlett
Packard HP 48, but if you're in math and some of the sciences,
you're using the TI,'' Shyam said.
</P>
<P>
   Chance are better, however, that you'll have to buy a TI brand,
the dominant player in a $400 million-per-year U.S. education
calculator market. Texas Instruments aggressively built its market
by providing calculators to professors and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the education market, they have about 80 percent,'' Shyam
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments makes several models of graphing calculators,
starting with the TI-80, which costs about $50.
</P>
<P>
   This is a small calculator for middle school pre-algebra and
algebra I students, said Andy Selle, who helps maintain a Web site
devoted to TI calculators at  &LR; www.ticalc.org. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Selle said the next model up, the TI-83, which costs about $95,
is a better ``workhorse'' for high school students who are taking
algebra I, geometry, algebra II, pre-calculus and calculus.
</P>
<P>
   A comparable model from Hewlett-Packard is the HP 48, which
costs about $100.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, which has about 15 percent of the U.S.
education calculator market.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments' models can be upgraded by downloading
software via the Internet, Shyam said.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger price tag doesn't necessarily mean you'll get the
calculator you need. However, buyers should try to look at the
calculator as an investment in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally recommend buying something you're going to use
beyond the one term in which the calculator is required,'' Shyam
said. ``The calculator is a lot more useful animal than most people
give it credit for.''

 MAKING FREE PHONE CALLS VIA THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 Q:  I've heard that you can use the Internet to make 
 long-distance phone calls for free. Is this true, and if so,   how
do you do it? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It's true. Using special telephony software, it's now
possible for people with PCs anywhere in the world to have voice
conversations without paying a phone bill. But don't toss out your
telephone just yet. Internet telephony is a young technology with
some significant drawbacks:
</P>
<P>
   _Because there still is no standard for the technology, both
parties in an Internet call must have the same software loaded on
their PCs. And you'll need a headset or a microphone and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   _You have to arrange things ahead of time because the person
receiving the call has to be online.
</P>
<P>
   _Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, the audio
quality of an Internet call, especially a long-distance one, might
not be up to telephone standards. And you might experience minor
delays in transmission.
</P>
<P>
   You also can make a call from a PC to a regular phone, which
doesn't have to be prearranged. That's not free, but it's still
cheaper than a phone-to-phone call because, for the most part, the
call is routed via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to give Internet telephony a try, a couple of good
programs are Internet Phone from VocalTec, which lets you make
PC-to-PC or PC-to-phone calls, and Net2Phone, which as the name
implies, is just for calling from a PC to a phone. The software,
along with more information, is available at  &LR; www.vocaltec.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.net2phone.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; My 9-year-old daughter spends a lot of time on the &LR; 
 &LR; Internet. She's fascinated by such things as Leonardo &LR;   &LR; DiCaprio's
page, the Barbie page, etc. I would like to be able &LR;   &LR; to review the
Web sites she visits to see if she's been to any &LR;   &LR; objectionable
sites and to help me set standards for where she &LR;   &LR; should surf.
Does any software exist for this purpose? I use &LR;   &LR; Netscape 4.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Netscape itself can help. The browser keeps a history of
all the pages visited. Go to the Communicator menu and choose
History. You'll see the name of each site visited, its address, the
date it was first visited and last visited, and the total number of
visits. By default, pages stay in the history for nine days, though
you can increase the time with Netscape's Preferences.
</P>
<P>
   You also might consider a software program that blocks
objectionable Web sites. Two popular ones are Cyber Patrol
( &LR; www.cyberpatrol.com &LR; ) and SurfWatch ( &LR; www.surfwatch.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I have a Macintosh IIsi that I would like to donate to a &LR; 
 &LR; charity or school. Do you know of an organization that would &LR; 
 &LR; take this machine? It works fine but is obviously out of date.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; There are a couple of ways to go about donating used PCs
and peripherals. You can go directly to a local school or school
district or call a favorite nonprofit. Or your can go through an
organization that specializes in recycling old equipment. Check out
the PEP Computer Recycling site on the Web at
 &LR; www.microweb.com/pepsite/Recycle &LR;   &LR; /recycleindex.html &LR; . There
you'll find names, phone numbers and descriptions of organizations
across the country that accept computer equipment for distribution
to schools and charities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I can't seem to find a way to display my e-mail folders &LR; 
 &LR; on the same screen as my messages in Netscape Communicator. Can &LR; 
 &LR; you tell me how to do that, so I can drag messages between &LR; 
 &LR; folders?  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; As far as I can tell, Communicator doesn't let you view a
list of messages and a directory of mail folders in the same
window. You can display either a Message List window, showing the
contents of a folder such as the Inbox, or the Message Center,
which shows the folders themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, you can easily move messages to another folder. To
move a single message, select it in the Message List window, then
click the File icon on the toolbar and choose the target folder
from the list of folders that appears.
</P>
<P>
   You also can select one or more messages (for multiple messages,
press the Ctrl key while selecting), drag them to the File icon,
then to the target folder.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; 
Add an item to your Windows Start menu the easy way: Just drag the
program or shortcut icon to the Start button from the desktop or
from Windows Explorer. Next time you hit the Start button, the
program will be listed and you'll be able to click right to it.

 EVEN 3 MILLION FANS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though the New York Yankees are on target to draw a
record 3 million fans to their historic home in the Bronx this
season, a spokesman for George Steinbrenner said Monday that still
may not be good enough to keep his team from moving to Manhattan or
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Steinbrenner said he would consider keeping the team
in the Bronx if home attendance climbed over the 3 million mark for
the first time in Yankee history and if the Yankees could be
guaranteed similar attendance in future years. The four-game series
with the Texas Rangers that ended Sunday drew more than 200,000
fans, leaving the team well on its way to reaching 3 million for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive attendance, the Yankees owner appeared to
be edging away from any commitment to stay in the Bronx, which
Steinbrenner complains has insufficient parking and high crime. And
his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, played down the team's chances of
meeting the goal of 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinbrenner is hoping that they go over the 3 million mark,
but it's a long shot,'' Rubenstein said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has promised that he will sit down and talk about the Bronx
if they go over 3 million. But he's made no commitment to staying
in the Bronx if they do.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the team has drawn 2,109,004 fans, 18 percent
more than last year at this time. That is also 11 percent more than
at the same point in 1988, the best year ever for Yankee home
attendance, which ended with 2,633,703 fans going to the Bronx
stadium. If current trends continue, attendance should surpass 3
million by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 11 years, Steinbrenner has kept three mayors and
five governors in two states guessing about where he intends to put
the Yankees when the team's lease at Yankee Stadium expires in
2002. He has signaled his preference for a new billion-dollar
stadium on the West Side of Manhattan or in New Jersey. But he has
yet to announce his plans, despite many self-imposed deadlines for
an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees are the most valuable team in major-league
baseball and has the most lucrative cable television contract in
professional sports, the team ranks fourth in attendance in the
American League and ninth in the major leagues. Steinbrenner wants
a new, publicly subsidized stadium that he says will draw more fans
and generate more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said that the Yankees would need a new stadium even
if they decided to stay put.

 WASHINGTON: he testified.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's own advisers expressed relief on Monday
that he was finally telling his side of the story. Some, however,
also feel misled by him, since he denied an affair to them as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton worked out on Monday morning in the White House
gymnasium, then spent about two hours preparing with his lawyers in
the White House residence. At noon, he broke for a briefing on
domestic and national security matters. Advisers described him as
engaged and interested during his ten-minute foreign policy
discussion, asking Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, how
the Russian ruble was trading.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a photo of that meeting, the only
public glimpse of the president before Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about 12:30, Starr's blue-gray Crown Victoria sedan
swept up the White House drive, and he and his team of prosecutors
headed for the Map Room. The room, on the ground floor, is named
for its wall map of Europe still stuck with the colored pins that
Franklin D. Roosevelt used to mark the progress of World War II.
Clinton used the room to hold ``coffees'' for large donors to the
Democrats during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition on Jan. 17 in the Jones lawsuit, the president
acknowledged a mere acquaintance with Ms. Lewinsky, whom he met in
1995 when she was a 21-year-old unpaid intern. Clinton said that he
could not even recall ever being alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,''
Clinton said. ``I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had sworn in an affidavit that she did not have a
sexual relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Clinton, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky, Linda Tripp,
had secretly tape-recorded numerous conversations in which her
friend described an affair with Clinton. Mrs. Tripp provided those
tapes to prosecutors, and also met with Mrs. Jones' lawyers before
they interviewed the president.
</P>
<P>
   Securing permission from Attorney General Janet Reno to expand
his investigation, Starr pounced, suspecting that Clinton had lied
in his deposition and then tried to cover up his relationship by
securing a job for Ms. Lewinsky, among other means.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton repeated in public his denial of any affair with Ms.
Lewinsky, issuing it in strong terms after giving a tepid response
to the accusations when they first surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' he said on Jan. 26, shaking his head and jabbing the
air with one finger. ``I never told anybody to lie, not a single
time _ never.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton fell publicly silent about the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr's investigation ground on. He
called more than 70 witnesses before the grand jury here, amassing
circumstantial evidence of an affair. Finally, after issuing a
subpoena for Clinton's testimony, he secured an agreement with Ms.
Lewinsky to testify in exchange for immunity. She acknowledged
under oath that she had had sex with Clinton, but denied he asked
her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also turned over a blue dress to prosecutors, which
they are having tested to determine if it carried residue of a
sexual encounter with the president. The test results were not
disclosed, deeply worrying the president's advisers as he prepared
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to testify in exchange for Starr withdrawing the
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the president were buoyed on Monday by public
opinion polls that continued to show Clinton with approval ratings
above 65 percent. By contrast, when President Ronald Reagan
acknowledged making mistakes in the arms-for-hostages swap known as
Iran-Contra, he had fallen to his lowest level of support in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   One White House adviser noted that a CBS News poll, 24 percent
of people surveyed said that Clinton lying bothered them most,
while 16 percent said that they were most bothered by the media
coverage of the Lewinsky investigation. ``You guys are getting a
good second,'' he said. ``If we keep it going right, you may pass
us.''

ONLINE GAMBLING LOSSES CHALLENGED  
 BY DAN FOST  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - GAMBLING   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
   A Marin County woman who is being sued for refusing to pay
$70,000 in online gambling debts is countersuing three credit card
companies on the grounds that wagering on the Internet is illegal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If her suits are successful, they could rock the already shaky
foundations of the $600 million Internet gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Haines allegedly used a dozen credit cards to play
craps, blackjack and other online games over a three-month period
early last year. Haines visited over 50 sites, including Cyber
Thrill, Inter Casino and Casinos of the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   When she didn't pay her losses, one of her credit card
companies, Providian National Bank, filed a lawsuit to collect the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Haines countersued Providian, as well as Visa International,
MasterCard International and 50 online gaming operators based
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last month in Marin County Superior Court,
charges the credit card companies with illegal business practices
for issuing merchant licenses to the online casinos, said her
lawyer, Ira Rothken of Corte Madera.
</P>
<P>
   By granting merchant accounts to offshore casinos, the credit
card companies are ``essentially ratifying illegal gambling
operations,'' Rothken said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling is illegal in the United States under a 1961
law that bars betting over phone lines. Although it is also illegal
for Americans to gamble in virtual casinos that are based offshore,
individuals are rarely prosecuted for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed 90-10 by the U.S. Senate last month would require
Internet service providers to block customer access to virtual
casinos and establish fines and jail sentences for Americans caught
gambling online.
</P>
<P>
   Rothken said some of the offshore casinos ``outright stole
virtual chips'' from Haines. He said Haines sent letters protesting
the charge to Providian, but her letters were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Rothken described his client as a middle-aged woman, ``involved
in various types of businesses.'' She was not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Providian Financial, the San Francisco institution that is the
parent of Providian National Bank, would not directly discuss the
case, but a spokeswoman did address the issues raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providian lends money to consumers on the basis of their
credit worthiness, and it expects to be paid back when it makes
loans,'' said spokeswoman Laurie Cole. ``To the extent the customer
incurs a debt, we believe they should bear the responsibility of
paying it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole also said that the problem of gambling on the Internet ``is
a concern to a lot of people, us included, and it needs to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Visa spokeswoman declined to comment, and no one from
MasterCard was available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   If Haines' lawsuit is successful, it could cause the collapse of
the Internet gambling industry, said I. Nelson Rose, a Whittier
College law professor and American Bar Association expert on
gambling law.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said credit card accounts are the key to betting at
Internet casinos. ``Anything else is too slow,'' Rose said.
``Without credit cards, online gambling is doomed.''

LIVENT MAY BE REQUIRED TO BUY BACK NEW BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Livent Inc., the company that brought the hit musical
``Ragtime'' to Broadway, may be legally required to buy back $125
million of bonds that it issued just months ago under a
little-noticed provision in its bond agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The provision states that the company must offer to buy back the
bonds at a higher price if the company's founders, Garth Drabinsky
and Myron Gottlieb, no longer manage the company from executive
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new management suspended Drabinsky, the chief
creative director, and Gottlieb, a vice president, last week. The
new management team, headed by the Hollywood power broker Michael
Ovitz, said it had found millions of dollars of accounting
irregularities in the company's books.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Livent said that management believed it could
resolve the issue without having to buy back the bonds at 101
percent of the bonds' principal plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect the matters disclosed last week to have a
significantly adverse effect on the company's cash flows,'' he
said, ``and we would hope that if this provision is triggered at
some point, we could satisfactorily resolve the situation with our
bondholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Livent, under the leadership of Drabinsky, a flamboyant
impresario known for his extravagant spending habits, has long been
known for its aggressive accounting policies.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied any wrongdoing. And they have
questioned why the company's new management is now bringing their
allegations. They noted that Ovitz had financial experts review the
company's books earlier this year before he bought $20 million of
Livent's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Livent, a public company based in Toronto, has not
traded since Aug. 7.

`I MISLED YOU,' CLINTON SAYS, ADMITTING TO LEWINSKY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Staring history and the American public in the eye,
President Clinton reversed months of staunch denials Monday night
and admitted to a relationship with former White House intern
Monica S. Lewinsky that he described as ``not appropriate,'' in a
public confession meant to salvage the remainder of a troubled
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking in the Map Room of the White House where he
had testified to a federal grand jury earlier in the day, admitted
that he had misled the nation and his own wife for the past seven
months about his relationship with Lewinsky. He denied, however,
ever pressuring Lewinsky to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was
not appropriate,'' Clinton said. ``In fact, it was wrong. It
constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on
my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I misled people, including even my wife. I
deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   To the overriding question of whether Clinton attempted to
obstruct justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit, Clinton
said, ``I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at no
time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to
take any other unlawful action.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five-minute speech, delivered in a voice tightened by
nerves, Clinton also struck back at independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr, saying the investigation began with his business dealings 20
years ago and has now spread to his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many
innocent people,'' Clinton said. ``Now this matter is between me,
the two people I love most _ my wife and our daughter _ and our
God. I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age when media consultants and pollsters dominate the
political and public agenda, the testimony, followed by the speech,
provided a stretch of raw political theater unseen in this city
since the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The speech followed five grueling hours of testimony by Clinton
before the federal grand jury that has investigated his
relationship with Lewinsky since late January.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton provided no details of his relationship
with Lewinsky. A White House official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that Clinton also refused to tell the grand jury
specific details of his physical relationship with Lewinsky, and
for that reason, he may be summoned back before the panel, possibly
by subpoena. To some of the prosecutors' questions, Clinton
provided no answers. To other questions, he was vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very explicit, highly intrusive questions,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The president
felt that personal privacy and institutional dignity did not
require a graphic answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the White House Monday night, there were crosscurrents of
fury and betrayal _ fury at Starr for the rawness of his handling
of Clinton during the testimony, and betrayal toward Clinton for
allowing his staff to promote what they learned Monday was little
more than a lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sort out my own feelings down the road,'' said White
House press secretary Michael McCurry Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials confirmed that Starr left open the possibility that he
may summon Clinton before the grand jury again to ascertain
specifics of his relationship with Lewinsky, though David Kendall,
Clinton's personal lawyer, told White House aides that he believed
that prospect was ``highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Clinton seemed to try to put the issue behind
him, although a lengthy report from Starr to the Congress is
expected as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important to me personally,'' Clinton said of
his family life. ``But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my
family life for my family. It's nobody's business but ours. Even
presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of
our personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get
on with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   At 12:25 p.m., a silver sedan paused at the gates to the White
House, then whisked up the drive, carrying independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr and a pair of deputies toward their encounter with
the president. It marked the culmination of the sometimes far-flung
four-year Whitewater probe and the spinoff investigation into
allegations that Clinton had sexual relations with Lewinsky and
pressured her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sat in the back seat of his parked car for about two
minutes, then emerged in the shadow of the White House and entered
through the north portico, usually reserved for visiting
dignitaries and heads of state. He was led to the historic Map Room
on the ground floor of the main residence, where President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt plotted troop movements during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was itself historic. Never has a sitting president
appeared before a grand jury in a case in which he is the presumed
target, and never has a president been compelled to reveal so much
about his private life and possible criminal activity to
prosecutors and the public that elected him.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony began at 12:59 p.m., when Clinton, accompanied by
his lawyers, arrived downstairs from his private quarters and began
explaining himself to the grand jurors at the federal courthouse a
dozen blocks away. The testimony was broadcast live to the grand
jury by a scrambled video transmission, with cardboard covering the
windows to the grand jury room and court security guards keeping
reporters far from the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony stretched into early evening. Clinton paused for
several breaks before prosecutors ended the session at 6:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the dusky gloom of a cloudy Washington evening, Starr,
grim-faced, emerged with his aides, waved a few times to the
collection of reporters gathered outside, then was chauffeured off
in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Clinton's personal lawyer, David E. Kendall,
strode outside to a waiting microphone, announced the end of the
testimony and took an uncharacteristic swipe at Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This afternoon the president voluntarily testified for more
than four hours about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and the
questions he was asked about that relationship in the Jones
deposition last January,'' Kendall said. ``He testified truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Around Washington and the country Monday, reaction was mixed and
muted, with significant questions remaining over the damage that
Clinton's wholesale reversal has done to the presidency in general
and his own presidency specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah again
openly signaled that Clinton's apology would render impeachment
proceedings unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the American people forgive an awful lot of things,
and I believe they'll forgive him,'' Hatch said at a news
conference in Iowa. ``We're a great nation, and a forgiving
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri said: ``If he
has subverted the truth, if there are the serious crimes of
perjury, the Congress has a responsibility to impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained in the main residence throughout the day
Monday, never venturing to the West Wing and the Oval Office. After
meeting with the Rev. Jesse Jackson late into Sunday night and
early Monday morning, he awoke early and met with his lawyers from
9 to 11:30 a.m. to work out the final details of his testimony.
Shortly after, he received his customary daily briefing from chief
of staff Erskine Bowles and National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the morning, Clinton presented aides with a
handwritten draft of his proposed national address and ordered them
to refine it, though he declined to tell them if he would
definitely deliver it. For many senior aides who have publicly
defended Clinton in the darkest days of the prior seven months, the
scrawls were his first acknowledgement that he had not told the
truth to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton testified, aides gathered in the West Wing to
create what they said was the most difficult address of the
presidency _ a speech that, would endure through history and try to
salvage a sense of credibility between Clinton and the American
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Starr left the White House, Clinton's political aides
were summoned to the residence, to the upstairs solarium, for their
first full briefing of his relationship with Lewinsky. The group
consisted of Bowles, White House counselors Paul Begala and Doug
Sosnik, senior stategist Rahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff
John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   One participant said the meeting was very businesslike. Clinton
did not offer apologies, and no one in the session confronted him
with any accusations or regrets. ``It was neither light nor
heavy,'' said the one official. ``It was all very much business. We
had a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven months, Clinton refused to discuss his legal problems
with his closest political aides for fear that any information
shared with his senior advisers, who are not protected from a grand
jury subpoena, could be wrung out by Starr. During that silence,
many of those aides had been his staunchest defenders, arguing that
when Clinton made his vehement denials in January, he meant he
never had any kind of sexual contact with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, standing in the Roosevelt Room, Clinton glared at
the cameras with a look of pain and anger and said, ``I want to say
one thing to the American people. I want you to listen to me. I'm
going to say this again: I did not have sexual relations with that
woman _ Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie. Not a single
time. Never. These allegations are false and I need to go back to
work for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, his aides heralded his denial as proof of
innocence. ``Sex is sex, even in Washington, I've been assured,''
White House communications director Ann F. Lewis said hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used very plain language and very strong language, and
America knows exactly what he means,'' Begala said on that same
day. ``He did not have a sexual relationship with this woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Emanuel in April: ``Did he have sex? No. Sexual relations?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear last night if Clinton sat privately with Hillary
Rodham Clinton and his daughter Chelsea, prior to his testimony and
speech, though aides said that Mrs. Clinton continued to advise her
husband on legal and political strategy right up until Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who arrived at the White House late Sunday night at the
request of Chelsea Clinton, said he met with Clinton's wife and
daughter for nearly two hours before climbing the stairs to
Clinton's private office and talking with him for several minutes
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bill has a sense of embarrassment, that all the
speculation about this has created an embarrassing situation for
him,'' Jackson told reporters Monday. ``Hillary, as the wife,
there's a sense of humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was originally planning to leave for Martha's Vineyard
and a two-week family vacation on Saturday, but his departure was
delayed for the testimony. White House officials said the family
now plans to fly to the Vineyard sometime today and remain until
Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Lewinsky declined to say where Lewinsky was
Monday and whether the former White House intern planned to watch
the president's address. Lewinsky has been informed that she could
be called back before the grand jury this week. Lewinsky has made
no plans so far to make a public statement of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and historians wondered whether Clinton can
salvage the final 2 1/2 years of his second term, or whether he
will spend his time warding off congressional critics while he
tries to recreate a sense of credibility with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process has dragged the presidency down in a very
serious way,'' said Sheldon Stern, the head historian at the John
F. Kennedy Library in Boston. ``This is a really significant step
in promoting and legitimizing the cynicism that young people feel
today about politics and government. More and more they're saying
they don't care about politics and democracy, that it has nothing
to do with them. They're saying they're all phonies and frauds and
you can't believe anything they say. If that's going to be Bill
Clinton's legacy, he's going to have a lot to answer for.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University presidential scholar Richard Neustadt said
Clinton's reversal may strengthen the precedent set by the
Watergate break-in and cover-up in the early 1970s, which caused
significant public distrust in government and its leaders. Still,
he said the issue of sex was a relative wild card that could not
yet be measured and may create a different, or indifferent, dynamic
within the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is just a different category, where lying about sex
is different,'' Neustadt said. ``And you can't create a credibility
gap when you lie about sex. It is crummy, but it may not be serious
in the way the other things came to be serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Neustadt: ``If there's a public reaction, it will be a
slow burn. You're not going to know tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials appeared heartened Monday by public
opinion polls that put Clinton's approval ratings near all-time
highs and showed that most Americans already believed Clinton was
lying when he had said he did not have a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky.

CLINTON FRIENDS, AIDES ADMIT FEELINGS OF BETRAYAL, ANGER,
HUMILIATION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to tighten lead, add attribution)   By RICHARD L. BERKE and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before he addressed the grand jury and then the
nation, President Clinton called in some of his closest aides over
the weekend, associates said, and, one by one, he told them that
the accusation they had steadfastly denied for months was true: he
had had an improper relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings, which took place on Saturday and Sunday, were
described by close Clinton associates as informal and involving
only some aides. And only in some cases, they said, did Clinton
express regret for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of public denials and private anguish over
the inquiry by Kenneth Starr, it was those conversations that
helped Clinton fully come to terms with the toll the sex scandal
has wrought on his friends and on his presidency, two people close
to him said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit him hardest on Sunday,'' one close friend said. ``This
was a very, very difficult weekend for him. Nothing is more
important to him than his place in history. He is worried that this
investigation will eclipse everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even late last week while Clinton's associates were telling
reporters that he might acknowledge having had sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky, the friend said he was still ``in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four days ago,'' he said, ``the president told me he never had
sex with Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who met with the president _ and who had stood loyally by
the president _ expressed feelings of betrayal and humiliation,
people close to Clinton said. One friend said that there was ``a
lot of disappointment'' and that it was the aides' reaction that
was most distressing to the president, leading him to ``beat
himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the American public forgives Clinton for bending the
truth in explaining his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, he now
faces a problem closer to home: repairing relations with aides,
friends and Cabinet members who for months have adamantly, and
publicly, defended him. Collectively, these people face hundreds of
thousands of dollars in legal bills related to the investigations
that have punctuated his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the White House press secretary, was
unequivocal when the Lewinsky matter first became public,
declaring: ``The president is outraged by these allegations. He's
never had any improper relationship with this women.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, asked whether he feels misled, McCurry sidestepped the
question, saying he was still figuring out how he felt. But he
seemed to acknowledge his discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so self-preoccupied to be thinking about how I feel,''
he said in an interview. ``I think it's important that the
president talk to the American people, because whatever position
I'm in, they're in much the same position. I'm sure all the rest of
us will sort out how we feel in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, an adviser outside the White House who has been one
of the most aggressive Clinton defenders, spoke of his
disappointment in an interview Monday night. ``My disappointment is
not personal,'' he said. ``I'm a friend and a supporter, and I will
stand by him in a difficult time like this. My disappointment is
that his presidency should be judged as a great one and we've got
to work even harder now for his legacy because of what happened.''

</P>
<P>
   Besides Hillary Rodham Clinton, who ridiculed the accusations as
the product of a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' Clinton's most
unwavering defenders include Ann Lewis, the communications director
who for years has been close to Mrs. Clinton, and two senior aides
who have been with Clinton since the 1992 campaign, Paul Begala and
Rahm Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday night whether he feels betrayed, Emanuel said:
``This guy is dealing with something very personal. He is taking
responsibility for it. Where I come from you don't choose high and
low moments around your friends. I'm a staff person and I'm going
to be loyal to him. He and I have a history together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis, who had insisted that Clinton was not making any
distinctions between different forms of sex, said in January: ``Sex
is sex. Even in Washington, I've been assured.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ms. Lewis refused to talk about her own feelings
about the president, saying: ``I'm not going to go there. It is
more appropriate today for people to hear the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest profile members of the administration, no doubt,
will also be sorting out their feelings. In January, Clinton
assured his Cabinet he was innocent, and Madeleine Albright, the
secretary of state, stepped out onto the White House driveway to
back him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the allegations are completely untrue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll second that. Definitely,'' said William Daley, the
commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third it,'' said Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services.
</P>
<P>
   The last seven months have been particularly trying for some of
Clinton's defenders who, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said they suspected he was guilty but pressed on, or tried to
convince themselves of his innocence, not wanting to abandon him.
Some, like Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel, have been
careful to preface their defenses of Clinton with phrases like,
``If he says he didn't do this, I believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff, said of the
defenders, ``Whatever their inner suspicions, they went out
there.'' Panetta said he had spoken with some current White House
aides whose only solace Monday was that their ordeal might finally
be ending.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta, who was also Clinton's budget director and a longtime
Congressman from California, said he was personally disappointed in
the President. But most of all, he said, Clinton owes his staff
``an eye-to-eye'' apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to hang your staff out there with false
statements,'' Panetta said. ``When you're asked to spin something
that's not truthful, that's where you have to draw the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton acknowledged Monday night that he misled the
public, some of his defenders refused to back down. ``He did it to
protect his family,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a Democratic media
consultant. ``And it's none of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Clinton said that this weekend he fully realized
the profound effect his grand jury appearance could have on his
legacy, and that he seemed sad about that _ and still angry at
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to deal with the mixed emotions of relief and anger and
remorse,'' said one close associate of Clinton. ``He's angry that
it has come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The associate said that Clinton relied particularly on Mrs.
Clinton this weekend to keep up his spirits. She was described as
focused on the task before them, preparing for the grand jury's
questions to Clinton and for his address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a perceptible shift in tone in recent weeks among
Clinton's staunchest defenders, particularly at the White House.
Aides have been less energetic in defending Clinton and in
condemning Starr.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's former senior adviser who for
months has spoken out about his behavior, said he expected the
president's defenders to become more angry as time wore on. ``I can
imagine in the short run being numb by the crush of events,'' he
said. ``A kind of battle fatigue takes over. Where it may get
difficult is in the coming days when people have to confront what
happened and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the anger is already out in the open. Dee Dee Myers,
Clinton's former press secretary, said: ``I feel disappointed in
him; I'm angry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He put people through hell, including the staff and people who
are my friends,'' she said. ``The president has to apologize or
they have to quit. The president has to be truly, truly contrite.
I'm sure he didn't intend to hurt or embarrass them. But he did.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ADMITS AFFAIR WITH LEWINSKY, ASKS NATION TO RESPECT HIS
PRIVACY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told an anxious nation Monday
that he had a ''relationship that was not appropriate'' with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, directly contradicting the
blanket denial he issued to the American people seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing an extraordinary campaign of deception, denial and
evasion in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidency, Clinton
moved to try to repair a serious breach of public trust,
apologizing to the country in a televised address meant to clear
the slate on charges that have dogged his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not
appropriate _ in fact, it was wrong,'' said Clinton, who appeared
weary and emotionally spent after more than five hours of White
House interrogation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr earlier in
the day. ''I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of asking for national forgiveness,
however, pointedly asserting his right to a personal life that
includes personal mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now this matter is between me, the two people I love most _ my
wife and our daughter _ and our God,'' Clinton said. ''I must put
it right. And I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so.
Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private. And
I intend to reclaim my family life for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to dramatic lengths to distance what he regards as a
private matter from affairs of state, Clinton fired off a
determined counter-volley to his critics, saying the question of
his relationship with Lewinsky is a family concern, not a national
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nobody's business but ours,'' Clinton asserted. ''Even
presidents have private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Staring straight into the camera, and wearing a dark suit, white
shirt shirt and conservative blue necktie, Clinton stood by his
earlier claims that he did not urge Lewinsky, or anyone else, to
lie about allegations that he and Lewinsky had a White House
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy
evidence, or to take any other unlawfuyl actions,'' said Clinton,
urging the country to put the issue behind it. He added: ''This has
gone on too long, cost too much and hurt to many innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, said the president
conceded in his testimony that he had ``inappropriate contact with
Ms. Lewinsky.'' But, Kendall said, Clinton did not respond to some
questions touching on intimate details of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky,'' Kendall told the Associated Press.
``As to a very few highly intrusive questions, with respect to the
specifics of this contact, in order to preserve personal privacy
and institutional dignity, he gave candid, but not detailed,
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton postponed until Tuesday afternoon his departure, with
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter Chelsea, to
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., for a long-scheduled vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to spend much of the morning Tuesday on the
telephone making personal pleas for support from key political
figures, and trying to mend fences with senior White House aides,
many of whom have spent months defending him before a skeptical
public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, telegraphed late last week in a series of
carefully orchestrated White House leaks, marked the theatrical
climax _ but not the end _ to a moral and political drama that has
traumatized the administration and agonized the nation since
January.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to deliver an exhaustive report of his
investigation within weeks to Congress, which must then assess
whether the evidence justifies impeachment proceedings, formal
censure, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   As independent counsel, Starr presumably has reserved the right
to ask follow-up questions of Clinton, though it could not be
determined Monday whether he planned to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In early political reaction, Democrats were predictably quiet on
the matter, though some Republicans ventured that Clinton would pay
a political price of some sort for months of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Congress decides, Clinton, who has been dogged by a
series of scandals involving issues as diverse as his draft record,
White House travel operations and the use of the Lincoln Bedroom as
a perk for political backers, faces a daunting challenge: trying to
restore his credibility to the point that he may govern the country
for the two and a half years remaining in his badly tarnished term.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to begin that process, Clinton addressed the nation from
the historic Map Room, a formal parlor in the White House residence
that President Roosevelt used for top secret briefings during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the Map Room for his testimony, part of a
public relations effort to distinguish between his private affairs
and his official business, most of which is conducted away from the
residence in the White House West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady and Chelsea were at the White House on Monday,
having met for some two hours late Sunday night with civil rights
activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told reporters he was called to the White House at
Chelsea's request and that, after meeting with her and the First
Lady, the three of them met with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bill has a sense of embarrassment,'' Jackson told
the Associated Press. ``Hillary, as the wife, there's a sense of
humiliation. Hillary is dedicated to her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony began at 12:59 p.m. and lasted until 6:25
p.m. It was fed live to the federal grand jury that has been
reviewing evidence since January in Starr's inquiry into
allegations that Clinton conducted an affair with Lewinsky then
later urged her to lie about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments directly contradicted the public position he
has held since January 21, when the Washington Post newspaper first
reported that Starr was investigating allegations that Clinton had
an affair with Lewinsky then later urged her to lie about it under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared in televised remarks from the White
House less than a week after the allegations first surfaced. ''I
never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These
allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   That same month, in a deposition in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment suit against him, later dismissed, Clinton also said,
this time under oath, ''I have never had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony several weeks ago, Lewinsky reportedly detailed a
White House affair she said lasted more than a year. She reportedly
testified that she and Clinton discussed various cover-up schemes,
though he never explicitly urged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also reportedly turned over to Starr a dress she claims
contains physical evidence of a sexual encounter with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also questioned dozens of Clinton aides and members of
the White House Secret Service detail in an effort to corroborate
Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   While her version of events contradicts Clinton's public
statements, the president's lead personal attorney, David Kendall,
said Clinton set the record straight during Monday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He testified truthfully,'' Kendall told reporters at the White
House shortly after Starr's questioning ended. Without detailing
Clinton's testimony, Kendall took a parting shot at Starr,
continuing a central theme in months of White House efforts to
undermine the president's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' said Kendall,
again drawing a distinction between Clinton's performance on the
job and his handling of personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Starr waved quickly without comment to reporters as he exited
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, though, that Clinton's dramatic day of atonement
did not bring an end to a scandal that has already stained his
legacy and wrenched the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which the United States and Iraq drew close to war,
India and Pakistan flirted with nuclear Armageddon, ethnic
bloodshed reignited in the troubled Balkans, people power toppled a
U.S.-backed dictator in Indonesia and the global economy was
threatened by financial turmoil in Tokyo and Moscow, Clinton has
been distracted by months of complex efforts to avoid a day of
reckoning on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable estimate as to how much time and effort the
president and his staff have devoted to the issue. By Clinton's own
claims, however, and those of his attorneys, the distraction has
been extensive; there seems to be little doubt it's been
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday began, for instance, with Clinton's Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles meeting with two dozen senior White House officials
and trying to buck up their spirits for what promised to be a long
and painful day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'It's easy to be there for someone when they're up,
but it's the good ones who are there when you're down,''' White
House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters gathered in a packed
briefing room early Monday. ''I thought the analogy was a very good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own mood, McCurry acknowledged, was grim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't say he's exactly looking forward to it,'' McCurry
said as Clinton prepared to be interrogated, later adding, ''He
looks forward to getting this matter behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the drama that Monday brought, and all the intrigue
it finally laid to rest, Clinton's testimony and public statements
have not ended the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is likely to present Congress with an exhaustive report,
sometime next month, of his investigation, an event certain to
prompt a new round of media attention to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, based on Starr's findings, Congress would have to decide
whether to begin impeachment proceedings _ a process that would
involve lengthy hearings that could drag on well into next year _
or vote to censure the president for his activities or simply
ignore the issue entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of how the scandal will play in the
upcoming election season. All 435 seats in Congress, one-third of
the 100-member Senate and dozens of key gubernatorial and mayoral
slots, are up for grabs in November.

LEADERS OF MILLION YOUTH MARCH ASSAIL MAYOR AND PRESS AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking another step toward a showdown with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, organizers of a planned Million Youth March in
Harlem said Monday that they would seek a federal judge's
permission for the event but that the march would take place no
matter what.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor himself took a new tack in the confrontation Monday,
accusing the news media of hyping the event even as he tried to
play down its significance.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's pronouncements were the latest volleys in a weeks-long
battle over the planned march. Organizers have billed the event as
a show of unity and strength by young blacks, but the mayor has
denounced it as a ``hate march,'' citing anti-Semitic and
anti-white remarks by the main organizer, Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
With the proposed march less than three weeks away, neither side
has shown any inclination to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at two news conferences in Harlem, the organizers
stepped up their criticism of Giuliani and said they were going to
court because the city's refusal to grant them a permit was
unconstitutional. City officials have denied Muhammad a permit to
hold the rally on Sept. 5, a Saturday, on Malcolm X Boulevard,
saying the neighborhood cannot safely accommodate the 1 million
participants the organizers say they expect.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has fiercely criticized the Million Youth March in
recent weeks, refused to discuss it Monday. Instead, he complained
that reporters have written too much about the planned event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've really paid way too much attention to it,''
Giuliani said at a morning news conference. ``I pay very little
attention to it. This is a media creation more than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was largely Giuliani who drew reporters' attention
to the march in the first place. At several recent news
conferences, he pointed to Muhammad's anti-Semitic statements and
questioned why newspapers had not printed them. He also criticized
news organizations for not reporting what he considered one of the
most disturbing aspects of the planned march: that the organizers
planned to bring gang members from across the country to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has endorsed the concept of the march,
on Monday assailed the mayor's handling of the issue, saying
Giuliani's harsh criticism and efforts to stop the march have
created deep resentments. ``When he said he was going to stop the
march and called it a hate march, I think that was very
provocative,'' Sharpton said. ``The mayor's statements have created
a climate that could possibly lead to some kind of confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a former senior aide to Louis Farrakhan, leader of the
Nation of Islam, did not attend either Harlem news conference
Monday. He and other organizers have said that the march, involving
black teen-agers from across the country, was modeled after the
1995 Million Man March in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The city has offered Randalls Island and Van Cortlandt Park in
the Bronx as alternative locations for the march. It has also
recommended Sept. 19 as a more suitable date to avoid conflicts
with parades and other community events already scheduled for the
Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has called that later date and the locations the city
has offered `'totally unacceptable.'' He has also vowed to hold the
event on Sept. 5 in Harlem or in the Crown Heights section of
Brooklyn as a ``direct confrontation with the Jews of that area.''
</P>
<P>
   But city officials said Monday that when the organizers first
applied for a permit last winter, they asked to march on Sept. 19,
on Malcolm X Boulevard, on Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn or on
Randalls Island. Organizers did not return telephone calls seeking
an explanation Monday afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Muhammad was dismissed by the Nation of Islam as its spokesman
in 1994 after a 1993 speech in which he referred to Jews as
bloodsuckers and made other inflammatory remarks against Roman
Catholics, whites and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But he has continued making anti-Semitic statements. In a speech
last year he said: ``There is absolutely no evidence to
substantiate, to prove that 6 million so-called Jews lost their
lives in Nazi Germany.'' In the same speech, at San Francisco State
University, Muhammad said: `'Who's pimping the world? The hairy
hands of the Zionist in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wareham, a lawyer for the organizers of the march, said he
thought that the courts would be on their side. He said the
organizers would seek an injunction in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a human rights issue,'' he said, ``and it's simply the
right of young people in their own community to assemble and to
exercise their right to freedom of speech and freedom of
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Malik Zulu Shabazz, a lawyer who is one of the primary
organizers of the march, said gang members would indeed be coming
from around the country, but that the march will be peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing so-called gang members here to show that they
can put down the foolishness and the fratricide and the bloodshed
and the violence,'' he said. ``Why can't we as a black community
now take those who you consider to be criminal or gangsters or
thugs, why can't we use these young men as a foundation for
resurrecting the interests of our community and rebuilding our new
world order?''

&HT;        SPECTER, SANTORUM HOLDING DOUBT ON CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 -- As President Clinton tried to put the
Lewinsky scandal behind him, Sen. Arlen Specter said he had some
serious concerns about how the president handled his testimony and
suggested the matter could be headed for congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, R-Pa., said he was very troubled by the legalistic way
the president described his testimony during the extraordinary
nationally televised speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's one we can accept at face value,'' he said
after the speech on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his ``inappropriate'' relationship did not
constitute perjury in the Paula Corbin Jones case, when he
testified under oath that he did not have ``sexual relations'' with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also refused to answer questions that involved sexual
acts with Lewinsky. Those questions, Specter said, could be ``real
critical issues'' in determining if the president did have ``sexual
relations'' -- as defined in a written statement before his January
testimony -- and therefore committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know the facts and go through the constitutional
process,'' Specter said. He said he hopes Starr will send a report
to Congress by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be going on and on,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Johnstown, was not available for comment
because he is traveling in Saudi Arabia on a fact-finding mission,
and Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Everett, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Pennsylvania delegation remained behind
Clinton, despite his admission that he had not told the truth in
January. Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Phila., said there was no taste in
Congress to take up impeachment hearings if Starr's report is based
solely on perjury in sex-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dead in the water in Congress,'' Fattah said. ``If
that's at the basis of all this, I think it's an embarrassment to
Starr and the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said that the issue would focus
on perjury, not private sex acts. ``It's important for the
president to do what every other citizen of this country is bound
to do -- that is, when you raise your right hand and swear to tell
the truth, (you) tell the truth. The whole truth. And nothing but
the truth,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less from the president,'' Santorum added, ``would be
a slap in the face to the American justice.''

JURY FINDS LAWYER WAS HARASSED BY BOSS AT NEW JERSEY AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Ending a sexual harassment case that had
tarnished the image of New Jersey's most powerful law enforcement
agency, a state jury awarded $350,000 Monday to a former assistant
attorney general who said her boss had made inappropriate sexual
advances and lewd comments about women in the office and had
touched her breasts and buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for less than two days, the jury ruled that
Barbara Davis, 40, had been subjected to ``severe, pervasive and
unwelcome'' harassment by her supervisor, Richard T. Carley, the
former deputy director of the division of criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercer County jury, composed of five men and five women,
also found that the state had failed to investigate her complaints
aggressively in 1993. The judge forbade the jurors to speak,
because they still had to deliberate next month on whether to
assess punitive damages against Carley, 51.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came after an eight-week trial that offered an
unflattering portrait of the state's criminal justice division in
the early 1990s, with some testimony describing it as a unit rife
with the machismo of a boy's high school locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that male supervisors made crude passes at
their female subordinates, decorated their offices with photos of
bikini-clad models and a statue of a penis, and made salacious
comments about the body parts of female murder victims in grisly
crime scene photos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis said the harassment forced her to quit her
$50,000-a-year job in 1993, and said the stress of the legal battle
contributed to the failure of her marriage. Although the state may
appeal the verdict, Ms. Davis said the award _ $300,000 in back
wages and $50,000 for emotional distress _ should send a message
that such conduct is unacceptable, even in the traditionally
male-dominated world of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happy with anything that they gave me, even
a dollar, as long as they came back with a verdict that said you're
credible,'' Ms. Davis said Monday. ``Because, believe me, it
happened, and we're going to make it stop. It's going to stop now.
There's a sexual harassment hot line now so no more women will have
to go through this.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was the third in the past year in which a high-ranking
state official was charged with workplace harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gov. Christie Whitman was widely criticized for
agreeing to pay, at taxpayers' expense, the legal fees of former
Assembly Speaker Garabed ``Chuck'' Haytaian, who was accused of
harassing a female employee. That case was settled and cost
taxpayers $345,000.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials also paid the legal bills of Harold
Berkowitz, a former supervisor in the office of legislative
services, who was the target of a sexual harassment complaint that
was eventually settled for $347,000.
</P>
<P>
   Legal fees for Carley will cost the state more than $1 million,
in addition to the $350,000 in damages awarded Monday. Some
Democrats said the case highlighted the need to strengthen the law
to shield both female employees and New Jersey taxpayers. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have to have policy in place that protects employees and
make sure the state does not enable a hostile work environment,''
said Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, D-Teaneck. ``And we have to
have a policy in place to protect taxpayers so we are not paying
out settlements that we should not be paying out for defending
people who shouldn't be defended.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Jacob, the lawyer who represented the state in the case,
said New Jersey already had a thorough policy prohibiting workplace
harassment. Attorney General Peter Verniero, who took office in
1996, said that any of the offensive conduct described in the
testimony would not be tolerated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture of the division of criminal justice alleged in
this lawsuit does not reflect the current atmosphere or management
of the division,'' Verniero said.
</P>
<P>
   Carley declined to discuss Monday's verdict, but during
testimony he denied touching Ms. Davis. In a preliminary
investigation by the state attorney general's office, he did
acknowledge making crude remarks about women other than Ms. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that investigation, the state transferred Carley
to the division of alcoholic beverage control in 1994, stripped him
of his supervisory powers and cut his pay by $10,000 per year, Ms.
Jacob said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Jacob argued that Ms. Davis failed to notify the proper
authorities and said Ms. Davis' lawyers had overstated the sexually
suggestive nature of the office decorations. She said that there
were only two photos of bathing beauties and that the statue of a
penis was actually a fertility symbol that had been given to Ms.
Davis' supervisor, Gregory Sakowicz, by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacob also suggested Ms. Davis was motivated by money and
only filed her complaint after she was passed over for a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're judging with 1998 glasses something that happened in
1993,'' Ms. Jacob said. ``There has been an evolution in the law
since then, although I think the state handled it appropriately in
any event.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Carley's lawyer, Donald Belsole, said that his
client had a habit of making suggestive comments, but that he was
not abusive or malicious. ``His bark was worse than his bite,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors will reconvene in mid-September to weigh possible
punitive damages against Carley, but the judge has already ruled
that the state is not liable for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Davis, a spokesman for Verniero, said Carley would have to
pay his own legal expenses in that phase of the case.

   Duncan Pollack, a longtime top executive at Ammirati Puris
Lintas in New York, said Sunday that he had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great 13-year run at APL, but the time has come
for a new challenge,'' Pollack, 54, said, adding that he was
``investigating a number of opportunities'' and would announce his
plans in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Pollack would leave the agency
since he relinquished his positions as chairman and chief executive
of the New York office in January, while continuing as president
for North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Puris, chairman, chief executive and chief creative
officer at Ammirati Puris, will temporarily assume Pollack's North
American duties while a successor is sought.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack had been a top executive of Ammirati &AMP; Puris before that
agency was acquired by Interpublic Group of Cos. in 1995 and merged
with Lintas Worldwide to form Ammirati Puris Lintas.
</P>
<P>
   Two Agencies Named to a Split Fleet Account
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group said Monday that it would divide its
direct-marketing account, with billings estimated at $150 million,
between Barry Blau &AMP; Partners in Wilton, Conn., and Devon Direct in
Berwyn, Pa. The account had been handled by various agencies,
including Devon.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Richardson, a spokeswoman for Fleet in Boston, confirmed
reports of the decision this week in Advertising Age and Adweek.
She said the decision came after a three-month review that had been
narrowed to Blau, a unit of Snyder Communications ; Devon, and two
other agencies: Bozell Direct in New York, part of True North
Communications and Cohn &AMP; Wells in New York.
</P>
<P>
   More Schwab Duties for BBDO Worldwide
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. in San Francisco said Monday that it had
expanded its relationship with BBDO Worldwide by naming BBDO West
in Los Angeles to handle creative duties on its Mutual One Source
mutual funds service account, with billings estimated at $30
million to $35 million. The account had been divided between Cohn
Godley Norwood in Boston, which handled the print portion, and an
in-house team, which handled the television portion.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO West, part of Omnicom Group, was awarded the assignment
without a formal review. The decision comes less than two months
after BBDO New York was awarded Schwab's consolidated brand
advertising account for financial services, with billings estimated
at $40 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Suissa Miller Advertising in Los Angeles will continue to handle
the Schwab online brokerage account, while Rubin Postaer &AMP;
Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., will continue to handle media.

PROMISE ONCE AGAIN SHADOWED BY SHORTCOMINGS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add quotes from speech)   By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 20, 1997, as an ebullient Bill Clinton took
the oath of office for the second term that he hoped would secure
his place in history, he returned to a theme that had been at the
core of his claim to be a new kind of Democrat, declaring: ``Each
and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal
responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our
neighbors and our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one year later, Clinton learned that Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, was investigating accusations that
the president had started a sexual relationship with a White House
intern in 1995 and then tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Had the man who won the presidency by speaking out for the
people who ``play by the rules'' once more surrendered to a
lifelong compulsion to bend and break them? Monday night, in the
most painfully personal public confession of his life, and perhaps
in American political life, Clinton was forced to acknowledge, in
tight and reluctant tones, that he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both
public and private,'' the president said, adding that his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky was wrong and ``constituted a
critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for
which I am solely and completely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   How someone of such surpassing intellect and such protean
political talents could indulge in such conduct at a time when he
knew a special prosecutor was already scrutinizing his
administration and when his own re-election still hung in the
balance remains the most puzzling question about William Jefferson
Clinton. But it is not a new question, and in some ways it was
entirely predictable that this president should have come to this
pass, his promise once again shadowed by his shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton has always been convinced that he could outsmart,
out-talk, out-charm and outlast any adversary, and very often,
enough to confirm that conviction, he has. In the darkest days of
the 1992 primaries, he dared to campaign on a platform of personal
responsibility, despite widespread questions about his own marital
fidelity, marijuana use and draft record, and widespread doubt that
his answers were candid or complete. In his first term, he shifted
ground so many times that even his best friends sometimes said they
did not know where he stood.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Time and again in the risky running melodrama of his public
life, Clinton has treated the truth as an a la carte menu.
</P>
<P>
   Last Jan. 21, as news of the accusations involving Ms. Lewinsky
came out, Clinton told National Public Radio: ``I don't know any
more about it than I've told you, and any more about it, really,
than you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Monday night, Clinton insisted that when he testified under
oath in January that he had not had a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, his answers were ``legally accurate,'' though he added:
``I did not volunteer information.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such sweeping elisions lie far beyond the ken of
conventional political analysis. But professionals who have studied
the arc of Clinton's life and career have suggested some answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people wish to think well of themselves,'' wrote Stanley
Renshon, a political scientist and psychoanalyst at New York
University in his 1996 study of Clinton, ``High Hopes.'' ``However,
Bill Clinton appears to have come to believe the  &UR; best &LR;  of himself
and, either to avoid or discount evidence from his own behavior,
that all is not as he believes it to be. He attributes to himself
the most sincere and best of motives. His errors, when
acknowledged, are the result of basically correct efforts gone
temporarily awry, misunderstandings that, if one knew more of what
 &UR; he &LR;  knew, would disappear or be mitigated, or else are
attributable to naivete and inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may have come by his capacity for denial and
compartmentalization naturally. They were among the qualities that
allowed his widowed mother, Virginia Kelley, to persevere after
Clinton's father died three months before he was born, and that
allowed Clinton to make what most critics regarded as a splendid
State of the Union address just days after the intern scandal
broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When bad things do happen, I brainwash myself to put them out
of my mind,'' Mrs. Kelley wrote in her autobiography, published
after her death in 1994 under the president's review. ``Inside my
head, I construct an airtight box. I keep inside it what I want to
think about and everything else stays behind the walls. Inside is
white, outside is black: The only gray I trust is the streak in my
hair.''
</P>
<P>
   But gray is Clinton's favorite weapon. It has been central to
his successes and to his setbacks. As governor of Arkansas and then
as a presidential candidate, he succeeded in blurring old
distinctions of ideology, proclaiming himself neither liberal nor
conservative but ``new.'' As president, he at first promised both a
tax cut and new spending, then raised taxes instead. Two years
later, he apologized for raising taxes too much, claiming that
Congress had forced him to do so, a claim at sharp variance with
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who pledged not to raise taxes ``to pay for my
programs'' (he raised them to cut the deficit), who said he had
never ``broken the laws of my country'' (he tried marijuana as a
Rhodes Scholar in England), who defended his campaign finance
practices by saying he had never ``changed government policy solely
because of a contribution.'' His reputation for shading the truth
grew so encrusted that he faced semi-serious questions from
reporters over trivial matters, from his golf scores to whether he
really shot two ducks on a New Year's outing in Arkansas, or just
carried some that were shot by others.
</P>
<P>
   Innumerable times, Clinton has accepted responsibility and
forsaken blame. After his 1980 defeat after one term as governor of
Arkansas, his political consultant Dick Morris advised him that the
key to a comeback was to apologize for past mistakes, like raising
taxes and car license fees. Clinton resisted repeated entreaties to
say he was sorry, devising his own folksy formulation for a
television commercial: ``When I was a boy, my daddy never had to
whip me twice for the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only daddy Clinton knew was an alcoholic stepfather
who sometimes beat his mother, not him. And the president has spent
a great part of his life being whipped, often quite publicly, for
repeating his own mistakes. In his very first run for office, in
1974, his girlfriend Hillary Rodham, reportedly sent her father and
brother to help on his congressional campaign because she worried
about the rumors of his multiple romances on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, faced with accusations by Gennifer Flowers of a 12-year
sexual affair, Clinton said, ``That allegation is false,''
acknowledged causing pain in his marriage and largely put to rest
an issue that had derailed the 1988 campaign of Gary Hart. But
under oath in his deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones civil suit
this year, the president acknowledged sexual contact with Ms.
Flowers after all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Clinton has occasionally articulated a personal
hierarchy of relative wrongdoing, once blurting out in a
conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One _ apropos of
nothing _ that it was the money-changers in the temple who really
made Jesus mad, not the adulterous woman, of whom Jesus said in the
Book of John: ``He that is without sin among you, let him first
cast a stone at her.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ADMITS AFFAIR WITH LEWINSKY, ASKS NATION TO RESPECT HIS
PRIVACY
 &HT;    EDS: Inserts 4th graf; reflects minor editing.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told an anxious nation Monday
that he had a ''relationship that was not appropriate'' with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, directly contradicting the
blanket denial he issued to the American people seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing an extraordinary campaign of deception, denial and
evasion in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidency, Clinton
moved to try to repair a serious breach of public trust,
apologizing to the country in a televised address meant to clear
the slate on charges that have dogged his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not
appropriate _ in fact, it was wrong,'' said Clinton, who appeared
weary and emotionally spent after more than five hours of White
House interrogation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr earlier in
the day. ''I misled people, including even my wife,'' he said, his
voice quivering slightly. ``I deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton assumed the blame for his relationship with
Lewinsky _ ``It constituted a critical lapse inm judgment and a
personal failure on my part, for which I am solely and completely
responsible'' _ he also said it was time for the country to ``get
on with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of asking for national forgiveness,
however, pointedly asserting his right to a personal life that
includes personal mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now this matter is between me, the two people I love most _ my
wife and our daughter _ and our God,'' Clinton said. ''I must put
it right. And I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so.
Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private. And
I intend to reclaim my family life for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to dramatic lengths to distance what he regards as a
private matter from affairs of state, Clinton fired off a
determined counter-volley to his critics, saying the question of
his relationship with Lewinsky is a family concern, not a national
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nobody's business but ours,'' Clinton asserted. ''Even
presidents have private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Staring straight into the camera, and wearing a dark suit, white
shirt shirt and conservative blue necktie, Clinton stood by his
earlier claims that he did not urge Lewinsky, or anyone else, to
lie about allegations that he and Lewinsky had a White House
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy
evidence, or to take any other unlawfuyl actions,'' said Clinton,
urging the country to put the issue behind it. He added: ''This has
gone on too long, cost too much and hurt to many innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, said the president
conceded in his testimony that he had ``inappropriate contact with
Ms. Lewinsky.'' But, Kendall said, Clinton did not respond to some
questions touching on intimate details of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky,'' Kendall told the Associated Press.
``As to a very few highly intrusive questions, with respect to the
specifics of this contact, in order to preserve personal privacy
and institutional dignity, he gave candid, but not detailed,
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton postponed until Tuesday afternoon his departure, with
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter Chelsea, to
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., for a long-scheduled vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to spend much of the morning Tuesday on the
telephone making personal pleas for support from key political
figures, and trying to mend fences with senior White House aides,
many of whom have spent months defending him before a skeptical
public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, telegraphed late last week in a series of
carefully orchestrated White House leaks, marked the theatrical
climax _ but not the end _ to a moral and political drama that has
traumatized the administration and agonized the nation since
January.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to deliver an exhaustive report of his
investigation within weeks to Congress, which must then assess
whether the evidence justifies impeachment proceedings, formal
censure, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   As independent counsel, Starr presumably has reserved the right
to ask follow-up questions of Clinton, though it could not be
determined Monday whether he planned to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In early political reaction, Democrats were predictably quiet on
the matter, though some Republicans ventured that Clinton would pay
a political price of some sort for months of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Congress decides, Clinton, who has been dogged by a
series of scandals involving issues as diverse as his draft record,
White House travel operations and the use of the Lincoln Bedroom as
a perk for political backers, faces a daunting challenge: trying to
restore his credibility to the point that he may govern the country
for the two and a half years remaining in his badly tarnished term.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to begin that process, Clinton addressed the nation from
the historic Map Room, a formal parlor in the White House residence
that President Roosevelt used for top secret briefings during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the Map Room for his testimony, part of a
public relations effort to distinguish between his private affairs
and his official business, most of which is conducted away from the
residence in the White House West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady and Chelsea were at the White House on Monday,
having met for some two hours late Sunday night with civil rights
activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told reporters he was called to the White House at
Chelsea's request and that, after meeting with her and the First
Lady, the three of them met with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bill has a sense of embarrassment,'' Jackson told
the Associated Press. ``Hillary, as the wife, there's a sense of
humiliation. Hillary is dedicated to her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony began at 12:59 p.m. and lasted until 6:25
p.m. It was fed live to the federal grand jury that has been
reviewing evidence since January in Starr's inquiry into
allegations that Clinton conducted an affair with Lewinsky then
later urged her to lie about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments directly contradicted the public position he
has held since January 21, when the Washington Post newspaper first
reported that Starr was investigating allegations that Clinton had
an affair with Lewinsky then later urged her to lie about it under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared in televised remarks from the White
House less than a week after the allegations first surfaced. ''I
never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These
allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   That same month, in a deposition in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment suit against him, later dismissed, Clinton also said,
this time under oath, ''I have never had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony several weeks ago, Lewinsky reportedly detailed a
White House affair she said lasted more than a year. She reportedly
testified that she and Clinton discussed various cover-up schemes,
though he never explicitly urged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also reportedly turned over to Starr a dress she claims
contains physical evidence of a sexual encounter with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also questioned dozens of Clinton aides and members of
the White House Secret Service detail in an effort to corroborate
Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   While her version of events contradicts Clinton's public
statements, the president's lead personal attorney, David Kendall,
said Clinton set the record straight during Monday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He testified truthfully,'' Kendall told reporters at the White
House shortly after Starr's questioning ended. Without detailing
Clinton's testimony, Kendall took a parting shot at Starr,
continuing a central theme in months of White House efforts to
undermine the president's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' said Kendall,
again drawing a distinction between Clinton's performance on the
job and his handling of personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Starr waved quickly without comment to reporters as he exited
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, though, that Clinton's dramatic day of atonement
did not bring an end to a scandal that has already stained his
legacy and wrenched the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which the United States and Iraq drew close to war,
India and Pakistan flirted with nuclear Armageddon, ethnic
bloodshed reignited in the troubled Balkans, people power toppled a
U.S.-backed dictator in Indonesia and the global economy was
threatened by financial turmoil in Tokyo and Moscow, Clinton has
been distracted by months of complex efforts to avoid a day of
reckoning on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable estimate as to how much time and effort the
president and his staff have devoted to the issue. By Clinton's own
claims, however, and those of his attorneys, the distraction has
been extensive; there seems to be little doubt it's been
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday began, for instance, with Clinton's Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles meeting with two dozen senior White House officials
and trying to buck up their spirits for what promised to be a long
and painful day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'It's easy to be there for someone when they're up,
but it's the good ones who are there when you're down,''' White
House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters gathered in a packed
briefing room early Monday. ''I thought the analogy was a very good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own mood, McCurry acknowledged, was grim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't say he's exactly looking forward to it,'' McCurry
said as Clinton prepared to be interrogated, later adding, ''He
looks forward to getting this matter behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the drama that Monday brought, and all the intrigue
it finally laid to rest, Clinton's testimony and public statements
have not ended the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is likely to present Congress with an exhaustive report,
sometime next month, of his investigation, an event certain to
prompt a new round of media attention to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, based on Starr's findings, Congress would have to decide
whether to begin impeachment proceedings _ a process that would
involve lengthy hearings that could drag on well into next year _
or vote to censure the president for his activities or simply
ignore the issue entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of how the scandal will play in the
upcoming election season. All 435 seats in Congress, one-third of
the 100-member Senate and dozens of key gubernatorial and mayoral
slots, are up for grabs in November.

&HT;        FATTAH, A BELIEVER UNTIL THE END
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 -- U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah was a true
believer until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Fattah, D-Phila., despite streams of reports over the weekend
that President Clinton would change his story, said he fully
expected the president to stand by his original claim: ``I did not
have sexual relations with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that I've seen that he's moving away from
that,'' Fattah said early Monday afternoon, just as Clinton was
beginning to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the seven-month, sex-and-lies scandal, Fattah
steadfastly said he believed Clinton's original denials, avoiding
the sort of lawyerly defenses offered by the likes of former White
House counsel Lanny Davis. Davis often told TV audiences that even
if the affair was true it didn't rise to the level of ``high crime
and misdemeanor'' calling for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this matter, the president's been very straight forward,''
Fattah reiterated Monday. ``I'll deal with the facts as they
come.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday night, it was clear Fattah, and the nation, had not
been originally told the facts. And the fallout on Capitol Hill
remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   While Fattah said any case against Clinton based solely on
perjury related to sex was ``dead in the water in Congress'', Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he was very troubled by the president's
refusal to answer certain questions by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to answer questions that involved his sexual
acts with Lewinsky, questions that Specter said could be ``real
critical issues'' to determining if the president engaged in
``sexual relations'' and therefore comitted perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know the facts and go through the constitutional
process,'' Specter said on CNN's ``Larry King Live''. He said he
hopes Starr will send a report to Congress by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be going on and on,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Borski, D-Phila., is out of town on vacation and not
available for comment. Rep. Bob Brady, D-Phila., did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said that the issue would focus on
perjury, not private sex acts. ``It's important for the president
to do what every other citizen of this country is bound to do --
that is, you raise your right hand and swear to tell the truth,
(you) tell the truth. The whole truth. And nothing but the truth,''
Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fattah remained confident that Clinton would not have agreed
to testify before the grand jury unless he was certain he had his
legal background covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the president's stupid,'' he said.

D'AMATO'S APPEARANCE WITH GINGRICH SURPRISES DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
 - GINGRICH-NYT  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., has agreed to allow House Speaker
Newt Gingrich to hold a fund-raiser in Georgia on his behalf
Tuesday, even as his prospective Democratic challengers have sought
to hurt D'Amato by repeatedly linking him to Gingrich's policies.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's decision to fly to Georgia and appear with Gingrich at
the event was a surprise, if a pleasant one, to the three major
candidates for the Democratic nomination to oppose D'Amato this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn had been
planning to begin using a new television advertisement Tuesday that
for the first time directly linked D'Amato to Gingrich and to what
the commercial describes as the speaker's attempt to reduce
Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coincidence,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, which will cost $1,000 a head, is to be held at
a country club in Gingrich's hometown, Marietta. Aides to D'Amato
and Gingrich were unable to provide an estimate of how much D'Amato
expects the event to bring in.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser itself will not be open to journalists. D'Amato
did not announce the event, which was first reported in a column by
Robert Novak and was confirmed Monday by D'Amato's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's prospective opponents _ Schumer, Mark Green and
Geraldine Ferraro _ have made it clear that they would seek to use
D'Amato's association with Gingrich against him this fall. As a
result, several Democratic strategists said they were surprised
that D'Amato, who is known for his political astuteness, had agreed
to this fund-raiser just when attention to the campaign was
beginning to increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich fund-raiser does not appear to be a sign that the
senator has any financial difficulties. D'Amato has already raised
$20 million, about twice as much as his nearest possible rival, and
has about $12 million on hand to spend. He has had a steady stream
of television advertisements on the air recently.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's campaign spokesman, Harvey Valentine, said Gingrich
had offered to sponsor a fund-raiser for D'Amato when they ran into
each other a few months ago. He said D'Amato was not concerned
about the event being used against him. ``You know, the senator has
made his disagreements with the speaker known,'' Valentine said.
``When it's appropriate, we'll continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that D'Amato decided to go to Marietta for the
event rather than invite Gingrich to New York suggested that he was
not looking for much attention.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, D'Amato's political associate, Gov. George Pataki,
who is also up for re-election, has repeatedly gone out of his way
this year to distance himself from Gingrich. And the governor has
often criticized Gingrich for policies that Pataki said hurt the
Republican Party, especially in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's aides, who viewed the joint appearance as the
political equivalent of a hanging curveball, quickly produced a
list of quotes from Gingrich from over the years that were critical
of New York. ``These guys are two peas in a pod,'' Schumer said.
``D'Amato went along with all of Gingrich's cuts on Medicare, so
now Gingrich is giving him his reward.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Green, Joe DePlasco, said the planned
fund-raiser demonstrated that ``as much as D'Amato tries to show
that `I'm a new D'Amato,' there's nothing new here. He's the same
old conservative D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's communications director, Stephen Gaskill, also seized
on news of the event, saying that it was ``not surprising that
D'Amato has a close relationship with Newt Gingrich, given the way
that both of them vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's political spokesman, Michael Shields, ridiculed the
criticism, saying it came from ``liberal Democrats appealing to the
far left wing of their base by bashing a leading Republican.'' He
added, ``His opponents have not read any of the recent poll numbers
that show the speaker's approval ratings are much higher than they
used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the speaker had offered to help D'Amato as a sign
of his regard for D'Amato, who is chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker and Senator D'Amato are good friends,'' he said.
``We want to make sure that we have a strong Senate and a strong
chairman of that committee. As we pass bills in the House, we want
to make sure we get them through the Senate.''

QB THOMAS SAYS HE'LL STAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ By the end of Monday morning's practice, USC freshman
quarterback Jason Thomas was set to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   He told his father. He told USC coach Paul Hackett. He told his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett told Thomas to take the afternoon practice off and meet
with his parents before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting, along with an earlier individual meeting with
Hackett, prompted Thomas to decide he would stay at USC _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time I wanted to transfer this morning,'' Thomas
said. ``This morning was the closest I ever came. I don't want to
say how close I was. It's rough. I told my father I was
transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that kept me from transferring is I didn't want
to be a quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been frustrated that he fell behind sophomore Mike
Van Raaphorst and freshman Carson Palmer so early in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   This was confirmed Monday when Hackett told Thomas during their
meeting that he was the No.3 quarterback. The player-coach meeting
actually helped settle down the highly touted freshman, who has
been hobbled by an ankle injury during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm the No.3 quarterback because I didn't prepare
myself,'' Thomas said. ``I'm a couple pounds overweight. I paid the
price for it. After the (ankle) injury, I put on a lot of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he entered camp weighing 232 pounds, and he would
ideally play at around 210.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett attributed Thomas' frustration to the ankle injury, the
result of scar tissue remaining from the fracture Thomas suffered
during his senior year at Dominguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the injury. He can only practice once a day,''
Hackett said. ``It's hard for him. He's so competitive. This guy's
got four years to put up with me. They want to make an impact
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he plans to redshirt this year, unless injuries
allow him to play. He said he refuses to switch positions, because
he said it would be like quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson to linebacker: Junior David Gibson, who was battling
Grant Pearsall at safety, has been switched to starting weakside
linebacker. He'll replace freshman Darryl Knight, who was tentative
in Saturday's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put our best 11 guys on the field,'' Hackett
said. ``We did not move him with the idea he is a backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Pearsall injured his knee Monday morning but is
expected to be OK. It is not the same knee that Pearsall underwent
reconstructive surgery on last year. He did not practice Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, freshman defensive tackle Robby Wood has been
switched to offensive line.

CONE AND YANKEES BLITZ ROYALS, 7-1  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ David Cone is closer to his 50th birthday
than his high school graduation. Lines that didn't exist 10 years
ago cut across his face and neck when it's hot and he is straining
to get outs.
</P>
<P>
   But in his 35th summer, Cone is having perhaps the best season
of his career, and after he and the New York Yankees beat the
Kansas City Royals Monday night, 7-1, he is just two victories shy
of 20 _ which leaves Cone on the verge of accomplishing something
no one has in modern major-league history.
</P>
<P>
   Cone won 20 games for the Mets in 1988, the first and last time
Cone reached that mark. With two more victories, he would be the
first pitcher ever to go nine years between 20-victory seasons,
according to STATS, Inc. Jim Kaat, currently a Yankee broadcaster,
holds the existing record. Kaat went seven years between 20-victory
seasons: Kaat was 25-13 for the Minnesota Twins in 1966, and did
not win 20 again until he went 21-13 for the Chicago White Sox in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, Tim Raines and Tino Martinez each hit home runs
to support Cone, Martinez breaking open the game against the
Royals' Jose Rosado (6-9) with a three-run homer in the fifth
inning. The Yankees are 91-30, on a pace to win 121 games, and they
lead the American League East by 20 games, over Boston, the
Yankees' biggest lead since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine years since Cone last won 20 games, he has lived a
nomadic baseball existence, leaving the Mets for Kansas City, on to
Toronto and then the Yankees. He came to be familiar with aneurysms
and arthroscopic shoulder surgery as he struggled to stay healthy
through the 1996 and 1997 seasons. Now he is 18-4, the majors'
first 18-game winner this season, and a Cy Young Award candidate,
competing with Boston's Pedro Martinez and teammate David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre was the pitching coach for the Mets in 1988, and
he is Cone's pitching coach now. ``He's had the type of season
where you win 20 games,'' Stottlemyre said before Monday's game,
explaining how, early in the season, the Yankees scored lots of
runs for Cone when he wasn't pitching well, enabling him to win.
``Things always have to break right for someone to put up those big
numbers and win 20 games, no matter who it is. Right now, he's in a
good groove, and with the number of starts he has left, he should
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in his hometown Monday night and in the hot and humid
conditions he has come to love, Cone struggled with his control
early in the game, his fastball riding high and command of his
split-fingered fastball eluding him. A walk and a double in the
first inning and the Royals had runners at second and third and one
out.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone bore down, sweat glistening on the sides of his face
and in the hollow below his Adam's apple. Chewing gum nervously, he
stopped his jaw when he looked in for a sign, and then attacked.
David Palmer struck out on a fastball that singed the edge of the
strike zone and Terry Pendleton grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees holding a narrow lead in the third, Cone walked
two and allowed a hit to fill the bases, and again he pitched out
of trouble. In the first seven innings, the Royals were 1 for 6
with runners in scoring position, stranding eight runners as the
Yankees' offense finally steamrolled them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were vulnerable to left-handed pitching for most of
June and into July, when Williams was out with a knee injury. But
Williams has come back and Derek Jeter has matured as a hitter and
now the switch-hitting Davis can be the designated hitter against
left-handers, and now the Yankees' attack is quite potent against
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Through games of Saturday, in fact, the Yankees' lineup included
the American League's top four batting averages against lefties:
Jorge Posada (.370), Jeter (.368), Scott Brosius (.363) and
Williams (.359).
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers improved against Rosado Monday night. Leading off
the second inning, Williams _ who closed Sunday's victory against
the Rangers at Yankee Stadium with an upper deck home run _ crushed
a fastball some 421 feet to center field, onto the grassy knoll
beyond the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi singled in the fifth and Jeter walked, bringing
Davis to the plate with two outs. Rosado had struck out Davis with
fastballs in his first two at-bats _ Davis, like most older
players, sometimes cannot catch up to a high fastball _ and Rosada
started Davis with a high fastball in the fifth, missing high.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado then made the mistake of throwing the ball low; Davis
ripped a single to left-center, Girardi rounding third and scoring
the Yankees' second run. Williams followed that with an RBI single
before Martinez launched his three-run homer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hemmed in by prosecutors and reaching for political
forgiveness, President Clinton testified for more than four hours
at the White House on Monday before admitting in an extraordinary
address to the nation hat he had carried on a relationship with a
former White House intern that he said was ``not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton did not directly acknowledge a sexual
affair with the intern, Monica Lewinsky, after seven months of
emphatic denials. But he said, ``I did have a relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact it was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had misled his wife, but added: ``It is private, it
is nobody's business but ours. Even presidents have private
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of Clinton's testimony were not immediately
disclosed. But his lawyer, David Kendall, issued a brief statement
describing Clinton's liaison with Ms. Lewinsky as ``inappropriate
contact.'' It also appeared that Clinton declined to give detailed
answers about some aspects of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky,'' Kendall said. ``As to a very few
highly intrusive questions with respect to the specifics of this
contact, in order to preserve personal privacy and institutional
dignity, he gave candid, but not detailed answers.''
</P>
<P>
   In testifying and then speaking to the public, Clinton tried the
riskiest high-wire act of his career, trying to balance legal and
political burdens. Two days short of his 52nd birthday, he sought
to protect his presidency and elude legal jeopardy by acknowledging
an intimate relationship in the White House with a subordinate less
than half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been working on the brief public speech for several
days, his advisers said, operating on the belief that Americans
were not interested in the details of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky but did want him to own up to having made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   While the public focus on Monday was on sex as the airwaves
filled with chatter about the president, little was learned about
the less titillating but legally more threatening question of
whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice by possibly covering up
the relationship. He has denied that accusation, which associates
of Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has said is
at the center of the inquiry by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told the grand jury today,'' Clinton said in his address
on Monday night, ``and I say to you now that at no time did I ask
anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence, or to take any other
unlawful action.'' He concluded his public speech by saying, ``It
is past time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed defiant toward Starr, and his grand jury
session was described as very contentious.
</P>
<P>
   He told the grand jurors that he did not obstruct justice, and
said that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky did not constitute sex
under the definition used in the sexual misconduct case filed by
Paula Jones, according to a lawyer familiar with his testimony. As
a result, he argued, he did not commit perjury in denying an
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors informed Clinton that they might subpoena
him again if he did not answer their questions, and his lawyers
responded that they might fight such a subpoena. Beginning at 12:59
p.m., Clinton met with prosecutors in the Map Room on the ground
floor of the White House. His testimony was videotaped and
transmitted by live closed-circuit television to a grand jury at
the federal courthouse, just blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers were also in the room, Clinton sat alone in a
gilt chair before a table by a bank of windows, facing off against
a cadre of prosecutors who, his associates say, he believes is bent
on destroying him.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether the president lied under oath in
denying an affair with Ms. Lewinsky last January in his deposition
during the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit. Beyond the nature of
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr has been
investigating whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice and suborn
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took several breaks from his testimony on Monday to
confer with his lawyers in the doctor's office next door to the Map
Room. At about 3:30, he took a break that lasted roughly an hour,
one Clinton ally said.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the Lewinsky accusations has consumed seven
months of Clinton's presidency, his aides have acknowledged.
Clinton viewed his own place in history as riding in part on his
performance Monday and its impact on public opinion, one of his
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican congressional leaders have said that an
acknowledgment by Clinton that he had not told the truth about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky might blunt the threat of
impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill. Erskine Bowles, the White
House chief of staff, called Democrats on the Hill this evening to
rally support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Clinton heads off such hearings, it is far from
clear whether he will put his second term back on track, or put to
rest smirking speculation about his private life and inflamed
doubts, reflected in public polls, about his truthfulness. More
fundamentally, it was uncertain whether the presidency itself has
been diminished by a tawdry spectacle that on Monday drew so much
attention that one television camera monitored the scene from the
top of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With a grave expression and a brief wave, Starr left the White
House through the Diplomatic Entrance at 6:40 on Monday evening.
Moments later, Kendall stepped through the same door and made brief
remarks by the rain-slicked White House drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure'' to the four-year inquiry into the Clintons'
Whitewater real estate investment, he said, adding that it had
culminated ``in an investigation of the president's private life.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides picked up on Kendall's call for closure,
declaring that the president's statement on Monday would satisfy
any public interest in the long-running Lewinsky drama, and any
sense of aggravation with Clinton for his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are not pounding on the door for details,
they're pounding on the door for closure,'' one senior
administration official said. ``He doesn't owe them details, he
owes them an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   The official compared Clinton's remarks Monday night to his
acknowledgment on national television in January 1992 of ``causing
pain'' in his marriage. Clinton, then campaigning in New Hampshire
for the Democratic nomination, had been accused of an affair with
Gennifer Flowers, a singer in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering, rainy Washington day, White House officials
abandoned almost any pretense of the business-as-usual approach
they have taken during the head-snapping swerves and reversals of
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior staff meeting on Monday morning, Bowles reminded
the staff of the importance of sticking together. According to Mike
McCurry, the press secretary, Bowles quoted his own father, saying
``it's easy to be there for someone when they're up, but it's the
good ones who are there when you're down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare admission by the White House that the president's
spirits had sagged. One friend said that the president avoided
focusing until Sunday on the implications of his testimony. ``It
hit him hardest on Sunday,'' the friend said. ``This was a very
very difficult weekend for him. Nothing is more important to him
than his place in history. He is worried that this investigation
will eclipse everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton and his daughter,
Chelsea, remained at the White House on Monday, and were believed
to have met with him after he testified.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the president's own advisers expressed relief on Monday
that he was finally telling his side of the story. Some, however,
also feel misled by him, since he denied an affair to them as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton worked out on Monday morning in the White House
gymnasium, then spent about two hours preparing with his lawyers in
the White House residence. At noon, he broke for a briefing on
domestic and national security matters. Advisers described him as
engaged and interested during his ten-minute foreign policy
discussion, asking Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, how
the Russian ruble was trading.
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a photo of that meeting, the only
public glimpse of the president before Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about 12:30, Starr's blue-gray Crown Victoria sedan
swept up the White House drive, and he and his team of prosecutors
headed for the Map Room. The room, on the ground floor, is named
for its wall map of Europe still stuck with the colored pins that
Franklin D. Roosevelt used to mark the progress of World War II.
Clinton used the room to hold ``coffees'' for large donors to the
Democrats during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition on Jan. 17 in the Jones lawsuit, the president
acknowledged a mere acquaintance with Ms. Lewinsky, whom he met in
1995 when she was a 21-year-old unpaid intern. Clinton said that he
could not even recall ever being alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,''
Clinton said. ``I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky had sworn in an affidavit that she did not have a
sexual relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Clinton, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky, Linda Tripp,
had secretly tape-recorded numerous conversations in which her
friend described an affair with Clinton. Mrs. Tripp provided those
tapes to prosecutors, and also met with Mrs. Jones' lawyers before
they interviewed the president.
</P>
<P>
   Securing permission from Attorney General Janet Reno to expand
his investigation, Starr pounced, suspecting that Clinton had lied
in his deposition and then tried to cover up his relationship by
securing a job for Ms. Lewinsky, among other means.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton repeated in public his denial of any affair with Ms.
Lewinsky, issuing it in strong terms after giving a tepid response
to the accusations when they first surfaced.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' he said on Jan. 26, shaking his head and jabbing the
air with one finger. ``I never told anybody to lie, not a single
time _ never.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton fell publicly silent about the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Starr's investigation ground on. He
called more than 70 witnesses before the grand jury here, amassing
circumstantial evidence of an affair. Finally, after issuing a
subpoena for Clinton's testimony, he secured an agreement with Ms.
Lewinsky to testify in exchange for immunity. She acknowledged
under oath that she had had sex with Clinton, but denied he asked
her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also turned over a blue dress to prosecutors, which
they are having tested to determine if it carried residue of a
sexual encounter with the president. The test results were not
disclosed, deeply worrying the president's advisers as he prepared
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to testify in exchange for Starr withdrawing the
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the president were buoyed on Monday by public
opinion polls that continued to show Clinton with approval ratings
above 65 percent. By contrast, when President Ronald Reagan
acknowledged making mistakes in the arms-for-hostages swap known as
Iran-Contra, his popularity had fallen to his lowest level of
support in four years.
</P>
<P>
   One White House adviser noted that a CBS News poll, 24 percent
of people surveyed said that Clinton lying bothered them most,
while 16 percent said that they were most bothered by the media
coverage of the Lewinsky investigation. ``You guys are getting a
good second,'' he said. ``If we keep it going right, you may pass
us.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frederick H. Knubel, director of public information
at Columbia University and a spokesman for the university for 35
years, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island
after emergency surgery. He was 62 and lived near the campus in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He was fatally injured while bicycling in East Hampton when an
oncoming vehicle struck a deer, which then struck him, causing
severe internal injuries, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Knubel, director of the public information office since 1969,
acted as Columbia's chief spokesman in announcing the annual
Pulitzer Prizes for print journalism and the du Pont-Columbia
awards in broadcast journalism and in releasing news of Nobel
Prizes won by faculty and alumni.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with six presidents at Columbia, guiding news coverage
of major events, including the novelist Salman Rushdie's appearance
in 1991 at Columbia _ his first public appearance in the United
States after death threats against him by Iran's religious
hierarchy _ and the 1968 student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rochester, Knubel graduated from Hamilton College in
Clinton in 1957 and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in
1959. Before joining the university's news bureau in 1963 as
assistant director, he worked for The Rochester Times-Union as a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Judith Leynse; his mother, Alice
Knubel of New Rochelle; a sister, Helen Perry of Milford, N.J.; and
two stepsons, James and Andrew Leynse of Manhattan.

EDITORIAL: LETTING THE RUBLE SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 18:
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation and default were steps the Russian government wanted
to avoid for fear they would unleash political unrest and anger
foreign lenders. But on Monday the Kremlin took those steps because
the alternative _ the collapse of the banks and eventually the
economy _ seemed worse.
</P>
<P>
   Given the developing banking crisis and the loss of confidence
in international markets, the Kremlin had little choice. It had
become clear that not even the International Monetary Fund bailout
announced last month would be enough to keep the Russian government
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was forced when Russian banks, which have borrowed
large amounts of dollars, began to be pressed for repayment by
lenders last week. The banks tried to buy dollars from the
government, threatening to deplete its small reserves of foreign
currency. Last week the government blocked those dollar purchases.
Now it has blocked the debt repayments.
</P>
<P>
   The moves delay for 90 days the foreign currency debt repayments
owed by Russian banks and other private borrowers. That is aimed at
providing time for those borrowers to restructure their loans,
which many will have difficulty paying simply because of the
decline in the value of the ruble. The government said it would be
allowed to fall by up to a third. It is not clear how far the
currency will actually drop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russia promises that later this week it will
restructure its own ruble-denominated debt, on which it has been
paying extraordinarily high interest rates. It is expected to force
lenders to agree to accept lower interest rates and delayed
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Given the declining price of oil, a major Russian export, and
the government's failure to collect taxes, a devaluation has been
economically logical for some time. But Western governments were
reluctant to press for devaluation, because they feared the popular
reaction in Russia, where the availability of imported items,
particularly food, clothing and cars, has been a benefit of
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Russians do not anger easily and are likely to live with higher
prices as long as the government seems to be leading the country
toward greater financial stability. But the steps taken Monday will
no doubt deepen public cynicism about the country's political
leaders and could make it more difficult for reform candidates in
the next parliamentary and presidential elections. Their prospects
would be even less promising if the economy collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way for the Russian economy to recover will not be
easy. But it is in no one's interest to see the government
disintegrate.

&HT;        COLORADO LAWMAKERS SPLIT ON CLINTON CONFESSION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 -- As President Clinton finished his speech
Monday night, Rep. Scott McInnis watched his wife Lori stand up,
shrug, and walk into the kitchen of their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just didn't believe him,'' said the Pueblo Republican.
``He doesn't have it in his gut just to apologize. He's always
gotta add a 'but' to it or an 'and' to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, who chairs the Democratic National
Committee, applauded the speech, saying it was ``a forthright
statement and I respect him for saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a very strong apology,'' said Romer. ``It was a frank
statement of confession... I think it will help get this all off
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado lawmakers split on everything from whether Clinton
actually apologized to the potential impact of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., didn't find the speech to be enough.
``He expressed sorrow -- he did that,'' said Allard. ``He expressed
regret. But I didn't hear the word 'apologize.'''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said he especially disagreed with Clinton's assertion
that his affair is his private business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (ITAL)is(END ITAL) our business,'' said McInnis. ``More
secrets and more information has been exchanged through sex
throughout all time. The strongest tool for information and for
blackmail has been sex. What if it was a Chinese spy he was with?''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the speech was enough, and that the country should
move on to more important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve the truth and this is a positive
step in the right direction,'' said Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo. ``I cannot and will not condone the President's behavior,
but enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver, agreed: ``I am disappointed that
he did not acknowledge this earlier, but I have hope that this
matter now comes to a conclusion, so we can turn our attention to
the critical issues facing the country.''
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers also disagreed on another important issue: how
Clinton's confession affects the possibility of an impeachment
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he didn't answer all the questions, I think there's
another chapter yet to be played out,'' said Allard. ``I don't
think anyone in Congress relishes the idea of an impeachment
hearing. But I think they'll be looking for the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Romer said impeachment hearings would only help the
Democrats: ``If somebody tries to make a strategy of impeachment
after this confession, it will hurt them politically,'' he said.
``It will help the Democrats win back the House.''

CLINTON ADMITS RELATIONSHIP WITH LEWINSKY AFTER GRAND JURY
TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Complete writethru; adds Clinton address, details, quotes)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abandoning months of denial, President Clinton
admitted Monday night that he had an inappropriate relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and said he misled
his family and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his somber, nationally televised admission
less than four hours after completing sworn testimony before a
federal grand jury that is looking into allegations that the
president carried on an 18-month sexual relationship with the young
college graduate and coaxed her to lie about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to quell a scandal that has undercut his presidency and
raised the specter of impeachment by the Republican-led Congress,
Clinton abandoned his long-standing denial of the relationship 11
days after Lewinsky detailed the sexual relationship for the same
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, seated in the historic Map Room at the White House and
looking squarely into the television camera, insisted that he had
not lied about his relationship with Lewinsky in response to
questions posed to him on Jan. 17 by lawyers pressing Paula Jones'
$700,000 civil sexual harassment against him.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton added: ``While my answers were legally accurate, I
did not volunteer information. Indeed, I did have a relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Without going into details about the relationship, Clinton
called it ``a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on
my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said his public denials left ``a false
impression,'' adding: ``I misled people, including even my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, told reporters that
Clinton ``made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky'' during his testimony to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that in response to ``a very few highly intrusive
questions with respect to the specifics of this contact,'' Clinton
offered ``candid but not detailed answers'' in order to ``preserve
personal privacy and institutional dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's team is assessing whether to
recall Clinton for additional testimony, according to lawyers
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted, as he has since the allegations broke on Jan.
21, that he had not urged ``anyone to lie, to hide or destroy
evidence or to take any other unlawful action.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had denied the relationship for seven months to
avoid ``the embarrassment of my own conduct'' as well seeking to
protect his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this matter is between me, the two people I love most _ my
wife and our daughter _ and our God,'' Clinton said. ``I must put
it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nobody's business but ours,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his six-minute address to criticize Starr's wide
ranging investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many
innocent people,'' he said. ``It is time to stop the pursuit of
personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on
with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that Clinton answered Starr's questions for more
than four hours during the five-hour, 25-minute session in the Map
Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' added Kendall, a
trusted Yale Law School classmate of the president and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton chose to deliver his nationally televised
explanation from the Map Room, a formal sitting room adorned with
antiques and dominated by a World War II-era map showing allied
troops closing in on the Nazi capital of Berlin in April 1945.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill charted allied strategy there at the outset of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's secret testimony was relayed by closed-circuit
television to a 23-member federal grand jury seated in a courtroom
at the federal courthouse a dozen blocks away from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, 25, initially denied a sexual relationship with
Clinton in her sworn deposition in the Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit. That lawsuit was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky reversed course after winning immunity from
prosecution from Starr to tell the grand jury on Aug. 6 that she
and Clinton carried on a sexual relationship while she worked at
the White House, according to lawyers familiar with her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had repeatedly denied a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky, who went to work at the White House in June 1995 as an
unpaid intern. Clinton emphatically reiterated his denial in an
appearance at the White House on Jan. 26 with Mrs. Clinton by his
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared, waving his index finger for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, accompanied by Chelsea, a student at Stanford
University, planned to leave for a two-week vacation on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became the first American president to testify before a
grand jury investigating his conduct just two days before his 52nd
birthday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony was a crucial milestone in White House
efforts to quell a seven-month scandal that has obscured the
president's domestic agenda and hampered his efforts to bolster
Democrats' chances for retaking control of the House in the
mid-term congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's aides say the special prosecutor hopes to present a
report to Congress within three to five weeks on the results of his
four year inquiry into the Clintons' failed 1978 investment in the
Whitewater land scheme in Arkansas, their firing of White House
travel office personnel, the alleged abuse of FBI background
reports on prominent Republicans and the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may recall Lewinsky for a second appearance before the
grand jury before his inquiry ends. Starr's spokesman, Charles
Bakaly, said that prosecutors are near the end of their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to complete the investigation as quickly as
possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Starr must report his findings to the House Judiciary
Committee, which then weighs whether an impeachment inquiry is
warranted. Republican lawmakers in the House are divided, with some
conservatives insisting that the House undertake a full inquiry
into Starr's findings before reaching a decision on recommending
impeachment to the full House.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
reiterated at a news conference in Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday that
he did not believe impeachment proceedings are warranted if Clinton
told the truth before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally hope it works out well for the president,'' Hatch
said. Truthful testimony is ``the one thing that he can do that
might not only save his presidency but allow him to finish the
presidency through the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said that Clinton hoped
that his candor and apology would help douse a scandal that dogged
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been shadowed throughout his national political
career by allegations of marital infidelity. With his presidential
fortunes in jeopardy in the New Hampshire presidential primary,
Clinton denied a ``12 year'' affair with Gennifer Flowers during a
high stakes interview on CBS News' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted the relationship with Flowers in his Jan. 17,
1998, deposition in the Jones' suit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also denied Jones' allegations that he summoned her to a
Little Rock, Ark., hotel room in May 1991 _ five months before
launching his presidential campaign _ and solicited oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also denied Kathleen Willey's allegations that he
forced himself on her and fondled her during an encounter in the
Oval Office in November, 1993.

TWO CHARGED WITH BILKING INVESTORS IN PHONY CONCERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.C., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A licensed stock broker and another man were charged
in indictments unsealed Monday with bilking investors out of more
than $150,000 by pretending to promote concerts featuring the
Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are calling the men Con Artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants contacted potential investors and solicited
money to finance concerts for the Artist,'' said Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau. ``Rather than invest the money they
received in concert promotions, the defendants took the money for
their own use. Furthermore, the defendants had no connection
whatsoever to the Artist, and had no authority to sell any
promotional interests in his concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Brewer, 46, who worked for Millennium Securities Corp.
in Manhattan as a broker and lives in Princeton, N.J., was charged
with grand larceny, conducting a scheme to defraud and securities
fraud, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer surrendered to the authorities Monday; his bail was set
at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Moore, 28, of Raleigh, N.C., who allegedly posed as the
promoter of the concerts, was charged with grand larceny and
conducting a scheme to defraud, Morgenthau said. He is not yet in
custody; a warrant was issued Monday for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The most important charge, grand larceny, is punishable by up to
15 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme was carried out last summer, prosecutors said, and
involved at least four victims, none of whom were from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The largest loss was suffered by a Florida man, Harold Wexelman,
who was one of Brewer's stock clients and who gave the men more
than $50,000, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors uncovered the unusual scheme of selling stakes in
nonexistent concerts as part of a broader investigation into the
securities industry, Morgenthau said. When they realized that the
men were passing themselves off as representatives of the former
Prince, they called the performer's agent and his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Artist doesn't run his business like that,'' said Carolyn
Pelling, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case. ``He
doesn't take individual investments, and he certainly doesn't need
small-time investors to put any money up front in order for him to
have concerts.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ADMITS AFFAIR WITH LEWINSKY, ASKS NATION TO RESPECT HIS
PRIVACY
 &HT;    EDS: Adds 3rd graf to recast issue of an apology 
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told an anxious nation Monday
that he had a ''relationship that was not appropriate'' with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, directly contradicting the
blanket denial he issued to the American people seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing an extraordinary campaign of deception, denial and
evasion in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidency, Clinton
moved to try to repair a serious breach of public trust, in a
televised address to the country he hoped would clear the slate on
charges that have dogged his administration.
</P>
<P>
   In brief comments that were at least as combative as they were
contrite, however, Clinton never explicitly apologized to the
country for months of deception. On the contrary, he lashed out
against independent counsel Kenneth Starr and what the president
cast as a broader assault on the privacy of public figures, boldly
asserting at one point that his personal affairs were ''nobody's
business,'' even if they took place in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not
appropriate _ in fact, it was wrong,'' said Clinton, who appeared
weary and emotionally spent after more than five hours of White
House interrogation by Starr earlier in the day. ''I misled people,
including even my wife,'' he said, his voice quivering slightly.
``I deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton assumed the blame for his relationship with
Lewinsky _ ``It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a
personal failure on my part, for which I am solely and completely
responsible'' _ he also said it was time for the country to ``get
on with our national life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of asking for national forgiveness,
however, pointedly asserting his right to a personal life that
includes personal mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now this matter is between me, the two people I love most _ my
wife and our daughter _ and our God,'' Clinton said. ''I must put
it right. And I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so.
Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private. And
I intend to reclaim my family life for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to dramatic lengths to distance what he regards as a
private matter from affairs of state, Clinton fired off a
determined counter-volley to his critics, saying the question of
his relationship with Lewinsky is a family concern, not a national
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nobody's business but ours,'' Clinton asserted. ''Even
presidents have private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Staring straight into the camera, and wearing a dark suit, white
shirt shirt and conservative blue necktie, Clinton stood by his
earlier claims that he did not urge Lewinsky, or anyone else, to
lie about allegations that he and Lewinsky had a White House
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy
evidence, or to take any other unlawfuyl actions,'' said Clinton,
urging the country to put the issue behind it. He added: ''This has
gone on too long, cost too much and hurt to many innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, said the president
conceded in his testimony that he had ``inappropriate contact with
Ms. Lewinsky.'' But, Kendall said, Clinton did not respond to some
questions touching on intimate details of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the painful admission that he had inappropriate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky,'' Kendall told the Associated Press.
``As to a very few highly intrusive questions, with respect to the
specifics of this contact, in order to preserve personal privacy
and institutional dignity, he gave candid, but not detailed,
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton postponed until Tuesday afternoon his departure, with
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter Chelsea, to
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., for a long-scheduled vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to spend much of the morning Tuesday on the
telephone making personal pleas for support from key political
figures, and trying to mend fences with senior White House aides,
many of whom have spent months defending him before a skeptical
public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, telegraphed late last week in a series of
carefully orchestrated White House leaks, marked the theatrical
climax _ but not the end _ to a moral and political drama that has
traumatized the administration and agonized the nation since
January.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to deliver an exhaustive report of his
investigation within weeks to Congress, which must then assess
whether the evidence justifies impeachment proceedings, formal
censure, or neither.
</P>
<P>
   As independent counsel, Starr presumably has reserved the right
to ask follow-up questions of Clinton, though it could not be
determined Monday whether he planned to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In early political reaction, Democrats were predictably quiet on
the matter, though some Republicans ventured that Clinton would pay
a political price of some sort for months of deceit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Congress decides, Clinton, who has been dogged by a
series of scandals involving issues as diverse as his draft record,
White House travel operations and the use of the Lincoln Bedroom as
a perk for political backers, faces a daunting challenge: trying to
restore his credibility to the point that he may govern the country
for the two and a half years remaining in his badly tarnished term.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to begin that process, Clinton addressed the nation from
the historic Map Room, a formal parlor in the White House residence
that President Roosevelt used for top secret briefings during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the Map Room for his testimony, part of a
public relations effort to distinguish between his private affairs
and his official business, most of which is conducted away from the
residence in the White House West Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady and Chelsea were at the White House on Monday,
having met for some two hours late Sunday night with civil rights
activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told reporters he was called to the White House at
Chelsea's request and that, after meeting with her and the First
Lady, the three of them met with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bill has a sense of embarrassment,'' Jackson told
the Associated Press. ``Hillary, as the wife, there's a sense of
humiliation. Hillary is dedicated to her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony began at 12:59 p.m. and lasted until 6:25
p.m. It was fed live to the federal grand jury that has been
reviewing evidence since January in Starr's inquiry into
allegations that Clinton conducted an affair with Lewinsky then
later urged her to lie about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments directly contradicted the public position he
has held since January 21, when the Washington Post newspaper first
reported that Starr was investigating allegations that Clinton had
an affair with Lewinsky then later urged her to lie about it under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared in televised remarks from the White
House less than a week after the allegations first surfaced. ''I
never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These
allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   That same month, in a deposition in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment suit against him, later dismissed, Clinton also said,
this time under oath, ''I have never had sexual relations with
Monica Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony several weeks ago, Lewinsky reportedly detailed a
White House affair she said lasted more than a year. She reportedly
testified that she and Clinton discussed various cover-up schemes,
though he never explicitly urged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also reportedly turned over to Starr a dress she claims
contains physical evidence of a sexual encounter with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also questioned dozens of Clinton aides and members of
the White House Secret Service detail in an effort to corroborate
Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   While her version of events contradicts Clinton's public
statements, the president's lead personal attorney, David Kendall,
said Clinton set the record straight during Monday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He testified truthfully,'' Kendall told reporters at the White
House shortly after Starr's questioning ended. Without detailing
Clinton's testimony, Kendall took a parting shot at Starr,
continuing a central theme in months of White House efforts to
undermine the president's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' said Kendall,
again drawing a distinction between Clinton's performance on the
job and his handling of personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Starr waved quickly without comment to reporters as he exited
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, though, that Clinton's dramatic day of atonement
did not bring an end to a scandal that has already stained his
legacy and wrenched the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a year in which the United States and Iraq drew close to war,
India and Pakistan flirted with nuclear Armageddon, ethnic
bloodshed reignited in the troubled Balkans, people power toppled a
U.S.-backed dictator in Indonesia and the global economy was
threatened by financial turmoil in Tokyo and Moscow, Clinton has
been distracted by months of complex efforts to avoid a day of
reckoning on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable estimate as to how much time and effort the
president and his staff have devoted to the issue. By Clinton's own
claims, however, and those of his attorneys, the distraction has
been extensive; there seems to be little doubt it's been
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday began, for instance, with Clinton's Chief of Staff
Erskine Bowles meeting with two dozen senior White House officials
and trying to buck up their spirits for what promised to be a long
and painful day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'It's easy to be there for someone when they're up,
but it's the good ones who are there when you're down,''' White
House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters gathered in a packed
briefing room early Monday. ''I thought the analogy was a very good
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own mood, McCurry acknowledged, was grim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't say he's exactly looking forward to it,'' McCurry
said as Clinton prepared to be interrogated, later adding, ''He
looks forward to getting this matter behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the drama that Monday brought, and all the intrigue
it finally laid to rest, Clinton's testimony and public statements
have not ended the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is likely to present Congress with an exhaustive report,
sometime next month, of his investigation, an event certain to
prompt a new round of media attention to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, based on Starr's findings, Congress would have to decide
whether to begin impeachment proceedings _ a process that would
involve lengthy hearings that could drag on well into next year _
or vote to censure the president for his activities or simply
ignore the issue entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of how the scandal will play in the
upcoming election season. All 435 seats in Congress, one-third of
the 100-member Senate and dozens of key gubernatorial and mayoral
slots, are up for grabs in November.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said
it all. Al had taken everything that a greyhound could be expected
to, and then he had taken even more.
</P>
<P>
   Once he had been a racer, sleek and fleet. Then came abandonment
on the beaches of Brooklyn. Mercy arrived in the form of a new
owner and a home in the New Jersey suburbs, but when he was 8, Al's
back gave out. Two painful surgeries and more than $6,000 later, he
still wasn't the dog he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   His journey into Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning was a
pilgrimage of stubborn hope. There, in a back yard in Murray Hill,
Al dipped into his own Lourdes, a circular pool of heated water
that might do what the operations, acupuncture and Bach flower
essences had not: heal him.
</P>
<P>
   With Jodi Richard, a trained canine hydrotherapist, holding
tight to his rump, Al paddled and paddled, going nowhere fast, his
gimpy back legs freed from gravity so they could get the exercise
they sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   His owner, Jackie Wright-Minogue, rushed to him as soon as he
left the pool to rest under a pink towel on the cushion of a lawn
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to get well,'' she said, articulating the simple
wish that had wrought such complicated ministrations. ``I want him
to have a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   That desire, seemingly boundless among many pet owners, has
ushered in a whole new era in animal care. Ms. Richard's business,
Bonnie's K 9 Swim Therapy Center, named for her German shepherd, is
but one example.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the New York region, veterinarians are hooking
dogs and cats to electric acupuncture machines, dosing them with
homeopathic remedies, placing putatively therapeutic magnets
beneath their beds, even spraying the air around them with
lavender, lemon or eucalyptus in the name of aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is perhaps the inevitable outgrowth of a culture
blissed out on St. John's wort and mesmerized by Andrew Weil. It is
also the ultimate illustration of the degree to which many
Americans insist on sharing their own habits and extravagances,
from summer camp to spa treatments, with the four-legged members of
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Garvey, director of the Bobst Hospital at the Animal
Medical Center in Manhattan, described it as a kind of
cross-species psychological transference. ``We project our
character flaws on our pets,'' he said. ``We project our behavior
on them. I've even had clients project their religion on them. This
is very much in the same fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Could your cat benefit from an adjustment? There are a growing
number of veterinary chiropractors on hand. Is there knotting in
your dog's muscles? You can take him to a canine massage therapist.
If it has been tried on people, it is being tried on pets, and not
just on the most common species.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Buchoff, a veterinarian in North Bergen, N.J., has
performed acupuncture on iguanas with brittle bones. Dr. Marcie
Fallek, who has offices in New York and Fairfield, Conn., has
administered homeopathic treatments _ solutions with minuscule
traces of special plant or mineral ingredients _ to a pet raccoon
that was seemingly depressed over a canine companion's death and
had stopped using its litter box.
</P>
<P>
   The raccoon's owner, fearful that law enforcement authorities
would learn that she was keeping a wild animal, declined to be
interviewed for this article, even anonymously, Fallek said. ``Her
psychic told her there might be trouble,'' Fallek explained.
``Plus, Mercury's in retrograde and, well, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the obvious question: How much of this is pure
quackery? As it turns out, less than one might think.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Swanson, president of the American Veterinary
Medical Association, said that the legitimacy of acupuncture, at
least on mammals with skeletal structures similar to people's, was
beyond doubt, and that hydrotherapy and chiropractic were probably
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But Swanson cast a more skeptical eye on homeopathy, Bach flower
essences and the like. ``That's really getting on the fringe,'' he
said, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such
treatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians
and their clients. ``The world is made up of a lot of very
vulnerable and gullible people,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes
to the vim and vigor of their hirsute _ or, for that matter,
feathered _ loved ones. According to the association, expenditures
by Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and
birds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied,
from $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for
inflation). During that period, the pet population grew only
modestly.
</P>
<P>
   The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of
alternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not
cheap. In New York City _ where, granted, prices for most things
tend to be highest _ half an hour of acupuncture generally costs
$50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms. Richard's healing
waters costs $75. Because treatments are usually repeated over the
course of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than
just random experimentation more than two decades ago. Racehorses
were the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes
surrounding the health of these animals were highest.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, the field has really taken off,
drawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either
integrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary
practices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.
</P>
<P>
   The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was
founded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians. The
International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974,
reports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is
still a small fraction of all veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary
acupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being
ventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats,
dogs and parrots.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine in California regularly does turtles _ well,
not the shell,'' Ms. Watkins said. ``I know a guy in San Diego who
is doing a dolphin.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to
alternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product
catalogs, many with their own Internet sites. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site for the Botanical Animal catalog provides a
link to the Equilite line of herbal and floral elixirs for horses,
including the ``Broodmare Blend,'' the ``Clear Thinking Blend,''
the ``Ego Builder Blend'' and the ``Mellow Out Blend.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pets being given alternative treatments are often
following their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started going to an acupuncturist for stress because I saw
how well it worked for Lola,'' Liz Santander, an interior designer
from Chappaqua, N.Y., said of her 150-pound Great Dane as the dog
awaited her latest treatment the other morning in the offices of
Dr. Phillip Raclyn on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   It was a busy, busy day. While Lola, who was bouncing back from
a stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame
shepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.
</P>
<P>
   A condition known as degenerative myelopathy had essentially
paralyzed Ike's hind legs, which his owner, Chris O'Sullivan,
straps into a two-wheeled cart so Ike can still chase Frisbees.
(``I have to throw the Frisbee right at him,'' O'Sullivan
explained.)
</P>
<P>
   But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage
therapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a
particularly intimate, thorough petting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel for the bony landmarks,'' Ms. Cooper instructed
O'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in
Chinatown. ``Push away from the spine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Raclyn inserted an
acupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with
kidney problems. For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn;
then another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin
cushion. Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier and a few miles downtown, Ms. Richard's
patients were decidedly more agitated, slaves to a sloshy,
invisible treadmill. Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with
Duncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about
35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for
running.
</P>
<P>
   Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu
recovering from surgery for a ruptured disc. The operation had left
Sydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully
regain.
</P>
<P>
   This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked _ as
far as these things can be determined _ appalled and terrified
about taking the plunge. ``He's a good boy,'' Lauran Walk, his
owner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the
surface. ``He's a good, good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village,
said that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that
Sydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and
would do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was
only a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a
chance,'' Ms. Walk said as Sydnee took a brief poolside rest, a
shivering knot of fur with limited mobility. ``I can't be
selfish.''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: After a long wait, Americans treated to 'crummy TV'By
Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, that woman.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reversed his version of the truth about ``that
woman, Miss Lewinsky'' on Monday, first before a grand jury, then
in front of a national TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first appeared from the White House map room at 10 p.m.
looking as if he'd been sent to time out. He apologized (``it was
wrong''), hinted he might agonize (``I misled people, including,
even, my wife''), then rallied into a political statement. For four
minutes and ten seconds, he never reached for a Clinton prop,
though they never seemed far away: the bitten lip, the tear-welling
eye.
</P>
<P>
   It was two speeches in one, and it baffled many usually
unbaffable pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you saying you're not impressed?'' CNN's Larry King asked
Jeff Greenfield after the newsman's first post-speech comments.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield gave it another shot. ``It was the most unusual and
difficult speech any public figure has had to give. To judge it on
a scale of `rhetoric: 8, cosmotology: 6' is almost offensive in
this context.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered CBS's Bob Schieffer, ``You don't hear this kind of thing
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never heard it from an American president,'' said anchor
Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a rare telegenic moment in this long-running drama.
For all the day's historic weightiness, what led up to Clinton's
tell-little was mostly crummy TV _ a stunning letdown for those who
thought this might be a kind of final, rewarding episode to this
seven-month series. The broadcast networks interrupted regular
programming for a few minutes when Clinton began his grand jury
testimony shortly before 1 p.m. _ then scrammed (NBC cut off Tom
Brokaw in mid-sentence and leapt to its soap opera ``Sunset
Beach'').
</P>
<P>
   CNN wasn't so lucky. It was stuck with endless hours of expanded
coverage and little new to fill it with. There were rare bright
exceptions, such as Candy Crowley's feature on Clinton's
truth-telling options (``Isn't it mind blowing how truth is talked
about as multiple choice?'' she asked with the lively frankness
usually reserved for Greenfield).
</P>
<P>
   The most mind-blowing comment on truth, however, came from Sen.
Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) on CNN, when he advised Clinton to be
honest, adding, ``George Washington didn't lie. Now, I don't know
if that's true or not ...''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN did for much of the day what it's done for weeks: let
commentators speculate about what prosecutors would ask, what
Clinton would answer, and admit it had no idea. CNN producer Ted
Barrett got a morning peek inside the grand jury room and reported:
``It's a large court room with very tall ceilings, a pale white
wood, very light marble walls ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``All day we had the most lethal of situations: an intense
interest and no news,'' said Terrance Smith on PBS's ``The NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN tried to spike drama into this static situation _ so static
reporters were reduced to fashioning metaphors out of rain falling
over the White House _ with a tiny box in a corner of the screen,
ticking off the minutes of Clinton's testimony, as if it were a
World Cup soccer match. The network ditched the box less than two
hours later: it couldn't account for breaks during testimony, which
apparently rendered its clock ``unofficial.''
</P>
<P>
   When testimony ended at 6:25 p.m., the networks' nightly news
was left largely with news it had reported all weekend: Clinton
'fessed to a ``relationship.'' But Rather was still revved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is live TV,'' he reminded us. ``Trying to cover this
story is like trying to put a fan belt on a moving Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather later threw to Schieffer: ``Let's go for a quick
analysis, as far as there can be any.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer confirmed Rather's worst fears: ``I don't think
there's much more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But by prime time, the pundits were in full throttle _ just as
we like 'em. CNBC's Chris Mathews may have broken his own run-on
record. At one point he unloosed 196 words in a 40 second riff _
4.9 words a second!
</P>
<P>
   Too bad CNN didn't have its clock on him to make it official.

 &HT;    Bombeck to have 'a piece of Phoenix' at gravesite
 &HT;    By Brandon Peterson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For the past two years, only a potted plant
marked the grave where Dayton native and internationally-read humor
columnist Erma Bombeck is buried at Woodland Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the plant will be replaced by a massive rock that was
brought in from near Bombeck's former home in Arizona to adorn her
final resting place.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a 29,000-pound rock measuring 6 feet wide and
standing 5 feet 3 inches tall was delivered to the cemetery on a
flatbed semi truck.
</P>
<P>
   The stone was lugged off the property of one of Bombeck's
neighbors on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Bill Bombeck, said he ``wanted a piece of Phoenix''
at his wife's grave to commemorate the 25 years they spent together
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The rock is the largest marker in the cemetery, according to
Teresa Moyer, director of public relations for the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will definitely add fascination to the cemetery,'' Moyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bombeck died of complications following a kidney transplant in
1996. Shortly after her death, Bill Bombeck decided to have his
wife buried in Woodland Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Cemetery is the oldest non-profit cemetery in the Miami
(Ohio) Valley, according to Moyer. The cemetery is the final
resting place of numerous Dayton natives. James M. Cox, former
governor of Ohio and publisher of the Dayton Daily News, the Wright
brothers, Paul Laurence Dunbar and Charles Kettering, are among
those buried at the 157-year-old cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer said the next step is to have someone determine what type
of stone the marker is and more importantly _ how to place the rock
on the gravesite.
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery officials are trying to figure out how to preserve a
Magnolia tree that is situated near Bombeck's grave where the rock
is to be placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some site constraints, and we are looking into
various options on how to place the rock without damaging the
tree,'' said Mary Rogero, architect with Rogero-Buckman architects
who is handling the project. Rogero said she wasn't sure when the
excavation would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Bombeck began writing columns for the Journal Herald in 1965.
She also worked for the Kettering-Oakwood Times. Bombeck, who was
known for her witty but wise columns that poked fun at family life
began her humor column as a suburban housewife.

 &HT;    Despite defeat, quarterback question may be answered for Bengals
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Bengals head coach Bruce Coslet has said it plenty
of times: The quarterback competition will be settled on the field.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then Neil O'Donnell is the clear-cut leader
in his race against teammate Jeff Blake for the starting role Sept.
6.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Bengals' 30-27 preseason defeat at the hands of the
Indianapolis Colts on Monday at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   The big story was O'Donnell grabbing the quarterback job by the
lapels and pulling it toward him, while Blake played giveaway. Many
spectators booed Blake and the defense off the field at halftime
with the Colts ahead 23-14. O'Donnell started and had the Bengals
up, 14-10, when he left at 11:52 of the second. He completed all
five passes for 58 yards, with a 7-yard TD to Darnay Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Blake played the final 9:30 of the second quarter, going 0 for 7
passing with an interception and no first downs in four series.
</P>
<P>
   He bounced back in the third quarter, guiding the Bengals on a
nine-play, 82-yard opening drive that Eric Bieniemy finished with a
5-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Blake looked much smoother after halftime, setting up the TD
with passes of 29 yards to tight end Marco Battaglia and 15 yards
to David Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   But his night ended with more boos _ a false-start penalty on
left guard Rod Jones on fourth-and-1 near midfield that forced the
Bengals to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Blake may have even lost the backup job to Paul Justin, who
fired a 39-yard TD pass to rookie Damon Gibson with 3:18 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Colts rookie quarterback Peyton Manning completed 5 of 11 passes
for 112 yards and a 12-yard TD to Marvin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's TD came five plays after cornerback Jeff Burris
picked off Blake at the Colts' 41.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis opened the game with an 11-play, 71-yard scoring
drive that culminated with Marshall Faulk's 1-yard plunge on a
delayed call by officials. As the Bengals' celebrated what they
thought was a goal-line stand, the referees waited until they were
sure, then thrust their arms skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Tremain Mack exploded 60 yards with the ensuing kickoff to the
Colts' 37 and Corey Dillon took over from there. He carried five
times for 33 yards on runs of 6, 21, 4 and a pair of 1-yarders to
tie the score at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who fired a 25-yard pass to Torrance Small on the first
drive, launched a 39 yarder to Harrison at the Bengals' 28 on the
Colts' second drive.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals' top draft pick Takeo Spikes sacked Manning for an
8-yard loss and the Colts' settled for Mike Vanderjagt's 49-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott's TD catch _ set up by O'Donnell's 31-yard pass to
Dillon _ the Colts took control, reeling off 13 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   Mack added a 59-yard kickoff return to his 60 yarder and rookie
Artrell Hawkins had a 37-yard kickoff return. A pair of Bengals'
rookies _ linebacker Adrian Ross and nose tackle Glen Steele _
joined Spikes with sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Steve Tovar suffered a neck injury in the fourth
quarter.

FOUR WEEKS AFTER SCAFFOLDING COLLAPSE, STREET TO REOPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the relief of the business owners who were among
the hardest hit by the July 21 scaffolding collapse at the Conde
Nast building, the plywood gates that have sealed off 43rd Street
for several weeks were dismantled Monday, and the street itself was
scheduled to reopen Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For the Roundabout Theater, that means that its hit musical,
``Cabaret,'' can resume performances at the Kit Kat Klub on
Thursday after missing 35 performances and losing more than $1.5
million in ticket sales, artistic director Todd Haimes said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly unprecedented,'' Haimes said. ``It is truly an
act of God. You wait 20 years to have a hit like this and then _
literally _ the sky falls in.''
</P>
<P>
   For Steve Chang, the owner of Rio de Janeiro, a new
all-you-can-eat barbecue restaurant, the reopening of 43rd Street
means he can begin hiring and training people to replace the 40
waiters who left because he could no longer pay them. If he can
hire enough employees _ and get the gas turned on _ he, too, can be
up and running by Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Woodstock Hotel, where an elderly woman was killed
when the construction scaffold buckled, sending debris flying
through the roof, there was no hopeful news for the 274 mostly
elderly residents who were forced to relocate elsewhere on the West
Side.
</P>
<P>
   Structural engineers were breaking into the walls of the hotel
Monday to determine whether any of the support columns were
damaged, and were expected to file a report with the city Tuesday,
said Buildings Commissioner Gaston Silva.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building is going to need work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Monday when the hotel would be ready for
occupancy. The only other business on the block that is not being
allowed to reopen is a parking garage, which was also damaged by
falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   One restaurant, Manhattan Chili Company, has been operating a
takeout and delivery service, using a second entrance in the office
building at 1500 Broadway. The manager, Ken Kessler, plans to
reopen the restaurant on Thursday, but he said he would not be
surprised if many potential customers avoided 43rd Street in the
wake of the scaffolding collapse. ``For how long I don't know,'' he
said. ``People have short memories for some things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A building crew finished removing the last part of the damaged
scaffolding late Saturday, and the most dangerous part of the
operation was completed last week, when an elevator cab was
extricated from the 24th floor, said Richard Kielar, a senior vice
president of Tishman Realty and Construction, the construction
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Construction work on parts of the building not affected by the
accident resumed on Aug. 10, Kielar said, adding that the building
was expected to be finished by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as workers were cleaning up debris at the
construction site, city sanitation workers removed six huge trash
bins full of spoiled food from several restaurants on the block,
said Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of
Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, the owner of Rio de Janeiro, said that he was first
allowed to return to his restaurant about 10 days ago, and then was
allowed to return again Sunday night. ``The bad smell was swirling
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that the restaurant lost $750,000 by being closed.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old Casablanca Hotel, a 48-room boutique hotel with a
Moroccan theme, is also expected to reopen on Thursday, said
manager Brian Dass.
</P>
<P>
   Estimating that the hotel had lost about $200,000 in business,
he said that he was even more concerned about the damage to future
bookings, given that people plan their trips far in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an e-mail from someone asking if we would be open by
April 1999,'' he said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his grand jury testimony and his brief and
defiant public admission of an inappropriate relationship with
Monica Lewinsky on Monday night, President Clinton is hoping, as he
has so many times in the past, that the public will respond with
forgiveness and not disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The president, relying on polls and his own sense of the
public's weariness with a sordid story of presidential sex, took a
calculated gamble that he can escape indictment by prosecutors or
impeachment by lawmakers over what he declared was a private
matter. In his testimony and his testy four-minute speech to the
nation, he offered partial admissions but refused to answer many of
the questions that have swamped his presidency since January.
</P>
<P>
   And almost before he finished his grudging televised confession,
he turned on his inquisitors and demanded that the investigation of
his private life come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is time _ in fact it is past time _ to move on,'' the
president said with anger, not anguish, in his eyes, laying the
blame for seven months of national trauma on his political enemies
and Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, I was wrong. But they drove me to it.
</P>
<P>
   He left no doubt that his strategy was the same as it has been
for the past seven months: Fight, fight, fight.
</P>
<P>
   The president sacrificed some of the dignity of his exalted
office by admitting a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was ``not
appropriate.'' But he said the investigation that cornered him was
even more destructive than his private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many
innocent people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He sought to justify his misleading testimony and his months of
resistance to federal prosecutors as a fitting response to a
politically inspired invasion of his and his family's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also counting on a continued strong economy and the
forbearance of a public aware that he was a less than faithful
husband even as they were twice electing him to the nation's
highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even presidents have private lives,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   But he was largely silent on the more serious charges he faces _
conspiracy, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and suborning
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   His words of apology and contrition were belied by a tone that
was laced with anger and, in an important way, unrepentant. He said
that he has been subjected to an invasion of privacy by Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, that no American citizen should
have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   His four and a half hours of questioning by Starr and three of
his deputies was hostile and only added to the anger the president
and his top aides feel about Starr's intrusive inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lead private counsel, David Kendall, signaled
the continuing hostility between the two sides in a brief statement
in the White House driveway after the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that the president's testimony will finally
bring closure to the independent counsel's more than four-year and
over $40 million investigation, which has culminated in an
investigation of the president's private life,'' the ordinarily
mild-mannered Kendall said with evident contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said later that Clinton had refused to answer many of
Starr's questions and that, while candid, the president was
defiantly less than complete in many of his responses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's limited expression of contrition was only part of an
emerging White House strategy to continue fighting Starr on broad
legal and political fronts. An ambiguous public apology is just one
weapon in the Clinton arsenal honed in the snows of New Hampshire
in 1992 when Clinton was first forced to confront allegations of
marital infidelity from Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has privately raged at Starr over the past seven months,
believing he is a Republican partisan and a blue-nosed moralist
prying into the president's private behavior. He has dispatched a
dozen sharp-tongued aides and defenders to demonize Starr and
question the legitimacy of his investigation. That explains his
long refusal to voluntarily answer Starr's questions about the
Lewinsky matter and the scorched-earth legal strategy he has
pursued to delay his date with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, began calling
leading Democrats within minutes of the end of Clinton's grand jury
session, coordinating a political counteroffensive. The Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who counseled the Clinton family, appeared on television
Monday night to hammer Starr for intruding on the private lives of
the president, his wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone thought Bill Clinton would come away from this
experience deeply humbled and considering resignation, they were
wrong. He will fight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most difficult day in office is now behind him. What
now lies ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Reagan after the Iran-Contra debacle, Clinton
cannot simply confess error, shoulder responsibility and dismiss a
handful of top aides. In the Lewinsky matter, the fault was not in
the president's policy, but in himself. It is vastly harder to
repair a reputation than to repudiate a failed policy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the investigation by Starr is far from over. Whatever
errors or evasions Clinton admitted Monday must be weighed in light
of voluminous evidence collected over seven months that the
prosecutor may believe add up to the ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' standard for impeachment set by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to Starr how to portray the president's actions and
his words in a report expected to be delivered to Congress this
fall. But however the president is ultimately judged by Congress,
he must also confront the judgment of the citizenry, which has thus
far been indulgent of its wayward president while also finding his
personal standards of morality and honesty distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   His job approval ratings actually rose in the early days of the
scandal and have remained in the mid-60s. But a growing proportion
of the public came to believe he was stingy with the truth, a fatal
affliction for a politician with ambitions for a legacy among the
top ranks of American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Lewinsky saga would be little more than a sordid
national soap opera if the stakes were not so great. Many observers
believe that the Serbs in Kosovo, Saddam Hussein in Iraq and
perhaps even the terrorists who attacked U.S. Embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania were emboldened by a perceived power vacuum at the
White House. ``It is no coincidence,'' said a top-ranking official
of the State Department, ``that the really bad guys of the world,
like Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein, have picked this summer
to cause the United States trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And the American people, enjoying economic bounty and 20-year,
record-low gasoline prices, have sacrificed a measure of national
pride because of the sex-stained spectacle playing out in
Washington this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal has prevented people from feeling better about
the country because the principal complaint about the country is
its moral climate,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   And despite recent polling that indicates the American people
are willing to once again forgive the president his trespasses if
he confesses, Kohut said the public verdict is not so certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has the last and often a counter-intuitive word on
issues like this,'' Kohut said. ``The public is not so predictable
and the impact on the president and the presidency I think is yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he falls from grace, we will look for someone with grace to
replace him in 2000,'' Kohut concluded. ``It will be the equivalent
of Jimmy Carter in 1976, a search for character.''

WILL WOMEN SUPPORTERS STILL STAND BEHIND CLINTON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEAN BUCHANAN AND MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   ( Kansas City, Mo. ) _ For better. For
worse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For seven months, many American women have stuck with President
Clinton. He may have broken his vows to his wife, they said, but he
was faithful to causes important to them.
</P>
<P>
   And at least some said they did not care what Clinton told a
grand jury Monday. They like his policies; they want the
investigation to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little embarrassed, sure,'' Kansas resident Elizabeth
Appelbaum said about the allegations about Clinton. ``But he's not
my husband, and he's not my preacher either, and I wish he hadn't
done it, but I really don't care very deeply about his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care very much about what issues he's pushing and what
issues he's not pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, of course, whether the loyalty will last.
But for years, and through many allegations, women have been core
supporters of Clinton. They voted for him in 1996 by a 55-37
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Many women like Clinton because of his appointments. He gave the
nation its highest-ranking woman government official ever:
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. He named the first woman
attorney general: Janet Reno. He has supported family leave, a
higher minimum wage, abortion rights _ all issues many women
consider important.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in fact, one Kansas City woman had had enough of the
investigation. Ernestine Davis, a retired Kansas City
schoolteacher, turned off her television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We elected a president, not a pope,'' she said. ``And I look
at how people are working, and how the government has made attempts
to be for people, rather than for the elite....I think this has
been one big effort to get Clinton because he's been too fair to
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime backers of the president are troubled, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Clinton's policies, what he's done,'' said Judith L.
Zillner, an investment planner with Berthel Fisher &AMP; Co. ``But I'm
uneasy with his personal conduct. His conduct diminishes the office
of the presidency, and people need to believe in something. They
need to believe in their president and their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people were still sorting out their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women...are most interested in how good a job he's
doing,'' said Jackson County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill, a
Democratic candidate for state auditor in Missouri. ``But we all
want to admire him as a man, as well _ and this makes it very hard
to admire the man. This is just embarrassing. It's embarrassing to
him, to the office, to his family, to my party and to women, who've
supported him so strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people, however, knew exactly how they felt, including
those who have never backed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay Culp, the former head of Missouri Right to Life, said
her lack of faith in him has been justified by the current scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What angers me is that Gennifer Flowers' whole story came out
before he was elected,'' she said. ``We had the warning signs on
this behavior, and we ignored them. And because we ignored those
signs, we elected a president who has torn down the image of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   A recurring theme among Clinton's women supporters, however, is
that his sex life is not the business of anyone but Clinton and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a witch hunt by (independent counsel Kenneth)
Starr and the Republicans, and a waste of taxpayer money,'' said
Kathy Reed, president of the Kansas City Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has been a Clinton supporter from the beginning. She likes
his beliefs and actions on education.

   ``What Bill Clinton has been able to do for this country far
outweighs any problems he might have in his personal life,'' she
said. ``And make no mistake, this is his personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Lockhart of Leawood, Kansas coordinator for the National
Organization for Women, said women don't applaud extramarital
affairs, but most recognize that they happen.
</P>
<P>
   She said she does not defend him on the issue, but ``most
people, we want to mind our own business. We don't want to know
about their sex lives, and we don't want them to know about our sex
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Micheline Burger of Lenexa, who is chairwoman of the
Democratic Party in Johnson County and practices family law in
Olathe, agreed. She thinks Clinton's private life is the business
of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's taken seriously the issues that women feel
strongly about, that families feel strongly about,'' Burger said.
``Protecting children, protecting the elderly, protecting the
Social Security trust fund...those things are important to me and
to women in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue being investigated is sex, said Mary O'Halloran,
co-host of ``Talk Back'' radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not sexual harassment,'' she said. ``This is not a
crime, and I won't stop supporting this president until I see
evidence that his actions were criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran said she would be surprised to see a decrease in
Clinton's popularity among women because ``he is the strongest
advocate for women ever to sit in the White House, without a
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``Whether his support among women will hold if
the news continues to splatter this story across the front page for
another six months, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is dismay about the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every living person is full of contradictions, I know that,''
said Zillner, the investment planner. ``But he is the president,
and he's supposed to work hard to be above these things.''

MICKELSON WINS SHORTENED PEBBLE BEACH GOLF TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ It took Phil Mickelson more than six
months to win the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. But for a
$450,000 first-place check, plus a $100,000 bonus for being the PGA
Tour's top winner on the West Coast this year, it was worth the
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Winning under the most unusual circumstances of his career,
Mickelson captured the rain-plagued Pebble Beach event Monday,
which was completed more than six months after it started. The
tournament, shortened to 54 holes, was originally scheduled to end
Feb. 1, before Mark O'Meara had won a major and long before Monica
Lewinsky had appeared before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But when heavy rains washed out play on Feb. 1 and Feb. 2,
tournament officials and the PGA Tour took an unusual step. Instead
of the tournament being canceled, as it was in 1996, play was
suspended after 36 holes, and the third round was rescheduled for
March 1, the day after the Nissan Open outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But that plan did not work either. It became obvious a few weeks
before March 1 that the courses at Pebble Beach, drenched by El
Nino, still would not be ready. So the tournament was suspended
again until Monday, the day after the PGA Championship in Redmond,
Wash., allowing players to fly from Seattle to California on Sunday
night in time to play Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All of that led to Monday's bizarre scene _ players spread out
over three courses, no grandstands, no television towers, a gallery
not even one-fifth as large as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for Mickelson, it was a great day to play 18. He shot a
5-under-par 67 at Pebble Beach to finish at 14 under par for the
tournament, one stroke better than Tom Pernice, who shot a 67 at
Poppy Hills. Jim Furyk, who shot a 68 at Pebble Beach, and J.P.,
Hayes, who shot a 67 at Poppy Hills, finished tied for third at 12
under.
</P>
<P>
   Was the return trip to Pebble Beach worth it for Mickelson? Let
him count the ways. Not only did Mickelson receive the $450,000
first-place check, but he captured the $100,000 ``King of the
Swing'' bonus put up by Bank of America, given for the first time
to the tour's West Coast leading money-winner. Mickelson, who also
won the Mercedes Championships in January, won $771,450 on the West
Coast this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me see if I got this right,'' said Mickelson, who captured
his 13th career victory at the age of 28. ``Vijay wins the PGA
yesterday and wins $540,000, and I just won $550,000? It's a cool
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was, but at least it wasn't raining. Playing under the
same lift, clean and place rules that were in place when the
tournament began in January, the competitors were able to give
themselves good lies even from the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 166 players eligible to return Monday, 133 came back.
Among those who didn't were Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, and Vijay
Singh. But for most players, the chance to win a share of the purse
was too enticing to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson clinched the victory by making a birdie on the par-5
18th hole, hitting a booming drive, then hitting one of the best
2-iron shots of his career, which carried 221 yards to the front of
the green. Mickelson 2-putted from there, and the victory helped
make up for his disappointing finish at the PGA Championship, where
he shot a 78 on Saturday and finished tied for 34th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finishing up a tournament six or seven months later, you have
to find your own momentum,'' said Mickelson. ``This should give me
something to build on going into the later part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to do one of two things, either call
it like they did in 1996, or break the field into three divisions
and split the purse,'' said Mickelson. ``But when they decided to
come back, I was ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to suspend a tournament from winter until fall
caused enough controversy to force the tour to reexamine its
weather policy. According to Pernice, the tour's policy board is
leaning toward a plan that would extend tournaments until Monday if
they cannot be finished on Sunday. If play cannot be completed
Monday, the tournament would continue until Tuesday. If play cannot
be finished Tuesday, the tournament would be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Some players may choose not to return to Pebble Beach after this
year's problems, but the tournament remains popular among most
competitors, who enjoy coming to the area, and playing on some of
the most picturesque courses anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been talk about moving the event to the fall,
when weather conditions around the Monterey Peninsula might be more
favorable. But that would require significant compromises between
local hotels, sponsors and the community.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether anything other than better luck could be done to
prevent Monday's bizarre scene from recurring, Mickelson said:
``That's really difficult, but I anticipate them holding the
tournament at the same time every year, just because it has been
that way for so many years. I'll still come. I like this event.''
