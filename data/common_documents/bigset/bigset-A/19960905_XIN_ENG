<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Declines in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
fell by 1.4 percent in July, the largest decline in five months,
U.S. Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that spending on both public and private
building projects in July totaled 554.7 billion dollars at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate after an revised increase of 0.6
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
It was the second decline in the past three months and the
biggest drop since a 2.6 percent decrease in last February. The
overall level of activity also fell to its lowest point since
February.
</P>
<P>
The construction weakness in July mainly resulted from a 1.1
percent decline in new housing units, the biggest percentage drop
in this category since a 1.6 percent drop in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Spending on residential construction was down to an annual rate
of 244 billion dollars. Single-home construction edged down a
slight 0.1 percent in July but construction of multi-family units
plunged by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spending on non-residential construction fell by 3.5 percent to
an annual rate of 132.3 billion. The decline in non-residential
construction was seen in most categories such as factories,
offices, hotels, schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Public construction also dropped by 0.9 percent in July to an
annual rate of 139.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists have for some time been forecasting that the
construction activity would cool this year under the impact of
rising long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) passed up the chance to raise
interest rates at its meeting in July and August, but many
economists believe the Fed would hike rates when it meets again on
September 24.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Diplomat Denounces U.S. Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi ambassador to Athens
today denounced the new U.S. missile attacks on targets in Iraq,
describing Americans as "the new criminals of the modern age" and
"policemen of world disorder."
</P>
<P>
Issam Saud Khalil told the press at the Iraqi embassy that the
political behavor of the United States was unlawful. He charged
Washington with having arbitrarily imposed an economic blockade on
his country for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Washington was continuing the same tactics with other countries
such as Cuba, Iran and Libya, without having secured the consent
of the United Nations, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Khalil stressed that Iraq was an independent state with its own
culture and history, and it knew how to respect the ethnic groups
living on its territory.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq was not threatening any other state but on the
contrary was itself being threatened. He claimed the the
U.S. missile strikes of the moment were an election ruse by
President Clinton aimed at increasing his popularity by
displaying "Machiavellian ferocity."
</P>
<P>
The United States announced on Tuesday evening that it had
fired cruise missiles at Iraqi air defense sites for the second
time in 24 hours. A total of 17 cruise missiles were fired in the
strike from three U.S. warships and one submarine, all in the
Gulf, said Pentagon sources.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ambassador also described as "illegal" Tuesday's
decision by the U.S. to extend a no-fly zone for Iraqi aircraft in
southern Iraq almost to Baghdad. Washington did not win approval
for this from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not believe the U.S., "assisted by the British,"
would stop their attacks, "since their aim is not to protect the
Kurds but to control the region, and espionage."

<HEADLINE> IRS Auditing Gingrich's Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials at two Georgia
colleges were reported to have confirmed that the Internal Revenue
Service is conducting an audit of U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's college course.
</P>
<P>
A separate investigation of the course is already being
conducted by the House ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
The IRS division that audits tax-exempt organizations has
contacted the Kennesaw State University Foundation at Kennesaw
State University and Reinhardt College, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's "Renewing American Civilization" lectures were
conducted at Reinhardt, a private college, in 1994 and 1995. He
began the course at Kennesaw in the fall of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The audit focuses on whether the course, which was financed by
tax-deductible donations, met IRS rules for tax-exempt activities.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has denied repeatedly that the course ran afoul of IRS
or House rules.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's course was financed by tax-exempt donations that
were sent to the Kennesaw foundation and the Progress and Freedom
Foundation, a conservative think tank run by Gingrich's allies.
</P>
<P>
Employees who worked for Gingrich's political action committee,
GOPAC, had switched over to the foundations and solicited money
for the course.
</P>
<P>
Ethics complaints filed by a Gingrich rival, former Democratic
Rep. Ben Jones of Georgia, alleged that the course was not a
legitimate tax-exempt educational activity. Rather, Jones
contended, it was a GOPAC political activity designed to recruit
Republican activists.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today called
upon the United States to immediately stop launching any further
attacks against Iraq.

<P>
The statement was issued in the wake of the U.S. missile
strikes Tuesday against air defense targets in southern Iraq.

"We also call upon Iraq to refrain from engaging in further
military action in the Kurdish areas which might provoke an
aggravation of the situation," Badawi said.

<P>
Malaysia would also like to appeal to the other countries
concerned not to interfere in Kurdish affairs in order to avoid
further complication in the resolution of the Kurdish issue, he
said.
</P>

so that the present hardship endured by the Iraqi people is not
further prolonged, he said.

<HEADLINE> France to Adopt New Measures against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The French government will
announce on November 20 a series of new measure to combat sexual
abuse of children, French Justice Minister Jacques Toubon and
State Secretary of Emergency Humanitarian Action Xavier Emmanuelli
announced today.
</P>
<P>
These measures will push ahead a national campaign of
prevention of sexual abuse of children organized by the Ministry
of Social Affairs, as well as to strengthen aid programs for the
victims of sexual abuse, said Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
The government will also create a "permanent structure" to
help some families through "medical and psychological aid" and
provide them with cares and ways to reintegrate with the society,
said the state secretary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a draft law will be adopted by the government to
strengthen the fight against sexual exploitation of children and
teenagers below 18, and to toughen the laws against pornography
and sexual tourism involving child sex.
</P>
<P>
Toubon said that the government adopted in 1994 an
extraterritorial law which allows French police to arrest a French
citizen abroad on charges of sexual abuse of children.
</P>
<P>
But the law is little applied due to lack of its publicity, he
said, adding that the government is training magistrates in this
field.
</P>
<P>
France has legally fixed November 20 as the national day of the
rights of children, which coincides with the anniversary of the
creation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
Children.

<HEADLINE> Archives with Largest Number of Mao's Badges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A red flag, a sickle, a map of
China, a star and a heart are some of the designs made from nearly
400 badges featuring the likeness of late Chinese Chairman Mao
Zedong.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which is on display at the ongoing International
Congress on Archives in Beijing, is part of the collection of
Mao's badges from the provincial archives in northwest China's
Qinghai Province. The archives has a total of 20,124 of Mao's
badges in more than 4,000 styles.
</P>
<P>
Wei Zhi, director of the Qinghai Provincial Achives, said that
his archives has the largest number of Mao's badges among China's
3,662 archives collections.
</P>
<P>
The badges, made of aluminium, bamboo, plastics, glass, and
pottery, were stored in small boxes that were kept in some 30
two-meter-high iron cabinets.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, the badges were ordered by the Qinghai
Provincial Revolutionary Committee during the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976), when it was the fashion in China to wear Mao badges.
</P>
<P>
The provincial archives began collecting the badges in the
early 1980s, and sorted out some to display in Qinghai at the end
of 1991.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the largest collector of Mao's badges
is a private collector in Hunan, Mao's homeland, who has collected
and owns more than 50,000 badges.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Body's Letter on Trawlers' Dispute with Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits of the Mainland today expressed its
regret over reports by some Taiwan-based newspapers regarding the
recent dispute caused by the tangled nets of two fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan, the
Mainland body wants to make it clear that the dispute has been
settled.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, on the morning of August 19, the
fishing nets of the "Zhecangyu 3247" trawler of the mainland and
the "Yonghongfa 33" trawler of Taiwan became entangled, causing
severe damage to the net of the former.
</P>
<P>
Another trawler from Taiwan, "Longsheng 101," struck the
Mainland boat, which caused six mainland crewmen and the captain
of the "Yonghongfa 33," Yang Xizong, to fall overboard.
</P>
<P>
The seven were later rescued by the "Zhecangyu 3319" mainland
boat, and were brought back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, Yang paid 215,000 yuan in compensation to the
"Zhecangyu 3247" under an agreement reached by the two sides on
August 25. Yang left for Taiwan after that.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwan-based newspapers' reports of the issue were
inaccurate, the letter says.

<HEADLINE> Workers End Strike With Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, Septebmber 4 (Xinhua) -- Striking Zimbabwean civil
servants grudgingly returned to work today and union leaders
warned the strike will resume unless the government opens
negotiations on outstanding grievances by September 27.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of government workers gathered at Harare's Africa
Unity Square to be briefed by members of the unified civil
service negotiating committee on the outcome of Tuesday's
marathon talks with Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare
Minister Florence Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
Similar briefings were held in various centers thoughout the
country this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro last night said cabinet had rescinded an order
dismissing the workers who staged the 16-day strike that crippled
essential government services.
</P>
<P>
She also threatened to dismiss all workers who would not have
returned to work today.
</P>
<P>
The government last week conceded it had erred by awarding the
majority of the 161,000 civil servants less than 10 percent in
salary increases and agreed to add another 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the civil servants were not happy with the government
decision to withhold pay for the period they had been on strike.
</P>
<P>
Member of the negotiating committee Farai Jiya said the
committee was also disappointed to hear that cabinet had not seen
the urgency of the need to address workers' grievances outlined
in a seven-point document submitted to Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
The seven demands included increases in various allowances, a
unified labor law encompassing all workers, including civil
servants, and a 40-hour working week with anything beyond that
being treated as overtime.
</P>
<P>
However, as the meeting in Harare broke up in disorder with
the majority of workers apparently disappointed, the leaders
continued to exhort the workers to return to work.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have put the cost of the strike at over 100 million
U.S. Dollars in uncollected government revenue, while hundreds of
people could have died due to lack of care in government
hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Robben Island to Be World Heritage Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Robben
Island, once the home of political and common-law prisoners
including President Nelson Mandela, would be developed as a world
heritage site and a national monument and museum.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town today, Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology Minister Lionel Mtshali said the political
wing of the prison would be converted into a museum of the
freedom struggle.
</P>
<P>
This followed cabinet approval of the recommendations of the
future of a Robben Island committee chaired by presidential
adviser Ahmed Kathrada.
</P>
<P>
Mtshali said the recommendations would ensure the island
becomes a cultural and conservation showcase for the new South
Africa, while maximizing its economic, tourism and educational
potential.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, 1997, the department of art, culture, science
and technology would become the island's new controlling
authority, taking over responsibility from correctional services.
</P>
<P>
However, the cabinet stressed that the island's special
history should be taken into account during the planning and
development process and the incoming governing council should
comprise representatives of ex-political prisoners and the
president's office.
</P>
<P>
The island itself would be run as a site museum, where the
total environment will be conserved in line with international
conservation approaches.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, any long-term development should be
systematic, facilitated by a suitably qualified agency, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The two largest parties in
India, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress party,
today criticized the US missile attacks against Iraq, the Press
Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
A senior BJP leader said that it was a "strange thesis that
self-proclaimed US vital interests can override national interests
of any nation in the world."
</P>
<P>
"If the United States finds as unacceptable the conduct of
Iraqi forces within Iraq, how can it justify the conduct of US
forces carrying out missile attack on Iraq," he asked, adding that
the attack was "completely unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress party today also described the US air
raids on Iraq as "deplorable."
</P>
<P>
V.N. Gadgil, spokesman for the party, said that the U.N.
machinery and non-aligned movement should be activated to ensure
that situation does not worsen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. F-16 Fires Missiles at Iraqi Radar Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air force F-16
launched a missile against an Iraqi Radar site on Wednesday and
the site is "no longer operational", an administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came hours after the Pentagon said its back-to-back
bombardments of southern Iraq had "sufficiently reduced" the risk
to allied pilots enforcing the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
"We fired a HARM missile. The site is no longer operational."
The official said.
</P>
<P>
Neither the time nor location of the attack could be
determined. It was not clear whether the aircraft his a site in
the newly expanded no-fly zone now being patrolled by U.S.
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It was said the radar site was attacked after it was determined
that the radar had been tracking the American aircraft and was
preparing to fire a surface-to-air missile.
</P>
<P>
A HARM missile is a high-speed anti-radiation weapon that homes
in on a radar signal.
</P>
<P>
The rules of engagement allow U.S. aircraft to respond
immediately with a strike against a radar site if they believe the
Iraqis are tracking them for a potential attack.
</P>
<P>
The strike was the third by U.S. forces against Iraqi targets
in the last two days. In the first two strikes, 44 cruise missiles
were fired against 15 Iraqi sites, all in southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Lebanon Discuss US Missile Strike at Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri held today discussions with Syrian Vice President Abdel
Halim Khaddam in Damascus on the U.S. missile strike at Iraq, the
state-run Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The LNNA reported that the previously unannounced visit by
Hariri to the Syrian capital came only hours after the
U.S. launched a second wave of cruise missiles at a number of
military targets in southern Iraq which survived the first attack
on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon said the missile strike was aimed at destroying
President Saddam Hussein's military ability to attack aircraft
enforcing the expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted official sources in the Syrian capital as
saying that the talk between Hariri and Khaddam dealt with "the
position deriving from the American bombardment of Iraq and its
impacts on the whole situation in the region."
</P>
<P>
The position was considered "proceeding from the Lebanese and
Syrian desire over Iraq's unity and sovereignty and over a lift
of the ban on Iraq under which the Iraqi people are suffering,"
the LNNA added.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also dealt with bilateral relations and "the
results of the contacts conducted by Damascus and Beirut on the
future of the peace process and the situations in the Arab world
since the Cairo Arab summit (held in June)."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. missile strike against Iraq was also the focus of a
telephone contact between Hariri and Esmat Abdul-Meguid,
Secretary General of the Arab League, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said Tuesday night that
his government was "following with concern the recent
developments taking place in Iraq, fearing that these developments
could lead to another war in the region."
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping for a stop of the violence to avoid its political
and security effects on the region", the Lebanese foreign
minister pointed out, noting that "a re-eruption of the volcanos
is not in anyone's interest."
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has been at odds with Iraq for nearly two
decades, condemned the attack, saying it threatened Iraq's
unity.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of targets in Iraq constitutes a threat to the
unity of Iraq and its regional safety and increases the
suffering of the Iraqi people," a Syrian foreign ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It (the bombing) contradicts the United Nations charter and
international laws which protect the unity and sovereignty of
countries and reject the interference in internal affairs,"
the spokesman said.

LUANDA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of Angola
and Namibia stated here today that deepening their bilateral ties
would help foster political stability and economic development in
the southern African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in a press conference held here
by Angolan Prime Minister Franca Van-Dunem and his Namibian
counterpart, Hage Geingob, who is on his three-day official trip
to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a Namibian prime minister pays
an official visit to neighboring Angola which has been torn
apart by years of civil war but is at present on its way toward
national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stressed that Namibia and Angola would step up
cooperation in various economic sectors, especially in fishery,
water resources and irrigation, noting that the optimistic peace
prospect in Angola has made regional economic cooperation
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian prime minister also urged the Angolan government
to devote more efforts to helping foster national reconciliation
and political stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Geingob, who had held wide-range talks with the Angolan
government officials, also invited the Angolan prime minister to

PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- France confirmed this afternoon
that its combat aircraft joined the "Southern Watch" patrol over
southern Iraq this morning, but said that the French aircraft flew

</P>
<P>
The participation of French Mirage 2000 combat aircraft in the

<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting,
Netanyahu said that the two leaders "reiterated the commitments
to the signed agreements and the determination to carry out
the implementation."
</P>
<P>
"However," he added. "I'd like to emphasize that we have to
take into account the needs and requirements on the basis of
reciprocity and ensuring of the security and wellbeing of both
Israelis and Palestinians alike."
</P>
<P>
The hardline Likud leader, whose policies have cast a heavy
shadow on the peace process since taking over power in June,
denied that he tried to break the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that our position is to not only move
forward the peace process, but also improve the prosperity and
economic conditions of the Palestinian population," he said. "We
think peace and prosperity go hand in hand, and I believe we can
achieve both goals for the benefit of both peoples."
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "positive", Arafat praised Netanyahu
for agreeing to hold the meeting that would increase mutual
cooperation to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the commitments to the signed agreements on the
part of the Palestinian National Authority were "unchangeable".
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we and Mr. Netanyahu and his government
can work together to advance the peace process," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
In a reconciliating gesture, Arafat mentioned that it was
former Likud premier Yitzhak Shamir who started the Madrid
peace process. He offered his congratulations to Netanyahu for
his "great choice" of continuing peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the differences remained apparent as both leaders
agreed to leave all major disputes to discussions by the
joint steering committee, which is expected to formally start
soon.
</P>
<P>
Among the major disputes are the issues of Hebron redeployment,
expansion of Jewish settlements and the status of
Jerusalem. Reports said that the issue of Israeli troops'
redeployment from Hebron was the cause behind the delay of this
meeting, which was supposed to take place a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have withdrawn its troops from most of
Hebron by late March under the signed Oslo accords, but the
former Labor government froze the move after a series of
terrorist attacks from late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government has recently demanded revising Hebron
pullback plan, which is strongly opposed by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was hurriedly arranged after top negotiators
from the two sides held last-minute discussions to overcome
some sticking points.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the UN coordinator in the territories
Terje Larsen, Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat
had been holding secret talks with Netanyahu's close aide Dore
Gold in the past weeks to reach initial understandings to
pave the way for the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was forced to change his previous position as
pressure mounted recently on him to hold this meeting as
Israeli-Palestinian ties deteriorated quickly recently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton also threatened to
cancel a visit to Washington next week by Netanyahu if he
failed to meet Arafat by then.
</P>
<P>
To express his anger about the deadlock of the peace process
and Netanyahu's apparent snub of him, Arafat called for
large-scale protests last week to protest Israel's hardline
policies of expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
as well as cracking down PNA activities in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of the renewal of Palestinian armed struggle
against Israel if it continued its provocative policies.
</P>
<P>
Although the first meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat is
largely symbolic, it has at least broken the ice on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which is now finally back
on track.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Guinea Bissau Foreign Minister
Delfim Da Costa arrived here today on a week-long United Nations
peace mission in war-torn Angola which has reached the final
stage of its peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after meeting Angolan President Eduardo
Dos Santos, Da Costa said he would be devoted to stepping up the
peace process in Angola as Guinea Bissau is the current chairman
of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Da Costa, who delivered a personal letter to Dos Santos from
Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira, said he would meet
all the conflicting sides and all works of life in the Angolan
society to report what he sees and hears to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Guinea Bissau minister is expected to hold talks with U.N.
Special Envoy in Angola Blondin Beye. He is also scheduled to
meet Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
Angola's peace process is reaching a critical point when the
government and the UNITA are planning to establish a unified army
and a coalition government as the disarmament of the former UNITA
rebels has nearly been completed.
</P>
<P>
But there are still a host of problems to be solved before the
country realizes national reconciliation and peace.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Savimbi has made clear that he himself would
not accept the post of vice-president in the new government but
would instead send another senior UNITA official for the
position.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fires Missiles at Iraqi Radar Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq twice challenged
allied patrols of the newly expanded "no-fly" zone Wednesday and a
U.S. jetfighter responded by attacking an Iraqi radar site, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"These actions, plus the cruise missile strikes, demonstrate we
will take whatever actions necessary to enforce the 'no-fly'
zone," U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said.
</P>
<P>
Hostile radar from the SAM site "illuminated one of our planes
and we fired a HARM missile at that radar. The radar stopped
illuminating," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
He said that two Mig jet fighters had "approached our planes
from the north" of the no-fly zone, but that they had both been
"turned back before they got to 33 degrees north."
</P>
<P>
The confrontations were the first indication that Saddam
Hussein was challenging U.S. enforcement of the expanded no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
However, Perry said he had seen some signs that Iraq was
responding to the U.S. show of force.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have observed "a general pullback of Iraqi
forces in the north," and that more than half the Iraqi Mig jets
stationed at airbases in the south had moved north, Perry said at
a joint appearance with British Defense Minister Michael Portillo.
</P>
<P>
Still, he said more than 40,000 troops remained in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Perry said, "Our operational forces, pilots in particular, are
prepared for serious challenges, and I am confident they can meet
these challenges."
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday the United States has launched three attacks on
Iraqi targets, the first two with cruise missiles aimed at
air-defense sites and the third at a mobile radar facility.
</P>
<P>
U.S. allies have had a mixed response to the strikes against
Iraq. France and Russia said they would have favored diplomacy,
but Britain has been supportive.
</P>
<P>
The strike was the third by U.S. forces against Iraqi targets
in the last two days. In the first two strikes, 44 cruise missiles
were fired against 15 sites, all in southern Iraq. The second
round, late Tuesday night, was described as a "mop-up operation"
against four of the sites.
</P>
<P>
Air Force General Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, declined to say whether all 15 targets had been
destroyed, but said Saddam's defenses had been reduced enough so
that allied pilots enforcing the no-fly zone would not be
threatened.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced after the initial cruise
missile attack that the air exclusion zone would be expanded about
60 miles further north, to the 33rd parallel. That would take it
to the suburbs of Baghdad, where a defiant Saddam ordered his
armed forces to shoot down any foreign aircraft in Iraqi airspace.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemn New U.S. Missile Attack against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4(Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
criticized the new missile attack against military sites in Iraq
by the U.S. armed forces earlier today and called for a political
settlement of the crisis, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received by the Interfax, the Russian government
pointed out that the strikes create "additional difficulties in
transferring the current crisis to a course of political
decisions."
</P>
<P>
It expressed concern over the ongoing escalation of tension and
underlines that "any military operations inside and surrounding
Iraq should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
"Russia persistently calls on all parties to reject the logic
of force and to take the path of political settlement in the
current crisis situation," the government said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that "Washington is in fact claiming the role of
supreme arbiter, virtually trying to replace the (U.N.) Security
Council, which, in line with the U.N. charter, has the exclusive
right to sanction the use of force.
</P>
<P>
"The unilaterally adopted decision of the United States and
Great Britain to expand the 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq should
be viewed in this context," the government said, noting that "such
actions, which create dangerous precedents, contradict
international law and are unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, the Russian government issued a statement
as its first official reaction denouncing the U.S. missile strikes
on Iraq, saying: "Russia insists on a cessation of all military
actions in Iraq threatening the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of this country."
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Kuntsevich, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences
and a consultant on chemical weapons to the U.N.
Secretary-General, said the U.S. strikes against Iraq may lead to
leaks of poisonous and bacteriological substances into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
He said chemical weapons and bacteriological substances may
still be stored in Iraq because a U.N. mission to disarm Iraq has
not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
The strikes thus create a risk of chemical damage not only for
civilians but U.S. troops as well, he said, adding that he had
information that some U.S. troops suffered from poisonous leaks
into atmosphere during the operation Desert Storm about five years
ago, when the United States also carried out air strikes against
Iraqi military facilities.
</P>
<P>
The United States on early Tuesday launched one of the biggest
military strikes against Iraq since the Gulf War, firing 27 cruise
missiles at targets in southern Iraq in response to Iraqi attacks
on Kurds in the north. Earlier today, the U.S. military forces
launched two waves of missiles strikes against Iraq, according to
reports reaching here.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Urges Dialog Between Hutus and Tutsis In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- East African leaders
indicated that they will not review the sanctions they imposed on
Burundi to force the Pierre Buyoya administration to return to
normal until they see dialog between the Hutus and the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by former Tanzanian leader Julius Nyerere
in a press conference here today. Nyerere, who is mediating
between the two communities, arrived in Kenya this morning to
brief President Daniel arap Moi on the Burundi situation.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere told the press that the leaders had decided on three
conditions that have to be fulfilled by the Burundi
administration which came to power in a coup in July. The three
conditions are restoration of parliament, the unbanning of
political parties and serious negotiations between the Hutus and
the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
However, Julius Nyerere said serious dialog between the two
communities is the most important of the three conditions the
East African leaders have imposed for the review of the economic
embargo on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said even while political parties and parliament were
in existence before the coup, the two communities made no effort
at serious dialog to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nyerere urged both the rebel Hutus and the
Buyoya-led Tutsis to stop killings. enditem

<HEADLINE> Lloyd's Recovery Plan Approved by UK Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- British government today gave
its consent for setting up a substantial reinsurance company,
Equitas, to proceed unconditionally with the reinsurance of the
1992 and prior liabilities of Lloyd's London syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Full authorization for Equitas by the Department of Trade and
Industry would mark the end of the 308-year-old insurance market's
struggle to secure its financial future.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's was brought to the brink of collapse by combination of
catastrophic losses, incompetence and negligence on the part of
some agents, which contributed to 8 billion pounds (12 billion
U.S. dollars) of losses over the five years to the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the new company said that although
Equitas was formed and initially owned by Lloyd's, its ownership
has now been transferred to a discretionary trust.
</P>
<P>
The seven trustees are required to act in regard to the
interests of the Lloyd's Names (individual underwriting members of
Lloyd's), whose obligations are reinsured by Equitas, it added.
</P>
<P>
David Newbigging, chairman of Equitas, said in the press
release "Equitas has a duty to Names and to policyholders. We are
conscious of our obligations and we look forward to the challenges
ahead with confidence and enthusiasm."
</P>
<P>
Michael Crall, chief executive officer of Equitas, pointed out
the Equitas is designed to run-off the liabilities it has
reinsured in a fair, efficient and sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
"Equitas is a solution to the problems of the Lloyd's market
arising from past underwriting losses. Equitas aims to provide
claims management and run-off management services which, we hope
will become a model for the insurance industry," he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu-Arafat Handshaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- With a historic handshaking,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat today took a major step toward breaking the deep
ice on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Despite a long delay and all dramas, the first face-to-face
meeting between the two former rivals has cleared the heavy shadow
over the peace process since Netanyhau took office in June.
</P>
<P>
They both pledged to push forward the stalled peace process
based on the signed agreements and resolve all differences
through negotiations within the framework of the Joint Steering
Committee.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, this was also the first recognition of
Arafat by a leader from the rightwing Likud party, which has long
adopted anti-Palestinian hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
In a reconciliatory gesture to Netanyahu, the hardline Likud
leader, Arafat mentioned that it was former Likud hardline
premier Yitzahak Shamir who started the Madrid peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu came to today's meeting not out of his own
will but rather of the pressure that continued mounting recently
from inside and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, trying to keep to his campaign promise, has long
shunned Arafat although promising to continue the peace
process. During the campaign for May elections, he vowed never to
meet with Arafat, whom he charged with harboring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It was not until last week that Netanyahu had been forced to
drop his arrogant attitude toward Arafat when the
Israeli-Palestinian ties plunged into the greatest crisis since
the two sides made peace in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Netanyahu's policies of expanding Jewish
settlements and clamping down on Palestinian activities in East
Jerusalem, Arafat called on Palestinians to stage a general
strike last Thursday and protest prayers in East Jerusalem a day
later. He also warned of the renewal of Intifada, or Arab
uprising, to oppose Israeli hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
At the home front, besides criticism from the opposition Labor
and Meretz parties, some members of his own ruling faction also
called on Netanyahu to meet Arafat earlier to save the peace
process before too late.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton aslo threatened to
cancel a visit by Netanyahu next Monday if he refused to meet
Arafat by then.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the untiring efforts by UN coordinator in the
territories Terje Larsen, who facilitated the 1993 Oslo peace
accord, top negotiators from the two sides overcame the obstacles
for the Netanyhau-Arafat meeting through marathon talks which
lasted till the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The first handshaking between Netanyahu and Arafat is symbolic
rather than substantial, because none of the major disputes has
been solved, including the thorny issues of Hebron redeployment,
status of Jerusalem and expansion of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is a major push to the peace process as the
ice has been broken. Despite the expected more turns and twists
in future formal negotiations, which are to follow up soon, the
peace train is finally back on track.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The General Command of the
Iraqi Armed Forces today condemned the U.S. for dispatching spy
planes to carry out reconnaissance over Iraq, terming it as an
"aggressive act."
</P>
<P>
The General Command said in a statement that the U.S. spy
planes took off from Saudi Arabian and Turkish territories to
provide information on land and military facilities in south Iraq
in a bid to maintain its "aggressive operations" against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the statement carried today by the Iraqi news agency, the
General Command said "we are stating these facts to keep our Arab
people and the friendly Kurdish people posted, and we will take
into serious consideration the attitudes of the countries around
the world towards this American aggression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.S. cruise missiles attack since Tuesday
morning for its weekend assault on the Kurdish rebels. So far, 44
cruise missiles have been launched against Iraqi military targets
in southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Exchange Controls No Concern to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Remaining exchange
controls affecting South African individuals and companies were
of no concern to international investors to whom no restrictions
on either capital or current transactions applied, Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel said today.
</P>
<P>
During an interpellation in the National Assembly in Cape
Town, Manuel said the government was implacably committed to the
abolition of exchange controls in a systematic way and on a
responsible basis that would not unduly disrupt short-term
financial stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign invesotors never raised concerns with the authorities
about exchange controls, he said.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the gradual abolition of the remaining
exchange controls, Manuel said a number of measures had already
been implemented, including allowing South African institutional
investors to exchange part of their portfolios for foreign
securities via asset swaps.
</P>
<P>
''The Rand remains on a floating exchange rate basis and it's
important that both the spot and forward exchange rates of the
rand should reflect the underlying market conditions including
expectations about exchange rate movements,'' said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that restrictions that did exist on current
account transactions were recognised as necessary for the
effective implementation of the controls of outward investment of
resident-controlled capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Douglas Gibson and Ken Andrew, parliamentarians from
the Democratic Party, argued that by failing to lift exchange
controls Manuel was sending out signals that he had no confidence
in the rand, and was thus creating fear and uncertainty in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's local currency Rand has depreciated by about 25
percent since mid-February due to certain factors, including
speculations about the abolition of exchange controls, affecting
the financial markets. enditem

CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers will hold
an emergency session next week to discuss issues related to the
Middle East peace process, particularly the issue of Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid announced
today that the session, called by the Palestinian Authority, will
be held in conjunction with the foreign ministers' regular meeting
on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The emergency session, to be presided over by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, will also deal with Israeli measures to
Judaize Jerusalem, Abdul-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been greatly angered by Israel's decision
to expand Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories and its
demolition of a Palestinian building in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mortada, Egypt's permanent delegate to the Arab League,
said today that the foreign ministers of the 22-member Arab League
would try to evaluate the Arab-Israeli peace process in the light of
resolutions adopted at the Arab Summit last June.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Arab leaders called on Israel to continue the
Mideast peace process based on the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Mortada was quoted by Egypt's news agency MENA as saying that
only the foreign ministers from those countries that attended the

<HEADLINE> Illegals in S.Africa --  Matter of Concern: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government was most concerned about the tide of illegal
immigrants flowing into the country, Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi made the remarks during an interpellation on
emigration, requested by Frederik Van Deventer from the National
Party, in the National Assembly in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet sub-committee had been formed to investigate ways of
stemming the flow and would meet to discuss the issue on
September 18, said Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer said many South Africans were leaving the country
because they had no confidence in the future.
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer claimed that reasons for this included the
government's ineptitude and lack of decisive action on various
issues, statements by ministers undermining the criminal justice
system, and the lack of government action against illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Willem Botha, parliamentarian from the Freedom Front, also
said the government and the cabinet should take responsibility
for the situaion.
</P>
<P>
Botha said the government was not acting against the vast
numbers of illegals, who brought no benefits to South Africa and
were even a danger to the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the numbers of illegal immigrants

<HEADLINE> Swiss Economy Stalls in Its Longest Stagnation Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Swiss economy found itself
stalled in the longest stagnation period since the year 1949 with
the lastest official figures putting the growth rate for last year
at only 0.1 percent, well below a March forecast of 0.7 percent
growth, local press reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with an average growth rate of 2.8 percent for all
OECD countries (Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development) in 1995, Switzerland is lagging further behind in the
group of industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the gap between the growth rate of Switzerland and the
average of the OECD nations was only 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The current stagnation of Swiss economy began in 1990, the
longest one since the official statistics began to be compiled in
1949, the Swiss Federal Bureau for Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
Swiss economy saw declines of 0.3 percent in 1992, and 0.8
percent in 1993 respectively, followed by a one percent growth in
1994, according to the official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Syria Mediates between Rival Shiite Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Syria has mediated between two
Lebanese major rival Shiite groups, the Amal Movement and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, in a bid to avoid a possible showdown
between them in Lebanon's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam held a meeting in
Damascus, Syria, today with Amal leader Nabih Berri and Sheikh
Hassan Nasrallah, secretary general of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Syrian Chief of Staff
Maj. Gen. Hikmat Al-Chahabi, the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency (LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
On their way back home, Berri and Nasrallah were invited by
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, chief of intelligence of  Syria's
35,000-strong forces in Lebanon, to lunch in the eastern Lebanese
resort of Anjer in the Beqaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
This was the second visit by Berri, who is also the Lebanese
speaker, to the Syrian capital in 48 hours and the third in one
week.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda in today's meeting was an agreement between
the moderate Amal Movement and the fundamentalist Hezbollah on a
joint list of candidates for the fourth and fifth of a five-phase
general election in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of the election have been held separately in
Mount Lebanon, south Lebanon and Beirut on the previously three
consecutive Sundays, in which Hezbollah lost two of its current
eight seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
These three rounds constituted a nightmare for all the Islamic
fundamentalists, because of their slim chance confronting an
anti-extremist alliance headed by Berri, Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.
</P>
<P>
The Sunni billionaire prime minister, who has emerged as the
major winner in the 1996 parliamentary election, described the
election as a "battle between the moderates and extremists."
</P>
<P>
Without joining force with the Amal Movement, the prospect of
the Hezbollah would be faint in the fourth round of election on
September 8 in south Lebanon, where Berri's Amal has the majority
of supporters.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen out of 23 allocated for south Lebanon are reserved
for Shiite Moslems, with the remaining for other factions,
including two for Maronite Catholic Christians, four for Sunni
Moslems, one for Greek Orthodox Christians, two for Greek
Catholic Christians and one for the Druze.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned LNNA quoted a source close to the Shiite Amal
leader as saying that it became "something unconceivable" that it
had taken two days to forge a joint list between the Amal
movement and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The source added that the thorny issue was resolved "by
midnight" when the leaders of Amal and Hezbollah were called by
Khaddam to a meeting in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that during the meeting Berri and Nasrallah
worked out a draft agreement "out of their consciousness" that
the situation in south Lebanon did not allow any discord in the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Abdullah Gasir, chairman of Hezbollah's
Executive Committee, said today that his party would "adjust
itself to the current mediation if it meets the conditions put
forward by Hezbollah for a coalition" with Amal.
</P>
<P>
The Amal Movement founded in early 1970s, formed a coalition
with Hezbollah, which seceded from Amal in 1985, to run for the
1992 parliamentary election, the first since the end of the
country's civil war in 1990.

BAGHDAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Anti-aircraft artillery of the
Iraq army in Baghdad this evening opened fire at "hostile
targets," which have not been identified so far.
</P>
<P>
The "hostile targets," however, are believed to be missiles

</P>
<P>
At 9:10 p.m. local time, Xinhua correspondents here saw Iraqi

However, tranquility prevailed in the streets of Baghdad
despite the sounds of shells, while vehicles continued to move as
usual.
</P>

Four positions in southern Iraq were the targets earlier today

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa today expressed
their hope that rapid result would come from the meeting between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat held a meeting at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip today, the first since Netanyahu took
over power in June.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted by this first meeting. But it is not enough
just to shake hands. To lead to something is better," said de
Charette after having talks with Moussa this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the meeting would be a positive step in the
interests of peace and the two meeting sides if "practical and
positive" results are obtained.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that he shared with his Egyptian counterpart
the "same appreciation of the situation (of Mideast) which gives
us real concerns."
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that the peace process resume its course, on the
basis of the agreements already signed and the engagement made,
notably the principle of exchange of land for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt and France have a "convergence of
views" on Iraq and the peace process, and that the holding of the
3rd International Economic Conference on Mideast and North Africa,
previously scheduled for November in Cairo, should be linked with
progress of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will leave for Oslo, Norway, this evening after a
one-day visit in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The French capital has become since the beginning of September
a turntable of diplomatic activities on the Mideast.

in Paris to talk with French leaders the situation in Iraq and
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Objects to US Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian permanent delegate
to the Arab League Mahmoud Sobeih today expressed his objection to
the U.S. missile attacks on Iraq, saying that "such aggression
would escalate tension in the region."
</P>
<P>
In statements carried by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
(MENA), Sobeih called for an immediate end to U.S. strikes against
the Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
All issues should be settled through diplomatic means, he said.
</P>
<P>
The use of force against a country which suffers from
U.N. economic embargo and a shortage of food and medicine is
unacceptable at all, Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo circulated a
statement by the Palestinian leadership that voiced grave concern
over the escalation of tension in "sisterly" Iraq because of the
U.S. air strikes carried out Tuesday and today, according to the
MENA.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq was defending its lands against an aggression launched by
some forces in the northern Kurdish region," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged all parties concerned to respect Iraq's
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It called for lifting the U.N. economic embargo imposed on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and resolving all issues
through peaceful means and in accordance with the international
legitimacy.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Held in Contempt of Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. District Judge held
Susan McDougal in contempt of court Wednesday for refusing to
answer questions in front of the Whitewater grand jury in Little
Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered McDougal, who last month was
sentenced to two years in prison in a Whitewater probe, to report
to jail Monday where she will remain until she agrees to testify,
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
McDougal's attorney, Bobby McDaniel, contends the independent
counsel wants her to testify against her former husband, James
McDougal, and their former business partners in the Whitewater
land deal, President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing after the grand jury session, McDougal read a
statement saying she was asked questions about her personal life
that she believed violated her right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
McDougal also said she might be subject to prosecution if she
did answer because her statements might not agree with testimony
from other witnesses questioned in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
McDougal was convicted on loan fraud charges in May for her
role in obtaining a 300,000-dollar loan in 1986 from a lending
company backed by the Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
James McDougal reportedly is cooperating with prosecutors and
his sentencing has been postponed until November.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals were convicted along with former Arkansas
Governor Jim Guy Tucker on charges of misusing loan funds from
Capital Management Services and Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
Tucker received four years probation, including 18 months of
home detention, as doctors said he was suffering from a
life-threatening liver disease and would be denied a transplant if
he went to prison.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Missile Strikes against Iraq Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. president Bill Clinton
on Wednesday said that two cruise missile strikes he had ordered
against Iraqi military targets have successfully fulfilled U.S.
objectives and Saddam Hussein now "knows there is a price to be
paid for stepping over the line".
</P>
<P>
In his first full assessment of American missile attacks
against Saddam, Clinton said: "He is strategically worse off...
I'm satisfied this mission has achieved the objectives we set out
for it.
</P>
<P>
"The targets were either destroyed or sufficiently damaged so
that we can say our mission has been achieved," he told a White
House news conference, in which vice President Al Gore also
attended.
</P>
<P>
The United States has fired 44 cruise missiles from warships,
stationed in the Persian Gulf, and from B-52 bombers, in two
strikes at 15 "selected air defense sites" in Iraq, which a
Pentagon officer said had sharply reduced Iraqi military ability
in challenging U.S.-led allies's missions in the no-fly zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was not overly concerned by two Iraqi
challenges in the newly Expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq,
which went into effect at 12 p.m. local time on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will do whatever we have to do in the future to protect our
pilots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a U.S. Air Force F-16 launched a HARM missile, a
high-speed anti-radiation weapon, against an Iraqi radar facility,
which was said to have locked its radar on the American aircraft
and preparing to fire a surface-to-air missile.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, two Iraqi MIG jets were said to be
approaching the expanded no-fly zone from the north and then
turned back.
</P>
<P>
The president Acknowledged there were frictions with his
allies, some showing reservation on U.S. military action and
others flatly opposed to use U.S. air bases in their countries as
launching pad for U.S. missile attacks, but he decided that the
coalition against saddam hussein has not been fractured, "I don't
think it's dead."
</P>
<P>
Before the president's news conference, Defense Secretary
William Perry held a Pentagon news briefing, in which he said that
the two main missile strikes plus the F-16's attacking at the Iraq
radar site have demonstrated that the United States would "take
whatever actions necessary to enforce the no-fly zone".

<HEADLINE> Blood Donation Becomes Lofty Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Donating blood has become a
humanitarian trend in Benxi in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Before 1990, the city's donated blood supply came from
compulsory campaigns in government departments and enterprises, as
well as individual donations, said Li Yongzhi, head of the Benxi
Blood Center of the Chinese Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the city's Red Cross Society and Public Health
Department have promoted the importance of blood donation via the
local newspapers, and on radio and TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Following the lead of local officials, including mayor Li
Yingjie, Benxi residents have grown more and more enthusiastic
about donating their blood.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the blood center regularly stationed a vehicle,
donated by the Red Cross Society of Hong Kong, in the city's
downtown area to accept donations.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 61 percent of Benxi's blood supply came from local
donations. As a result, the city was awarded a gold medal by the
Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) and the Ministry of Public
Health in last November.
</P>
<P>
Between January and August this year, more than 3,000 Benxi
residents donated blood.
</P>
<P>
An official with the RCSC said that blood donation should be
the ultimate goal of blood supply management in China, and is the
only solution to the blood shortage.

<HEADLINE> Indurain Throws Doubt on Retirement Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Five-time Tour de France
cycling winner Miguel Indurain of Spain instilled new doubts on
his recently announced decision to retire, two days before the
start of the Tour of Spain here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I don't even know myself if I am going to
continue or if I am going to pull out at the end of this year,"
said the 32-year old Spaniard, whose year has been marked by an
unsuccessful sixth attempt at the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Also playing a part in his decision is Indurain's recently
falling out with his Banesto team.
</P>
<P>
"I am competing because I have to," said the Spaniard,
unimpressed by having his competition schedule imposed upon him by
Banesto.
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred to take holidays, but it's the team who
hand out the orders," he added, indicating that his morale was
flagging.
</P>
<P>
Indurain, who won gold at the Atlanta Olympics in the
time-trial, has failed to impose his brilliance on the Spanish
Tour in the past. His previous memorable success being in 1985
when he held the yellow jersey for four stages.
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner and cycling world champion, Frenchman
Laurent Jalabert is again favoured this year despite his premature
retirement from the Tour de France.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Open Up Buy Unlisted Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to allow
foreigners to make direct investments in unlisted stocks, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said here today.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the computer programs are completed, foreigners would
be given access to unlisted stocks registered with and
traded through the Korea Securities Dealers Association, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It might be late this year or early next year when the market,
which is scaled at some 10 billion U.S. dollars, would open to
direct foreign investment, a ministry official noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said there would be an aggregate ceiling on the
maximum amount of unlisted stocks foreigners were allowed to buy.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreigners have access to unlisted stocks, often
called over-the-counter (OTC) stocks, indirectly through country
funds. They can directly invest only in stocks listed and traded
on the Korea Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also planned to relax rules on the registration and
trading of venture capital companies in the OTC market, the
official added.

<HEADLINE> Scope for Sino-Kazakh Cooperation, Says Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Chinese State
Commission for Economic Restructuring Li Tieying said today there
is a great scope for economic and trade cooperation between China
and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that prospects for Sino-Kazakh
economic and trade cooperation were promising because the two
countries were complementary with each other economically. They
had no political problems in the way of developing
good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Exchange visits by the leaders of the two countries this year
had laid the foundation for a strategic, cooperative partnership
between China and Kazakhstan, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Li, Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin
said he would like to see the bilateral trade volume reaching one
billion U.S. dollars by the end of this century. It was expected
to be 400 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Li said the target could be achieved through joint efforts by
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government was satisfied with the development of
the Sino-Kazakh relationship and optimistic about the future of
the relations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a state councillor, will return to China on
Friday after completing a four-day visit to Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Independence Imperative for Foreign Policies of Asian Countries (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Adhering to independence is
imperative for the foreign policies of Asian countries, said Chen
Qurong, a Chinese expert on international relations, who spoke in
Beijing today at the ongoing "21st Century Forum."
</P>
<P>
Independence is indispensable for most of the Asian countries
that stood up on their own not long ago, including China, said
Chen, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference and director of the Institute of
Contemporary International Relations.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to independence means adhering to the world's
acknowledged principles concerning sovereignty, selecting the path
of development in accordance with the people's will, and opposing
intervention in other countries' sovereignty issues or internal
affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Adhering to independence and deepening mutual dependence upon
one another will be conducive to the future peace in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the scholar, it might be wise for Asian countries
to seek widespread cooperation on the basis of independence,
mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and to persistently
pursue the establishment of a justifiable and reasonable new
international political order.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st century, Chen said, Asia will be characterized by
the rise of more than one country. The trend of multi-polarity
appeared first in Asia, and the 21st century will probably witness
no declining major powers, but rather the rise of multiform
forces, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, China, East, South, West
and Central Asia have begun to rise in different ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the next decade, there will be an array of
possible power structures in Asia, including single polarity
power, a traditional multi-polarity power balance, multi-element
coexistence and various strategic combinations centering around
key issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
The next ten or 20 years will be crucial for many Asian
countries, he said, when it will be especially necessary to
maintain harmony between political and social stability and the
wide-sweeping changes that will take place.
</P>
<P>
The theme of Asia, like the rest of the world, has turned from
wars and revolution to peace and development, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The scholar said that the modernization of the national defense
system is an important component of the national
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries fully understand the confinement of military
power in the present-day era and the peril of the arms race, as
they have suffered greatly from the pain caused by wars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, most of the countries will seek to control the
military power while struggling to modernize the national defense,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The "overall peace" in Asia will be determined by various
factors, Chen said, such as sustained economic development and
corresponding restraint during disagreements, the proper balance
between politics and economy, the political progress attained by
various nations, foreign policies balancing independence with
mutual dependence, and national defense policies excluding the
arms race, and multi-element peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Imbalanced development is permanent and stability is relative,
he said, pointing out that many de-stablizing elements will exist
in the future in Asia. He hoped the "de-stablizing elements can be
reined into the framework of general peace and joint development as
much as possible."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. military aircraft are
patrolling the skies of southern Iraq without meeting challenges
from Iraqi fighters and radars, a spokesman for the U.S. military
headquarters responsible for the Gulf region said today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Central Command spokesman Nino Fabiano told reporters that
no Iraqi aircraft were spotted in the southern no-fly zone and no
anti-aircraft batteries had challenged U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"We see nothing. Some of the activity that is being seen is the
Iraqis returning to garrison," Fabiano said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also denied claims by one of the Kurdish factions
that there were fierce fightings in northern Iraq, where Iraqi
regular military forces and Kurdish factions battled earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, U.S. aircraft patrolling a newly expanded "no
fly"zone over southern Iraq encountered two Iraqi challenges, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Wednesday that the United
States remained concerned that Iraq might attack the Kurds again
as it did last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Perry warned that Iraq would be punished more
toughly if it posed a more serious challenge to the stability and
U.S. aircraft in the northern and southern "no fly" zones imposed
by the United States and other major Western powers.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Police Crack False Passport Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (RCMP) have uncovered a Montreal-based forgery ring which
produced high-quality counterfeit documents enabling thousands of
people to enter Canada illegally.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper said the RCMP arrested a Montreal
man about two weeks ago after undercover officers bought more than
200 forged documents for use in falsifying Canadian passports.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old man, identified as a native of Sri Lanka, has
been charged with dealing in forged Canadian passports.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have been at the center of the group that
specialized in printing and distributing false copies of passport
pages. The forged pages would then be substituted for the genuine
pages in lost or stolen passports.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no idea how many of these pages were
produced. It was estimated to be in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
The forged pages were printed in the city of Montreal and then
sold to other forgers and smugglers, "enabling criminal
organizations to bring thousands of illegal aliens into Canada,"
police said.
</P>
<P>
The ring dealt extensively, but not exclusively, with Sri
Lankans, police said.
</P>
<P>
The price for a falsified passport was about 2,200 U.S.
dollars, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Forest Damage Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Almost one in every five
trees in European Union (EU) countries had clear signs of damage
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
That was 2.6 percent more than the previous year, according to
a forest condition report published today.
</P>
<P>
Countries participating in the survey cited atmospheric
pollution, drought and insect attacks as possible causes of the
forest damage.
</P>
<P>
The report, drawn up by the European Commission and the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said the crown condition
of almost all tree species had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on a survey carried out in the 15 EU member
states and in other European countries. More than 600,000 trees
were examined, and about 26,000 sample plots.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the number of trees showing clear signs
of damage was particularly high in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
The report also contains a special chapter on the intensive
monitoring of forest ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
These activities aimed to document the forest conditions in
Europe and contribute to a better understanding of cause-effect
relationships between forest conditions and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
A total of 440 tree plots have been installed in EU member
states for the long-term, intensive monitoring program
coordinated by the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the European Commission and the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe have been publishing a series of
common Forest Condition Reports focusing on large-scale crown
condition assessments.

years to become one of the world's major securities markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the Fourth Member Conference of the exchange, the

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Arrives in Warsaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), arrived here today on a four-day official and
goodwill visit to Poland.
</P>
<P>
Li, the first CPPCC chairman yet to visit Poland, said he
believed his visit would further promote mutual understanding
between the two countries and their peoples. It would strengthen
their friendship and mutual trust, push forward the long-term and
stable growth of bilateral relations and mutually-beneficial
cooperation based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released upon his arrival, Li said that
China and Poland had enjoyed traditional friendship. A constant
development and solidification of such friendship was a shared
desire of the two countries, for it was not only in line with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also beneficial to
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation had achieved sustained growth over
recent years in various fields such as economy and trade, culture,
science and technology, Li said. With concerted efforts from the
two countries, such cooperation would surely be more productive.
</P>
<P>
Li, who was invited by Polish Senate Speaker Adam Struzik, was
greeted by Deputy Speaker of the Senate, Grzegorz Kurczuk, at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Warsaw, Li will meet with Polish leaders on
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Poland is the first leg of Li's European tour which will also
take him to the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Organizes Trip to Civilian Area Hit by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Information Ministry
organized today a trip for foreign reporters to visit a Baghdad
residential area which it said was hit by a U.S. missile launched
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Some residential buildings were seen demolished and
inhabitants dislodged said their houses were damaged by a
U.S. cruise missile launched Wednesday evening, which Iraq said
killed one civilian and injured nine others.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad residents interviewed denounced the U.S. missile
attack and said that it would only make them more determined to
"offer more sacrifices for their country."
</P>
<P>
The General Command of the Iraqi Armed Forces confirmed at
midnight Wednesday the country suffered the third round of
U.S. missile attacks, which came only several hours after the
anti-aircraft artillery opened fire on hostile targets in the
dark skies over the capital.
</P>
<P>
The general command said the Americans fired a salvo of
missiles aimed at some military installations and civilian
centers in Iraq at 8:45 p.m. local time Wednesday, and some of
the missiles fell onto the capital.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. rejected the accusation, saying there had been no
American military operations in the capital area.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced Wednesday it fired a new round of missiles
into southern Iraq and destroyed an Iraqi radar site that was
preparing to attack an American F-16 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
Since early Tuesday, the U.S. forces have launched three
rounds of missile attacks on Iraqi military targets and civilian
localities, killing 6 people and injuring 26 others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claimed that the assault was launched to retaliate
for an Iraqi military offensive against the Kurdish controlled
areas in the north.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Every healthy resident above
the age of 18 in coastal Jiangsu Province must plant three to five
trees a year, in accordance with a set of new regulations set
forth here today.
</P>
<P>
The 22-article Regulations on Planting Trees on a Voluntary
Basis, which were issued by the Standing Committee of the
Provincial People's Congress, also specifies duties and
responsibilities of leaders at all levels, the undertaking of
tree-planting projects, inspection, rewards and punishment.
</P>
<P>
The regulations state that those failing to meet their
tree-planting quotas without a good reason will be reprimanded and
ordered to meet their quotas within a prescribed time.
</P>
<P>
Thirty million residents in Jiangsu voluntarily plant an
estimated 110 million trees each year, according to an official
with the Provincial Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Jiangsu had some 750,000 hectares of trees
and a tree coverage of 11.7 percent, the official said.

<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung
Electronics Company has developed a 14-inch, thin film,
transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) monitor for desktop
personal computers, a company spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The flat screen monitor is as thin as five centimeters and
weighs three kilograms, one 10th of existing cathode ray tubes,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But it produced highly defined pictures, surpassing the quality
of existing 17-inch monitors. It could be operated with 35-watts
of electricity, meaning an energy saving of 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Samsung would be able to catch up with Japanese makers, such as
Hitachi and Fujitsu, which were ready to mass-produce the next
generation's monitor, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The company forcast that the world's flat screen monitor market
would grow to 15.2 million units in the year 2000, occupying 18.6
percent of the total monitor market.
</P>
<P>
Samsung planned to invest 125 million U.S. dollars by the turn
of the century to foster the item.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Announces New Monetary Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
has announced new monetary policy measures which in line with the
expected economic growth and falling inflation will ensure price
stability and a firmer grip on money supply growth.
</P>
<P>
The bank has with immediate effect raised the present limit of
35 percent foreign investor participation on the Zimbabwe stock
exchange to 40 percent and participation in every counter has
been increased from 5 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors who constitute the biggest buyers of shares
on the Zimbabwe stock exchange, were first allowed to participate
on the local bourse in June 1993. This latest move is part of the
ongoing efforts by the government to improve the investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
All foreign currency accounts, commonly known as fcas, will
now be eligible for the 17.5 percent statutory reserve
requirement. This is with immediate effect and the money will be
payable in Zimbabwe Dollars.
</P>
<P>
And beginning this month, the Central Bank will buy gold from
producers in foreign currency, putting the producers at the same
level with other exporters.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Bank Leonard Tsumba said these new measures,
announced on Thursday, together with current market operations,
would ensure that money supply growth did not exceed 22 percent a
year and would be sufficient to support the private sector credit
growth of at least 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
''With the economy now expected to grow by 7 percent this
year, and at a slower pace in 1997 and, given the inflation
target of 17 percent by June 1997, money supply cannot be allowed
to continue growing at current levels,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Commission has decided to assist 23 European television stations
to transmit wide-screen signals this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision is another step in the implementation of an action
plan for promoting wide-screen television services and program
production in the 16:9 format in the EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen out of 23 TV stations will broadcast for the first
time in the wide-screen format.
</P>
<P>
As a result, people in Finland will be able to watch
wide-screen TV programs for the first time this year, and in
France, Germany, Spain, Britain, Greece and Italy, the service
will cover more areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 17 broadcasters joined ranks with the 22
TV stations who are providing wide-screen program services in 13
of the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU adopted, in July 1993, the four-year action plan for
introducing advanced television services with a total fund of 228
million ECU (about 296 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas Urged to Score Sustained Agricultural Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun has
urged that coastal areas achieve coordinated development in
farming, manufacturing and service sectors to ensure sustained
agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting coastal Fujian Province from August 31 to
September 5, Jiang said that both developed and underdeveloped
areas must strengthen the farming sector as the foundation of their
economies and give top priority to agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
"Developed areas ought to take the lead in expanding an
export-led farming sector, achieving a relatively comfortable
living standard and building socialist rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He visited grain production centers, mountainous areas, fruit
plantations, aquatic products farms and flood-control facilities
and farm product processing factories.
</P>
<P>
"With a huge population..., China must rely on its own efforts
to solve the problem of grain supplies," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a grain-deficient province, Fujian must make a success of
grain production and increase the ratio of its grain
self-sufficiency, he told local officials.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the steady increase in grain production, it is
imperative to effectively protect farmland and keep farmland
acreage stable by administrative, economic and legal means.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also visited rural residents in Changting
County, which was struck by typhoons in late July and early
August.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Commission
has decided to extend a grant of 20 million ECU (about 26 million
U.S. dollars) to Albania to support its balance of payments and to
reinforce its reserves.
</P>
<P>
The grant is in line with the various other financial grants to
Albania since this country started the transition towards a market
economy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The grant represents the second instalment of the 35 million
ECU grant agreed by the European Union Council of Ministers in
November, 1994. The first instalment was paid in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission said in a statement that it authorized the
payment of this second tranche in view of the "globally positive
results" achieved by the Albanian economy over the past two years,
in particular the macro-economic stabilization, the streamlining
of external trade and the mass privatization program.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission has also taken account of the effective
introduction of VAT (Value-Added Tax) on 1 July 1996, continued
progress with structural reform, and assurances received from the
Albanian authorities concerning the adoption of further measures
to correct the budgetary situation," it added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Cracks Down on Foreign Prostitutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign women
working as prostitutes in Greece is growing at an alarming rate,
forcing the authorities to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Public Order Ministry figures show that a total of 13,677 women
have entered the country in past times under false "artistic"
identities such as dancers and singers. In 1995, 3.948 foreign
women were expelled from Greece while 1,277 prostitutes and 196
pimps were arrested.
</P>
<P>
A study published today said the illegal trade in women had
taken on large dimensions over the past two years, despite the
fact that the number of women brought from abroad as "artists" had
decreased.
</P>
<P>
The study found that many of the women brought to Greece for
sexual exploitation were illegally smuggled in. Others came in
legally, but the majority remained in Greece without a residence
permit. They came from Albania, Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia,
Romania, Russia, the Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The study said the women were usually scared and didn't have
residence permits. Living conditions for them were very
bad. "They live, either alone or in groups, in sordid hotel rooms
and in low-category pensions, and they are not provided with any
services," the study said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the foreign prostitutes were forced to have sex
with an unlimited number of men, increasing the risk of catching
and transmitting sexual diseases.

<HEADLINE> China-US-Japan Relations to Have Positive Impact on Asia: Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- With the 21st century on the
horizon, the relations between China, the United States and Japan
are healthier than ever before, a Chinese scholar said in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Such ties are expected to play a positive role in the situation
in Asia in the next century, said Zi Zhongyun, a research fellow
of the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Zi, speaking at panel discussions of the ongoing first
conference of the "21st Century Forum," said the China-US-Japan
relations have been playing a decisive role in the Asia/Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Owing to China's rapid development, Zi said, China's presence
can never be ignored when issues in the Asia/Pacific region are
discussed.
</P>
<P>
This is the basis for the co-existence and development of ties
between China, the US and Japan on an equal basis, the scholar
said, adding that it is also a key factor in maintaining peace in
the Asia/Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Zi described the three countries as forming a "scalene
triangle" -- one that has unequal sides -- as the Japan-US
relationship is "apparently closer" than China's relations with
the other two.
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional trade disputes between Japan and the US, it
seems unlikely that a crisis would occur, he said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of security, Japan and the US have continued to be
allies even after the end of the Cold War, he said. And China has
a reason to feel uneasy when the renewed Japan-US security treaty
affects the Taiwan issue, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The scholar noted that in the event of conflict, it is unlikely
that two of the three countries would join hands against the
third, because the decision-makers of all three countries know
that this would be "both unwise and difficult to accomplish."

<HEADLINE> New Devise to Fight Salmonella Infection of Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed a new device that can reduce the salmonella infection
of uncooked or improperly cooked eggs, The Jerusalem Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
The device, created by scientists in the northern port city of
Haifa, is able to quickly produce large amounts of ozone gas to
disinfect eggshells, thereby significantly reducing the danger of
salmonella infection of eggs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Local company Health Eggs Ltd. has purchased the exclusive
worldwide rights to the knowhow and will sell disinfected eggs on
local market soon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Health Ministry has affirmed that the ozone-treated
eggshell leaves the product safe for consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said that it does not completely
eliminate the risk of uncooked or poorly cooked eggs as, in a
minority of cases, the chicken may be infected with salmonella
and pass it on directly to the egg insides the shell.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that only one in 10,000 to 20,000 eggs is
infected inside with salmonella. The most common danger is the
presence on the eggshells of pathogens, which infect the egg when
it is cracked open or when uncooked food is prepared on unclean

LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Olympic marathon winner Josia
Thugwane of South Africa withdrew Wednesday from the Great North
Run on September 15 in Newcastle, England.
</P>
<P>
It reported Thugwane, who in Atlanta became South Africa's
first black gold medalist when he won the marathon in two hours 12
minutes and 36 seconds, has received death threats in his home
country and is taking them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Quoted in Wednesday's Johannesburg Star newspaper, the
25-year-old said his life was in danger because of the rewards he
earned from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is talking about the plan to kill me," he said. "I do
not know who the crooks are but if they say they will kill someone
they will do it.
</P>
<P>
"They think I am rich. I fear more now for my wife and family
than myself."
</P>
<P>
Thugwane already has first-hand experience of South African
violence, narrowly escaping death in a car-jacking incident
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Race director John Caine is upset about the withdrawal, which
comes six days after Thugwane's presence was confirmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A local Somali employee for
the World Health Organization (WHO) has been abducted by Somali
gunmen in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The abducted employee whose name is a Mr. Jeylani has
reportedly been a long-term storekeeper for United Nations health
organizations agency in Mogadishu, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Four gunmen stormed the house of Mr Jeylani in south
Mogadishu two days ago. The gunmen who were not identified have
reportedly hurt no one in the house during their 15-minute
operation.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are currently asking for a huge ransom of 20
million Somali Shillings (some 2,666 US Dollars) for his
release.
</P>
<P>
However, there are serious efforts and negotiations for the
release of Mr Jeylani no matter how much is the cost, while some
other elders, along with local officials, are also trying to
pacify and end the abduction peacefully and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen claimed they are treating their hostage in a
humanely way. ''they feed him three times a day and let him have
a shower once a day,''said a man who asked not to be named for
security reasons. according to this man, the health situation of
Mr Jeylani is fine even though he looked restless, worried and
confused.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of the U.N. employee came just a day after south
Mogadishu faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid had met a
delegation from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for
the release of an abducted Australian pilot.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid has promised to help, saying he would review the
case of Mr Justin Fraser, the Australian pilot who was caught by
militiamen supporting late general Mohamed Farah Aidid at Huddor
airstrip on May 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid said he is working on the release of Fraser.
Fraser was fined 485,000 US Dollars by a court established by
late general Aidid on June 20.
</P>
<P>
This new abduction in south Mogadishu would be a hard blow to
the new initiative in normalizing the relations between the world
community and the administration of Hussein Mohamed Aidid in
south Mogadishun, observers here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Internal Trade
is to introduce live pigs to replenish national reserves in a bid
to increase the supply of fresh pork.
</P>
<P>
The move follows reports which revealed that daily sales of
frozen meat had been chopped in half.
</P>
<P>
Market experts hailed the move, since frozen pork, previously
the only stock in the national reserve, has become increasingly
unmarketable with the constant rise in people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
According to China Business Daily, the sale of frozen meat in
Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai has reduced by between a half or a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The falling sales of frozen meat has also added burden to the
national finance.
</P>
<P>
Under the trial scheme, the Ministry of International Trade
will select large pig farms to provide live pigs for the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Contracts will be signed under which the variety, quantity and
time of slaughtering will be defined. The State will be
responsible for arranging the processing, price and the marketing
of the meat.

threat to take sanctions against non-US companies investing in
Iran had no effect whatsoever on Iran's economic development.

The US attempt has no effect on Iran nor does it put any

Malaysia's company Petronas is involved to develop our oil fields
especially since it decided to do so even after the sanction was
announced."

<TEXT>
<P>
First, science and technology's role of serving economic
construction will be maintained. New and advanced technology
should be used to support pillar industries and for combining
production and research. To do so, enterprises are becoming the
main pathway and will play an important role in solving problems
that appear in the course of economic and social development.
</P>

Second, China will work on breakthroughs in some fields where
the research force is strong and try to catch up with, or surpass,
international developments. It will also train young science and
technology personnel for the 21st century.
</P>

Third, science and technology will play an active role in
social development, the ecology, and in the rational exploitation
and use of natural resources. It will also be important in the
prevention of natural disasters and help to minimize damage,
alleviate over-population, guarantee people's health, and assist
in sustained national development.

Fourth, science and technology should act as a foundation for
civilization and contribute to the people's quality and moral
standards.

Zhu said that Chinese scientists and technologists pay
attention to exchanges and cooperation with their counterparts
elsewhere in the world, and will rely on principles of equality,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Disabled people in Beijing
have found more employment opportunities, a better welfare system
and more convenient facilities to help them in their work and life.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to July this year, 1,230 disabled people have found
jobs in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the 116,000 urban disabled old enough to
work now have jobs, according to Wang Zhidong, deputy director of
the working committee for the disabled under the Beijing Municipal
Government. Wang is attending an on-going session of Beijing
Municipal People's Congress which opened on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A national survey in 1987 showed that Beijing has 413,000
handicapped people, accounting for 4.5 percent of local total
population.
</P>
<P>
To promote the work about the disabled, the Beijing Municipal
Government issued a set of regulations on the employment of
disabled people, encouraging local government departments, social
institutions and enterprises to employ disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Municipal Government also decided to allocate regular
subsidies to disabled people who were suffering hardship starting
from July, 1995.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to July this year, some 3,070 such people received
1.89 million yuan (about 229,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng spoke highly of the policy and the State
Council's Working Commission for the Disabled and called on the
nation to learn from them.
</P>
<P>
The city has worked out rules for building no-barrier public
facilities for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The Fangzhuang residential quarter in southeast Beijing has
been designated as a pilot area for building a no-barrier
environment for the disabled, for which more than three million
yuan (about 360,000 US dollars) will be invested. The work is
expected to be completed by October 1.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has placed great importance to the recovery of the
disabled in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The city has carried out recovery operations on 9,592 cataract
patients, 931 paralyzed children, and 221 deaf children were
cured. More than 130,000 people who are especially in need of
iodine were fed with iodized oil pills.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Beijing's six districts and counties
established legal service agencies for the disabled, judicial
departments and courts in four districts and counties implemented
preferential policies to provide legal services for the
handicapped people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai, Denmark Vow to Increase Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI September 5 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade cooperation
between Denmark and China's largest city is expected to grow in
the future, said sources at a Sino-Danish Economic and Trade
Seminar held here today.
</P>
<P>
Denmark is ready to make more contacts with Shanghai to expand
economic and trade cooperation, and in doing so both sides can
obtain returns, said Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen
who is visiting the city.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Shanghai also said that Danish business people are
welcome to enter into economic and trade businesses and
investments in the city.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, trade volume between the two countries reached 73.14
million US dollars, a rise of 11.6 percent over the previous
year. Bilateral trade volume for the first seven months hit 37.89
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai mainly imports aquatic products and machinery from
Denmark; it exports clothes, textiles and other light industrial
goods, livestock products and medicine to them.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, there were ten Danish-funded ventures in
Shanghai, four of which had been set up last year.

<HEADLINE> China Standardizes Property Rights Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China has issued two documents
to promote the standardized development of an enterprise property
rights market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jixiang, director of Property Rights Department of the
State Administration of State Property (SASP), said that in recent
years, local governments have been highly concerned with fostering
and developing enterprise property rights markets, which are
networks for trading businesses and their assets.
</P>
<P>
"They have considered the issue as one of significance for
deepening enterprise reforms and boosting economic development,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The documents, "The Guiding Opinions on the Establishment of a
Supervisory System for Enterprise Property Rights Markets," and
the "Provisional Measures for the Management of an Information
Network for Enterprise Property Rights Markets," have been issued
by the SASP.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a dozen Chinese provinces and
municipalities have published rules on the management of
enterprise property rights markets.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 intermediary institutions who deal in property
rights transfer have been set up at the provincial level; there
are more than 100 such institutions approved by governments at the
prefecture or city level.
</P>
<P>
"The institutions have been instrumental in optimizing the
distribution of existing assets, speeding up the establishment of
a modern enterprise system, and promoting a sound and healthy
development of local economies," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property
Rights Exchange, where property rights of 711 enterprises have
changed hands for 1.84 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang said, problems like underpricing state
properties do exist in the course of developing enterprise
property rights markets.
</P>
<P>
Fostering and standardizing the enterprise property rights
markets is a difficult and sensitive issue at the current stage of
China's reform and development, and the task will be accomplished
over a fairly long period of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that in the near future, the SASP will give priority
to building up a legal framework for enterprise property rights
markets and updating the information network for them.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to overhaul the intermediary
institutions and train their employees, Zhang added.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang to Build More Reservoirs to Quench Thirst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province is pooling money to solve the problem of water shortages,
a bottleneck in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, water shortage has become a major problem
because of rapid industrial and agricultural development, increase
in population, inadequate water storage facilities, and water
pollution in the province.
</P>
<P>
Half of the province's 70 towns are short of water, and last
year over two million people suffered from thirst. Water shortages
have also caused direct economic losses of as much as 1.5 billion
yuan (about 181 million US dollars), local officials revealed.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the grim situation, the province will build more
reservoirs, and introduce new investment and management systems.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more spending on the construction of new
reservoirs, the provincial government will allow various
localities to levy another 0.20 to 0.5 yuan on the fees for each
cubic meter of water.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will also encourage the issuing of
bonds or stocks, and give favorable treatment in approving land
and taxes for reservoir construction.
</P>
<P>
Several areas in the province have started to build reservoirs
and ancillary facilities. In Taizhou and Wenzhou cities over ten
water projects have already been completed.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Japan Strengthen Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Trade relations between Hong
 Kong and Japan have been further strengthened with the signing of
 an agreement of cooperation between the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) and the Kansai Economic Federation, one
of the most influential economic organizations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a signing ceremony here Thursday, TDC Chairman
Victor Fund said, "We feel the trade relationship between Japan
and Hong Kong will become even more important in the future. In
the coming boom that will mark the beginning of the 21st Century
-- the Pacific Century, Hong Kong companies and Japanese firms
will have many opportunities to work in partnership with each
other."
</P>
<P>
The TDC chairman also mentioned that Hong Kong remains the
gateway to China and it can do much to help Japanese businessmen
wishing to further explore the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The Kansai Economic Federation represents around 860 major
companies and organizations in the Kansai region -- an area which
accounts for around one-fifth of the Japanese economy or
approximately three percent of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Hong Kong's third largest trading partner. Total trade
 between Japan and Hong Kong amounted to some 40 billion
U.S. dollars last year, which represents a 17 percent increase
over the previous year.

XI'AN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial
Hall is renovating 17 former residences of late Chairman Mao
Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries in Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an was a revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, where the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee was headquartered between January of 1937 and March of
1947.
</P>
<P>
A staff at the memorial hall said that the efforts are being

<HEADLINE> German Bank Raising Profile In Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank
(Sudwest LB), one of the world's top 100 banks, is making a strong
 presence on Asia's bond market in parallel with its growing
profile as a commercial bank in the dynamic region.
</P>
<P>
The German bank has prepared for regular issues of liquid bonds
 to attract Asian institutional investors. SudwestLB, the largest
bank in Baden-Wurttemberg in southwestern Germany, is regarded as
a high-quality bond issuer in Europe. Its aggregate bond issuance
in 1995 totaled 16 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We wish that our investors are geographically diversified, and
 we put an increased emphasis on Asia, the world fastest growing
region," said Rolf Limbach, member of the board of managing
directors of SudwestLB.
</P>
<P>
Limbach and other senior executives of the German bank have
just arrived in Hong Kong, the third leg of their current tour of
Asia's major financial centers -- Tokyo, Beijing, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of their visit to Beijing, Limbach said state-run
institutional investors in China, with a considerable amount of
foreign exchange reserve, are willing to buy high-quality
bonds. He hoped to get the same encouraging news here in Hong
Kong, where many institutional investors are based.
</P>
<P>
With assets of 120 billion US dollars at the end of 1995,
SudwestLB is the public sector bank in Germany's most prosperous
state Baden-Wurttemburg, home of many internationally-renowned
companies such as Daimler-Benz, Porsche, Hugo Boss and Bosch.
</P>
<P>
Basing its Asia-Pacific Division in Singapore, the bank has set
up representative offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Hanoi. As a
result, its commercial banking business, mainly providing trade
loans for German companies, has expanded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In the form of direct investment, the bank poured 26.5 million
US dollars to build the German Center for Industry and Trade in
Singapore, and the construction of a similar center is under way
in Beijing, involving a total of 25 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets with Henry Kissinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, today told
former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that he hopes China
and the United States will further develop their relations on the
basis of the three Sino-US Joint Communiques.
</P>
<P>
Qiao met this afternoon with Kissinger, who is here attending
the ongoing "21st Century Forum," sponsored by the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of relations between China and the US is
conducive to the interests of peoples of both countries, Qiao
said. And as long as the two sides strictly abide by the three
joint communiques, and properly settle the Taiwan issue, the
bilateral relations could remain stable and continue to develop,
he said.
</P>
<P>
This is conducive to peace in the Asia/Pacific area and the
whole world, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman said he welcomed Kissinger's participation in
the forum, and thanked him, as an old friend of the Chinese
people, for his active effort in improving Sino-US ties. He also
spoke highly of Kissinger's outstanding performance two decades
ago, which marked the beginning of a positive change in Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
A nostalgic Kissinger said he could hardly believe that 25
years have passed since he met with Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and
Zhou Enlai at the peak of their careers.
</P>
<P>
In regard to US-China relations, Kissinger said he has always
held that there should be constructive bilateral relations between
the US and China, and that he opposes the "containment policy"
against China. He was glad to see that the bilateral relations are
gradually improving through the joint efforts of both sides and
hopes that the healthy momentum continues.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also briefed Kissinger on China's economic
situation.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Vows to Enhance "Link" Function </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province
halfway along the Yangtze River, has vowed to step up its role as
a link between east and west China.
</P>
<P>
Noted economic analysts said that the Yangtze Economic Belt
will become an important area for promoting China's economic
development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, analysts said, will play an irreplaceable role as a key
link because of its particular geography and its economic
strength. It is the sole city in central and west China that
ranks among the country's top ten economic powers.
</P>
<P>
To enhance its "link" function, local government officials
said that city will make a number of special efforts in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
-- It plans to build 10 major projects, including the
construction of two sections of national highways, a Yangtze
bridge in Baishazhou, a container transfer center in Yangluo, the
second long-distance telecommunication hub, and expand the city's
telephone switchboard from one million to 1.5 million lines.
</P>
<P>
-- Establish several national-level or regional-level
markets, to turn the city into a financial, technology,
information, personnel and materials center, linking up western
parts of China with the east, and even international markets.
</P>
<P>
-- Produce 10 million tons of steel, 500,000 automobiles and
500,000 kilometers of optical fibre.
</P>
<P>
So far, steel, automotive, mechanical engineering, and hi-tech
and other pillar industries have been set up in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the city has made major improvements
in infrastructure facilities. Wuhan airport and the Wuhan-Yichang
expressway have opened to traffic. The expressway has halfed the
journey time between the city to the site of Three Gorges Dam
construction site.
</P>
<P>
A second Yangtze bridge in the city, and the inner ring road
have also been finished, which have greatly improved traffic
conditions of the city. A plant capable of assembling 300,000
automobiles has gone into trial production.
</P>
<P>
The telephone switchboard capacity has surpassed one million
lines, the first phase of the Yangluo Power Plant, with an
installed capacity of 600,000 kilowatts, has been connected to the
regional power grid.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the investment environment, Wuhan has
become a hot spot for foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, Wuhan had utilized more than
three billion US dollars, ranking first among all inland
cities. More than 20 of the 500 top multinationals in the world,
such as Coca Cola, have invested, or established subsidiary
companies in the city.

Boutros-Ghali's term ends in December this year.
</P>
<P>
The US is reportedly opposed to his renomination for a second

<P>
CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The United State and Russia, both sponsors of the
Middle East peace process, submitted the official papers of the
proposed Middle East and North Africa bank to the United Nations
on August 28. The project is ready for prospective members to sign
and complete their countries' ratification procedures, the local
English-language daily The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new bank members are Egypt, the U.S., Russia, Tunisia,
Jordan, Algeria, Palestine, Israel, Japan, Canada, the
Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, South Korea
and Malta.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is expected to approve before the end of this
month U.S. accession to the Investment and Development Bank in the
Middle East and North Africa -- slated for Cairo -- in which
Washington will share by 52 million U.S. dollars per annum along
five years.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and France signed last Friday a technical
cooperation agreement in the fields of electricity, energy,
training and the exchange of expertise.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper The Egyptian Gazette today quoted Minister
of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza as saying "the agreement
targets cooperation on the respective feasibility studies for the
power project to link Egypt and Zaire in addition to training
technicians on international power grids."
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Preparations are currently under way in Egypt to
organize an international conference entitled "Tourism: The
Present and Future in Egypt."
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is scheduled to open in Egypt's Red
Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh on September 24. It will gather
prominent experts from Canada, Germany, Italy, Brazil, The United
States, Cyprus and the United Kingdom to discuss tourism
development, its impact on the environment, manpower development,
education and marketing.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The Tunisian government has set up a new
administrative unit to speed up the privatization process,
according to the latest issue of Middle East Economic Digest
(MEED), a business weely published in London.
</P>
<P>
The new unit will propose a sell-off program, submit it for
approval to a ministerial committee chaired by the prime minister,
and implement it.
</P>
<P>
The move follows an agreement in July with the World Bank to
speed up privatization, which has been so slow as to cast doubt on
the government's will to reduce its role in business.
</P>
<P>
Privatization ministry officials say up to 18 companies have
been privatized so far this year, MEED said.

<HEADLINE> Early Rice Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Statistics Bureau
says that China's early rice crop produced 44 million tons this
year, up 4.2 percent over the output last year, with significant
increases in Jiangxi, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces in the
south.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the increase to state efforts to increase
farmers' interest in producing grain, by raising the price of
grain, while local governments developed preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8.29 million ha of land were planted in early rice
this year, 90,000 ha more than last year, resulting in 460 million
kilograms more in output.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' per capita cash input in farming in the first half of
the year was 282 yuan, a seven-percent increase over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
A survey in Jiangxi showed that, with the exception of chemical
fertilizers, consumption of other major agricultural products,
such as pesticides and plastic sheeting was up by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
The use of advanced agricultural techniques also helped
increase output. The acreage planted in hybrid early rice, for
example, was about three million ha this year. Another new
technique was raising rice seedlings in dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
The increased per ha output of early rice this year was 160.3
kilograms, 3.1 percent higher than last year. About 1.3 billion
kilograms more rice was harvested because of the increase in per
ha output.
</P>
<P>
Weather this year was also favorable for rice growing,
according to the bureau.

date for the resumption of final-status negotiations between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two leaders discussed such issues as
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron,
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the lifting of the
Israeli closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas, al Tayeb said.
</P>
<P>
But differences remained over these key outstanding issues,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The historic meeting at the Erez Crossing on the Israel-Gaza
border yielded few specific results, but it was believed to have
helped clear the air between the Israelis and Palestinians after
months of growing animosity following the hardline Netanyahu's
election in May.

<HEADLINE> China's Science and Technology Expected To Develop Fast(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- In the last several decades,
China has established an independent scientific and technological
system, with science and education-oriented policies, says Zhu
Guangya, a well-known Chinese scientist.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the First Meeting of the 21st Century Forum, Zhu,
who is vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and president of Chinese Academy of
Engineering, said that wide-ranging research has been done and 18
million scientists and technicians have been trained.
</P>
<P>
This has been used to support economic and social development
and to allow China to participate in international competition, he
said, but pointing out that China still has some problems in
development. Scientific and technological development is sometimes
divorced from economic construction. In addition, only a small
part of the country's scientific achievements are used in
production, and scientists' ability to come up with new ideas
still needs to be improved.
</P>
<P>
"China faces difficult tasks in its scientific and
technological development," Zhu said, noting that to use science
and technology as the primary productive force, China passed its
Decision on Speeding up Scientific and Technological Progress in
1995, for economic and social development and increasing state
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is to use science and education to revive the
nation. The Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National
Economic and Social development and the Long-Range Objective to
the Year 2010 gives the nation's strategic objectives for the next
15 years.
</P>
<P>
This document explains that the strategic plan of reviving the
country through science and education, while maintaining a steady
pace of development, should be implemented in such a way as to
fundamentally change China's economic structure and the way of
economic growth, he said.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Hopes France to Support U.S. Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said here today that he hoped to persuade France, which
criticised American missile attacks upon Iraq, into supporting
future American actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
this morning, Christopher, who is due to fly to Paris for talks with
French government officials later today, told reporters: "I hope that
after our conversations this afternoon, the French will go forward
with the operations as we have had in the past."
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is on a five-day trip to Britain, France and
Germany, is expected to hold separate talks with French Foreign Miniser
Herve de Charette and French President Jacques Chriac before leaving
for Bonn this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also expressed the hope that France will join the
United States and Britain in patrolling an expanded no-fly zone in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation of the French on this is highly desirable. They
have been a very important partner during the Gulf War and we hope
they will continue to participate fully on these matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns is
quoted by local media reports as saying that Christopher and
Rifkind have agreed that the U.S. and Britain could if necessary
patrol the expanded no-fly zone in southern Iraq without French
help.
</P>
<P>
"In discussions on the no-fly zone, they agreed that no matter
what the French do, the U.S. and the UK have the capability to
implement effectively the expanded no-fly zone."
</P>
<P>
Burns stressed that "we've got sufficient air assets in the
region to implement the extended on-fly zone."

<HEADLINE> Fourth Group Of Firms For China's Overseas Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China is choosing a fourth
group of firms, which are expected to be large-scale and
efficient, but plagued by fund shortages, for listing overseas,
according to a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shuqing, secretary general of the State Commission For
Restructuring the Economy, told a seminar here today that,
since July 1993, when Tsingtao Beer and Shanghai Petrochemical
were listed in Hong Kong, a total of 24 firms have issued shares
and been traded overseas, raising 4.44 billion US dollars in the
move.
</P>
<P>
All but two, which are listed with the New York Stock Exchange,
are listed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is sponsored by the Department of Foreign
Economic System of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy, and the Institute of Global Financial Studies of the
Foundation For Advanced Information and Research of Japan. More
than 100 Chinese and Japanese membersa of the banking, securities,
and investment community attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
An executive with Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. said that it is
his hope that Chinese firms can pay more attention to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, and that the Tokyo Stock Exchange has been working
strenuously since 1994 to prepare for handling Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Hong Kong market is small and its aggregate
market value accounts for only eight percent of Tokyo's.
</P>
<P>
"A huge supply of H shares can have a negative influence on
supply and demand in the Hong Kong market and result in a lower
than ideal issue price of future shares," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the New York market is the world's largest
and most active, but he said that it is not an ideal market for
Chinese firms, because of European and American investors' lack of
knowledge about China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two firms which have been listed on the NYSE
do not perform well.

<HEADLINE> Agent System To Be Tried In Chinese Rolled Steel Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Two central government
departments and a leading commercial bank are pooling their
resources to promote the agent system in marketing rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade (MIT), the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry (MMI), and the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) signed an agreement on September 3 here
for ICBC to give special loans and other considerations to
enterprises that experiment with the system.
</P>
<P>
China introduced an agent system that is widely used in
international distribution on a trial basis last October for steel
products and motor vehicles. It allows producers and distributors,
who previously had only loose connections, to have fixed ties and
make commitments to each other with contracts. This move is viewed
as an important means of improving China's socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, contracts for rolled steel
distribution worth over six billion yuan (722.89 million US
dollars) were signed.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations are trying to expand the system and
ensuring the essential funding. The two ministries have pledged to
improve policy guidance, coordination and supervision.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Maria has claimed 115 lives in
Mozambique's southern Inhambane Province for the first half of
1996, health officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Mussa, director of the health department of the
province, was quoted by the Noticias newspaper as saying that a
total of 3518 patients had suffered from malaria by the end of
June this year.
</P>
<P>
Antonio said the death toll might be a bit higher, but refuted
reports that the deaths were caused by the lack of medicine and
medical care.
</P>
<P>
The health official pointed out that the high death toll and
contracting rate were a result of excessive rainfall. During the
raining season from January to April, 93 people died of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
He said the health authority has taken measures to overcome
the disease, including spraying pesticide to kill mosquitos, the
major carriers of malaria, in the disease-stricken areas of the
province.

BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's largest river contains
40 percent of the country's polluted water, "China Machinery &AMP;
Electronics Daily" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The 14 billion tons of polluted water that go into it annually,
mainly in the form of industrial pollutants, has caused most of
the river's tributaries, especially those in the middle reaches,
to be seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
Studies done by environmental protection departments have shown
that the water in the river's main part barely meet the country's

Experts warn that water quality will worsen drastically if
protection regulations do not prevent the excessive discharge of
polluted water into the river.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Imperial Archives Well Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's oldest imperial
archives has survived 400 years of weathering, and has become a
model for file keeping, according to Chinese archivists.
</P>
<P>
Located on the eastern side of the prestigious Imperial Palace,
Huang Shi Cheng, the imperial archives in the Ming (1368-1644) and
Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, collected the emperors' veritable
records, imperial edicts, and imperial genealogies.
</P>
<P>
It also kept important documents, such as copies of Yong Le
Encyclopedia, which is China's first encyclopedia, the Compendia
of Qing Law, and the collection of the imperial general's seals.
</P>
<P>
Different from halls in the Imperial Palace, which are
constructed in wood, Huang Shi Cheng was wholely made of
stone. There are no beams or pillars supporting its arched roof.
</P>
<P>
Even the front gate was made of two pieces of stone, each
weighing five tons.
</P>
<P>
It is the only stone-structure, non-beam building in existence
in China.
</P>
<P>
The building with six-meter-thick walls sits on a stone base
measuring 1.42 meters. Stone platforms of the same height were
built inside the room to shelf camphorwood cabinets decorated by
gilded copper sheets with carved dragon design.
</P>
<P>
Windows were built at both the eastern and the western walls to
create a draft.
</P>
<P>
Archivists say that the design and craftsmanship of the
archives helped to prevent the files from fire, damp, worms and
rotting.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the fact that special officials were appointed
to take care of the files, and that a strict system of airing the
files was implemented, the documents in the archives survived
weathering in the past centuries," said Qin Guojing, vice-director
of the First Historical Archives of China, where all the files
from Huang Shi Cheng are now kept.
</P>
<P>
"Huang Shi Cheng is an example how the ancient Chinese were
good at file-keeping," he says.
</P>
<P>
The oldest imperial archives in existence was closed after
1949. It is now under state protection.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Former US President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China is willing to continue its "positive
and constructive" attitude to develop Sino-US relations, with
American co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In this way, both countries should increase their dialogue and
common viewpoints, reduce troubles, and co-operate more, to ensure
the healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here this afternoon in a meeting with
former US President George Bush who is here to attend a symposium.
</P>
<P>
In welcoming Bush, Jiang said he appreciates Bush's efforts in
the past at increasing understanding between China and the US and
their people, and at improving bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that through efforts on both sides there has been some
progress in Sino-US relations recently, and there are more
favorable conditions for the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that it is still the major
issue affecting the development of Sino-US relations, and that he
hopes the US can strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint
communiques and handle the Taiwan issue with caution, to avoid
delaying the improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he firmly believes that the US's leaders and people,
whether Republicans or Democrats, support the "one China" policy
and are in favor of developing good relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he has always been concerned about US-China relations
and hoped that such important relations can continue to improve,
adding that he will continue to make his own efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
Bush is here to attend an international symposium on China's
reform of its pension system, which is jointly sponsored by the
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy (SCRE) and the US
John Handcock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Director of the Foreign Affairs
Office of the State Council Liu Huaqiu, Vice-Minister of SCRE
Zhang Haoruo, Chinese Ambassador to the US Li Daoyu, and head of

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Optical Fair,
organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), will
become an annual event starting this year instead of a biennial
one, said Perry Fung, TDC's manager for exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Fung said the change is due directly to Hong Kong's growth as a
world optical goods manufacturing and distribution center.
</P>
<P>
The 4th Hong Kong Optical Fair will be held in November with
the participation of some 240 exhibitors from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that in response to market demand by overseas buyers,
the 1996 fair will be doubled in size and it will show the trends
and latest developments in the optical industry.
</P>
<P>
Overseas participants account for more than 40 percent of the
total number of exhibitors. They are from China, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Fung said that exhibits range from frames and glasses to
machinery, packaging materials and related chemicals and services.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Optical Fair has rapidly developed into one of
the world's leading optical goods trade fairs, he said, adding
that he expects to see about 8,000 buyers this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, Hong Kong's total exports of optical
goods amounted to 2.9 billion HK dollars (374 million US
dollars), an increase of 22 percent over the same period of last
year. Meanwhile, the total exports of optical instruments and
apparatus were valued at 2.2 billion HK dollars (284 million US
dollars), up 11 percent.

NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- American fast food giant
McDonald's, whose entry into the Indian market has been the
subject of speculation for the last two years, is now preparing to
open its first two outlets in Delhi and Bombay (Mumbai) later this
year, The Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has been extremely cautious in planning its Indian
debut with company officials attributing the delay to the
country's complex mechanism for awarding clearances to foreign
projects, particularly in the consumer sector.
</P>
<P>
"Our delayed entry gives us more confidence, a better
understanding of the fast food market and the socio-economic
trends in the country," said Vikram Bakshi, managing director of
McDonald's India.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has signed up with two local food firms in Delhi and
Bombay (Mumbai) to open its outlets in these cities first.
</P>
<P>
The entry of foreign investment in the consumer sector has been
controversial in India. The Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in
Bangalore, Karnataka, was attacked by local farmers earlier this
year.

<HEADLINE> Words of Late Chairman Mao Zedong Well Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The words and works of the
late Chairman Mao Zedong, from an original composition he wrote at
19 to his manuscripts and jottings, are being preserved for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the writings, all in his own hand, are carefully
preserved in Beijing's Central Archives.
</P>
<P>
The massive collection also includes Mao's photos, films and
original tape recordings of his speeches.
</P>
<P>
Mao Zedong, the late chairman, was born in Hunan Province on
December 26, 1893 and died on September 9, 1976.
</P>
<P>
Mao led the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese
people in bringing an end to the semi-colonial and semi-feudal
society. It culminated in the founding of the People's Republic and
establishment of a socialist system.
</P>
<P>
In a room in the Archive's No.2 Hall, are stored over 30,000 of
Mao's manuscripts and documents, along with his jottings. They are
all preserved in cabinets, while 90,000 copies of the books kept
by Mao are in bookcases.
</P>
<P>
A staff member at the Central Archives said the General Office
of the CPC Central Committee once issued an order asking all
Chinese people to submit any original handwritten items by
Chairman Mao -- manuscripts, letters or documents with his
jottings, to the Central Archives for preservation.
</P>
<P>
He said Mao's works have been kept in a traditional Chinese
way. All the metal staples were removed to prevent corrosion of
the papers.
</P>
<P>
Each piece of his manuscript, either a single page paper or a
book, is kept in a paper bag, which is placed in a small drawer
made of insect-proof camphorwood.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Second PM Supports Majoritarian Electoral System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian second Prime
Minister Hun Sen reiterated Wednesday that he preferred a
majoritarian system to a proportional one in the 1998 national
elections.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said this while meeting teachers being trained under a
human rights program at the Olympic Stadium here.
</P>
<P>
According to the second prime minister, a majoritarian system
is to give people a chance to directly elect the persons they like.
</P>
<P>
His statement came after reports that King Norodom Sihanouk
favored a combined polling system for the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's 1993 U.N.-organized general elections were held on a
proportional basis, with votes cast for parties.

<HEADLINE> Hefei, China's Booming Household Appliances City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An East China city has made a
clean sweep to become the country's biggest producer of household
washing machines.
</P>
<P>
Just a decade ago the bankrupt-threatened Rongshida Washing
Machine Plant in Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province,
was on the verge of going down the plug-hole.
</P>
<P>
But it emerged from a small loss making factory into a
money-spinning plant, producing two million washers every year.
</P>
<P>
Now the Rongshida plant leads the country in output, sales and
market share of washing machines. It boasts more than one billion
yuan in assets.
</P>
<P>
The transformation of the factory's fortunes is part of the
city's success in becoming a famous production base nationwide for
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The city has launched a massive technological drive to develop
its household appliances industry, turning it into one of the
local four leading industries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 the city has produced many top-selling brand-name
household appliances, including the "Rongshida" washing machine,
"Meiling" refrigerator, "Swan" air conditioner, and "Wanyan" VCDs.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Hefei Sanyo firm, cooperatively set up with
Japan's Sanyo company, the Rongshida plant is to join forces with
a US company to improve and expand its production.
</P>
<P>
It also plans to spend 230 million yuan on technological
upgrading during the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The Meiling refrigerator group also increased its assets from
2.55 million yun in 1983 to 2.3 billion yuan in 1995, and
generated more than 1.2 billion yuan in output value during the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meiling group plans to inject 290 million yuan building a
production line, with the annual capacity reaching 500,000
ozone-friendly refrigerators during the coming five years.

<HEADLINE> India Expects Drop in Rice Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- India anticipates a good
rice crop, helped by plentiful monsoon rains, but exports are
likely to dip due to a fall in world demand and uncompetitive
prices, The Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
Harvesting of the new rice crop will start in October.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said India was expected to harvest around 70 million
tons of rice in October, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
India produced around 81 million tons of rice in 1995-96
(July-June) crop year, with most of it meeting domestic needs. The
government has set a target of nearly 80 million tons for the crop
year of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
"Indian exports this year will be a maximum of three million
tons as Indian prices are much higher than Vietnam's prices," a
leading food grains exporter said.
</P>
<P>
India exported a record five million tons of rice in the year
that ended in March. Substantial quantities of rice was sold to
Indonesia and Bangladesh in the year.
</P>
<P>
But exports to the two countries are expected to fall this year
because their domestic production has improved.
</P>
<P>
One Bombay-based commodity analyst said "exports are not going
to pick up unless prices fall by about 20 U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
Traders said Vietnam was selling average quality rice at 255
dollars per ton but Indian prices were around 275 dollars.

LUANDA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Popular Movement
for the Liberaton of Angola (MPLA) is demanding that the joint
peace commission of the country drop the special arrangement for
the former rebel UNITA movement leader, Jonas Savimbi.

The Lusaka peace accord provided for a special position of
deputy president for Savimbi in the future government of

</P>

The MPLA said in a statement on Wednesday that the arrangement
should be removed from the accord because UNITA failed to agree
on the setting of deputy president for Savimbi at its recent
national congress.

The statement expressed disappointment at the slow

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- About 20 people were wounded on
an Air France Boeing 747 passenger plane which was forced to make
an emergency landing in Marseille, southern France, by a strong
tempest this morning.
</P>
<P>
``The violence of these turbulences surprised the crew and the
203 passengers on board the flight 437 when most of them were
sleeping at the moment of the coming of the tempest and did not
have time to attach their belts,'' said an Air France spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the plane came into strong turbulences
at about 01:30 above the Mediterranean, as it was on its way from
Johannesburg to Paris.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which suffered grave damages in its cabins, made an
emergency landing at the Marseille-Provence Airport at about 06:30
to rush the wounded passengers -- two of them in grave situation
-- to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 169 passengers continued their trip to Paris on
another plane.

<P>
So far it is not known about the nationality of the passengers
wounded.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes New Monetary Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
yesterday announced new monetary policy measures which, in line
with the expected economic growth and falling inflation, will
ensure price stability and a firmer grip on money supply growth.
</P>
<P>
The bank has with immediate effect raised the present limit of
35 percent foreign investor participation in the Zimbabwe stock
exchange to 40 percent and participation in every counter has
been increased from five percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors who constitute the biggest buyers of shares
on the Zimbabwe stock exchange were first allowed to participate
in the local bourse in June 1993. The latest move is part of the
ongoing efforts by the government to improve the investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
All foreign currency accounts, commonly known as FCAS will now
be eligible for the 17.5 percent statutory reserve requirement.
This is with immediate effect and the money will be payable in
Zimbabwe Dollars.
</P>
<P>
And beginning this month, the central bank will buy gold from
producers in foreign currency, putting the producers at the same
level with other exporters.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the bank Leonard Tsumba said these new measures,
together with current market operations, would ensure that money
supply growth did not exceed 22 percent a year and would be
sufficient to support private sector credit growth of at least 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
"With the economy now expected to grow by seven percent this
year, and at a slower pace in 1997 and, given the inflation
target of 17 percent by June 1997, money supply cannot be allowed
to continue growing at current levels," he said.

PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced Wednesday
evening that the government will cut 25 billion francs (5 billion
U.S. dollars) of income tax in 1997 in the project of a tax
reduction of 75 billion francs (15 billion U.S. dolllars) in five
years.
</P>
<P>
-- France lost a battle of communication Wednesday on whether
French combat aircraft participated in a patrol mission over
southern Iraq that morning.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry first confirmed a report by U.S.
Defense Department that French fighters joined the mission. But
several hours later, the Defense Ministry said that no French
fighters took off that day. However, the Prime Minister's Office
said in the night that French aircraft did fly that morning -- to
defend the air space of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States Wednesday continued its raid on Iraq. An
American fighter destroyed an Iraqi missile base Wednesday
afternoon after being hooked by an Iraqi radar. But Washington
denied having bombed Baghdad and its suburb, as Iraq accused.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who will
arrive in Paris today, said he would urge France to join allied
patrol over the extended exclusion zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- The space reserved by bicyclists in the streets of Paris has
become the center of a hot debate. The supporters of cyclists say
that the space is insufficient and designed incoherently, while
the opposers said that the idea of making Paris a ``small Swiss
commune'' is ``Utopian.''

<HEADLINE> Strong Economic Growth Predicted in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Investment Centre
(ZIC) has predicted a seven percent growth rate in the economy this
year.
</P>
<P>
The optimism is based on an above average rain season which
has boosted the agricultural sector, the mainstay of the
Zimbabwean economy.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report on Zimbabwe's economic situation, the ZIC
said the projected growth rate was almost a certainty given the
18 percent growth in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
After suffering successive droughts since 1991, the country is
set to harvest 2.7 million tonnes of maize as well as significant
increases in the production of other crops like wheat, cotton and
horticultural produce.
</P>
<P>
The government agency also predicted that following reforms to
the economy under the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund-backed economic strutural adjustment programme, the economy
was now on a firm footing for sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwean economy has been transformed and is inexorably en
route to becoming a modern economy with strong emerging market
characteristics," said the ZIC.

<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey may soon stage a
large-scale cross-border military operation against the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), Turkish sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Turkish security forces will first enter
into northern Iraq, clean up the PKK build-ups and then set up a
10-kilometer safety belt zone in the region to prevent the
infiltrations of the PKK rebels into the Turkish territory from
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Tansu Ciller said that the northern Iraq-based Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) had asked for the help of the Turkish
government against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said that the PKK was amassing its forces on the Iraqi
side of the Turco-Iraqi border, and pledged that necessary
measures would be taken to prevent the infiltration by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the weakening of the (Baghdad) central
government, the terrorist activity on our border has
intensified," she said.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that
Turkish security forces wiped out 291 PKK rebels in the military
operations in southeastern Turkey within one month.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war which has claimed
more than 21,000 lives in southeastern Turkey over the past 12
years.

SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to allow
foreigners to make direct investments in unlisted stocks, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said here today.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the computer programs are completed, foreigners will

</P>
<P>
It said that there will be an aggregate ceiling on the maximum
amount of unlisted stocks that foreigners will be able to buy in
total and individually.

<P>
Currently, foreigners buy unlisted stocks, often called
over-the-counter (OTC) stocks, indirectly through the country
funds. They can directly invest only in stocks listed and traded
on the Korea Stock Exchange.
</P>

according to the local press today.

<P>
The printers said they have asked newspaper publishers to
reduce printing orders by 50 percent because the company could
not afford to buy enough imported newsprint.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Develops New Monitor for Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung
Electronics Company has developed a 14-inch thin film
transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) monitor for personal
computers, a Samsung spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The flat screen monitor, which is only one 10th of the existing
cathode ray tube, is as thin as five centimeters and weighs three
kilograms, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But it produces highly defined picture, surpassing the quality
of existing 17-inch monitor, and improves 25 percent of the
lighting, compared with the existing one. It can be operated with
35-watt electricity, saving 56 percent of energy.
</P>
<P>
Samsung is expected to catch up with Japanese makers, such as
Hitachi and Fujitsu, which are ready to mass-produce the next
generation's monitor, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The company has forecast that the world's flat screen monitor
market will grow from 210,000 units this year to 15.2 million
units by the year 2000, occupying 18.6 percent of the total
monitor market.
</P>
<P>
Samsung plans to invest a total of 125 million U.S. dollars by
2000 to foster the program.

<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Perry held a telephone conversation with Turkish National
Defense Minister Turan Tayan on the situation in Iraq late
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the Turkish Defense Ministry said
that Perry informed Tayan about the latest developments of the
situation in Iraq through telephone.
</P>
<P>
Tayan told Perry that there has existed a large vaccum in
northern Iraq and the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) there intended to infiltrate into the Turkish
territory after the U.S. air strikes at the selected air defense
targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tayan said that Turkey would contribute to the security of the
lives and property of the Kurdish groups in that region and would
take the necessary security measures in the Turco-Iraqi border
region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military operations against Iraq have hurt the
Turkish economy and the postponement of implementation of U.N.
resolution 986 is detrimental to the interests of Turkey, Tayan
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fired 27 missiles against selected air defense targets
in southern Iraq Tuesday, killing five people and wounding 19
others, in response to the Iraqi government troops weekend attacks
on the Kurdish town of Irbil in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On early Wednesday morning, the U.S. launched 17 missiles at
the targets in southern Iraq that survived the first strike,
leaving one person killed and 17 others injured.
</P>
<P>
At midnight Wednesday, the General Command of the Iraqi Armed
Forces confirmed that Iraq suffered the third round of missile
attack launched by the U.S. forces, which came several hours after
the Iraqi anti-aircraft guns opened fire on hostile targets in the
dark sky over Baghdad.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today Malaysia truly regretted the U.S.
missile attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We are unhappy because the U.S. has acted without referring to
the (United Nations) Security Council or other parties," he told
reporters after calling on Malawian President Bakili Muluzi who
arrived here today for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Mahathir said that Malaysia would
make a proposal to the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) to take a common stand on the recent U.S. missile strikes at
targets in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Malaysian government has not yet made an
official decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should not

KAMPAL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defence
Forces (UPDF) are heavily patrolling its border with Sudan in
operations against the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
</P>
<P>
The local daily "the New Vision" disclosed today that the
border exit points are under tightened control of the UPDF.
</P>
<P>
Due to this situation, LRA Commander Alex Oti Lagony's attempt
to cross the border into Sudan flopped twice last Saturday, the
report said.

Lagony, who is leading 50 fighters with about 100 abductees,
has decided to pass through Omoro County to reach Kitgum
District, northeast of Gulu, according to the report.
</P>

Lagony's fighters burnt over 300 huts and killed 24 people

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Wine consumption has
skyrocketed in Thailand over the past years, especially among the
middle class who prefer luxury wines.
</P>
<P>
According to the Excise Deportment under the Finance Ministry,
wine imports jumped to 4.89 million liters last year from 1.25
million liters in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Imported wines mainly come from France, the United States,
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Chile, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
Worried that the popularity of foreign wines could feed the
country's widening trade deficit, the department called on people
to drink less.
</P>
<P>
The department has also launched a program to build more local
wineries to encourage Thais to drink Thai wines.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently has four companies which are permitted to
produce wine for domestic consumption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Show of Force Undesirable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The complicated situation in
the Gulf area turned tense after the U.S. launched several cruise
missile strikes against Iraq in the past two days, causing serious
attention and concern from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have strongly condemned the U.S. military
operation. Even some of its allies have expressed reservations on
the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attack against Iraq, a parade of its force, was
designed to meet the needs of its coming presidential election,
and at the same time, to help safeguard its strategic interests in
the Middle East and other regions of the world. It violated Iraq's
territorial integrity and sovereignty, thus revealing once again
U.S. hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the U.S. is using its force to bully the
weak. Under severe international sanctions following the 1990-91
Gulf War, Iraq, with its national power and military strength
having been crippled greatly, can hardly be considered one of
U.S. rivals. So whenever Iraq fails to fall in with its wishes,
the United States will at once use military power and
strike. Such overbearing behaviour has certainly met condemnation
from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the U.S. operation is an interference in the internal
affairs of another country, trampling on the norms of
international laws. Iraq is a sovereign country, recognized by the
international community, and its territorial integrity and
sovereignty should be respected. Its actions on its territory are
its international affaris that brook no foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
With no formal authorization from the United Nations, the
United States and some other countries established in Iraq the
"no-fly zone". And now the United States on its own launched
missiles against Iraq. All these are nothing but evident
interference in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
With peace and development being the trend of world today, it
is the common desire of nations to settle the disputes through
negotiations rather than resorting to forces. Countries, big or
small, strong or weak, are equal, and should all abide by the
basic principles in international relations. Anyone attempting to
run against this trend will only have to swallow the bitter
fruit.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: First Netanyahu-Arafat Handshake Induces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ironically, Netanyahu faced much stronger criticism from
within his Likud faction, including National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, Science Minister Ze'ev Begin,
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy and senior Likud lawmaker
Uzi Landau.
</P>
<P>
Begin, son of late hardline premier Menachem Begin, said the
meeting contradicted the Likud platform and the government's
guidelines. He warned that it constituted "capitulation to
extortion, and giving in to blackmailers always only increases
their demands."
</P>
<P>
Sharon, former defense minister who launched the aggression
into Lebanon in 1982 in a plot to eliminate Arafat's forces,
curtly labeled the meeting a big mistake, saying the "business
with Arafat should not have been conducted at this level."
</P>
<P>
Landau, head of the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense committee, termed the meeting "a blow to Israel's
interest and a hindrance to our future negotiating stance." He
said that this would encourage "Arafat to continue breaching the
accords."
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, Netanyahu is expected to win majority
support from his party, which will convene a central committee
meeting late today to discuss the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jewish settlement leaders denounced
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting as "morally repugnant." A spokesman for
the Council of Jewish Settlers warned against "a deepening
ideological bankruptcy of the government."
</P>
<P>
Regardless of all the dramas and cynicism, Israeli analysts
hailed the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting as an important U-turn by
Netanyahu from a party ideologue to a pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was the message," wrote David Makovsky, chief
diplomatic writer of the prestigious English-language daily The
Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
He listed three reasons to illustrate the significance of the
meeting: First, it shows the Oslo accords have reached a level of
general acceptance which permits future progress; second,
Netanyahu still enjoyed broad support within his Likud party
despite antagonism from a few ideologues; third, the meeting is
also a milestone for Netanyahu's political Odyssey as he has
turned from an ideologue to pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
In the words of U.N. coordinator for the territories Terje
Larsen, the facilitator of Oslo accords and recent secret talks
on Netanyahu-Arafat meeting, Netanyahu "is taking over the good
ship Oslo with Arafat."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, Netanyahu and Arafat are now in the same boat, and
Netanyahu seems to be realizing that they will sink or swim
together," Makovsky added.

<HEADLINE> "China Threat" Theory Destabilizes Asia: ROK's Ex-Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The so-called "China Threat"
theory is "harmful" and "very destabilizing" for Asian countries,
ROK's former Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the situation in the Asia Pacific region towards
the turn of the 21st century, Han, now special representative of
UN Secretary-General on Cyprus, said it is important for major
powers in the region to maintain good relationships.
</P>
<P>
This is in the interests of the big countries themselves, and
is in the interests of the rest of Asia as well, he said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Han, who believes Asia can not have collective security like
Europe, said Asia should seek cooperation among major powers and
common understanding and multilateral security cooperation among
all countries, adding that these aspects are equally important.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, economic prosperity in Asia offers a better
chance for maintaining peace, while the growing economic
independence of Asian countries demands more and more cooperation,
and there is a greater need for peace.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the situation in the Korean Peninsular, the
ex-foreign minister held that there are three possibilities;
maintaining the status quo, the realization of peaceful
co-existence of the north and south -- if not reunification,
through their productive dialogues, or the occurrence of drastic
changes due to certain reasons.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, he said, multi-nation cooperation is needed to
help prevent the situation in the peninsular from moving towards
an unfavorable direction.

<HEADLINE> Citizens Urge Cracking Down on Shoddy Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Shoppers in Guangzhou and
Shanghai have called for a law to crack down on the widespread
sale of fake goods in the country.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey by Guangzhou Damen Information Industry
Corporation showed that four out of five people quizzed had once
bought shoddy goods.
</P>
<P>
And over 68 percent held that fake goods were spotted
"everywhere", with less than one percent replying that there were
"very few" fakes.
</P>
<P>
When asked "what goods are faked the most?" 56.7 percent
answered famous brand clothing, followed by foodstuffs, drinks,
tonic medicines and audio and video products.
</P>
<P>
More Guangzhou citizens held that top-grade domestic electrical
appliances, audio, video products and computer software were more
likely to be shoddy, while Shanghai residents found more fakes
among famous brand name clothes, health care commodities and
foods.
</P>
<P>
Though China has launched many crackdowns on fakes, almost 62
percent of people said the operations were only partly effective,
29.3 percent of people said they were fruitless, while only 8.3
people said the operations were quite effective.
</P>
<P>
Suggesting ways of increasing the curb on shoddy goods, 71.1
percent said a special law should be adopted, 62 percent said the
government must take more strict measures, and 55 percent held
that consumers themselves should learn more self-protection when
buying goods.

<HEADLINE> Brain Acts Like Personnel Manager: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The brain acts like a
dynamic personnel manager, constantly shifting its "workers" --
the nerve cells that control nearly all bodily functions -- from
one cell group to another to deal with a variety of
ever-changing demands, an Israeli science magazine said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by Weizmann Institute of
Science in the latest issue of Science Tips, a new study
disproves the prevailing notion that nerve cells, or neurons, in
the brain either act on their own or form permanent working
groups.
</P>
<P>
Instead, neurons are shown to belong to a number of different
groups and to change their momentary affiliation in accordance
with the task to be performed, thus coordinating the processes
involved in seeing, hearing and movement control.
</P>
<P>
Using a ground-breaking technique that makes it possible to
record the electrical activity of many individual neurons at the
same time, Prof. Ad Aertsen of the Neuronbiology Department and
his colleagues at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have shown
that two neurons may closely communicate with each other when
processing one type of signal, but completely ignore each other
when responding to another kind.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, if these findings are corroborated,
they will have implications for such fields as neurology, where
it is vital to know how a task carried out by one set of neurons
may affect the function of other brain cells, and computer
science, branches of which deal with simultaneous processing of
information flowing along multiple paths.

MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate
slowed down further to 7.9 percent in August from 8.9 percent in
July on the annual basis as prices of food, beverage, tobacco,
fuel, light and water went down in the month, the National
Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a report released here that inflation rates
in the prices of most food items generally slowed down in August.

percent last month from 21 percent in July, corn to 17.9 percent
from 21.7 percent, dairy products to 5.4 percent from 5.8 percent
and meat to 4.3 percent from 6.3 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the inflation rates in the food, beverage
and tobacco (FBT) and fuel, light and water (FLW) indices went
down by 1.9 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, on a month-on-month basis, prices in the country
increased by 1.0 percent in August, compared to 0.1 percent in
July, it said.
</P>
<P>
In August, prices of vegetables and fruits were higher than
that in the previous months because of typhoons, it said.

Inflation started hitting double-digit levels in the
Philippines in September 1995 at 11.3 percent and kept the trend
until May this year.

NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Armed gangsters robbed 1.5
million Kenya Shilling (about 30,000 U.S. Dollars) teachers'
wages on Wednesdayin Machakos Town around Nairobi, the capital of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The gun-totting thugs grabbed the money as it was being taken
to the Teachers Service Commission offices in Machakos for
payment of thousands of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Four thugs confronted two cashiers as they returned from
withdrawing the money at Kenya Commercial Bank in the town. One
was hit on the hand and released the metal box containing the
money.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japanese Invaders Rob China's Bone Inscriptions 60 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese invaders robbed
ancient Chinese tombs and returned to Japan with a large number of
inscribed bones and tortoise shells during its 1937 invasion of
China, a Chinese archivist claims.
</P>
<P>
The taking of the priceless relics caused a great loss to China
in the preservation of its cultural heritage, Tang Jianshe, Deputy
Curator of Henan Provincial Archives, said.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing the ongoing 13th International Congress on
Archives in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Originating from Shang Dynasty (16 to 11 century B.C.), the
inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells were the earliest
Chinese characters ever found, and Anyang City in Henan Province
had been Shang's capital "Yin" which was eventually ruined when
the Zhou Dynasty (11 Century B.C.) was established.
</P>
<P>
Records kept by the Henan Provincial Archives showed that after
Japanese troops occupied Anyang in 1937, the Tokyo Teikoku
University, and some other institutions, sent groups to Anyang to
excavate on an extensive scale for inscribed bones and tortoise
shells, and other kinds of cultural relics, and sent the unearthed
Chinese cultural relics to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Documents at the Yin Ruins Museum show that among the 12,443
slices of inscribed bone and tortoise shell, many were taken from
China during the invasion.
</P>
<P>
The inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells were first
discovered in 1899 in a traditional Chinese medicine shop by an
official of Qing Dynasty. The collection of the inscribed bones
and tortoise shells started soon after their first discovery.
</P>
<P>
China now keeps about 120,000 slices. Experts have discovered
more than 5,000 characters on the bones and tortoise shells, and
fixed meanings for 1,500 of them.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 26,000 slices of inscribed bones
and tortoise shells are kept abroad, with most of them were taken
by foreign missionaries.

<HEADLINE> China to Survey Business Environment for APEC-funded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, Philippines, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China will survey
from next year the operating environment of small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) funded by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) in the country.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, which was put forward by Chinese delegates who
are attending the ongoing Third APEC Ministerial Meeting on SMEs,
aims to create a more liberal operating environment for SMEs
funded by APEC members in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, vice minister of China's State Economic and Trade
Commission, said at the meeting that the project is expected to
assess the circumstances faced by SMEs in preparation of policy
readjustment recommendations to the relevant government agencies
in China.
</P>
<P>
He said the project, which will begin from next April and
conclude in December 1998, will give an accurate and accessible
study on the business environment in China by reviewing the
existing literature on overseas investment, field trips to SMEs
and seminars in coastal, central and western parts of the country
respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 16 out of the 18 APEC members have direct
investments in China, the project will benefit not only the
existing SMEs but also most of the APEC member economies. The
project will greatly facilitate the globalization of the SMEs in
the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen's report, over 260,000 enterprises have been
set up in China with investments from overseas by 1996, and most
of them are SMES funded by APEC member economies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- German driver Heinz-Herald
Frentzen, the rising star in Formula One racing arena, will
replace the current championships leader British driver Damon
Hill to drive for the William Renault Team, according to a
statement issued here today by the Williams Grand Prix Engineering
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Frank Williams, the director of the Williams Team, announced
the decision earlier today at the Williams headquarters in London
after dropping successful Hill without giving any reasons earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
The director also paid tribute to Hill, who has been with the
Williams Team for six years, by saying: "Damon has contributed
greatly to the team, both as a test and race driver for the last
six years."
</P>
<P>
"I think his record speaks for itself, as very few drivers have
ever approached his record of 20 wins in 64 starts. He will be
missed by everyone at our Grove factory and we all wish him the
best of luck for the remainder of this year, as well as the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Frentzen, 29, is in his third year of Formula One racing after
making his debut for the Sauber-Mercedes team at the 1994 Brzilian
Grand Prix. He finished 13th in his first Formula One season but
made marked progress to the ninth place in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Frentzen, who is commonly regarded as one of the most talented
young drivers, will join World IndyCar champion Jacques Villeneuve
in the Williams Team next year.

NAIROBI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya does not support terrorism
whether it is local or international, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka said on Wednesday.
</P>

he visited oil refineries and the Kenya Port Authorities.

He has also held talks with his host President Daniel arap
Moi. The Iranian President is urging African countries to turn to
his country for help instead of stooping too low to the Western
nations which attack strings to aid.

<HEADLINE> NZ Labor Party Signals No More State Asset Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Labor Party
indicated today that it will end state asset sale if it becomes
part of the next government.
</P>
<P>
Deputy leader Michael Cullen said that he has reviewed
remaining state assets and that he intends to recommend no further
asset sales should his party comes to power.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party sees the state-owned enterprise (SOE) model as
a viable permanent mode of operation, not a halfway house to
privatization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor started the economic reform in New Zealand 12 years
ago. It restructured many government departments into SOEs, and
later sold some of them to private investors in order to repay
government debts.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, it supported the present National Party
government in the sale of the state Forestry Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: First Netanyahu-Arafat Handshake Induces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The first handshake between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Wednesday has received mixed reactions in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party, which championed the Oslo peace
agreements, hailed the first sign of recognition of Arafat by a
Likud leader as a victory for its peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader and former premier Shimon Peres demanded
Netanyahu, who ridiculed Peres for his meeting with Arafat
during the election campaign, to "beg forgiveness" from the
slain Labor premier Yitzhak Rabin for the Likud's election
propaganda against his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for some courage and decency. Enough with
cynicism ... Netanyahu must stand up today and ask for
forgiveness and admit that he was wrong in the election campaign,
and that it was necessary to meet Arafat and negotiate with him,"
Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Peres praised the meeting as "a tremendous victory" for
Labor's peace policies, stressing it had put an end to the idea
of "Greater Israel" because the meeting was held on the basis of
the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he expressed fears about future, citing
Netanayhu "went to meet Arafat without having a plan for the
future, an idea of the permanent settlement or a vision of the
future of the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat held a long-delayed historic meeting at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip Wednesday
to break the deadlock on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders pledged to push forward
the stalled peace process based on the signed agreements and
resolve all differences through negotiations within the framework
of the joint steering committee.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Shahal, Labor's former public security minister,
humiliated Netanyahu for his meeting with Arafat as "the
greatest fraud and cynical deception in our history."
</P>
<P>
Beyond the criticism for Netanyahu's limitless cynicism,
Labor's former minister Yossi Beilin expressed "heavy fears"
that "there will be no understanding and no progress beyond the
meeting itself."

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports to Iraq Hang in Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Doubts over the future of the
UN oil-for food deal with Iraq after the US missile attack on that
country further reduce the chances that Iraq will buy Thai rice,
Thai Commerce Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had approached the Thai Commerce Ministry earlier this
year to buy 250,000 tons of Thai rice on credit terms and an
unspecified amount of cash, the officials ware quoted today by the
local news paper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
But in July, the Thai government decided to turn down the
request because the Thai export-import bank would not approve the
one-year credit sought by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq may turn to private Thai exporters for help
because it was known to need 400,000 to 500,000 tons of rice, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said they had not heard of private deals with
Iraq, but agreed that the collapse of the oil-for-food program
would make exporters even more reluctant to do business with Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) Chairman and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan held a
secret meeting with senior diplomats of the Iraqi Embassy in
Ankara on the situation in Iraq, the local newspaper Milliyet
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Erbakan and the Iraqi diplomats discussed the
latest developments of the situation in Iraq at the prime
minister's residence at Ayranci District of Ankara late Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Justice Minister Sevket Kazan and an official of the
Turkish Foreign Ministry attended the secret meeting which
lasted for one hour, reported the paper. The Iraqi ambassador to
Turkey is now in Baghdad, said Turkish sources.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan declined to disclose the details of his meeting with
the Iraqi diplomats after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said in his government program that Turkey would
develop relations with the Islamic world, especially neighboring
Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration did not make contacts with Erbakan on
the situation in Iraq, but informed Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller of the latest developments in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish sources said that maybe the White House suspected
that Erbakan would inform Baghdad about the U.S. military
operations in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan once accused the 1991 Gulf war staged by the U.S.-led
allied forces as "a Zionist war."
</P>
<P>
On August 12, Erbakan, who was visiting Iran, dispatched
Kazan and Education Minister Mehmet Saglam to Baghdad to hold
talks with Iraqi officials on means of boosting bilateral
relations in the fields of trade, economy and politics after Iraq
signed with the United Nations the oil-for-food deal in May.
</P>
<P>

U.S. dollars since the imposition of the U.N. trade embargo on

<HEADLINE> CMC Vice-Chairman Meets US Pacific Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's
Central Military Commission, Chi Haotian, today met with Joseph
Prueher, pacific commander for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a state councillor and defense minister,
extended a welcome to Prueher, who is on his first visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that as two major countries, the maintenance of
friendly relations between China and the US is of significance
not only for the Asia-Pacific region but the whole world.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to its relations with the US, Chi
pointed out. He expressed the hope that the good momentum in Sino-US
relations, which emerged recently, will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
"Contact is better than containment, and dialogue is better
than confrontation", he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the basis for the development of bilateral
relations is the three joint communiques between the two sides,
with the Taiwan issue as the key.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries should adhere to the principles
of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in
each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of a new century, Chi said, the two sides
should bring about a healthy and stable Sino-US relation with a
view to the future.
</P>
<P>
He also refuted the so-called "China threat", calling it a
"sheer nonsense".
</P>
<P>
Prueher told Chi that the US Defense Secretary William J. Perry
is expecting Chi to visit the US.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US and China have common interests, and it is
important for the two sides to understand and respect each other.
</P>
<P>
The US does not view China as a threat, Prueher said. He added
that China's prosperity is also in the interests of the US, thus
the two countries should solve any problem peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the US adheres to the "one China" policy, and the
Taiwan issue is up to the Chinese themselves to resolve.
</P>
<P>
Prueher said that the frank and constructive discussion between
him and Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the General Staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), has created favorable
conditions for the improvement and development of relations
between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Xiong and US Ambassador to China Sasser James Ralph were
present at today's meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The US visitors arrived in China on September 2 at the invitation
of the Headquarters of the General Staff of the PLA on a week-long
official visit to China.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Criticizes Iraqi President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri has criticized Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for his "blunder" that gave a good pretext to the U.S. to once
more exhibit its hegemonic and arrogant attitude.
</P>
<P>
"I think Saddam was wrong in invading Irbil, and to pose for an
attack on Sulaymaniyah was another blunder of the Iraqi ruler,"
the Iranian speaker said in a report carried by today's English
daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
However, Nateq-Nouri noted, the U.S. attacks on Iraq was an
overt interference in the domestic affairs of Iraq and a
violation of the rights of a nation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker said the U.S. missile attacks against Iraq
were a "blatant breach of international regulations and norms."
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi citizens must decide the fate of their country for
themselves," he said. "The Iraqi citizens must be permitted to
decide their fate themselves, and what the U.S. has done up to now
is to encroach the Iraqi people's right to decide for themselves."
</P>
<P>
As a neighbor of Iraq, Iran could not remain indifferent toward
the conditions in that country, Nateq-Nouri said, adding that Iran
was following up the developments in Iraq with concern because
should these attacks continue, "it will upset the regional
equations and balance."
</P>
<P>
"We should wait a little until the case is clarified, then we
can make a careful assessment of the developments in Iraq," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati as saying that "both Washington and Baghdad made
mistakes."
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of our assessment, both governments have
committed mistakes and what they have done is against the
innocent people of Iraq," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said both the government of Iraq and the U.S.
Administration "are equally guilty of harming the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any attacks against innocent people. What
the U.S. has done is against innocent people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati stressed that "we are also opposed to the recent
attacks launched by the Iraqi government against its own citizens
in northern Iraq."

<HEADLINE> China to Help Conserve Angkor Relics in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China has offered to give a
helping hand to the conservation of the world-renowned Angkor
relics in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
A number of the relics are to be repaired by China in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics,
said that the project, starting next year, is the first time China
has offered cultural aid to another country.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the Chinese experts, who closely studied
the Angkor relics last year, will carry out a further study next
month, and will select the objects for conservation after
consultation with the Cambodian side.
</P>
<P>
The Angkor relics, built during 802-1219, are concentrated in a
300 square kilometer area in northwestern Cambodia, the capital of
the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire from the ninth to the 15th Century.
</P>
<P>
Angkor, with its magnificent temple architecture and reliefs,
was built to symbolize the universe in accordance with the model
provided by Hindu cosmology.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th Century, the empire moved its capital to Phnom
Penh, leaving Angkor to decline. The site was discovered and
refurbished in the middle 19th Century, but was again damaged by
fire in wars during recent decades.
</P>
<P>
To save the Angkor relics, which have been given World Heritage
List status, the Cambodian government and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
launched an international movement, involving a dozen countries
including India, Poland, Japan, France and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> "Dual Recognition" Unacceptable, Says People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- "Dual recognition" with regard
to relations with China is absolutely unacceptable, says a signed
article carried by the People's Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The article written by Gu Ping refers to the so-called "dual
recognition" of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, a
stand point advocated by some South African leaders. It says that
the issue of Taiwan is a matter of principle that has an important
bearing on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and is a
cardinal issue of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China. The government of the People's Republic
of China is the sole legitimate government of China," says the
article.
</P>
<P>
Since the new China was founded in 1949, that principle has
been the prerequisite for any country to set up diplomatic ties
with China, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It says that it is in compliance with this "one China"
principle that the United Nations restored to China its legitimate
seat in the U.N., by expelling Taiwan from the international
organization.
</P>
<P>
The article says that on August 26, a South African leader,
treating Taiwan as a "nation," said his country would continue to
support Taiwan, insisting on "dual recognition."
</P>
<P>
The so-called "dual recognition," it says, is in essence an
attempt to create "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," which
means a split of China and therefore, has all along been rejected
by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The article says that any country which wants to establish
diplomatic ties with China can maintain economic and trade
relations with Taiwan but not official relations with it.
</P>
<P>
If South Africa wants to have official diplomatic ties with
China, the article says, it has to abide by the principle by
severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognizing the
People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of
China.
</P>
<P>
It should not have been difficult for those South African
leaders who had been fighting for many years for the birth of a
new South Africa to understand this principled stand of China, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
"Just think. Will you agree if some people in South Africa,
with the backing of external forces, try to split South Africa
into a 'black homeland' and a 'white homeland'?"
</P>
<P>
"Do not do to others what you would not wish to have been done
to yourself." This old saying of China is of universal
significance, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to understand though that South African leaders went
so far as to say that it is "immoral" to sever ties with Taiwan,
creating an excuse for "dual recognition," the article says.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently supported the just cause of the South
African people in fighting racism and has provided them with a
large amount of unselfish assistance, it notes.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela himself has repeatedly said that China
is an old friend of the people, especially of the black people, of
South Africa, says the article.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, which sided with the white minority-led government
against the black people when apartheid ran rampant in South
Africa, provided some financial support to the African National
Congress only when the victory of the black people was in sight,
the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The article says that anyone who upholds justice and faces up
to reality can tell what is "moral" and what is "immoral."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people cherish and are willing to further develop
their friendship with the South African people, the article says.
</P>
<P>
To South Africa, China does not have special request, the
article says, adding that it only hopes that in developing ties
with China, South Africa observes the stance on Taiwan adopted by
the United Nations and the majority nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, South African leaders who hesitated to sever ties with
Taiwan over the past few years are now publicly advocating "dual
recognition," not hesitating to violate recognized international
norms and relevant U.N. resolutions. This hurts the feelings of
the Chinese people and damages the image of South Africa in the
world, says the article.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people sincerely hope that South African leaders
will not be tempted by the "dollar diplomacy" of Taiwan, but
starting from the fundamental interests of the South African
people, make the right choice in developing relations with China,
the article concluses.

LUSAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A racket has been exposed in
which some Zambian telecommunication employees accumulated 287
million Kwacha (about 240,000 U.S. Dollars) in dubious telephone
calls made by alleged drug dealers on other customers' accounts.
</P>
<P>
A number of employees in the northern city of Ndola, southern
city of Livingstone and capital city of Lusaka have been

Zambian telecommunication employees and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
In August the employees accumulated 85 million Kwacha in local
calls and 202 million Kwacha in international calls made on the
telephone mumber 322693, which raised suspicion and prompted the
investigation by police and the Zambia Telecommunications
Company.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepali Opposition to Decide on Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
is busy hammering out its final position on a Nepal-India treaty
on the development of a border river, which it earlier vowed not
to ratify during the ongoing parliament session.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Wednesday began discussions on a task
force report on the treaty amid pressures from other leftist
parties for its rejection.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the CPN-UML will decide in a few days whether it
supports or rejects the treaty, which was signed on the prime
minister level last February in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India treaty on the integrated development of the
Mahakali river, Nepal's western boundary with India, has been
earlier hailed by officials here as a watershed of bilateral
cooperation on water development between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The treaty lays down principles and framework arrangements for
sharing of irrigation, hydropower and flood control benefits from
future water projects on the border river on an equitable basis,
between Nepal and India, Nepali officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, resistance groups in Nepal claimed the treaty provides
less benefits for Nepal than that for India like earlier treaties
on water development between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member task force, formed by the CPN-UML last April to
study the text of the Mahakali treaty, earlier this week handed
over its report to the party leadership on the treaty's advantages
and disadvantages to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari told the parliament two
months ago that his party would not allow the Mahakali treaty to
be ratified during the present parliament session.
</P>
<P>
It was reported there is a division within CPN-UML leaders
regarding to the ratification of the treaty, which has been tabled
to the parliament for approval by the government.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said a few of CPN-UML leaders favored
ratification of the treaty but a majority of the party leadership
argued the treaty could be ratified only after some necessary
corrections.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has made it clear that no changes could
be made in the treaty.
</P>
<P>
With its 88 seats in the powerful 205-seat Lower House, the
opposition's stand will decide the fate of the Mahakali treaty as
any treaty on water development in Nepal needs a two-thirds
majority for ratification in the house.
</P>
<P>
A group of small leftist parties Wednesday urged the CPN-UML,
the main opposition party, to reject the Mahakali treaty by
stating it "against Nepal's national interest."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speculations on the government's lobbying for
foreign influence to the treaty's ratification arose here as a
high-level United States diplomat arrived Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
US Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Robin Raphel is
expected to meet top government officials and opposition leaders
here during her five-day official visit, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier some opposition MPs criticized against the remarks by a
 visiting British official on the Mahakali treaty, accusing the
government of lobbying foreign interference in the country's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
British Parliamentary Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Liam
Fox said here on August 26 that Nepal should ratify the Mahakali
treaty as a prerequisite to attract foreign investment into the
country.

NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi showed his
superiority to defeat Thomas Muster in the quarter-finals of the
U.S. Open tennis tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded American held off the third-seeded Austrian
and used two hours 32 minutes to score a 6-2, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2
victory and a semi-final berth for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
Agassi spent most of the match parked comfortably on the
baseline, controlling the points by rifling his groundstrokes
from corner to corner.
</P>
<P>
After being flattened in the opening two sets, Muster got off
the canvas to battle back from 0-2 to take the third set.
</P>
<P>
Rain once stopped the match. After they coming back to the
court, the Austrian knew clearly that his chance had gone away.
</P>
<P>
Muster fell behind 0-3 before holding serve. However, he had
never found back his form and conceded the last set at 2-6.
</P>
<P>
Agassi next faces Michael Chang, the second-seeded
Chinese-American who advanced to the semi-finals for the first
time in four years by beating unseeded Spaniard Javier Sanchez

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls APEC Small Businesses to Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, Philippines, September 5 (XINHUA) -- Philippine President
Fidel Ramos today stressed the need for small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) to work closely together to succeed in a more
competitive environment of borderless trade.
</P>
<P>
In a video-taped welcome message to the delegates of the third
Ministerial Meeting on SMEs of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) being held here today, the president said, "To
survive, small enterprises must network and seek information to
improve their products and process."
</P>
<P>
He said the APEC member economies have addressed the problem of
the lack of information with the establishment of the APEC Center
for Technology Exchange and Training for SMEs in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The center, which will be inaugurated on September 7 in the
country, will help to maintain constant contacts among the APEC
economies and provide training to bodies involved in promoting
SMEs and facilitating information and technology transfer in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"In a fluid international business environment, the services of
the center will enhance the competitive posture of small
enterprises. The center will keep them attuned to shifts in
prices, designs as well as markets. That should allow SMEs the
advantages of pro-acting and reacting on time when market becomes
extremely blind," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting opened here this morning with
the theme of "Creating the Climate for the Globalization of SMEs."

footballer underwent surgery Thursday after being paralysed from
the neck down when he was hurt in a friendly soccer match,
according to the annoucement of the soccer officials of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old footballer played for the Woodlands Wellington,

<P>
The part-time professional, who played for Singapore seven
years ago, was hurt seven minutes after taking the field as a

He was hurt when Selangor midfielder Mubin Mokhtar fell heavily
on him after both went for the ball. Two of his vertebrae were
fractured.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that nerves in the spinal cord could have been
damaged, which could lead to permanent paralysis if he does not
recover from the operation.

<HEADLINE> Rival Student Bodies Agree to Restore Peace at Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Rival student organizations in
the Dhaka University have reached a consensus that normal academic
activities would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Because of violent clashes between the opposition-backed
Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) and the pro-government Bangladesh
Chhatra League (BCL) over the issue of outsiders' occupation of
dormitories, the JCD has enforced an indefinite strike that forced
suspension of classes and other academic activities at the campus
since August 25.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the consensus was reached last
night in a joint meeting of leaders of different student bodies
including the JCD and the BCL with the acting Vice Chancellor of
the university Prof. Shahiduddin Ahmed at his request.
</P>
<P>
The JCD leaders agreed to withdraw its indefinite strike, the
sources said, adding that the meeting also reached an agreement
that the resident students who were staying outside their halls
would be rehabilitated in their respective halls.
</P>
<P>
To rehabilitate the "genuine" resident students in their
dormitories, the meeting decided that all such students would be
summoned in their hall auditoriums and would be allowed to enter
the hall after verifying their identity cards in presence of the
concerned officials and teachers and student leaders.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will resume this afternoon and a final peace accord
is likely to be signed, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Central Chinese Province Increasing Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A megalopolis made up of six
cities in central China's Henan Province, with the provincial
capital as its center, is the focus of accelerated urban
construction, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, and Luoyang,
Jiaozuo, Xinxiang, Kaifeng and Xuchang cover a quarter of the
province's territory and contributes half of its gross domestic
product. Their population accounts for one-third of the province's
total.
</P>
<P>
To develop the economy of the new megalopolis, the six cities
have adopted a policy of close co-operation, while aiding their
own pillar industries, forming a rational industrial pattern as a
result.
</P>
<P>
The officials say they will work harder to turn the region into
a leading force for economic development and the province's
opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
This includes establishing an open market mechanism in common,
adjusting and unifying the construction of major basic facilities,
and unifying industrial layout, and agricultural production, as
well as management of water resources and land development.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say they believe that because of its location,
the megalopolis will also be a transit place for economic
expansion in central and western parts of the country in funding,
technology, professional skills, and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
Because of its transport advantages, with several trunk railway
lines passing through it, the region has become a popular spot for
investment, having attracted more than 20 billion yuan (2.4
billion U.S. dollars) of outside investment. When more key state
projects are completed, investment will potentially amount to 100
billion yuan, the officials noted.

NANCHANG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Shugen, a farmer in Yaobu
Village, in Jiangxi Province, established a center in his home to
push the use of plastic sheeting for growing vegetables, and teach
villagers how to use it and a dozen related techniques.
</P>

As a result, the village soon became a major vegetable provider
for surrounding areas, and many people made quick money by taking
advantage of advanced farming techniques and were in turn copied
by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 3,700 similar services in the province,
covering more than 97 percent of the townships, which have farmers
with knowledge of various skills as members. They regularly
exchange information and cooperate with institutes of higher
learning and science research institutes.

<HEADLINE> Former Indian PM Questioned Over Bribery Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- In a significant
development, former Indian prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao on
Wednesday was questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation
(CBI) regarding his alleged role in a bribery case, The Hindustan
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Rao has been accused of buying support from four members of
parliament of a small party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), at
the time of a no-confidence motion against the Rao-led government
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High court filed charge sheets against Rao and some
other Congress leaders for their alleged role in the bribery
scandal about three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Highly-placed sources in the CBI said the former prime minister
was questioned by senior CBI officials at his residence in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
CBI sources said that a set of 15 to 20 questions had been
prepared by senior officials prior to the interrogation.
</P>
<P>
During the interrogation, Rao was understood to have flatly
denied any knowledge of the payments made, maintaining that he had
no knowledge whatsoever of any payments made, if there was any.
</P>
<P>
CBI sources described the interrogation as routine and said the
CBI had not reached any conclusions on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges New Poll Campaign Rule to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has called for new regulations on election campaigns to prevent a
repetition of the disorderliness and violence that marked past
elections, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the National Council for Defense and
Security to draw up the regulations in time for the 1997 general
election, scheduled for the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The council's Chairman Lt. Gen. Soekarto, who met President
Soeharto on Wednesday, said the president stressed that election
campaigns should no longer be turned into shows of force by the
political organizations contesting the elections.
</P>
<P>
They should rather be aimed at attracting the sympathy of
voters by contestants stressing their respective programs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The election next year will be the sixth under President
Soeharto. The ruling political group Golkar, which has won all
five previous elections with landslide margins, is pitting itself
against the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
The election will fill 425 of the 500 seats in the lower
house, while the remaining 75 members will be members of the armed
forces, directly-appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
Under the Indonesian law, the military cannot vote in
elections.
</P>
<P>
The current electoral law restricts campaigning to a 25-day
period. Next year, it is slated for April 29 to May 23, official
sources said.

BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov and his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel today agreed to
oppose NATO's eastward expansion plan and the United States'
missile strikes in Iraq, reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Primakov told reporters that Russia's position
on NATO membership for former east bloc states "has remained the
same" and that Moscow will continue a dialogue with NATO on the
expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
Without Russia there could be no security in Europe, stressed
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that although Germany and Russia maintained
different positions on NATO, both nations agreed there should be a
new definition of NATO's ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq since September 3, Primakov
reiterated Russia's opposition to Washington's use of force against
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He said that no resolution rejects the right of Iraqi troops to
be in this or that part of Iraqi territory and Moscow had no plan
to intervene in Baghdad's policy.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that although Bonn and Moscow had different views
on the U.S. missile strikes, both nations agreed there should not
be any escalation of the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Primakov announced that German President Roman Herzog has been
invited to visit Russia for talks with President Boris Yeltsin on
October 12-14.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will fly to Russia on September 7
to meet Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Caution Urged for U.S. Use of Thai Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Thai prime minister
Chatichai Choonhavan said Thailand should be cautious in allowing
the United States to use the U-Tapao naval airbase in Chon Buri
province, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over reports that U.S. B-52 bombers that
attacked Iraq had been refueled in mid-air by U.S. tankers from
the airbase, Chatichai said Thailand gained little when it gave
Americans military access to it.
</P>
<P>
Thailand did its best to help that country in the past, he
said, but in return the country barred Thai labor and goods.
</P>
<P>
The United States used the U-Tapao airbase in the Gulf crisis
and the Gulf war in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Foreign Minister Amnuay Virawan has stressed
that Thailand will not take sides with either the U.S. or Iraq.

STOCKHOLM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- International High
Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt proposed on Tuesday in
Helsinki that Northern European Partnership for Peace (NPFP) be
built to unite the Baltic and the Nordic countries, according to
reports available here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, based on the assumption that no Baltic state was
likely to be granted NATO membership in the bloc's first entries,
would prevent the Baltic region from becoming a vacuum in the
process of new European security structures being formed.
</P>
<P>
According to Bildt, who is also The Swedish Moderate leader and
former Swedish prime minister, common units for international
operations similar to those in Bosnia could be prepared and
trained within the framework of the new establishment.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that the NPFP could work within the broader
framework of security cooperation which the new NATO would offer.
</P>
<P>
At the same time such a structure would not involve any changes
as far as Denmark's and Norway's NATO membership as well as
Sweden's and Finland's non-alignment status are concerned.

ROME, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Tuesday his country "fully supports" Slovenia's

</P>
<P>
Dini expressed the support when meeting with visiting Slovenian

since the end of the Cold War and Slovenia was one of the
candidates likeliest to acquire NATO membership next year.

The EU, as a political and economic body, has now 15 members
and Italy held its rotating presidency in the first six months
this year.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Dini said that their bilateral relations
had been developing healthily since Slovenia and the EU signed a
cooperation agreement in Luxemburg this June.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral trade links, both sides agreed their economies
were highly supplementary and hoped that cooperation accords on

<HEADLINE> APEC Opens 3rd Ministerial Meeting on Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CEBU, Philippines, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of the 18
member economics of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
began their third meeting here today, which aims to strengthen the
capacity of small and medium enterprises (SMES) to compete in a
more competitive and free trade and investment environment in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of "Creating the Climate for the Globalization
of SMES," the two-day meeting is expected to come up with
statements that are related to the future direction of SMES and
how the APEC members working together can accelerate the process
of development of SMES to become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will push for the globalization of SMES by
reviewing the implementation of the SMES Action Program forged by
APEC members in Australia last year and finding ways to strengthen
the cooperation between the APEC economics in the five priority
areas of the program.
</P>
<P>
The five areas address the common difficulties faced by the
SMES in all APEC economics. These areas include human resource
development, information access, technology and technology
sharing, financing and market access.
</P>
<P>
To deal with these difficulties, the meeting will also call for
an increased participation of private sector, the involvement of
support groups and institutions, and enhanced linkages with other
APEC working groups and fora in the development of the SMES.
</P>
<P>
The small and medium enterprises make up more than 90 percent
of all enterprises in the region, contribute 30 to 60 percent of
the gross domestic product, account for 35 percent of the region's
exports and cover between 32 to 84 percent of employment in
individual APEC economics.
</P>
<P>
The first two APEC ministerial meetings on SMES were held in
Japan and Australia in 1994 and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos sent his message to all
delegates who are attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Crisis Not to Affect Brazil's Oil Supply: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf crisis caused
by U.S. missile attacks on Iraq will not affect Brazil's oil
supply, an oil company official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mendes Renno, chairman of the Brazilian Petroleum Company, said
Iraq had been one of Brazil's main oil suppliers before the Gulf
war in 1991. But now Brazil imports oil mainly from Argentina,
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the biggest oil consumer and importer in Latin
America. It produced 900,000 barrels of oil per day last year
which met half of the country's domestic needs. The other half
needs to be imported.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Visit Boosts Ties: Ukrainian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The current visit to Ukraine by
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has laid a sound foundation for
enchancing Ukrainian-German ties, especially in the area of
investment, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said today.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told a joint press conference with Kohl that Ukraine,
listing Germany as one of its most important partners, expects
economic ties between the two countries to further develop.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries have decided to meet regularly and
set up direct hot-line contacts.
</P>
<P>
The two states share identical or similar views over various
political and economic issues and enjoy common interests in many
fields, said Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet republic will give top priority to its
relations with the rest of Europe so as to become a "true"
European nation not only in terms of geology but also of politics,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Kohl said Germany will continue
to give political and economic support to Ukraine while
strengthening ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The German government believes that further German investment
in Ukraine has good prospects, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany so far has only offered 3 million marks (2.03
million U.S. dollars) of aid to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Kohl today also met with Chairman of Supreme Soviet (Ukraine's
parliament) Alexander Moroz.
</P>
<P>
The development of Ukraine is of great importance for the whole
of Europe, especially Germany, Kohl told Moroz.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's positive changes at present are benefiting other
central and eastern European regions. On the contrary, if reforms
in Ukraine bogged down, the balance of Europe would be shaken,
Kohl noted.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also proposed that no consultations over NATO's eastward
expansion start until 1997, when U.S. presidential elections are
over, so as to avoid affections of uncertain factors.
</P>
<P>
NATO should be cautious in expanding itself, warned Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Kohl left here later today for Ukraine's southern port city of
Odessa, and then he is to return home the same day.

BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai fisheries leaders,

<HEADLINE> Bank pledges clean-up loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank
(SDB) has promised to increase its loans to environmental
protection projects during the 1996-2000 period, the China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move of SDB, a policy-oriented creditor in China, reflects
the country's drive to stop the growth of pollution by the year
2000 and to achieve significant improvements by 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to SDB's credit plan, priority is being given to
large- and medium-sized state enterprises' pollution-relief,
energy-saving, clean-production and comprehensive use projects,
which are part of the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The bank said that hi-tech applications and equipment
manufacturing projects meeting the industrial policies for
environmental protection also will get more help.
</P>
<P>
New projects that fail to meet requirements for environmental
protection will be denied credit by the bank, and continuing loans
for extension and reconstruction projects also will be stopped.
</P>
<P>
For 1996, SDB plans to grant 460 million yuan (55.4 million US
dollars) in loans to environmental protection projects, half of
which will go toward cleaning-up the Huaihe River, one of the
country's key pollution-relief projects.
</P>
<P>
SDB has so far provided 726 million yuan (87.5 million US
dollars) in loans to promote environmental protection since the
bank's establishment in March 1994.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers to Set Goal for Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN ministers will set a
goal for the group to have closer economic integration which could
transform the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) into other type of
cooperation at their annual meeting in Jakarta next week,
according to a Thai official.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN may turn its free trade area into a customs union but is
unlikely to go as far as a single market, Krirk-Krai Jirapaet,
Chief of the Business Economics Department, was quoted today by
the local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
A customs union allows free trading of goods among ASEAN
members and setting up of barriers against outsiders, while a
single market allows free trading of goods and services among the
group members with barriers against outsiders.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, at the upcoming meeting, will only state their
goal and senior officials will later work out measures to achieve
that goal, Krirk-Krai said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN leaders raised the issue at their meeting in Bangkok last
December.

WARSAW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Economic
Cooperation Minister Jacek Buchacz has been dismissed over huge
trade deficit sustained by the country, the Polish government
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Buchacz was fired by the president on a proposal by Prime
Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewic, Polish Agency Interpress (PAI)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Buchacz, 48, a Polish Peasant Party (PSL) member, took up the
position on February 6 this year when Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewic formed the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Both Buchacz and the PSL, one of the ruling coalition parties,
have expressed strong opposition to the president's decision,
charging that it violated the agreement on coalition.
</P>
<P>
Buchacz's dismissal was caused by the rise of foreign trade
deficit, according to the PAI.
</P>
<P>
The PAI said that Poland's foreign trade deficit in the first
half of the year reached 3.1 billion U.S. dollars, and the
aggregate deficit is expected to reach 10 billion dollars by the

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Decreases in Key Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Water and soil erosion in
China's eight worst affected areas have declined markedly this
year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted a leading official from the Ministry of Water
Resources as saying that 33,196 square kilometers of eroded land
in the eight areas has been improved due to the erosion-control
programme, which has been operating continuously since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The programme has benefited a total of 43 counties in China's
nine northern, northwestern and northeastern provinces and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
According the ministry, the amount of land already improved
accounts for 45 percent of the programme's target.
</P>
<P>
The eight areas have a population of over seven million within
the country's four largest river valleys, namely, the Songhuajiang
and Liaohe in the northeast, the Yangtze in the south, and the
Yellow and the Haihe rivers in the north.
</P>
<P>
For decades, millions of people lived in poverty in these areas
because over 70 percent of their total land area were suffered
from water and soil loss.
</P>
<P>
But since the carrying out of the programme, thousands of
barren hills have been developed into over 475,000 ha of new farm
land and some 1.8 million ha of of forest have been used to
develop key soil and water resources.
</P>
<P>
More than 230,000 ha of cash fruits and forest, and millions of
ha of grassland have been created.
</P>
<P>
The programme is the first of its kind in China, serving as a
State-level model to demonstrate the importance of improvements to
the environment and farming infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The programme has accelerated rural economic
reconstruction. More than 1.5 million rural residents have begun
to shake off poverty since the implementation of the programme.

COCHABAMBA, Bolivia, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The 14 Rio Group
member countries issued a declaration today, condemning all
attempts to impose unilateral sanctions of an extra-territorial
nature in the application of domestic law of any country.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, issued at the end of the group's two-day

which imposed sanctions on companies in third countries with
investments in Cuba in March, contravenes the rules that govern
relations of co-existence among states.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Law ignores the fundamental principle of
respect for sovereignty and violates international law, the
declaration said.

and underline the importance of the unanimous opinion issued by
the Inter-American Legal Committee of the Organization of the
American States," the declaration said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, MILF to Have Exploratory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are expected to have
exploratory peace talks within this month, the Philippine Journal
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Executive Secretary Ruben Torres as saying
that the MILF earlier sent "feelers" to discuss the comprehensive
peace agreement signed here Monday by the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Torres revealed that two weeks before the formal signing of the
peace accord, he met with one of the MILF leaders and the MILF
leader asked for a copy of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Journal also quoted Manuel Yan, head of the
government panel which had negotiations with the MNLF, as saying
that the MILF is now evaluating the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"They (MILF) told us that they will see if this final peace
agreement is acceptable to them. If it is, they will just
participate in the implementations and if not, then we will have
to conduct separate talks with the MILF," he said.
</P>
<P>
After three years of peace talks, the government and the MNLF
signed the peace agreement Monday to end a 24-year old civil war
in Mindanao, but earlier reports said that the MILF, a breakaway
group of the MNLF, has officially rejected the peace accord and
vowed to continue its armed struggle for an independent Islamic
state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here predicted that a lasting peace in Mindanao could
hardly be achieved before the government brings the 20,000-strong
MILF to the negotiation table.

SHANGHAI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial center, is making a greater effort to standardize
Chinese and foreign-funded property management businesses.
</P>
<P>
A set of provisional rules issued by the municipal government
on property management business ratings in the city, which took
effect September 1 of this year, calls for the city to introduce a
rating and assessment system for Chinese and foreign-funded
property management businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the city departments, the number of
property management businesses has been growing at an annual
average rate of 80 percent since 1992, and stands at 1,400 now.
</P>
<P>
The officials say that the fast growth of the businesses, which
are a necessary part of the overall development of the real estate
sector was accompanied by an increase in the number of problems
that have been the source of complaints from local citizens.
</P>
<P>
The provisional rules, which have 20 articles, are intended to
improve the control of property management companies and to
standardize their operations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Those which refuse to operate according to the rules will have
their license revoked.

<HEADLINE> Negatives of Picture Archives Effectively Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Late Chinese chairman Mao
Zedong visited only one foreign country during his life -- the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, original negatives of the pictures from Mao's
historical visit in the early 1950s became brittle as time went
on. But technicians from the China Photo Archives (CPA), the
largest of its kind in China, repaired the damaged negatives
effectively through a self-styled method of transplantation.
</P>
<P>
The method is especially effective on nitrate negatives, which
were widely used from the 1880s to 1960s. The film base of aging
nitrate negatives produces nitrogen oxide, which causes the
negatives to turn yellow and brittle. Blisters would also grow on
both the upper and lower layers of the negatives.
</P>
<P>
Such negatives may even burst into flames if poorly stored.
</P>
<P>
Peng Xiangao, a CPA technician, discovered that the emulsion
layer which carries images is not damaged by early blistering,
even if negatives bubble and the film base is broken. The image
itself may not be impaired in these cases.
</P>
<P>
By saturating nitrate negatives in clear water, Peng and his
colleagues removed the photographic layer and transferred it to a
new, safe film base without damaging the original image.
</P>
<P>
This unique method could also be applied when restoring early
movies. China filmmakers had produced more than 1,000 movies
before the 1950s, using nitrate film. Less than 20 percent of
these movies have survived.
</P>
<P>
"Since the density, contrast, clarity, and image layer of the
original are safely transplanted and completely preserved, the
method is better than other forms of copying, including the
computerized image processing technique which is now popular
around the world," said CPA director Xu Youzhu.
</P>
<P>
Most old nitrate negatives owned by CPA were saved through this
process, Xu said, adding that her technicians are now working on
computerized index technology and are trying to store CPA
collections in optical discs.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1984, the CPA has collected some 1.6 million
original negatives, 2.6 million copied negatives, and 5.6 million
pictures. Their collection dates from 1839, when photography was
first practiced, to present times.

<HEADLINE> China Speeding up Modernization of Housing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts
to modernize its housing industry, in a bid to launch large-scale,
quality construction of residential housing nationwide.
</P>
<P>
A group of large cities and provinces will serve as pilot
sites, including the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
Changchun and Harbin as well as the provinces of Jiangsu,
Zhejiang, Shangdong, Guangdong and Sichuan, according to a source
from the Ministry of Construction, which recently set forth the
modernization program.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to spend three to five years to complete
preparations for the drive.
</P>
<P>
A senior ministry official noted that despite remarkable
development in the housing sector in recent years, it has a long
way to go to catch up with the advanced countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China's annual housing construction
totals one billion sq m. And investment in the housing sector
accounts for 30 percent of the country's fixed-asset investment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is an urgent need to upgrade the industry,
improve both efficiency and quality of housing construction, and
use higher-quality building materials.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged the pilot sites to give top priority to the
design of urban layout, and the introduction and application of
new technologies, in order to set up a standard and
market-oriented housing production system.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Confirms Fresh US Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The General Command of the
Iraqi Armed Forces confirmed at midnight Wednesday the country
suffered the third round of missiles attack, which came only
several hours after the anti-aircraft artillery opened fire on
hostile targets in the dark skies over the capital.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation came in a statement issued by the General
Command of the Armed Forces. It said the Americans fired a salvo
of missiles aimed at some military installations and civilian
centers in Iraq at 8:45 p.m. local time Wednesday, and some of the
missiles fell onto the capital.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that most of the missiles were shot down by
Iraqi soldiers, but it did not mention the number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign correspondents visited a crowded residential
quarters in Baghdad, which was hit by one missile. As a result,
one cyclist was killed and six others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Before the missile attack Wednesday evening, the artillery
units of the Iraq army in Baghdad fired twice at unidentified
"hostile targets."
</P>
<P>
There were an interval of several minutes between the two
artillery salvoes, but no sound of sirens was heard.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified "hostile targets," however, were believed to be
missiles fired by the U.S. navy ships in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua correspondents witnessed Iraqi anti-artillery guns
opening fire on the unidentified targets in the skies above the
Iraqi capital. Deafening sounds of the artillery roar were heard
from various directions, coupled with sounds of explosions in the
skies afar.
</P>
<P>
However, tranquility prevailed in the streets of Baghdad
despite the sounds of shells, while shoppers were strolling along
the street shops and vehicles continuing to move as usual.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the capital were seen standing on the balconies of
their home buildings, watching the glistering traces of the
artillery duels in the dark skies.

<HEADLINE> US, Britain Reconfirm Mutual Support in Gulf Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain today reconfirmed their mutual strong support and
cooperation in dealing with the crisis in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made after talks between U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry and his British counterpart, Michael
Portillo, at the Pentagon earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers told reporters that both the United
States and Britain are determined to "take whatever actions are
necessary to enforce" non-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While denying that there were differences within the Western
allies on the latest U.S. military operations in Iraq, Perry said
"I fully expect the French to continue participation in the
(Western) coalition" in enforcing the non-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief alleged that U.S. operations "have
completed, successfully completed" by attacking "a total of 14
Iraqi air defense facilities south of the 33rd parallel."
</P>
<P>
Perry noted that the United States has observed "a general
pullback of Iraqi forces" in the northern non-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
"But I wanted to caution you that there are still over 40,000
forces in that region, and they're still in a very dangerous
position," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perry admitted that "maintaining security and stability" in the
region would be a "longtime problem for which there's no single
solution."

<P>
NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks edged higher
today, struggling against a weak bond market as trading turned
cautious before Friday's key report on employment levels.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average traded in a narrow range,
adding 8.51 to 5,656.90.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,380 up and its volume totaling
351.26 million shares as against 333.50 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.61 to 352.37, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.52 to 1,143.81.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.52 to 1,143.81, but the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.45 to 557.34.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were pressured throughout the session by a weak bond
market. As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
rose to 7.09 percent.
</P>
<P>
There were no new economic data today to steer trading.
Friday's monthly employment report could be the determining factor
in whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this
month to keep inflation steady by slowing the economy, according
to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Macedonia Sign 7 Inter-State Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the
Yugoslav and Macedonian governments signed in Skopje today seven
inter-state agreements on trade, finance, transport and customs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on trade, which envisages the lifting of customs
and other taxes in trade and gradual reduction of the list of
products on the quota regime, was signed by visiting Yugoslav
Prime Minister Radoje Kontic and his Macedonian counterpart,
Branko Crvenkovski, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported from
Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Trade Minister Djordje Siradovic and Macedonian
Finance Minister Taki Fiti signed the agreements on avoiding
double taxation and stimulation and protection of investments
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Other relevant ministers of the two countries also signed
agreements on air, railway, telecommunications, and customs
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the signing, Kontic said conditions
had been created for strengthening economic cooperation and the
trade between the two countries was expected to reach 1 billion
U.S. dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Macedonia signed an agreement on regulating
mutual ties in Belgrade in April, thus formally establishing
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said the signing of the inter-state agreements
represented the second step in the upgrading of relations and
paved the way for free trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav premier said the visit to Macedonia was one of the
steps towards Yugoslavia's return to the international market and
all financial institutions in the world and the agreements were
important for peace and stability in all of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov received Kontic
and said his country wanted to establish best possible relations
and cooperation with neighboring and friendly Yugoslavia,
according to Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Kontic arrived in Skopje Tuesday for a two-day state visit to
Macedonia, being the first high-ranking official to visit
Macedonia over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Dole Begins Campaigns in Midwest With Tax-Cut Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole today started fierce campaigns in
the Midwest with focus on his across-the-board tax cut economic
plan and drug-fighting slogans.
</P>
<P>
The three Midwestern U.S. states, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,
are widely considered ones of the former U.S. Senate majority
leader's critical battlefields.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is seeking reelection in the
November 5 elections, made a train and bus trip to five Midwestern
states including Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Latest polls show
that Clinton's supporting rate is rising in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dole, 73, is lagging behind Clinton by as many as 20 points
throughout the country in recent polls taken by some U.S.
newspapers and televisions.
</P>
<P>
The Dole tax-cut economic plan includes a 15 percent
across-the-board cut in income taxes, a 500 U.S. dollar per-child
tax credit, a halving of the capital gains rate and a balanced
budget by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Dole said that his tax-cut plan was only the first step of his
goal of bringing down U.S. federal government spending and
returning more of what Americans earn to their pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
He has insisted that its would be better for Americans
themselves to manage the money they earn.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that after about two years of his presidency, he
would be working for a "fairer, flatter tax system."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton has been sharply criticizing Dole's tax-cut plan,
saying that Dole's plan would lead to a soaring of the federal
deficits.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Media to Cover Developing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged the media to pay more attention
to the true stories of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Fifth Conference of Ministers of
Information of Non-aligned Countries, Boutros-Ghali said that he
was deeply concerned about the issue of marginalization in the
world's press of the image of Africa and other developing regions.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, some news organizations were interested only in
cold war confrontations. The real needs of the countries in
development were neglected. More recently, it is most often
violence and bloodshed that attract the television cameras of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Serious, substantive coverage of the challenges and
achievements of developing countries is too seldom seen. This
needs to change," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations itself has an obligation to protect the
independence and freedom of news organizations and to defend the
right of all peoples to freedom of opinion and expression, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations must be the voice of those whose voices were
not heard, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I take it as my personal duty to draw attention of the world's
media to the true stories of the developing world and to do all
possible to help build journalism's strengths so that the voices
can make themselves heard, so that they can tell their own stores
to the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Missile Attacks on Iraq Won't Resolve Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The missile attacks on
Iraqi military targets won't resolve a series of political
problems in the region that affect the U.S. interests, said a
signed article of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the U.S. interests there range from
political stability in Turkey to oil production in the Caspian Sea
basin.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday's missiles didn't solve any of the myriad thorny
issues facing the rapidly changing region," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that difficult new decisions for any U.S. president --
involving such nations as Turkey, Iran and Iraq -- seem sure to
arise in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Geoffrey Kemp, a former Reagan
administration Mideast specialist, as saying that the latest Iraq
crisis "raises questions of whether American diplomacy needs to
focus as aggressively and actively on the Gulf situation as it has
been focusing for the last four years on the brokering of
Arab-Israeli peace."
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. increasingly may have to go it alone -- such as by
launching cruise missiles rather than leading an international
coalition, it said, "it makes it more difficult for us to look at
a wide range of options for what to do."

<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The African Sub-group of the
International Road Safety Organization has expressed concern over
the rising rate of road accidents and their consequences on the
economic growth in Africa.
</P>
<P>
African countries should come together to salvage themselves
from problems associated with road accidents, Olu Agunloye, the
Liaison Officer and Spokesman with the United Nations Economic
Community of Africa Transport Data Bank, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on the African Road Safety Initiative (ARSI), a
special organization to be launched in April next year, Agunloye
said the African sub-group has resolved to promote ARSI to combat
road safety problems in Africa which have assumed outrageous
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
ARSI will promote development of road safety within African
countries, encourage regional cooperation and collaboration, and
provide an action plan for road safety programs in africa, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the programs include road safety financing, public
education, standardization and harmonization, intra-continental
transfer of road safety research, training and database
development as well as technology transfer from industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
ARSI will be formally launched at the third african road
safetyh congress scheduled in South Africa between April 17 and

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Governor of South Carolina
David Beasley today ordered evacuations of the state's entire
coast and Georgia's Governor Zell Miller declared a state of
emergency along the state's coast as Hurricane Fran was moving
toward the U.S. mainland with strong wind of 185 kph.
</P>
<P>
"No area along our coastline is safe from what has become a
huge, menacing storm," the Associated Press quoted Beasley as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Beasley expected that a half million people would be evacuated
before the hurricane, which skirted the Bahamas today, lands
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A hurricane watch, already in effect from north of Sebastian
Inlet in central Florida to Little River Inlet, South Carolina,
was extended northward to North Carolina's Oregon Inlet, the
National Hurricane Center said.
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), the hurricane's center was about 710
kilometers southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, moving toward
the northwest at about 20 kph.
</P>
<P>
Beasley put the state's entire National Guard on standby, and
warned Fran could drive inland through the state.
</P>
<P>
Schools already were closed today in Beaufort County and the
Marine Corps prepared for possible evacuation of 5,000 troops from
its Parris Island training center near Beaufort. The Marine Corps
had to cancel Friday's scheduled graduation for 600 recruits,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Navy ordered ships out to sea from the Mayport Naval
Station at Jacksonville, Florida, and the Kings Bay Naval
Submarine Base in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, the Chatham County Commission called for a
voluntary evacuation for the coastal county's 205,000 residents.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Warns Liberian Warlords to Follow Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Special
Envoy to Liberia, Anthony Nyakyi, warned on Tuesday Liberia's
warring parties' failure to utilize the revived Abuja peace
accord would be ''costly''.
</P>
<P>
Such failure ''will be costly in many respects, and will
create an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust among the
factions, discourage the donors who have already started
providing assistance to the African peacekeeping force known as
ECOMOG to support the implementation of the peace process,'' he
said at the swearing-in ceremony of Liberia's first woman head of
state Ruth Perry.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted the UN envoy as saying
that in the coming days, ECOMOG, the UN observer mission in
Liberia (UNOMIL) and the government and other concerned parties
plan to travel by air and road to all parts of Liberia to verify
phase of the Abuja accord, namely, a ceasefire and the
disarmament of fighters.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by warring factions last month in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, leaders of the factions have made new
promises to cease all hostilities in war-torn Liberia and disarm
their fighters so that free and fair elections can be held by the
end of May next year.
</P>
<P>
''We are optimistic that the leaders will this time fulfill
this commitment,'' Nyakyi said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed UN's ''full agreement'' with the safeguard
measures adopted by west African leaders to implement the peace
plan and ensure the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that ''disarmament and demobilization should be
carried out in an orderly and transparent manner so that the
people of this country and Liberia's external partners can have
confidence in the process.''  enditem

<HEADLINE> US Facing Growing Criticism in Cuba Trade Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is facing
growing criticism from European nations for a new American law
penalizing foreign companies doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton administration officials have been desperately
stepping up their efforts to defuse a potentially damaging trade
war with its allies, local news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Eizenstat, the special envoy appointed by U.S. President
Bill Clinton to win support for the so-called Helms-Burton Act, is
now in Brussels for talks with senior officials of the European
Union (EU) to coordinate U.S.-EU positions in intensifying
sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The envoy has reportedly proposed a multinational effort to
isolate Cuba. He is calling on the EU's inter-governmental,
non-governmental and private sectors dealing with Cuba to
concentrate on "helping the people rather than the government."
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission, the EU's executive, remained
steadfast in its opposition to the Helms-Burton Act, named after
its sponsors in the U.S. Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade Commissioner, was due to address the
European Parliament later in the day to report on his meeting with
the U.S. envoy and reiterate plans to retaliate against any U.S.
laws aimed at punishing European companies or individuals keeping
business with Cuba.

<P>
BELGRADE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb republic,
the Muslim-Croat federation and the Muslim Sarajevo government
agreed today on an urgent exhumation of bodies from all mass
graves in both entities of the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Serb parliament speaker Momcilo
Krajisnik, President of the Muslim-Croat federation Kresimir Zubak
and federation Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic, the Tanjug news
agency reported from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The three parties also reached a preliminary agreement on the
exchange of prisoners of war at a meeting held at Sarajevo
airport, which was attended by deputy of the international
community's High Representative for Bosnia Michael Steiner.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Krajisnik told reporters that pows had so
far been exchanged very slowly and that the Serb side would insist
on the implementation of this agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a resumption of talks with Zubak on the
release of Serb prisoners who are detained in neighboring Croatia,
because this issue has still not been solved.
</P>
<P>
Muslim authorities on Tuesday night delivered five Serb bodies
killed near the town of Kljuc during the Muslim-Croat offensive in
western Bosnia in last autumn, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Identification of these bodies and of another 20 bodies exhumed
from a mass grave near the village of Kamen, near Glamoc in
western Bosnia, will be established in Banja Luka, it added.
