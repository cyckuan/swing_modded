<HEADLINE> Germany to Maintain Economic Growth: Bundesbank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank Thursday
presented an optimistic outlook for continued German economic
growth, supported by booming exports and rising domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report, the Bundesbank did not see any big
threat from the Asian crisis to German economic growth despite a
sharp fall in exports to the crisis-ridden area.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the crisis-hit Asian countries accounted
for merely 5 percent of German exports while the main importers of
German products, especially in Europe, had picked up momentum in
their domestic economies.
</P>
<P>
Exports overall "had clearly risen" this year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Strong exports had been joined by clearly rising domestic
demand in driving the economy ahead, the bank stressed.
</P>
<P>
It reported that new domestic orders for the manufacturing
sector increased by nearly 5.5 percent in the four months of this
year over the last four months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank also noted a revival of domestic investments.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the bad news for German economy was
that recession would continue to hit the construction sector and
that joblessness, at 11.2 percent in May, which it described as
still "unacceptably high" after a fall of 200,000 so far this
year, would remain the country's main problem.

<HEADLINE> Women's Status Raised Thanks to Actions Echoing the Fourth World Conference on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Women's status has been
significantly raised during the past few years thanks to efforts
by countries and non-governmental organizations in line with the
spirit of the Fourth World Conference on Women (FWCW).
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, FWCW president and president of the All-China
Women's Federation, said this in the Beijing Seminar on the
Follow-Up Action to FWCW, where over 300 women delegates from all
over the world gather and present reports on recent progress of
women's cause in their respective countries following the FWCW.
</P>
<P>
The FWCW, convoked in September 1995 in Beijing, passed the
Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action in which strategic
goals for solving women's problems world wide were mapped out.
</P>
<P>
"The Fourth FWCW is the largest international meeting in the
history of the United Nations to date," said Chen. "It has become
an important milestone in striving for equality between men and
women and in promoting peace and development."
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the FWCW Gertrude I. Mongella extended her
thanks to all non-governmental organizations for their efforts in
promoting women's benefits.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, first secretary of the secretariat of All-China
Women's Federation, briefed the audience on Chinese government's
effort and goals in promoting women's employment, women's
education, and so on.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will discuss in panels in the next few days such
topics as women and poverty, women's education and training, and
objections to violence against women.

<HEADLINE> Banks Merger Leads to Political Crisis in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy said Thursday the government's decision to merge the
state-owned Restoration Bank into the private Golomt Bank was
illegal and should be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Great Hural, or parliament, Bagabandy called
on the legislature to annul the government decision and regulate
on the banks' lendings and borrowings of money.
</P>
<P>
Public disappointment and distrust of the government has been
growing and society would descend into turmoil if the government
lost the people's support, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted the secret merger decision on May 27
without parliamentary debate, and was met with strong opposition
from the Mongolian People's Revolution Party (MPRP), which called
the move a misappropriation of national assets by a few people in
power.
</P>
<P>
The MPRP decided to abstain from parliamentary sessions unless
the government decision was cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it threatens to call for dissolving the Great Hural
if its demand is not met.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural is scheduled to further discuss the issue on
Friday.

WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday named U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson to the United
Nations to head the Energy Department and Richard Holbrooke to
lead the mission at the most powerful world body.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Rose Garden, Clinton praised Richardson as a
"vigorous and articulate proponent of our engagement around the
world and the importance of leveraging that engagement by living
up to our United Nations obligations."
</P>
<P>
He said Richardson, a 14-year former congressman from New

experience in deregulating the oil and gas industries, promoting
alternative sources of energy to ensure that energy development
meets tough standards of environmental safety.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, the diplomatic troubleshooter who mediated the
Bosnia peace plan, was recognized by Clinton as "already a
familiar face around the globe" for his ongoing work on Bosnian
peace.

<HEADLINE> Bilharzia on L. Malawi Almost Under Control: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The prevalence of bilharzia along
the once highly infected western shores of Lake Malawi has
dropped by over 50 percent, and it is now almost under control, a
bilharzia control study has shown.
</P>
<P>
According to a Malawi News Agency report Thursday, the study
showed that the prevalence rate of the disease has dropped from
77 to 23.4 percent, reducing fears among tourists who love
lake-bathing of contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
The two-year research was jointly conducted by the Department
of Community Health at the College of Medicine of the University
of Malawi, ministry of health, ministry of tourism, parks and
wildlife, some hotels and local communities in the area.
</P>
<P>
The study concerning Africa's third largest lake which has
about 400 fish species not found elsewhere showed that in every
10 children living around the western lake shore area tested,
only two have bilharzia.
</P>
<P>
"The third and most recent investigations carried out last
month yielded very encouraging results as they showed continued
decline of prevalence of bilharzia," Coordinator of the Lake
Malawi Bilharzia Program Chiwoza Bandawe was quoted as saying by
the weekly newspaper the Malawi News.
</P>
<P>
Bandawe said that the number of eggs found in a sample of
urine has also dropped drastically from 26 percent to three
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The first investigations carried out in May 1997
revealed that 77 percent of the 3,622 children tested in three
schools within the area had bilharzia.
</P>
<P>
"But the second investigation revealed that the rate of the
disease in the schools had dropped from 77 percent to 32 percent
while the recently conducted third investigation has shown a
further downward trend to 23.4 percent."
</P>
<P>
He added that the decline is a result of the efforts by the
health clubs which have been started in some schools. The
children themselves are very active in spreading awareness about
bilharzia and the need to stop urinating in river water.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator also said that over catching of the type of
fish which eat bilharzia eggs contributed to the rise in
prevalence rate of bilharzia along the western shore of Lake
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Fish from the lake provides over 70 percent of protein to the
people living along the lake shores.
</P>
<P>
The news of bilharzia prevalence in the area had badly
affected business for the resorts there, and in general, it had
also led to a drop in numbers of tourists visiting the lake area.
</P>
<P>
But with the efforts now being put in place to control the
disease, the situation is once again returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth investigation will be carried out in October this
year," said Bandawe.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Sets Condition for Khieu Samphan's Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Khmer Rouge's nominal political
leader Khieu Samphan would be treated leniently way if he captured
fellow leaders Ta Mok and Nuon Chea and handed them over to the
royal government, Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Cambodian Economy Institute, Hun Sen warned
that if Khieu Samphan did not do as requested and continued to
resist the government, he would be captured along with the other
two men.
</P>
<P>
Noun Chea, Ta Mok and Khieu Samphan are the only three Khmer
Rouge leaders other than Pol Pot, who are named by Cambodian
authorities as wanted for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Ta Mok is believed to be in his 70s and Khieu Samphan is 67
years old. Noun Chea's age is not known.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that Khieu Samphan is now in Pailin
near the Thai-Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told his supporters Tuesday that the three staunch
Khmer Rouge leaders were incapacitated with a variety of health
problems.
</P>
<P>
Noun Chea is paralyzed down one side of his body. Ta Mok is
suffering a severe pain in the stump of an amputated leg and Khieu
Samphan has a lung trouble.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, five senior officials of the so-called Khmer
Rouge government signed a statement, announcing they had split
from the Khmer Rouge's hard-liners Ta Mok and Noun Chea.
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge's nominal leader Khieu Samphan has for years served
as the more presentable public face of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas
in Cambodia. Some observers describe him as a somber, austere and
extremely disciplined man.

<HEADLINE> Meeting to Promote African Development Begins in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo international conference
on African development (TICAD ii) starts a two-day second
preparatory meeting here Friday to deliberate on agenda for
action to promote development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations information center said in a statement to
the Zimbabwe News Agency Thursday that 24 members of the
preparatory committee were expected to attend the meeting which
is organized by the United Nations, Japan and the Global
Coalition for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is one of three such meetings set to prepare an
''agenda for action'' for African development with specific steps
to be taken by African countries and their development partners
in social development.
</P>
<P>
The committees also promote industrial and agricultural
development among other issues.
</P>
<P>
TICAD ii will be held in Tokyo, Japan in October and is aimed
at furthering African development through the ''agenda for
action''.
</P>
<P>
''The main message of this agenda for action for African
development is poverty alleviation through accelerated and
sustainable economic growth and further integration of African
economies into the global economy,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
TICAD promotes south-south cooperation with a focus on the
ownership of African development based on national development
priorities to be supported by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The first TICAD was held in Tokyo in 1993 after which a
declaration on African development was adopted, reaffirming
partnership with shared responsibilities based on the principle
of self-reliance of African countries and the commitment of the
international community to support these efforts.

<HEADLINE> ILO Conference Ends With Work Rights Declaration Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Delegates adopted here Thursday a
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work at the
end of the annual meeting of the International Labor Organization
(ILO).
</P>
<P>
In the declaration adopted by consensus, the ILO called on all
its 174 members, even if they have not ratified the related
conventions, to promote and realize the effective abolition of
child labor, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory
labor and the elimination of discrimination in respect of
employment and occupation.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 delegates from 157 countries, including 127
ministers, attended the 86th International Labor Conference from
June 2 to 18.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the delegates also completed the first
round of discussions on a new international convention designed to
eliminate the worst forms of child labor, including hazardous
work, debt bondage, forced labor and slave-like conditions, and
children in prostitution, pornography and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The text of the proposed convention and recommendations will
receive a second reading and is expected to be adopted at the 1999
conference.
</P>
<P>
The ILO estimates that 250 million children between the ages of
5 and 14 in the developing countries are forced to do hard work,
of whom 61 percent are in Asia, 32 percent in Africa, and 7
percent in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The conference also adopted a Resolution on Youth Employment,
which calls on member states to take specific measures to increase
employment opportunities for young persons, while ensuring
employment protection for them.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to establish a new international convention on
contract labor failed to generate sufficient consensus and
delegates referred the matter back to the ILO Governing Body for
further consideration and possible inclusion on the agenda of a
future conference.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Thursday postponed its hearings
on the apartheid government's biological and chemical weapons
program until next month.
</P>
<P>
The delay will give TRC staff time to study documentation
submitted by Niel Knobel, former surgeon-general of the former
South African Defense Force, and to ascertain whether Wouter
Basson, the alleged mastermind behind the program, will testify.
</P>
<P>
Basson plans to apply to the Cape High Court to stop the TRC
from forcing him to give evidence, which Basson says will
prejudice his upcoming criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
Basson is soon to go on trial for 10 charges, including
possession of mandrax and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
The TRC hearings, which began on June 8, have been told that the
former apartheid government made biological and chemical weapons to
suppress the anti-apartheid movement at home and aboard.
</P>
<P>
The TRC has also been told that the former government had
plans to poison President Nelson Mandela after his release in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Opposes Upgrading Palestinian Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu warned Thursday that the attempt to upgrade the
Palestinian status at the United Nations could lead to the
collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem that he has consulted
with U.S. officials and British Prime Minister Tonny Blair on this
matter. He added that he would also raise the issue with the
leaders of other European countries.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Israeli government on Thursday said
that the U.N. observer status of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) should be determined only in the
Israeli-Palestinian permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
It charged that the PLO efforts to upgrade its U.N. status were
a violation of the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
In response, Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat's senior advisor Nabil Abu Rudaineh said in Gaza that it
was the national right of the Palestinian people to upgrade their
status at the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He also demanded Israel respect the international legitimacy of
the signed Oslo peace accords by implementing them in earnest.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Nasser al-Kidwa, the PLO observer at the U.N.,
said that Arab states, led by Egypt, have asked the U.N. General
Assembly to reconsider an Arab resolution on upgrading the
Palestinian status. The General Assembly was asked to schedule a
debate on the proposal next week.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, which was first submitted by the Arab
states last December, called for conferring "upon Palestine the
same rights and privileges of participation as those conferred
upon member states, with the exception of voting and candidature"
in U.N. committees, such as the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the U.N. General Assembly granted the PLO the observer
status, which was upgraded in 1988 with the PLO designated as
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Although the proposed resolution would make little difference
for the daily work of the current Palestinian mission at the U.N.,
it would affirm international support for the Palestinians in
their peace talks with Israel, which have been stalled for over 15
months.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Encouraged to Develop Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The role of the small scale
enterprise sector in uplifting the living standards of
Zimbabweans is of crucial importance in difficult economic times,
a government minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the small business expo in Harare, Minister
of State for Enterprises and Indigenization in the President's
Office Cephas Msipa said small business had become more
attractive than large companies.
</P>
<P>
He said they were absorbing a large number of youths churned
out of Zimbabwe's education system annually.
</P>
<P>
''Small businesses are also, to a large extent, providing a
safety net for the thousands being retrenched from the large
conglomerates as they down-size and focus only on their core
business, not only in Zimbabwe but also throughout the world,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, had incorporated small business
development as the cornerstone of its indigenization policy.
</P>
<P>
Measures, including the regularization of informal sector
activities, would be taken in due course to accelerate the entry
of those in the fringes of the country's economy into the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
''it is also the government's considered view that the small
business sector should spearhead the country's industrialization
program. We have had to formulate and implement an
industrialization policy which is currently under
consideration,'' Msipa said.
</P>
<P>
''To this end we have witnessed the coming to fruition of
several funds earmarked for the small enterprise sector as well
as bilateral programs aimed at strengthening small businesses
through technology transfer and capital injection via joint
ventures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Msipa encouraged the exhibitors from the small enterprise
sector to look into the export market by investing more in
product, packaging and quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
The three-day expo was organized by the Confederation of
Zimbabwe Industries, Zimbabwe enterprise development program and
Zimbabwe trade promotion body.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official: Hopeful Signs Seen in Iraqi life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N official said
Thursday that hopeful signs can be seen in some aspects of Iraqi
life as a result of the implementation of the first three phases
of U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between what is desirable and what is currently
available is beginning to narrow," said the U.N. humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq Dennis Halliday at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said water contamination has been substantially lessened in
Baghdad after the use of water-pumping equipment and treatment
chemicals, adding that U.N. relief supplies, especially food and
medicines, have become more constant.
</P>
<P>
The availability of improved seeds, farm tools, pesticides,
tractors has boosted food production, and in some other cases, a
further deterioration is no longer witnessed, the coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that there is still much to be done: drinking
water quality still needs to be improved in many parts of the
country; averting chronic malnutrition needs long time and
requires a balance guide of basic food such as animal protein and
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
He warned the current delay by the member states of the U.N.
Security Council in approving the 300 million U.S. dollars used
for the purchase of spare arts and equipment for Iraqi oil
industry will affect the country's oil output and export in the
fourth phase of the deal starting June 3.
</P>
<P>
"This is expected to have serious consequences for the whole
oil-for-food program, in particular, the enhanced (fourth)
phase. There is a growing concern that we may not reach the
estimated growth target of 4.5 billion U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi government has said that due to the lack of spare parts,
Iraq can export no more than 4 billion dollars worth of oil in the
fourth phase.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.N. oil-for-food program started in December 1996,
Iraq had been allowed to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every
six months to buy food, medicines and humanitarian goods. The
value was raised to 5.2 billion dollars for the fourth phase.

<HEADLINE> S. African Policemen Always Armed: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South African off-duty
policemen will not be disarmed, Neels Steenkamp, commissioner of
Police Management, said in Pretoria Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Steenkamp said in a statement that it was evident that attacks
on police members were mainly aimed at seizing their firearms,
but disarming them would render them defless and make them
become easy targets for criminals.
</P>
<P>
For some time, there has been an argument in South African
mass media that off-duty policemen should be disarmed so as to
avoid their weapons being either robbed or stolen.
</P>
<P>
However, Steenkamp said that police members were expected to
come to the assistance of the community and enforce the law,
regardless of whether they were on or off duty.
</P>
<P>
"Services to the community and the self-defense of police
officials cannot be compromised as a result of the incopacty of
the police to perform or to defend themselves," Steenkamp said.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke to Visit Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy on the
Cyprus problem Richard Holbrooke will visit Greece next Monday for
talks with Greek Foreign Ministry officials, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that Holbrooke, who
will be accompanied by U.S. State Department Special coordinator
for Cyprus Thomas Miller, will deliver an address at a Greek
university and both he and Miller will have talks with the
political leadership of the Greek Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Holbrooke, in his capacity as U.S. presidential envoy
on the Cyprus issue, visited the divided island republic in an
effort to bring back the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to
the negotiating table, but his mission failed due to the two
sides' positions of not yielding to each other's demands.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive-coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a firm supporter to the Cyprus Republic, and
neighboring Turkey have been at odds for decades over their
disputes on a series of issues including the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is also expected to visit Greece at the end of July as
part of Washington's efforts to mediate the disputes between
Greece and Turkey.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
International School (UNIS) 1998 Graduation will take place on
June 19 in the General Assembly Hall at Headquarters of the United
Nations in New York, a release from U.N. spokesman's office said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UNIS class will be addressed by Kate Burton, a graduate of
UNIS Class of 1975 and a well-known actress who has appeared on
Broadway in television shows and films.
</P>
<P>
This year's graduation class of 109 young men and women
represents 61 different nations and cultures. By learning and
socializing together on a daily basis, these students have
demonstrated that political, geographical, racial or cultural
differences are minor in comparison to what they have in common.
</P>
<P>
The UNIS was founded in 1947 by a group of United Nations
parents to provide an education that fostered global sensibility
for their children. What began modestly as a nursery school for
20 children is now a co-educational, college preparatory school
enrolling 1,502 children from 106 countries.

<HEADLINE> Malawian College's Means for Survival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped College of
Medicine of University of Malawi has started embalming dead
bodies to raise money for its laboratory teaching activities, the
Malawi News Agency MANA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The assistant lecturer in anatomy of the college, Dr. Steve
Kamiza told the daily Nation Wednesday that embalming service
opened to the public two months ago "as part of fund raising in
view of the financial hardships."
</P>
<P>
He said surface perfusion, a process that preserves the body
for four weeks before it decomposes costs 2,500 Malawian Kwacha
(some 100 U.S. Dollars) while visceral perfusion that can keep
the body for "years costs 5,000 Kwacha (about 200 U.S. Dollars)
and vascular perfusion that maintains the body for up to five
years costs 10,000 Kwacha (about 400 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a professional embalming... we have a professional
specialist from South Africa," said Kamiza.
</P>
<P>
He said that mourners are, however, not allowed within the
college premises during embalming process to avoid disturbing
classes.
</P>
<P>
"It should be emphasised that we do not allow people wailing
within the campus. We only do the embalming. We collect the
body from the hospital's (Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital)
mortuary and return it later.
</P>
<P>
"We don't keep bodies at our campus as it is strictly a
learning institution,"said Kamiza.
</P>
<P>
However, embalming service had been introduced to the college
for purposes of training anatomy trainee doctors.
</P>
<P>
Vice-chancellor of the University of Malawi Professor Brown
Chimphamba confirmed that the College of Medicine is at the
moment cash-strapped "and so is the whole University of Malawi.
</P>
<P>
"It is,therefore, not a surprise that the College of Medicine
has gone into such a fund raising venture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chimphamba added, "the college is very young. It would,
therefore, not be a surprise that it is in such financial
constraints."
</P>
<P>
The College of Medicine which is less than 10 years old is one
of the five constituent colleges of the University of Malawi. The
others are Chancellor College, an arts college, Bunda College, an
agricultural college, the Polytechnic that offers technical and
engineering courses and Kamuzu College of Nursing offering
midwifery and nursing courses.
</P>
<P>
The University of Malawi just like other government subsidized
statutory corporations is facing financial hardships at the
moment mostly due to the structural adjustment program the
Malawian government has adopted under the influence from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Malawian government has instituted the
Cash Budget System under which departments and ministries have to
spend according to the amount of money allocated to them by
treasury -- which in most cases is inadequate -- and no extra
cash is given regardless of any eventuality.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Agrees on Further Military Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Defense leaders of Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda Thursday adopted at the end of their meeting a
strategy for further military cooperation under the auspices of
East African Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
The strategy ranges from confidence building measures
including training and joint exercises, the integration of
military training facilities and systems, military research and
production measures, they said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy is intended to culminate in the conclusion of a
Defense Pact" formed in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha on
April 30, said Tanzanian Minister of Defense and National Service
Edgar Dionies Maokola-Majogo, who chaired the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are meeting and discussing security issues" with an eye to
maintaining peace in east Africa as "defense and security were a
necessary pre-requisite for the region's economic and social
development," Maokola-Majogo noted.
</P>
<P>
The military leaders agreed on the holding of regular meetings
with the next one being proposed for October in Kampala, Uganda's
capital.
</P>
<P>
They also signed an Addendum to the Memorandum of
Understanding on Cooperation in Defense and a Status of Forces
Agreement which regulate the legal status of members states'
defense forces while on visits in each other's territories.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister of State in the Office of the President in
Charge of Defense Giedon Ndambuki, Ugandan Minister of State for
Political Affairs Amama Mbabazi, as well as EAC Executive
Secretary Francis Muthaura attended the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also present were the three chiefs of defense forces --
General R.P. Mboma of Tanzania, General D.R. C. Tonje of Kenya
and Major General Jeje Odongo of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came in the wake of the three countries' on-going
joint peace keeping military exercise, code-named Natural Fire
'98, in Lodwar, northwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Maokola-Majogo said the three nations prefer to train their
military personnel with peace keeping skills so as to be able to
"convene this force when it is needed."
</P>
<P>
"This is the best approach," he claimed, saying the three
countries have no plans in the near future to set up a joint
regular peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
"Let's share the knowledge and take needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will go to Lodwar Friday to view the exercise,
the first-ever of this kind in the east African region, according
to their joint statement.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 soldiers from the three states, together with some
120 U.S. army trainers, now have entered the final stage of the
mock peace keeping operation which is set to end on June 27,
Kenya Defense Ministry's spokesman George Nyakundi told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, starting on June 2, aims to expose the soldiers
to future involvement in multi-national peace keeping operations
under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It focuses on dealing with a hypothetical state called
Somanga, and the forces work to restore order, said Nyakundi.
</P>
<P>
Defense experts of the three states met in Arusha on June 1-6
to work out the modalities for implementing the defense
memorandum, signed on April 30, including the establishment of a
joint military liaison office at the EAC secretariat in Arusha.

<HEADLINE> 1st Health Lab Opens in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's capital Mogadishu has
had a top class health laboratory for the first time since the
beginning of the civil war after toppling former President Siad
Barre in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Central Laboratory which opened in Forlanini
Hospital Tuesday is a community project invested by the United
Nations World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The lab, co-sponsored by the Joint Health Authority of
Mogadishu, was designed for analyzing various germs, the HIV
virus, the parasites, as well as the cholera germ which are now
tightening its grip on the people in Mogadishu and elsewhere in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the lab cost of nearly 50,000 U.S. Dollars
includes equipment as well as the necessary reagents for making
the analysis of the deadly diseases when there's an outbreak of a
disease of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony Tuesday, the WHO country
representative in Mogadishu, Dr. Abdukarim Assayr Ali, said the
lab is open to all Somalis in an effort of minimizing the time
and risk of taking the samples abroad.
</P>
<P>
Cholera and other samples were taken to Nairobi, Kenya, or
Johannesburg, South Africa, for analyzing the existence of the
suspected diseases in the past.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ali said WHO will keep maintaining the laboratory for the
next three months by supplying the reagents and paying a little
incentive to the nine local lab technicians in the facility.
</P>
<P>
During these three months, people will pay one-third of the
normal expenses for each sample to be tested, and will pay for
the full expenses after this period so as to enable the project
to become self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
It has already tested 15 samples taken from patients in the
quarantines of Benadir and Forlanini hospitals, and seven out of
the eight tested samples from Benadir hospital have shown cholera
positive while another six out of the seven samples from
Forlanini quarantine have also shown cholera positive.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory is being safeguarded by well-armed militiamen
belonging to Forlanini Hospital to avoid the repetition of the
event in which the gangs recently ransacked the second largest
soccer stadium which is only about 300 meters away from the lab
in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> OAU Observes Day of African Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) organized a discussion with a theme of "Children and
the Education Decade" at Africa Hall here Thursday afternoon to
mark "the Day of African Children."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the discussion, an OAU representative said that
education is a key for development and the education decade
provides all boys and girls with free and compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) also called on African
countries to carry out the programs of the education decade.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, African leaders adopted in Yaounde, Cameroun, a
resolution on the launching of the Decade of Education in Africa
(1997-2006).
</P>
<P>
The resolution and the decade plan of action adopted by the
African education ministers later gave an excellent opportunity
for the OAU member states and their development partners to
achieve various goals in the field of education.
</P>
<P>
This includes programs emanating from the Jomtien Declaration
on Education for All, the Ouagadougou and Kampala declarations on
education of girls and women, the Segou Perspective, the Accra
Charter and declaration on the promotion of African languages in
education, and etc.
</P>
<P>
School children and panelists comprising ministers of
education, labor and social affairs, women's affairs, finance or
their representatives as well as officials from the OAU, the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the World
Bank and some other U.N. agencies attended the workshop.
</P>
<P>
June 16 was designated by the 26th Session of the OAU Summit
in 1990 as "the Day of African Children" in remembrance of the
massacre perpetrated by the racist regime of then South Africa in
Soweto in which many innocent children lost their lives.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Repeats Demand for Big Cut in Germany's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Thursday repeated his demand for a big reduction in Germany's
payments to the European Union budget.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Germany now shouldered about 28 percent of the EU
budget, Kohl told the German parliament on Thursday that "We will
remain in the future a large contributor but we want a fair and
just share".
</P>
<P>
The EU should work out a fairer method of billing its members
by March 1999, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The demand first raised by Kohl at the recent EU summit in
Cardiff, Wales, has struck big controversies among the EU members.
</P>
<P>
While Kohl won predictable support with the Netherlands, Sweden
and Austria, which are the other big net payers into the EU
budget, he got a stiff rebuff from other nations including Spain
and France which are benefiting from the current EU budget scheme.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the tough new stance on the budget issue, Kohl
apparently wanted to score points with German voters with the
country's general elections just three months away.
</P>
<P>
Germany currently pays about 11 billion Ecus (12 billion U.S.
dollars) more than it gets back in farm and development subsidies
from the EU annually, nearly four times as much as Britain, the
next biggest net contributor.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Germany wanted to slash its EU payments by
about seven billion German marks annually (four billion U.S.
dollars), a cut that would certainly be welcomed by German
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Observers, however, warned that the EU budget dispute would
carry the risk to undermine its enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Germany's new tight-fisted stance would either mean a delay to
the EU enlargement, or less money for potential new members than
poorer EU nations have won in the past, they said.

<HEADLINE> Two Russian Officials to Visit Yugoslavia, Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian deputy foreign
ministers will leave for Yugoslavia and Albania on Sunday to
promote settlement of the Kosovo conflict, according to the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky is to fly to
Yugoslavia to facilitate the settlement and elaborate on the joint
statement by the Russian and Yugoslav presidents, Foreign
Ministry's spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a briefing on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Afanasyevsky will visit Belgrade and Pristina, the capital of
the autonomous Kosovo province, and meet with their leaders and
delegation members at the talks with Kosovo's Albanians, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Another Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev will visit
Tirana and Skopje, the capitals of Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said that Moscow regards the results of the
negotiations between the Russian and Yugoslav presidents held on
Tuesday "as a big step towards preventing violence in Kosovo and
diverting the crisis into a peaceful channel."
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes that in settlement of the Kosovo conflict much
depends on how actively President Slobodan Milosevic will meet the
obligations he has assumed, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the readiness of Kosovo Albanians to return
to the negotiations assumes major significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rukhmanin emphasized that it is necessary to dispel separatist
illusions, to reiterate the position which unequivocally condemns
terror and violence used by the Kosovo Liberation Army and make a
statement in support of Yugoslavia's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
An armed conflict occurred between the Yugoslav government and
ethnic Albanians, who are seeking for independence, in Kosovo in
February. Since then, more than 300 people have died in clashes.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
Thursday with former U.S. president George Bush in the Kremlin,
saying that the two laid the the foundation for ending the "Cold
War".
</P>
<P>
Bush is here on a private visit.
</P>
<P>
"We have become friends and began to resolve matters, using
exactly the same key," Yeltsin said. "The history of our relations
with George heralded an entirely new page in the history of
Russian diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"The presidents of the two countries, former enemies who used
to grind knives against each other, have turned everything upside
down and went as far as reducing strategic weapons," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders had turned a new page in social,
cultural and human relations between the two countries and had
permanently removed an "iron curtain".
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Diamond Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South African diamond giant
De Beers' Central Selling Organization (CSO) Thursday reported a
41 percent drop to 1.7 billion U.S. Dollars in first half year's
rough gem diamond sales, the lowest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The fall in sales followed the CSO attempts to curb
overstocking in the industry which has been hit by shrinking
retail diamond markets in Japan and southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7-billion-U.S.-Dollar sales figure, sharply down on last
year's first half sales, is slightly better than the consensus
forecast of 1.55 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The daily Business Day Thursday quoted analyst Des Mayers as
saying that the CSO could probably sell more in the second half
year, but would have to watch developments in Asia carefully.
</P>
<P>
The danger is that growth could slow down in the United States
before Asia recovers, Mayers said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed that there is no guarantee that, even
if Asia recovered, its consumers would start buying diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the southeast Asian region normally are major
consumers of diamond in the the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which used to account for about 28 percent of the
world's retail diamond market, now accounts for more than 35
percent as other important markets have declined.
</P>
<P>
At their peak in 1996, the Japanese and southeast Asian
markets together accounted for about 40 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
De Beers reported strong growth this year in retail sales of
diamond jewellery in the U.S., Canada, India and Europe. Sales
in the Gulf states and China continued at reasonable levels but
the markets in Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia declined
further.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iran Gear Up Efforts to Mend Rift: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Thursday that Egypt and Iran are stepping up efforts to mend
the rift in their long-strained relationship.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement to reporters here when asked to
comment on the progress Iran has made in its efforts to end
decades of hostilities with the United States, Saudi Arabia and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's new, moderate President Mohammad Khatami proposed early
this year people-to-people exchanges with the U.S. as a way to
start a new friendship, which makes a thaw in those relations
possible.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the new development was in fact preceded by
progress in Cairo-Tehran ties last winter when then Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati paid a crucial visit to Cairo
to kick off the process of fence-mending.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of entent between Cairo and Tehran, Moussa said, he
received this week a large Iranian economic delegation here and
witnessed the signing of a protocol for boosting bilateral
cooperation in industry, investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
The visit was the first of its kind in nearly 20 years. "There
is movement in Egyptian-Iranian relations at the present time,"
Moussa said, and voiced hope that the relations will take a
positive turn as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Moussa added that contacts between the two countries are now
continuing at the foreign ministerial level within the framework
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, of which both are
members.
</P>
<P>
Iran disrupted diplomatic and political ties with Egypt after
late Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat visited Israel to launch
his peace initiative in 1979, the year of Iran's Islamic
Revolution. They became even more hostile to each other after
Cairo accused Tehran of backing Egyptian Muslim militants fighting
to overthrow the secular government.
</P>
<P>
The ice in Egyptian-Iranian ties began to thaw in recent years,
and bilateral trade started to picks up. In 1997 alone their trade
volume reached 75 million U.S. dollars, and Iran is investing 220
million Egyptian pounds (some 64.7 million dollars) in seven
projects of weaving, carpets, ready-made garments and banks in
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Join Regional Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is to join the Common Market
of East and South Africa (COMESA) later this month in a bid to
strengthen its economic and trade links with other African states.
</P>
<P>
The official signing of the agreement on Egypt's membership of
COMESA will take place on June 29 at the opening session of the
group's summit in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will lead an Egyptian delegation to
the 5th COMESA ministerial meeting due to be held in Kinshasa on
June 25-27.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian cabinet on Tuesday endorsed the Egyptian
membership of COMESA, believing this will promote Egypt's trade
and investment relations with the 19 COMESA members, Assistant to
the Foreign Minister on African Affairs Mohamed Shaaban told
reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment activities among the COMESA states will be
carried out through a free trade zone of 350 million inhabitants
with exports worth 17 billion U.S. dollars and imports of 25
billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between Egypt and the COMESA members
currently stands at 2.5 billion dollars, and is expected to rise
to 4 billion dollars, Shaaban added.
</P>
<P>
"Joining COMESA will open the door to an increase of Egypt's
exports to the group's members as well as a tax exemption of up to
90 percent by October, and 100 percent by the turn of the
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaaban is to leave here Friday for Kinshasa to attend the
COMESA governmental committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Metwalli Soliman will also lead Egypt's
delegation at the first special meeting of the COMESA Ministers of
Communications on June 24 in Kinshasa, Shaaban said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Turkish Violations of Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government on Thursday
condemned the new violations of Cyprus airspace by Turkish
military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, government spokesman Christos
Stylianides said that Cyprus "is taking the necessary diplomatic
action" concerning the Turkish "provocative violation."
</P>
<P>
"The government is calmly monitoring Turkish attempts to
create artificial tension," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the government's insistence on the
implementation of international law and its proposal for
demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Six Turkish F-16 fighters flew low over both the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sectors of the divided capital, Nicosia, around
12:00 local time (0900 GMT) Thursday and then landed at the
Lefkoniko airport in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish officials, the warplanes were sent in
retaliation for the landing of six Greek warplanes at the Paphos
military air base in the Greek Cypriot-dominated southern part of
the island earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Cyprus had protested the visit by five Turkish
navy warships to the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta in northern
part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkey landed troops and occupied the northern third in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been heightened on the island since January of
last year when Cyprus ordered S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from
Russia, whose delivery is scheduled for later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to take all necessary measures to
prevent the deployment of these Russian-made missiles.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Short of External Hotel Experts: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar is short of
external hotel experts although tourism is the leading industry
in the isles, a senior government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Idi Pandu Hassan, the Minister of State who is responsible for
constitutional and legal affairs, said at the House of
Representatives that non-islanders constitute a mere 14 percent
of all workers in the leading privately owned hotels.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said 11 people from Kenya and 225 from the mainland of
Tanzania have been employed in 10 leading privately owned hotels
in the isles.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said a total of 1,400 people in the hotels are
Zanzibaris, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The minister was responding to a question of Haji Mkema Haji,
a member of parliament from Koani, who wanted to know the number
of workers from the outside who are employed in Zanzibar hotels.
</P>
<P>
The isles investment regulations spell out that Zanzibaris
should be given priority in employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour in late April said the
government has been striving to make tourism the principal
foreign exchange earner to replace cloves exports after the
prices of the cash crop plunged in the world market in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Amour called on Zanzibar residents to give full support to
foreign investors in developing the tourism industry so as to
tide over the isle's economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, part of Tanzania, is separated from the African
continent by a 21-mile corridor at its narrowest point. It
comprises the twin islands of Unguja and Pemba and more than 20
smaller islands in the Indian Ocean.

</P>
<P>
The OAU delegation, appointed by the 34th OAU summit meeting

</P>
<P>
According to the OAU chief, the delegation represents Africa's
collective concern on the situation and its desire to contribute
in every way possible to put an end to the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, Salim said, have characterized the crisis as
a conflict that affects not only the two countries but also
countries in the region and Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We have come here on the basis of the urging of the heads of
states in Ouagadougou for a cessation of hostilities and for the
implementation of the efforts which are made by the
facilitators," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU delegation will look into what the problem
areas are and what can be done to ensure that the peace process
is on course.
</P>
<P>
The OAU delegation left here Thursday afternoon for Asmara on
a similar mission and is expected to return here this evening.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Condemns Greece's Landing Warplanes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit Thursday accused Greece of escalating tension in
Cyprus by landing its warplanes on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The military movements displayed the Greek government's
"expansionist plan" concerning the eastern Mediterranean country,
Anatolia News Agency quoted Ecevit as saying in Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The criticism came as four F-16 fighters and two C-130
transport planes belonging to the Greek Air Force touched down at
an air base near the western town of Paphos in the Greek
Cypriot-dominated part of Cyprus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who ordered a military intervention in 1974 when he
was the then prime minister, said that Turkey would use its air
force to "maintain tranquility in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Turkey's six F-16 fighters landed at the
Gecitkale Air Base in northern Cyprus in response to Greece's
military movements on the island.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem stated that
Turkey would take all necessary steps to protect the security of
Turkish Cypriots and Turkey itself.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Turkish Foreign Ministry had
instructed its embassies in member states of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to brief these countries on "the latest
provocations by Greece."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greece and Cyprus have condemned the
landing of the Turkish fighters in northern Cyprus, describing it
as "an illegal move."
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said in Athens that
those countries selling arms to Turkey should also be held
responsible for the current tension in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the small island in the
wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 to 50,000 Turkish troops are stationed
in the northern part of Cyprus with a claimed aim to protect
Turkish Cypriots who unilaterally declared "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" now only recognized by Ankara.

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Minister Mohamed Bilal told the Zanzibar House of

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Ethiopia, Eritrea to Stop Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani urged here Thursday Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease their border
clashes "for the sake of regional stability."
</P>
<P>
"Any conflict in the Horn of Africa implies a far-reaching
security impact that would affect the entire region," Anani told
reporters after meeting the Ethiopian envoy and Minister of
Industry and Trade Ali Sayyed Abdallah, who arrived here Wednesday
for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"The Red Sea is an Arab sea as many countries overlooking
it are Arab countries, and therefore we are concerned about its
security," said Anani.
</P>
<P>
For Jordan, its Red Sea port of Aqaba is the only sea outlet
that links it with the outside world. Amman is therefore
especially concerned about the Red Sea security, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sea is surrounded by Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan. The Ethiopian-Eritrean border
conflict broke out in early May, and has claimed hundreds of
lives.
</P>
<P>
Anani called for both parties to exercise restraint and wisdom
to end their armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Jordan will join Egypt's effort to cease the conflict,
Anani said that "if there is a need for such a mediation, then it
could be made in coordination with our brothers in Egypt and we
are ready for this."
</P>
<P>
African leaders have already started mediation between Ethiopia
and Eritrea to end the bloodshed. On Thursday, a delegation of the
Organization of African Unity met with Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa to to discuss ways to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. and Italian pressure, Ethiopia and Eritrea agreed
on Sunday to halt air bombings, and the ground fighting has also
subsided since one week ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
swelling budget deficit is seen as the biggest challenge the new
administration of President-elect Joseph Estrada who will take
office on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing on Estrada's economic agenda on Friday,
incoming Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu told reporters that
the deficit could get worse to hit 30 billion pesos (750 million
U.S. dollars) by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current government, which targeted a 5 billion pesos (125
million dollars) budget surplus, said earlier the deficit surged
to 15.4 billion pesos (385 million dollars) for the first five
months of the year due to revenue shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
The government has posted a budget surplus annually during the
past three years, at 39 million dollars in 1997, 156 million
dollars in 1996 and 275 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu also predicted a continued rise in the country's
average of commodity prices or inflation which hit a two-year high
of 9.2 percent in May with 1988 as the base year.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the impact of the Asian financial crisis on
commodity prices has not yet fully displayed.

<HEADLINE> Africa in Danger of Being Marginalized: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Deputy Foreign Minister
Nicholas Goche warned Friday that Africa is in real danger of
remaining largely marginalized from the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization was a reality which had brought changes
to the world economy but Africa's share of that global economy
had not yet improved.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the opening ceremony of a two-day second
preparatory meeting of the Tokyo International Conference on
African Development (TICAD) which started here Friday.
</P>
<P>
''In 1992, for instance, the total value of Africa's exports
was only two percent of the world total compared to 17 percent
for Asia and the Pacific, four percent for Latin America and the
Caribbean, 10 percent for Japan and 15 percent for North
America,'' Goche said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the preparatory meeting, being attended by
representatives from 11 African countries, two Asian countries,
five donor countries and 10 non-governmental organizations, would
examine trade issues with a view to resolving capacity
constraints and other problems hindering Africa's participation
in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
TICAD is a forum aimed at furthering African development
through an ''agenda for action'' and promoting South-South
cooperation with a focus on the development of Africa based on
national priorities to be supported by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Goche added despite multiple initiatives to address the issue
of debt, the problem still remained a major constraint to
sustained growth and development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
''This forum brings together creditor and debtor nations. The
issue of external debt has been on the agenda since the early
eighties when the debt crisis first surfaced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister also said that ''the outcome of our
deliberations here will have a significant impact on the shape
and content of the agenda for action to be adopted in Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
TICAD is a Japanese initiative designed to support African
efforts at economic recovery and development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will prepare the draft agenda for action to be
adopted at TICAD II to be held in October in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on issues related to social development which
include poverty alleviation, education, health, population,
private sector-led development, agriculture and environment, good
governance, conflict resolution and external debt.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Party Leader On Role of Youth In Country's Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-president Hu Jintao said here
today that the future of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
depends on whether it can win over the country's 320 million young
people, calling them a major force in promoting historical
development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central
Committee, was addressing the opening ceremony of the 14th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Youth League, the world's
largest youth organization, which has 68.5 million members between
the ages of 14 and 28.
</P>
<P>
Hu, emphasized the importance the Party places on the Congress,
and pointed out that the Standing Committee of the CPC Central
Committee's Political Bureau, the Party's leaders, were present at
the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
These included President Jiang Zemin, who is General Secretary
of the Party, and Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Wei Jianxing
and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
"The 14th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Youth
League is a significant meeting being held at the turn of the
century and at a crucial moment in China's reforms, opening-up,
and modernization," Hu told the more than 1,400 delegates.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been great progress in China's youth
movement of the 20th century and that it has proven that it was
only with the CPC's leadership that Chinese youth could achieve
the things they did.
</P>
<P>
The new century is filled with opportunities and challenges, he
said, and the Party hopes that the country's younger generation
can live up to its expectations and those of the people, and
contribute to the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Wary of Strict Refereeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANTES, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese squad would be
particularly wary of more strict refereeing when they faces Croatia in
Stade La Beaujoire here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to be particularly careful as the refereeing has
become very strict over the last couple of days," said coach Takeshi
Okada on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"For years, size differences between the Japanese players and
others has gone against us, but we can compensate with our speed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"This match is of ocurse very important for Japanese football in
view of the next World Cup but it is especially so fi we are to
qualify for the second round," Okada said.
</P>
<P>
Remarks from captain Masami Ihara echoed Okada's views.
</P>
<P>
"It's an important match as far as qualification goes and we're
prepared to take some risks. We also have to keep an eye on the
refereeing; after what happened yesterday this has become something to
take into consideration," Ihara said.
</P>
<P>
A total of five players were sent off in two games on Thursday,
including the record-making three substitutes ousted in the clash
between South Africa and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Ihara said his team would put on a more offensive face against
Croatia but what worried him most was the opponents' strong midfield.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian-born striker Wagner Lopes said Japan still had chance to
win although teammate Hidetoshi Nakata thought the chance was low.
</P>
<P>
Lopez said, "Croatia has a good team, made up of players who have
been part of prestigious leagues in countries like Italy or Spain. But
that is not enough to ensure good teamwork."
</P>
<P>
He added, "Croatia's strength is in individual players. If we can
manage to take advantage of their mistakes we'll have a good chance of
winning."

<P>
GENEVA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss city of Geneva will host
the eighth annual Internet Society Conference scheduled on July
21-24, the organizers announced here Friday.

play a vital role in establishing the Internet's presence in their
countries or facilitating the efforts of schools, government

BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Qian Qichen told a
seminar on Deng Xiaoping's Theory and overseas Chinese affairs
here today that China will use it to do a better job in the work
on overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Deng upheld the policies for overseas Chinese of Chairman Mao
Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, which emphazised protecting the
rights of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese who have returned,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>

an important way to form friendship with other nations and people,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed China's progress in this area and pointed out that
the effectiveness of Deng's theory on handling overseas Chinese
affairs have been proven as most overseas Chinese and returned
Chinese have contributed to China's modernization drive and the
reunification of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
As China continues with its opening up and modernization,
overseas Chinese will have an even bigger role to play, Qian
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Launches WTO Program for Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has launched a new
training program for developing countries, announced the World
Trade Organization (WTO) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, trainees from developing countries will
learn more about trade and development-related matters and improve
their knowledge of trade policy.
</P>
<P>
"Effective integration of developing countries in the
international trading system is crucial, not only for their
development, but also for the credibility of the WTO as a world
trade organization," said Dutch Permanent Representative Eveline
Herfkens.
</P>
<P>
"This requires the institutional capacity in these countries to
deal with WTO matters," he said. "Through this initiative, we hope
to make a modest contribution to this effect."
</P>
<P>
Initially, there will be up to three trainees per year, whose
selection and recruitment shall be made by the WTO secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Trainees will be considered as WTO staff members during their
assignment and will receive a normal salary, but will not take up
regular staff posts.
</P>
<P>
While working for the WTO, they will receive training for a
maximum of two years and then go back and contribute to the
strengthening of their countries' institutional capacity.
</P>
<P>
The content and duration of the assignment vary for each
candidate, depending on their circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands will meet all costs involved with the trainees.
</P>
<P>
In coming weeks, the WTO secretariat will finalize arrangements
for selection and recruitment, the development of tailor-made
programs and the supervision of trainees.

<HEADLINE> Duma Sets Up Impeachment Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, on Friday adopted a decision to form a
special commission for the impeachment of President Boris Yeltsin,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by 331 votes in favor and five against,
no abstention.
</P>
<P>
The special commission consists of 15 representatives of all
parliamentary groups and is headed by Vadim Filimonov, communist.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Duma also approved the impeachment commission
regulations.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the initiative of forming the commission came
from the faction of Communists.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution the president may be impeached
by the Federation Council "only on the grounds of Duma charges of
high treason or committing some other grave crime." The charges
should be confirmed by a Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the Yabloko party said on Friday
that the nation was increasingly discontented with the
government's policy and that this meant Yeltsin would soon leave
office.
</P>
<P>
Yabloko in its statement circulated in the Duma noted that "A
serious wave of discontent is giving rise to increasingly loud
calls for the dismissal of the Russian president."
</P>
<P>
At the same day coal miners who have for nine days been
striking outside Russian government headquarters in Moscow urged
parliament to back a proposal for impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of the State Duma Gennady Seleznyov said on
Friday that a motion for impeaching the president was unlikely to
drum up enough support in the lower house in fall this year.
</P>
<P>
Such a motion would hardly muster 300 votes in the State Duma,
the minimum it would need to be carried, Seleznyov told a news
conference.

To achieve this goal, he said, the younger generation need the
"common ideals and beliefs." That is to hold high the banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory in building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and to make painstaking effort to improve their
education, ability, and moral integrity.
</P>
<P>
To which he added, they should be honest and virtuous as well,
and urged them to have a pioneering spirit and creativity, which
are the force behind national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Young people, as the least conservative and most creative
social group, he said, need to free their minds, seek truth from
facts, and to work for new breakthroughs based on their
predecessors' experience.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Party and the state have always had high
regard for people studying abroad, and that, even though they are
far from their native soil, they are the children of the
motherland, and the Party and the people have always cared about
them, and welcome them to return home to serve the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the Communist Youth League should play a greater
role as the Party's assistant and as a bridge between it and young
people, and take the responsibility of uniting and educating young
people.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, the executive secretary of the Secretariat of the
13th Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke
at the opening ceremony, saying that the League's major tasks
across the country are to provide a "spiritual pillar" for the
younger generation with Deng Xiaoping Theory, guiding them to
study hard and display creativity, and prompting them to serve the
society voluntarily.

held once every five years. The current congress is expected to

<HEADLINE> China, Mozambique Renew Medical Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June (Xinhua) -- The governments of China and
Mozambique signed an agreement on medical cooperation between the
two countries here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the renewed pact, China will send its 12th medical team
to Mozambique to help the local people in the near future this
year.
</P>
<P>
The doctors of the Chinese medical team will increase from 12
to 16. Among them, twelve will work in the Maputo Central
Hospital, the biggest and best in this southern African country.
The other four doctors will work in a district hospital in
Maputo, a source in the Chinese embassy here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Besides specialists in surgery, acupuncture, anaesthesia,
otolarygology and orthopaedics, China will add experts in the
fields of gynaecology and orthopaedic surgery to the new team, to
cater for the needs of the Mozambican people.
</P>
<P>
China began sending a medical team to Mozambique, a former
Portugese colony in 1976, only one year after its independence,
and the team is being replaced every two years.
</P>
<P>
So far, 11 batches of Chinese doctors have been sent to help
the Mozambicans. And the incumbent team will return to China in
August when its terms expire.
</P>
<P>
For over 20 years of the medical cooperation, nearly one
million Mozambican people have been cured by the Chinese doctors,
whose consummate medical skills and noble ethics have won praises
from the Mozambicans, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Deputy Minister of Health Abdul Noormahamedi and
China's Ambassador to Mozambique Shao Guanfu signed the pact here
on behalf of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Noormahamedi said with the
situation in Mozambique becoming more stable and its economy
growing steadily, his government hopes that China would invest
more in the health field of Mozambique and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shao promised that China plans to strengthen the
cooperation between the two countries in making medicines from
Chinese herbs and in the field of pharmaceutics.

Leekens also made other two changes to the starting line-up and

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Turkey's Violations of Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has lodged a strong
protest to the U.N. General Secretariat against recent violations
of its airspace by Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. dated on Friday, Cyprus' Permanent
Representative to the U.N. Sotos Zackheos said that "it should
be stressed to the Turkish side that these actions are in
violation of international law and Turkey should act according to
the principles and norms of this law."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the violations of Cyprus' airspace by six
Turkish F-16 fighters which flew low over both the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sectors of the divided capital, Nicosia, around
12:00 local time (0900 GMT) Thursday and then landed at the
Lefkoniko airport in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish officials, the Turkish warplanes were
sent in retaliation for the landing of six Greek warplanes at the
Paphos military air base in the Greek Cypriot-dominated southern
part of the island earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides Thursday
accused Turkey of creating an "artificial tension" by sending
warplanes over its airspace.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Cyprus also protested the visit by five Turkish
navy warships to the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta in northern
part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and occupied the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> A Quiet Week for Cyprus Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market has
experienced a relatively quiet week as the market consolidated at
the current price levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly market review issued Friday by the
Cyprus Investment and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), the
CISCO All-Share Index closed at 431.9 points on Thursday,
a drop of 0.8 point over the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The only session that ended with gains was last Friday, when
the market climbed 4.9 points to 437.7 points. But the gain was
reversed gradually in the next four trading days.
</P>
<P>
Monday witnessed the biggest decline in the week, as the market
fell 2.8 points to close at 434.9 points. This decline was
triggered by the speculation that France would propose delaying
the Cyprus accession talks with the European Union (EU) at the EU
summit held the same day in Britain's Welsh capital Cardiff.
</P>
<P>
The market continued sliding in the following days within a
marginal range between 0.7 to 1.6 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions in the week rose to 5.2
million Cyprus pounds (about 10.4 million U.S. dollars), from
4.1 million pounds (about 8.2 million dollars) in the previous
week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Plan To Improve Rural Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The coming third meeting of the
Ninth Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress
will discuss revising the Village Committee Organization Law to
urge greater clarity in village management.
</P>
<P>
This will affect more than 900,000 villages in China and 900
million people. A draft specifies the system of democratic
election for village heads and provides for tighter supervision,
according to Zhang Mingliang, director of the Civil Affairs
Ministry's Grassroots Power Building Department.
</P>
<P>
China passed the Law in November 1987, putting an end to the
practice of picking village heads at the government level.
</P>
<P>
It says that all members of the village committee, the formal
village leadership, are to be directly elected by the village, and
in the past decade, most Chinese villages have held three direct
elections, greatly increasing democracy in China, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"The law protects the democratic rights and basic interests of
all Chinese villagers," he explains.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that village committees make public a list
of the village's assets, incomes, expenditures, land leases, and
building permits. And, this open management of village affairs
effectively keeps dishonest village heads from benefiting
personally by using their power, Zhang says.

BONN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
warned Friday that the deployment of warplanes by Turkey and
Greece on the divided island of Cyprus would escalate tensions in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's comments came after Turkey sent six F-16 warplanes
Thursday to the northern sector of Cyprus in response to the
landing of four Greek F-16s and two C-130 transport planes in the
southern Cypriot air base on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The German government strongly warns both sides against use of
force which is totally unacceptable nowadays in Europe," Kinkel
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to believe that two NATO allies have threatened
each other with use of force," Kinkel added.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties concerned to explore confidence-building
measures and make efforts to ease tensions.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inflation to Rise by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's inflation might ascend
above 20 percent while the Kwacha is expected to hit 2,200 for
one U.S. Dollar depreciation in the second half of the year,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the latest Business Trends published by
Standard Chartered Bank Zambia as saying that the nine percent
target for the year-end is no longer meaningful and that with the
current situation, inflation is likely to push upward, already
its averaging in the 20 percent range.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, inflation can be expected to accelerate,
partly for statistical reasons, but also as the knock-on effects
of currency devaluation and wage push inflation starts to bite,
said the publication.
</P>
<P>
However, over the whole year, inflation is expected to fall
modestly below last year's 24.8 percent. An average of 22 percent
to 23 is being forecast.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the decline in the country's copper
earnings and low disbursement of donor money are some of the
factors that have caused a foreign exchange drought, causing a
steep fall in the Kwacha from 1300 last December to 1970 against
one Dollar at present.
</P>
<P>
The Kwacha depreciation might have impact on the consumer
prices in the second half of the year leading to wage increases
which would in effect generate a degree of wage-push inflation,
predicted the bank document.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to control inflation and protect the Kwacha, the
Bank of Zambia, the country's central bank, said monetary policy
would be tightened to curb demand for foreign exchange, pointing
to lower monetary growth and higher interest rates for the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The year is expected to end on a bad financial base, and "the
extremely ambitious 1999 inflation target of four percent now
also looks unrealistic and it is questionable whether in fact, so
low an inflation rate is consistent with the government growth
rate," said the publication.

Macao has better public order before that date.

<P>
He said he believes that Macao's police could play a more
active role in guaranteeing the smooth transition by acting
promptly to stem the increase in crime. Police in the inland areas
is ready to increase cooperation with the Macao police in stopping

<HEADLINE> Canada's Trade Surplus Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada's trade surplus in April
fell by 600 million Canadian dollars (408 million U.S. dollars) as
Asia's financial crisis kept the nation's export growth in check.
</P>
<P>
April's trade surplus was 1.2 billion Canadian Dollars (816
million dollars), down from March's 1.8 billion dollars (1.2
billion dollars) and the lowest since last October, Statistics
Canada said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was blamed on the financial crisis in southeast
Asia with many countries suffering sudden and sharp devaluation of
their currencies followed by set-back in their economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The currency depreciation prompted Asian nations to curb demand
for Canadian goods, which have grown relatively more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The sinking demand has, in turn, dragged down world prices for
Canadian mainstays such as wood, minerals, oil and gas, thus
bringing about the reduced value of Canadian exports.
</P>
<P>
Exports barely budged in April, rising 0.1 percent from March
to 26 billion Canadian dollars (17.7 billion dollars). Higher
exports of aircraft, communications equipment and other consumer
goods were offset by lower exports of cars, wood pulp, precious
metals and ores.
</P>
<P>
Imports, however, rose 2.6 percent to 24.8 billion dollars
(16.9 billion dollars). Aircraft and steel product imports were
mainly responsible for the rise, offset slightly by a drop in
imports of auto parts.

MARSEILLE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- With Patrick Lluivert banned, the
Netherlands will try to look for inspiration from Arsenal striker
Dennis Bergkamp in the match against South Korea here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp, who played only 30 minutes in the goalless draw with
Belgium, will be fully fit and able to start his World Cup match.
</P>
<P>
He is most likely to be partnered in attack by Pierre van
Hooijdonk and coach Guus Hiddink will possibly use both Boudewijn
Zenden and Marc Overmars to attack down the flanks.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans will also miss a key player Ha Seok-Ju, who
became the first victim of FIFA's tackle from behind rule in the
match against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Cha Bum-Kun has said the South Korean team would adopt a more
aggressive approach to the match. Choi Young-Il, who sat on the
bench during the 3-1 defeat to Mexico, is expected to be recalled to

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Flight attendants and ground
personnel of Philippine Airlines (PAL) threatened Friday to join a
crippling two-week-long pilots' strike which has already
aggravated the debt-ridden airlines' financial situation.
</P>
<P>
The ground workers' union filed a strike notice with the

and harassment.
</P>
<P>
The flight attendants' union expressed support for the pilots'
strike and said it may follow their suit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the striking Airline Pilots Association of the

have agreed to rally in front of the presidential palace on July
1, the first day for the next administration.
</P>
<P>
Vice President and President-Elect Joseph Estrada, who has
openly supported PAL management's decision to downsize, will take
his oath of office on June 30 to succeed outgoing President Fidel
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, PAL filed a petition to the Philippine Securities
and Exchange Commission seeking approval for its rehabilitation
plan which will lead to the sacking of 5,000 employees, or 37
percent of its more than 13,000 workforce.
</P>
<P>
The airlines said it is unable to meet payments on its loans,
estimated at 2 billion U.S. dollars, because of drastically
reduced cash flow as a result of the devastating pilots' walkout.
</P>
<P>
The strike has cost the company more than 2 billion pesos (50
million dollars) in lost revenue, PAl said.
</P>
<P>
The airline said it also plans to dispose of 40 of its 54 jet
planes, suspend more than two-thirds of its routes and sell some
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
The company said Thursday it will decide in three months
whether it will shut down after seeing the results of the
rehabilitation plan.

PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- P.J. Patterson, Prime Minister of the
Caribbean island nation Jamaica, said on Friday that the team's debut
at the World Cup finals had brought his nation together.
</P>
<P>
"Jamaicans are fanatical about the World Cup: each time the Reggae
Boyz play, everybody is in front of their TV set," said the prime
minister at the team's training camp at Chaumont, 300 kilometers east
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
"In my country, sport is a way of bringing people together, in a
spirit of peace and faternity," Petterson added.
</P>
<P>
He said Jamaica, the first English-speaking nation which qualifies
for the finals, was very proud of being part of the top-level soccer
tournament although it was not the first time his country
distinguished itself in a high profile event.
</P>
<P>
"I would like everybody to remember that Jamaica qualified for the
Winter Olympic Games, although snow never falls on my country. We
rejoice all the more because until now our national football team has
never distinguished itself."
</P>
<P>
Jamaica, which lost to Croatia in their Group H opener, will face
former world champion Argentina at Parcs des Princes in Paris on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Pay Cost of U.S. Troops in Won </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is to pay most of the
cost of maintaining U.S. troops in Korea in South Korean currency
this year, saving the Seoul government 130 billion won (92.8
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The payment agreement with Washington was announced Friday by
Kim In-jong, South Korean defense policy adviser, and Richard
Christenson, counsellor of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Seoul promised to pay 399 million U.S.
dollars this year as its share of the cost of keeping some 37,000
U.S. troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, with the former 11th largest economy in the world
suffering under the Asian financial crisis, Washington agreed to
accept most of the payment in won at a pre-crisis exchange rate of
907.6 won against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the two nations said that the agreement
will reduce Seoul's burden without imposing any further financial
burden on the United States.
</P>
<P>
"In consideration of South Korea's need to lessen the potential
demand for foreign currency, Korea's payment will be made in won,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will mostly effect South Korean employees working
for the U.S. military. The original portion set aside for their
salaries was 299 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 100 million U.S. dollars will be offered to the
U.S. Forces in South Korea in the form of the construction of
various facilities and support in kind.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. effort to reduce its financial burden,
South Korea will provide an additional 2.6 million U.S. dollars in
logistics supplies to the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in January that
Washington would not seek to profit from a weakening won.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean currency, which had been in the 900 level last
October, just before the November financial crisis, is now
hovering around 1,400 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
It was trading at 1,392 to the dollar Friday.

<P>
"It is a matter of satisfaction that China has for over four
decades been an active partner in our development efforts with its
involvement in major sectors of the Nepalese economy," the king
said.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal and China, guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence, share many things in pursuance of their foreign
policies," he said. "We wish to see continuation of closer
interaction between our two countries in the coming years."
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that there are no unsettled issues between China and
Nepal, and over the years, the two countries have carried out
fruitful cooperation in many fields and there have been frequent
exchanges of high-level visits between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that when visiting Nepal at the end of 1996, President
Jiang Zemin agreed with King Birendra on establishing between the
two countries a good-neighborly partnership of lasting friendship
oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"During my tenure of office, I will exert my efforts and make
my due contribution to the steady development and consolidation of

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Applying for Additional Loan From World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad confirmed Friday that Malaysia is applying for an
additional 700-million-U.S.-dollar loan from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said this loan and the 300-million-U.S.dollar loan approved
by the World Bank Friday would be used solely for social programs
like housing, and not for economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The government was in the process of applying for the
700-million -U.S.-dollar loan, he told reporters at the United
Malays National Organization( Umno) general assembly here.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian National News Agency report from Washington
Thursday quoted a World Bank official as saying that Malaysia was
expected to request for the loan before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the 7.03 billion ringgit (about 1.793 billion U.S.
dollars) supplementary budget to spur economic activity announced
Thursday by Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, Mahathir said it
would compound the country's present budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said with the government's shrinking revenue due to a
fall in company profits following the economic slowdown, the
government was expecting a deficit for this year.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the government forecast a budget surplus of 3.934
billion ringgit (about 1.004 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We may have to borrow more money, like through the issue of
bonds. We are working on this," he said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President to Pay First Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad is
to pay his first visit in more than 20 years to Lebanon this fall,
notably to climax Damascus' official recognition of Lebanon's
statehood and independence.
</P>
<P>
The Orient radio Friday quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, who is visiting the United States, as saying Assad "will
visit us at the invitation of President Elias Hrawi before
October."
</P>
<P>
Hrawi last month expressed hope that Assad would visit Lebanon
"to see me before my term is up. I have extended longstanding
invitations to him."
</P>
<P>
The remark has sparked media speculation on whether Assad's
visit would be a formal farewell to Hrawi, whose term will expire
in October, or a prelude to another extension of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi was elected president with strong Syrian backing in
1989, two days after the assassination of his predecessor, Rene
Mouawad, in a massive car bomb blast in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's constitutional term expired in 1995, but the parliament
voted a one-time constitutional amendment that year, allowing him
to stay on for an extra 3-year term.
</P>
<P>
The conservative newspaper An Nahar here said Assad's coming
visit, the first since he came to power in 1971, will further
stress Syria's official recognition of Lebanon's independence, an
issue at the center of broad suspicion.
</P>
<P>
This was a reference to Syria's longstanding contention that
Lebanon is part of Syria that was torn off by victorious British
and French allies after the first World War.
</P>
<P>
Syria withheld its recognition to Lebanon after it declared
independence in 1943, but has kept a special relationship with
it. Syria now has some 40,000 troops in Lebanon, deployed since
1976, after Lebanon's 15-year civil war broke out.

<P>
The Yellow River, which meanders over 1,900 km through Qinghai,
is another favorite boating destination.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir at the Longyang Gorge Hydropower Plant introduced
boating on the river.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ROK Firms In Shandong Province Report Rising Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The exports by ROK-funded companies
in east China's Shandong Province were valued at 891 million US
dollars in the first five months of this year, up 6.5 percent on
the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is home to 2,525 firms funded by the Republic of Korea
(ROK), or half of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials attributed the rise in exports by ROK-funded
firms to their minimal presence in the Asian market. As a result,
the firms have not been affected by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Half of their products were exported to the European and
American markets, and only 24 percent of their products sold in
other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government's firm support for ROK firms in the
form of new policies and reduced taxes has also contributed to
their good performance.

<P>
HEFEI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Anhui
Province have enjoyed a general improvement in living standards in
recent years, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In 1997, the per capita income of Anhui farmers increased to

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Warn of Renewed Fires in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN environment ministers
warned Friday against a renewed threat of fires in the months
ahead as the region is entering into the dry season.
</P>
<P>
The warning was contained in a statement issued by Singapore
Minister for the Environment and Health Yeo Cheow Tong at a press
conference held at the end of the one-day 4th Ministerial Meeting
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Haze.
</P>
<P>
The statement said though heavy rains had helped put out the
fires in Kalimantan and the El Nino was at its final stages, new
fires were already spotted in some parts of the region,
particularly in Sumatra, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted that firm measures should be taken
immediately to put out these fires before they go out of control.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to speed up the implementation of the
Regional Haze Action Plan which was launched to beef up preventive
measures, and to establish regional monitoring mechanisms to
enhance fire-fighting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said that the plans must be complemented by
public education efforts and strict enforcement against open
burning, and they particularly urged ASEAN countries to include in
their national laws regulations to discourage open burning
activities by land owners.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to strengthen fire-fighting cooperative
mechanisms for fire-fighting in Sumatra, which involve Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore. They also set an objective to prevent
fires and not to allow the scales of any fires to deteriorate into
a disaster level.
</P>
<P>
On fire-fighting in Kalimantan, Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia
will join efforts to prevent and contain any fires there within
the framework of a working group led by Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Singapore agreed to assist Indonesia in aerial
surveillance by providing training and communication equipment
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called on the international community to
provide the necessary assistance.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) said at the press conference that the Global Environment
Facility has adopted a project of 750,000 U.S. dollars to support
the efforts to deal with fires and haze, and the UNEP will
actively follow up with potential donors on an ASEAN plan to
establish a 10-million-U.S.-dollar fund for fire-fighting and
other related measures.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the United States has promised to offer an
aid of 4 million dollars to help ASEAN deal with the regional haze
problem and an additional 2 million dollars to assist Indonesia in
fire-fighting operations.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech Friday morning, Yeo Cheow Tong said the
1997 fires and haze cost ASEAN 4.5 billion dollars and a repeat of
this disaster will surely aggravate the already bad regional
economic situation.

<HEADLINE> China's Communist Youth League Growing Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest youth
organization, the Communist Youth League of China (CYLC), has been
growing steadily over the past five years, said a senior leader of
the CYLC.
</P>
<P>
The total number of members of the CYLC stands at 68.5 million,
up 10.5 million from 1993. And 3.92 million members of the CYLC
joined the Communist Party of China (CPC), the ruling party of the
country, over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the 13th CYLC Central Committee, Zhou Qiang,
executive member of the Secretariat of the 13th Central Committee
of the CYLC, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the
14th National Congress of the CYLC here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the five years after the convocation of the
13th National Congress of the CYLC, 230 million Chinese young
people, some one-fourth of the country's total population, have
made tremendous contributions to China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said the past five years have shown that the present
generation of Chinese youth is a reliable and promising
generation, and has been growing steadily under the correct
guidance of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Since it was founded in 1922, the CYLC has all along stuck to
the principle of CPC leadership, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, the CYLC has given priority to the education
of the young generation and sticks to the principle of using Deng
Xiaoping Theory to equip them as a spiritual pillar.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the past five years, more than 50
million members of the CYLC have attended professional training
courses, and more than 1,000 small- and medium-size enterprises
have begun to reduce losses or turn a profit because of the CYLC.
</P>
<P>
He said that the young volunteers program, launched by the CYLC
in 1993, has promoted the building of social ethics, and the
movement now boasts more than 1.3 million youth volunteer groups,
comprising 70 million young people.
</P>
<P>
The Hope Project, also launched by the CYLC, has so far
received more than 1.3 billion yuan in donations from home and
abroad, which has helped more than 1.8 million dropouts to return
to school and funded the building of more than 5,000 Project Hope
primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Zhou stressed that the work of the CYLC should be
conscientiously subject to the work of the whole Party and the
whole country, and the CYLC should stick to the leadership of the
CPC and be consistent with the CPC Central Committee, with Jiang
Zemin at the core, politically and ideologically.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Increases Loan Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) - The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC), one of the country's big four commercial banks, has
accelerated the extension of loans this year to help boost
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The bank issued 32.5 billion yuan in loans in the first five
months, including 9.4 billion yuan in May, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said that ABC will continue to give lending
priority to the agricultural sector this year. He added that the
bank has budgeted its loans for the agricultural sector at 35
billion yuan, 1.1 billion yuan more than last year, or more than
20 percent of the bank's loan portfolio this year, which is valued
at 160 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The bank also increased lending to the real estate sector,
mainly targeting residential housing and the renovation of rundown
buildings. It is also seeking to start new forms of loan services
to finance home buyers.
</P>
<P>
ABC also beefed up financial support for infrastructure
projects and basic industries, including transportation,
telecommunications, power and high-technology, in the first five
months. The bank plans to extend 15 billion yuan in fixed-asset
loans this year, a surge of 12 billion yuan from last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank also attached great importance to meeting
the financial needs of medium- and small-size enterprises,
joint-stock companies, overseas-funded enterprises and private
businesses. Its planned loans for rural and township enterprises,
for example, will reach 25 billion yuan this year, 5 billion yuan
more than in 1997.

benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 10.48 points
to close at 1,122.91 points.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were lower on the whole day but off their lows
following some firming in regional currencies in the late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Trading was relatively quiet with most investors taking a
cautious wait-and-see stance ahead of the G-7 (Group of Seven)
meeting of senior finance officials in Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The wider market was weaker with many blue chips coming under
profit-taking after a strong mid-week rally.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume dropped to 146.88 million units, valued
at 321.25 million Singapore dollars (194.70 million U.S. dollars).
Falls led rises by 203 to 83 while 301 other counters remained

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand Hits New Low Against Western </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The rand fell to its worst
levels ever against the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound
Thursday, The Star paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Rand stood at 8.98 Rand to the Pound at the end of the
market after breaking through the nine Rand barrier earlier in
the day. Against the Dollar, it ended at 5.39 Rand, coming back
slightly from a low of 5.41 rand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the weakened Rand would reduce overseas travels
by South Africans, increase the price of imports and contribute
to inflation.
</P>
<P>
The surprise slump came in the afternoon after the Rand
rallied to 5.27 Rand to the Dollar in the morning, up 6 cents
from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Traders, who expected a further Rand recovery following news
that the United States would support Japan's ailing Yen, said
they could not account for the surge of the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
There were reports that the Rand selling came from speculators
in London and New York and there was also talk of a very large
corporate Dollar order.
</P>
<P>
A Rand trader in New York said the volatility in the day
indicated that the market was unsure at what level the Rand
should be trading in current conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank has been absent from the market, allowing
traders free rein to push and pull currencies.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals Thursday dismissed criticism
of the bank's performance, saying South Africa's economic
fundamentals remained sound.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was a victim of a wider attack on
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"As stability returns to the international financial markets,
our economy will be well-placed to resume a new upward phase of
the business cycle," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banking System Still Healthy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine banking system is
still healthy despite the closure of five thrift banks in the past
year, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Singson said the closure
of the five thrift banks will not affect the health of the
country's banking system as their combined resources amount to
only 561 million pesos (about 14 million U.S. dollars), or 0.02
percent of the entire banking industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank closed the five banks after they
failed to raise capital to the required level.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis started in Southeast Asia last July,
the Philippine Central Bank has closed Eastern Visayas Development
Bank, Aklan Development Bank, Commonwealth Savings and Loan Bank,
Community Savings and Loan Association and Fortune Savings and
Loan Association.
</P>
<P>
One commercial bank, Orient Bank, is still in limbo after
declaring a bank holiday on February 14.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is set to discuss with the Philippine Deposit
Insurance Corporation (PDIC) the possibility of bailing out Orient
Bank, which is suffering from non-performing debts, according to
Singson.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the PDIC if it wants to take out some of Orient's
bad assets. If it agrees to do so then it will be all right," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the banking systems of other Southeast Asian
countries, the Philippines' remains relatively healthy although
the five small banks were closed, economists also said.

<P>
BORDEAUX, June 19 (Xinhua) -- After scoring a last-gasp equaliser
in each of their first two group matches, the lucky Austrian team will
now take on the strongest team in Group B--Italy.
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Saint-Denis for the decisive match on June 23,
Austrian coach Herbert Prohaska shouted out his determination:"We
will have to play to win without fearing the Italians."
</P>
<P>
"I saw the first half of the Italian game against Cameroon. To
beat the Italians we will have to take risks except in the
organisation of our game," said Prohaska, "It will be a hard-fought
match, it will be all or nothing."
</P>
<P>
The Austrians have played two matches in the World Cup finals,
but many of them haven't loosened up.
</P>
<P>
Prohaska admitted that his players were still tense and nervous,
"But we can't hold that against them. They've all been giving one
hundred percent in training. By the time we play Italy, I will have
spoken to the players to make them relaxed."
</P>
<P>
Prohaska, who played for Italian club Inter Milan for three seasons

SHANGHAI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The second-phase construction to
provide drinking water from the upper reaches of the Huangpu River
to Shanghai has been completed.
</P>
<P>
The four-year-long effort cost 3 billion yuan to set up
facilities capable of daily transporting 5 million cubic meters of

<HEADLINE> PNA Criticizes Israel's Jerusalem Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Friday criticized Israel's plan for Jerusalem expansion and
called on the international community to pressure Israel to halt
such a unilateral plan.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman said in Gaza that the
expansion plan is aiming at causing a demographic change in the
Holy City for the interest of Israelis to preempt final status
negotiations, according to East Jerusalem-based Palestinian news
service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
He said the expansion plan, which has been endorsed by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is nothing but a "colonial
intention" and that "could not change the fact that Jerusalem is
the capital of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
A 12-point plan designed to strengthen Jerusalem, including
annexing land west of Jerusalem, building a tunnel under Mount
Scopus to connect with the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim east of
Jerusalem, and creating a silicon valley in Jerusalem, was formally
endorsed by Netanyahu on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been the focus of much debate over the past three
months, especially by residents in communities west of Jerusalem,
who have objected to the creation of a Greater Jerusalem via an
umbrella municipality that will wield administrative powers over
these nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a basic change in Jerusalem's status which
will be remembered as a turning point," Netanyahu said after
receiving the plan submitted to him Thursday by a special
committee comprising representatives from the Prime Minister's
Office, Jerusalem Municipality, the Interior Ministry and
Jerusalem Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be funded under the 1999 state budget, will be
presented to the cabinet on Sunday with Netanyahu's firm
endorsement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China's CPPCC members today
suggested the government offer legal backing for the
development of the country's high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at the third plenary meeting of the second
meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
that was held here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Participants indicated that high-tech competition has become
the focus in the international community, and accelerating the
development of high-tech industry is related to the fate
of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Gong Shiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee and vice-chairman of the Liaoning Provincial
Committee of the CPPCC, suggested the government spend 1.5 percent
of the gross domestic product on social research and development
each year, and fix the allocation in the form of a law.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wenying, alaos a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPPCC National Committee, said the government should take
effective measures to fight against unfair competition hindering
the commercialization and industrialization of scientific
research achievements.
</P>
<P>
She said a law governing the high-tech development zone was
submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress last year and was suggested for approval this year to
regulate the development of the country's high-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National
Committee also suggested the government stipulate measures in
government purchases, personnel, finance and tax collection to
support the development of the high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Study Outlines New Global Rural Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of a World
Bank report on global rural economies was published here today,
which called for a new approach to rural development in the 21st
century to solve the pressing problems of poverty, food security
and natural resource management.
</P>
<P>
The publication, titled "Rural Development: From Vision to
Action," reviews the importance of rural development in the global
economy and identifies a series of urgent actions that the World
Bank and its partners must take to improve the welfare of the 800
million people in the world who are going hungry.
</P>
<P>
The new rural development strategy focuses on six key elements
that involve government policies, international trade,
agricultural technology, information, rural infrastructure and
education.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Fox, rural development manager of East Asia at the
World Bank, said: "China has been a world leader in promoting
rural development and we hope that the report will provide new
ideas and initiatives to help spur environmentally sustainable
growth in the poor, remote inland areas of China."
</P>
<P>
Sources from the World Bank's Resident Mission in China said
that the World Bank is preparing a report on rural development
strategy issues, and is expanding its investment program in the
rural sector.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the World Bank approved 1 billion U.S.
dollars in financing for investments in China's rural sector,
including agriculture and irrigation, forestry, coastal
management, state farm commercialization, rural health services
and environmental management.

<HEADLINE> Education Exchanges Dynamic Between China, U.S. (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and twentysix years
ago, noted Chinese educator Rong Hong led 30 teenagers across the
then vast and mysterious Pacific Ocean to a newfound world,
ushering in the first chapter of Sino-U.S. education exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Some of the students, such as the first Chinese railway
engineer, Zhan Tianyou, made pioneering contributions to their
homeland after returning from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such contacts have witnessed ups and downs in the ensuing one
and a quarter centuries amid volatile state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
China's opening-up policy initiated in the late 1970s reopened
the gates of China, starting from a narrow crack to the now
two-way channels accessible to hundreds of thousands of people
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The past two decades can be considered a period with gradually
recovered exchanges, wide-ranging cooperative fields, and more
tangible results," said Chen Zhili, China's education minister, in
a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, in the past 20 years
a total of 163,000 scholars and students went to the United States
to study in almost all academic fields in more than 1,000
institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
"With the majority engaging in the study of natural sciences,
the figure accounted for 56 percent of the total studying abroad
in the period," Chen said, adding that 43,300 of them have
finished study and returned to China.
</P>
<P>
"It is also noteworthy that more and more students from the
United States are coming to study in China," she said. In 1997
alone, 3,135 U.S. students enrolled in Chinese colleges.

<HEADLINE> Ten Cities Report Excellent Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ten cities reported excellent air
quality in the previous week, according to information released by
the China Environment Monitoring Center (CEMC) today.
</P>
<P>
The inland cities of Nanchang and Nanning joined the group of
cities with excellent air quality, an honor normally reserved for
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
The other eight cities reporting excellent air quality were
Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Haikou, Beihai, Zhanjiang and
Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The CEMC's report gives the air quality atmospheric pollution
index (API) of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX) and
total suspended particles (TSP).
</P>
<P>
Air quality is listed on five levels by the State Environmental
Protection Administration. An API from 0 to 50 is level I, meaning
excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or good quality; 101
to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to 300 is level IV,
or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
No cities reported heavy air pollution in the June 12-18
period, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan, the capital of north China's Shanxi Province, was the
only city with medium air pollution. Its major problem was TSP.
</P>
<P>
Seven cities including Beijing, Lanzhou and Tianjin had slight
air pollution in the period, all with TSP as the major problem.
</P>
<P>
The air quality of the remaining 26 cities including Shanghai,
Suzhou and Guilin was good, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has 44 cities releasing weekly air quality
reports.

HARBIN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The drought has eased in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, a major autumn grain producer in

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Post-flood Disease Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Fearing serious floods and
droughts this summer, China's health departments are taking
measures to control a possible outbreak of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has informed local health
departments and agencies responsible for preventing epidemics to
be ready for disease control after flooding, according to
a MOH official.
</P>
<P>
Floods or droughts are often followed by intestinal illnesses
as a result of water pollution, said Li Jianguo, an official with
the MOH's Department of Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not provide national statistics on epidemics in
the first half of this year, the official admitted that the
current situation has become more serious than previous years and
"may worsen if preventive measures are not taken immediately."
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters will also increase the danger of plague and
malaria across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has asked to intensify supervision of the quality
of food and drinking water, as well as protection of water sources
to avoid food poisoning and prevent infectious diseases, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will keep a close eye on migrant people,
schools and large construction sites.
</P>
<P>
A special telephone line will be opened by the ministry for
local authorities to report the epidemic at any time.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Ministry of Water Resources and flood-control
agencies have warned of a possible serious flood on the Yangtze
River, China's longest, which has not occurred in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the nation's second longest, also is expected
to experience flooding this summer.
</P>
<P>
Floods have already hit the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian
and Guangdong in southern China.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Recovers $41m From Bank Frauds in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria banks were saved a loss of
3.526 billion Naira (about 41 million U.S. Dollars) from 478
fraud cases in 1997, through the work of the Failed Banks
Tribunals.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the Nigeria Deposit Insurance
Corporation in its 1997 annual report released recently in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The report said bank staff and their collaborators made
attempt to defraud the banks of a total sum of 3.777 billion
Naira (about 44 million dollars) in 1997, but they succeeded with
only 251.54 million Naira (about 2.96 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 566 bank staff were dismissed for involvement in
fraudulent activities, down from 1995's 625 but up from 552 in
1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the commonest type of frauds are
presentation of forged cheques, granting of unauthorized loans,
unauthorized overdraft, posting of fictitious credits,
suppression of cheques, abuse of medical scheme and fraudulent
transfer and withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
To combat the rising cases of banking frauds, the Nigerian
government promulgated the Failed Banks (recovery of debt) and
Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree 18, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, failed banks tribunals have been set up in
several cities. The prosecution and delivery of judgement in such
tribunals are made easier and much faster than what would have
been in ordinary courts.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts, the total number of fraud cases dropped
from 1996's 606 to 487 in 1997, while the actual loss declined
from 375.2 million Naira to 251.54 Naira, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the report said, both the magnitude of distress
as measured by the number of distressed banks and the depth of
distress as measured by various financial ratios declined in
1997.
</P>
<P>
For example, it said, the ratio of loans and lease of
distressed banks to the industry's total loans and leases fell
from 23.7 percent in 1996 to 21.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of total assets of distressed banks to the
industry's total assets which stood at 19.8 percent in 1995 fell
to 11 percent in 1996 and 7.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1996, the aggregate assets of banks rose by 25
percent to reach 739.3 billion Naira (about 8.70 billion
dollars), while the industry's total deposits rose by 26 percent
to reach 591.2 billion Naira (6.96 million dollars), the report
added.

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Friday's Monitor daily as saying that the
measure will soon cover the whole country and that the bulk of
smuggling will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
"All petrol stations in Kampala and Entebbe will be sealed
with customs seals so that we can know how much fuel is sold and
how much money is earned," the permanent secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Any station that cannot be sealed by the end of the month
along the east-south corridor will be closed down, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fuel smuggling is one of the illicit practices that many have
attributed to an improper taxation policy. This prompts fuel to
be smuggled into Uganda from neighboring Kenya where the tax
rates on fuel are much lower.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, said fuel smuggling is not caused by
high taxes but by the fact that the smuggled fuel remains untaxed
because it had been intended for Rwanda or the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to fight fuel smuggling, the new budget, which was
announced on June 11, aimed at narrowing the gap between fuel tax
rates in Uganda and Kenya. It reduces taxes on petrol, kerosene
by 30 Uganda shillings per liter and that on diesel by 60
Shillings per liter (one U.S. Dollar equals 1200 Uganda
Shillings).

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Above 61 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
around the 61-U.S.-cent mark Friday, buoyed by a firmer Japanese
yen but warily awaiting the outcome of crisis talks in Japan this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended slightly higher after a tumultuous
week during which it dipped to a new 12-year low of 58 U.S. cents
and rose above the 60 U.S.-cent level for the first time in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Market consensus is that the combined U.S. Federal Reserve and
Bank of Japan rescue package for the Japanese yen needs to be
followed up by swift reform by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
All eyes are now firmly focused on the G-7 meeting this weekend
in Tokyo involving deputy finance ministers and central bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the week in Sydney, the Australian dollar was
trading at 61.27 U.S. cents, little changed from 61.21 U.S. cents
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Much will depend on this weekend's meetings of U.S., Japanese
and G-7 officials," the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Michael
Blythe said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 83.47 Japanese yen from
83.77 yen and 1.0981 German marks from 1.0936 previously.

<P>
The one-day meeting involve the Group of Seven (G-7) finance
ministers' deputies and representatives from the 11 Asian economies
included in the Manila Framework.

SEOUL, June 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Friday accepted
invitation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
to attend a "grand festival for national reconciliation, unity and
unification" scheduled for August 14-15 in the truce village of
Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time South Korea has accepted such an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
"We will make a proposal next week to North Korea for a

</P>
<P>
On June 10, in letters to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and overseas Koreans, the DPRK invited them to attend the festival
marking the 53rd anniversary of Korea's independence from Japan on
August 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
"North Korea has formed a preparatory committee for the
festival, and we are to form a same committee comprising of
members from political parties and social organizations," Kang
said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea rejected previous DPRK proposals on the ground that
they were attached with preconditions, including South Korea
repealing its security law and abolishing its intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK did not mention the preconditions this time.

<HEADLINE> Education Exchanges Dynamic Between China, U.S. (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within the framework of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology
Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-U.S. Education Exchange and
Cooperation Protocol, "both official and unofficial exchanges saw
marked progress," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Take the inter-governmental Fulbright program for
instance. About 500 Chinese scholars and graduates and 300
U.S. experts carried out projects in the two countries in more
than 20 academic fields, including economics, law, history,
literature and politics in the past 19 years, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
"Inter-university exchanges are also active," she said. Through
cooperation in such forms as joint college operations,
international conferences and textbook exchanges, the two sides
carried out studies on wide-ranging fields from natural sciences
to liberal arts.
</P>
<P>
"Most recently, U.S.-based multinational corporations showed
strong interest in education exchanges by clinching joint research
labs in Chinese universities," she added.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of the cooperation, Chen said that Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States last fall
is a milestone in the Sino-U.S. diplomacy and has brought about an
opportunity for the two sides to further their education
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The education circles in the two countries should advance
along the development wave and reconsider the importance of such
development at a new height," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and U.S. universities should be encouraged to form
durable and mutually beneficial ties and focus more efforts on the
insightful studies on development trends in education in the
coming century, she added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also urged to put more efforts on joint
science and technology projects. "These substantial exchanges can
push forward the cultivation of talents, and then play a positive
role in each other's economic development and social progress,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"The longtime education exchange, a dynamic part in the
bilateral ties, is a cause with far-reaching impact for the two
countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
With efforts made by the two sides, Chen said she believes the
cooperation will have "richer contents and more accessible
channels" so that a mutual respect and comprehensive education
relationship will be brought well into the 21st century."

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Official Discusses Sino-U.S. Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming China visit will vigorously advance Sino-U.S. economic
cooperation and the healthy growth of two-way trade, according to
Sun Zhenyu, Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
During an exclusive interview today with Xinhua, Sun said that
the scale of bilateral trade does not cater to the demands of the
economic growth of both countries, and the two sides should
earnestly analyze and properly handle the problems in economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sun cited Sino-U.S. trade as the most active and important
part, as well as the major stabilizing factor and driving force of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the bilateral trade volume between the
two countries reached 49 billion U.S. dollars last year, 20 times
that of 1979 when China and the United States resumed their
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Mutual investments have continued to expand. By the end of
1997, the United States had invested in 24,366 projects in China
with contractual and paid-in U.S. investment reaching 40.06
billion and 17.5 billion U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's investment in the United States has also constantly
increased in wider ranges.
</P>
<P>
Since Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a successful visit to
the United States last fall, Sun noted, the establishment of the
midterm negotiation mechanism of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission of
Commerce and Trade and the convening of the Sino-U.S. Joint
Commission of Economy further improved exchange mechanism of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the Sino-U.S. agreement on the peaceful
use of nuclear power and the advancement of cooperation in the
fields of environmental protection and energy constituted new
areas of growth for bilateral economic cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon differences in the two-way trade, Sun said that
the annual evaluation of U.S. Congress on the most-favored-nation
trading status to China is incompatible with the times because
this approach makes the business community of the two countries
worry about the the future of their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The business societies of both countries have made unremitting
efforts to solve the problem, Sun said, adding that "only the
elimination of this practice for the interest of the two countries
can stablize the foundation of bilateral economic cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Urges People to Ensure Political Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday urged his people especially United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) members to be united to ensure
political stability to overcome the attack on the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
He also asked them to fully understand the powers behind the
attack on the local currency and the stock market, saying the
attackers intend not only to suppress the national economy and
finances but also to determine the leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
"In countries where they are able to exert great pressure their
power is not confined to the economic and financial areas alone.
They intend to control politics too and to determine who should
lead that country," he said in his policy speech at the 52nd UMNO
General Assembly here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"An attempt to change leaders in Malaysia had taken place
before when leaders were alleged to be anti-Jews," said Mahathir,
who is UMNO president, referring to allegations that he had made
statements against the Jews at a rally in Terengganu last year.
</P>
<P>
He said they then alleged that current leaders were obstacles
to efforts at economic revival and that present leaders were
ignorant of the intricacies of world financial systems.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to cause political instability because their
allegations will in turn create misunderstanding among leaders,"
he said in his speech focused on the country's economic and
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that under such circumstances, the economic and
financial problems could not be overcome and the economic
situation would worsen and finally the problems would become worse
with leaders unable to work together.
</P>
<P>
"When this happens, the economy will be open for foreign funds
to acquire major local companies. At that time they will revive
the economy and the value of our currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Malaysia's independence is still not assured, he
called on the Malaysian people to get united and work together to
save the nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
On China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Sun
said, the United States made a commitment six years ago to firmly
support China's access to the multilateral trade organization. Sun
expressed the hope that the United States can keep its commitment
so as to avoid any impact on the sound development of bilateral
economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
China's position and active measures taken after the financial
crisis in east Asia occurred last year fully demonstrates its
responsible attitude toward the region and the international
community and were welcomed by the international community, said
Sun.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that keeping China outside the WTO for a long
time will not be conducive to the stability and prosperity of the
world economy, adding his belief that the United States can draw a
correct conclusion on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the bilateral trade imbalance, Sun attributed it
to statistics and technical factors, as well as U.S. government
restrictions on technology exports to China and its insufficient
export promotions which reduced U.S. exports to China and expanded
the gap between statistics for the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Trade statistics also did not include profits by U.S. companies
from product sales in the Chinese market, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to the development of Sino-U.S. trade, and has made
unremitting efforts to solve the trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side will, as always, continue its efforts to
expand bilateral trade, especially its imports from the United
States, said Sun, while asking the U.S. side to lift its export
restrictions and increase credit support for its companies.
</P>
<P>
Sun called it "unfair" since the United States still treats
China as a non-market-economy country and resorts to a surrogate
in dealing with anti-dumping cases with China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Suspects over Tanzanian Pilot Murder Netted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) - Seven suspects including a
policeman in connection with killing a senior Tanzanian pilot
driving in downtown Dar es Salaam early June have been arrested
by police.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe said
Thursday that the suspects were found in possession of three
pistols, dozens of rounds of ammunition and a cellular phone
handset belonging to the slain pilot of the Air Tanzania
Cooperation (ATC), media here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"They are expected to appear in court soon," Gewe said,
appealing to city residents to volunteer more information on the
killing of Elizeus Rugeyemba Rutazaha, a 45-year-old First
Officer of the ATC Boeing Fleet, by two bandits armed with a
sub-machine gun and a pistol at about 11:00 in the morning on
June 8 while his saloon car stopped at a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
Police have not yet established the exact amount of money
which the gunmen took from the Rutazaha's vehicle after killing
him who reportedly left home with one million Tanzanian shillings
(1 U.S. dollar equals to 670 Tanzanian shillings at present) for
shopping in downtown.
</P>
<P>
The only passenger in the car, Alex Kapama, a retired army
officer, was queried by police but later released.
</P>
<P>
The police commander also alleged that the suspects were
hard-core criminals implicated in a number of offenses such as
armed robbery with some of their cases still pending in court.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the incident, Kapama told the police that
the two strangers smashed the car windows and shot Rutazaha in
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
"They then grabbed out two briefcases and disappeared," said
Kapama, who was treated for minor bruises on the hands in the
Muhimbili Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Innocent Mungy, the Public Relations Manager of the ATC, has
said Rutazaha, who had joined the state-owned ATC for 15 years
with 5,000 flying hours, was off-duty following a flight on June
7. The pilot is survived by a wife and three children.

<HEADLINE> New Treatments Save Giant Pandas from Normally Fatal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese veterinarians have managed
to cure chronic gastroenteritis, a major disease that normally
causes the death of giant pandas, through a combination of
traditional Chinese and Western medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
The treatments, regarded as a breakthrough in medical care for
giant pandas, passed the experts' assessment today in Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province and known as the hometown of giant
pandas.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, 10 giant pandas suffering chronic gastroenteritis
have received this medical treatment in the Chengdu Giant Panda
Breeding Research Base.
</P>
<P>
Five of them have recovered and the condition of the others has
been improved.
</P>
<P>
A female giant panda called Yaya gave birth to a female cub
after recovering from one year of treatment. Her daughter, who is
also in good health, weighs 30 kilograms now.
</P>
<P>
Chronic gastroenteritis is the top killer of giant pandas in
childhood. Statistics show that 56 percent of giant pandas raised
in captivity suffer digestive diseases, and 80 percent die of
intestinal and stomach diseases and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the rarest animals in the world and
on the verge of extinction. There are about 1,000 living in
China's western provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi.

<HEADLINE> Russian Officials to Mediate in Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Under President Boris Yeltsin's
instruction, two senior Russian officials left Friday for Abkhazia
to mediate between the conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov and Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS) Executive Secretary Boris Berezovsky
are to attend a new round of Georgian-Abkhaz talks, which is being
held in Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia, between Abkhaz leader
Vladislav Ardzinba and Vazha Lordkipanidze, a special envoy of the
Georgian president.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to pave the way to a personal meeting
and certain agreements between Ardzinba and Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Before departure at the airport, Pastukhov said that Yeltsin,
who chairs the Council of the Heads of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), believed that it was necessary to
facilitate the process of a peaceful settlement of the
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the current negotiations, Pastukhov said,
is to help eliminate the aftermaths of the latest aggravation of
the situation in the conflict region and solve the issues of
repatriating refugees, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Berezovsky stated on Thursday that the CIS Executive Board and
the Russian Foreign Ministry have formed a single consolidating
center for making decisions on the settlement of the Georgian-
Abkhaz problem.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the prospects for the settlement of the conflict,
the CIS executive secretary said that at this stage there are no
talks on exerting a pressure by force on Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although neither Tbilisi nor Sukhumi was pleased
with the efforts of the peacemakers, until now these peacekeeping
forces are an element of stability in the most complicated region.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian-Abkhaz conflict broke out when Abkhazia, a
northwestern autonomous republic of Georgia, proclaimed
independence in July 1992.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Independence Father Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has lost the last of its
independence pillars with the death of veteran statesman Adel
Osseiran, local newspaper Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Osseiran, who had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for
the past 15 years, died at midday Thursday on the way to hospital
in his native city of Sidon, his family said. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
During the 1943 struggle for independence from France,
Osseiran, then minister of supply and trade, was rounded up by
French forces, together with then President Beshara Khoury, Prime
Minister Riad Solh and two other ministers. They were later
released.
</P>
<P>
Pressures from local rebels, demonstrators and international
powers keen to undermine France's presense in the Middle East
prompted Paris to grant Lebanon its independence that year.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the leaders, Osseiran went on to become
one of Lebanon's prominent politicians, a career which spanned the
next five decades.
</P>
<P>
He took part in the parliamentary deliberations in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, which gave birth to the national accord document that put
an end to the 15-year civil war from 1975-1990.
</P>
<P>
He served as parliament speaker between 1953 and 1958 and also
held cabinet portfolios of defense, interior, justice, public
works, economy and education.
</P>
<P>
Osseiran was hailed as "belonging to a school of national
thought" and "an example of a generation of politicians who
entered the arena through the gates of knowledge, competency and
hard work in favor of Lebanon's unity and independence."

<HEADLINE> Independent Judiciary Maintained in HK: Chief Justice (by Tao Wenge) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- As the first chief justice of
the Court of Final Appeal in the history of Hong Kong, Andrew Li
Kwok-nang said that he and his colleagues will try their best to
build their court into one with international reputation.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his office, Li told Xinhua that he has almost given
up all his hobbies since he was appointed chief justice of the
Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"We should try our best because Hong Kong citizens have a very
high expectation to the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR, the
first in the history of Hong Kong," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one year after Hong Kong returned to China on July 1,
1997, the principles of independent judiciary and rule of law have
been successfully maintained in the SAR, Li said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The independence of the judiciary means that everybody is equal
in face of the law no matter who he or she is and that the courts
exercise their judicial power independently, free from any
interference, Li elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He said that he felt no interference at all with his work
either from the mainland or from the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The independence of the judiciary has been guaranteed by the
Basic Law in many areas, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law prescribes that judges of the courts of the SAR
shall be appointed by the chief executive on the recommendation of
an independent commission composed of local judges, persons from
the legal profession and eminent persons from other sectors.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Basic Law stipulates that the judges of the
Court of Final Appeal can hold their position life-long unless
they are no longer able to discharge their duties or conduct any
misbehavior, Li added.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Court of Final Appeal in the SAR
demonstrates that the Hong Kong people enjoy a high degree of
autonomy and it also demonstrates the implementation of the "one
country, two systems" principle in Hong Kong, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR practices a judicial system different from that of the
Chinese mainland. With the exception that the power of final
adjudication was transmitted from the British Privy Council to the
Court of Final Appeal of the SAR, the current judicial system in
Hong Kong almost sees no change compared with the previous one, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Final Appeal comprises not only local judges but
also judges invited from Britain, Australia and New Zealand where
the common law is practiced, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the number of appeals to his court has increased
compared with that to the British Privy Council because it costs
much less to settle the dispute in Hong Kong rather than sending
the cases to Britain as before.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to have a just and fair verdict
and make the parties to the lawsuit respect our verdict," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a pair of glasses, the gray-haired chief justice looks
like a scholar rather than a judge.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that just like the other courts in Hong Kong,
the trial in the Court of Final Appeal is open to members of the
public. all the members of the public can come to listen and the
verdict is also open. "People can read our verdict on the Internet
now," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the building of his court, Li said that the training
of judges is very important.
</P>
<P>
"We have intensified the work of training in three areas: the
latest development of laws, particularly the laws in the common
law area, the Chinese language and the new technology," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong is a Chinese dominated society, all the
trials were conducted in English before.
</P>
<P>
"That was unfair for those Chinese people who don't understand
English although interpreters were provided," Li said.
</P>
<P>
English is used in all the common law practiced areas but the
Chinese language is also very important because trials should be
understood by the ordinary citizens, Li said. "So, the Chinese
judges should learn their Chinese well," the chief justice noted.
</P>
<P>
"We invited famous judges from overseas to give us lectures and
introduce their experiences. We have established contacts with
courts in other common law practiced areas. In addition, we have
positively participated in international conferences," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the piles of files in his office, the chief justice
said that all his time has been occupied by his work and learning
Putonghua (standard spoken Chinese) every Saturday afternoon has
become one of his hobbies now.
</P>
<P>
On the wall of his office, there is a piece of Chinese
calligraphy which reads being upright and avoiding flattery. Li
said that is his motto as a justice.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Lower in Tokyo on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell in Tokyo Friday, led
by profit-taking activity after Thursday's substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange slipped 93.56 points, or 0.61
percent, from Thursday's close to finish at 15,267.98.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, fell 11.57 points or 0.97 percent to 1,187.27.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 480 million
shares from Thursday's 701 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB) was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei index stayed in negative territory throughout the
day, with market players skimming profits after the previous day's
increase of 650 points for the index, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was dampened as LTCB sank to a low of 95 yen
around 9:45 a.m. (local time), drifting below the 100 yen line for
most of the morning.
</P>
<P>
But an afternoon news report that the Japanese government is
considering a possible merger between the ailing LTCB and Nippon
Credit Bank (NCB) helped the Nikkei index recoup some early losses.
</P>
<P>
Market participants welcomed the news as it would likely accelerate
disposal of nonperforming loans at banks and prompt the Japan's
finance sector to reorganize, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,334 issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 679 to 419, with 170 issues remaining unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Environmental lobby group
Greenpeace has criticized the host government for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics of a lack of action in cleaning up toxins at the main
games site.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Sydney, Greenpeace spokesman Michael
Bland said time was running out for the clean-up of toxic
sediments in the Homebush Bay area, home to games infrastructure
such as the main stadium and athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
Another Greenpeace spokesman, Darryl Luscombe, said although
the New South Wales state government announced the clean-up a year
ago and committed about 13 million U.S. dollars to the job, it
had not yet issued a tender for the work.
</P>
<P>
Ports Minister Kim Yeadon said the project was progressing
well, with the first phase of site investigation and assessment
almost complete.
</P>
<P>
Yeadon said: "This is a massive project and it is totally
unrealistic to expect the final stage of the remediation project
to begin immediately."

<HEADLINE> Tensions over Cyprus Send Turkey's Stocks Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tensions over Cyprus have
suppressed Turkey's stock market and worries are growing about
future plummeting if confrontation escalates, the Daily News
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The near crisis wiped out gains in the morning session
resulting from the U.S. support of the Japanese yen, and sent the
Istanbul Stock Exchange into a deep slide Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National-100 index closed at 3.965.51, down 81.6 points,
or 2 percent, from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brokers were worried that similar fluctuations might be
expected as long as the confrontation between Greece and Turkey
continues.
</P>
<P>
"The positive atmosphere in the foreign markets created by
U.S. support of the Japanese yen was also reflected in our
morning session," Murat Zelet, general director of the Boomerang
Investment Partnership, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But in the afternoon, when news of Turkish fighter jets
landing in Cyprus and subsequent tension reached the market, we
witnessed a dive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent six F-16 fighters to the Gecitkale Air Base in
northern Cyprus Thursday morning in response to Greek Air Force's
military movements on the southern part of the island state.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement earlier said Greece's four F-16
jets and two C-130 cargo planes had touched down in Cyprus,
constituting a threat to the security of Turkish Cypriots and
Turkey itself.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
intervened and took over the northern third of the island
following an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economy Called Satisfactory in 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The performance of Nepal's most
macroeconomic indicators is satisfactory during the first 10
months of the current fiscal year which ends in mid-July, The
Rising Nepal daily said Friday, quoting the country's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
A substantial growth of 20 percent in exports plus a decline of
6.7 percent in imports has resulted in lower trade deficit and a
significant surplus of 7.925 billion rupees (122 million U.S.
dollars) in balance of payments, which in turn has contributed to
a substantial rise in foreign exchange reserves, the newspaper
quoted the Nepal Rastra Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, by mid-May, the foreign exchange holding
of the banking system rose by 21.4 percent to 60.497 billion
rupees (930 million dollars), sufficient to cover average
merchandise imports for a period of more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
It said a decline in gold imports is one of the major causes
for the slowdown in the overall imports, and accordingly, the
total foreign trade of the country witnessed a fall of 1.6 percent
to 96.185 billion rupees (1.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Net foreign assets of the banking system increased by 19.7
percent during the first 10 months of the current fiscal year
compared with a rise of 13.2 percent last year, the bank noted in
a press release.
</P>
<P>
The net domestic assets, which grew by 8.9 percent last year,
went up by 6.3 percent during this period.
</P>
<P>
Domestic credit during the review period rose by 7.5 percent
while credit to the government decreased by 1.7 percent, the bank
said, adding that 69.9 percent of the total domestic credit went
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign cash assistance (grants and loans) during the
period soared to 6.631 billion rupees (102 million dollars) as
against 3.126 billion rupees (48 million dollars) last year, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
On the price front, the national urban consumer price index
(base year 1983/84=100), on a point-to-point basis, rose by 6.6
percent during the period as against 5.3 percent for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country in the period saw a 3.4-percent growth
in total resources.
</P>
<P>
Development expenditure rose by 9.6 percent compared with zero
growth last year while the regular expenditure went up by 13.3
percent, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Winter-Spring Rice Crops Do Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 19 (xinhua) -- Vietnam has harvested more than
13.51 million tons of rice from the winter-spring crop, 200,000
tons more than last year, the English-language Vietnam News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bumper winter-spring crop has helped lower rice prices and
an estimated 2.8 million tons of rice has been exported over the
past six months, the newspaper quoted the General Department of
Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the yield of subsidiary crops was about 1.32 million
tons of rice equivalent, lower than previous years. Maize, the
second staple crop after rice, yielded more than 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the output of the subsidiary crops was
low because many farmers have turned to more profitable sugarcane
and peanuts. As a result, the area sown with maize fell by 3
percent and sweet potato by 3.5 percent compared with last year.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Welcome Management Transparency Over Their Affairs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a sociologist from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, village affairs such as financial management, land
distribution for building housing and contracts for economic
programs which used to be closed to public opinion formed the major
cause of disputes in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The lack of transparency and supervision over the actions of
village officials also led to corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
State Council have jointly issued a circular urging the country's
nearly one million villages to adopt a system based on the "open
management of village affairs".
</P>
<P>
The circular stresses that introduction of the system is the
major task for work in rural areas and will in turn have an
important bearing on rural reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Organic Law on Village Committees in the People's Republic
of China passed in 1987 requires the direct election of all
village officials formerly appointed by governments at higher
levels.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen provinces across China have introduced regulations
governing implementation of the law. Most Chinese villages have
held three direct elections of village officials over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Information provided by the Ministry of Civil Affairs shows
that more than 60 percent of the country's villages have adopted
the system of "self-government by villagers". For example, over 90
percent of villages in Anhui Province have adopted the system
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Xin Qiushui, an agricultural expert and researcher with the
Anhui Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, said the system of
"self-government by villagers" adapts to the need for farmers to
participate in the management of village affairs.
</P>
<P>
Xin noted that rural reform and implementation of contract
responsibility system provide more decision-making powers which
enable Chinese farmers to manage their own businesses. He said
farmers are exhibiting greater concern about their overall
interests, village affairs and the actions of local officials.
</P>
<P>
Wuhe County, for example, has established a leading group
responsible for promoting implementation of the system of "
self-government by villagers". As a result, more than 85 percent
of local farmers participated in village elections held in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Welcome Management Transparency Over Their Affairs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Years ago farmers from Qutai Village
had to appeal to governments at higher levels for help when
dissatisfied with the improper management of local financial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has fundamentally changed since Wuhe
County in east China's Anhui Province where the village belongs to
introduced democratic elections for the village leader in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Local farmer Sun Baoting, the leader of the aforementioned
appeal effort, has since been elected to lead the village group
responsible for supervising the management of village affairs.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that local villagers are satisfied with the current
management of village affairs since the adoption of system of
"self-government by villagers" which allows all villagers to voice
their opinions on their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
The village has also elected 21 representatives to soliciting
opinions on all major affairs which have an important bearing on
the interests of local villagers. Village leaders fully consider
all opinions before making final decisions.
</P>
<P>
The village also published a quarterly financial report and
various other village affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to a local villager, the "self-government by
villagers" means "four democracies" -- democratic elections of
village officials, democratic decision-making in village
management, democratic management of village affairs and
democratic supervision by villagers over village leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Self-government by villagers has enabled farmers to be the
masters of their own affairs which guarantees their democratic
rights and promotes stability, economic growth and social
development in rural areas," said Hui Liangyu, governor of Anhui
Province.

<HEADLINE> China Builds System to Monitor National Marine Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China has built networks to monitor
the marine environment in all of its territorial waters after 20
years of effort.
</P>
<P>
Built by the National Oceanographic Bureau, the networks are
expected to provide essential data for drafting policies on
sustainable national marine development.
</P>
<P>
Covering a nationwide network and three regional networks, the
monitoring system can launch 1,300 surveys of water quality in all
the river mouths, ports and offshore areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The system could launch more than 50 kinds of investigative
items including monitoring radiation materials, red tide,
petroleum spills and waste dumps.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuguang, deputy director of the National Oceanographic
Bureau, said that the whole system has more than 1,300
technicians, 22 vessels, two planes and some 600 monitoring
devices as well as advanced location equipment and data processing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Wang is currently on an inspection tour of the marine
environment protection system arranged by the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 years of the next century, Wang noted, the
networks will focus on monitoring marine resources and the
biological effects of environmental pollution.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province has paved
the way for the introduction of an internationally recognized
credit asset classification system for its banking sector.
</P>
<P>
In early May, the People's Bank of China, the nation's central
bank, announced Guangdong would conduct experiments with a
five-level credit asset classification system designed to improve
bank loan management.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Seeks Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) filed to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) here Friday a
rehabilitation plan intended to bring PAL back to financial
health.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 billion pesos (2 billion U.S. dollars) in debts will
have to be restructured to give PAL time to improve its cash flow
and enable it to service its loan payments, PAL said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
PAL said it is current in all its loan obligations as of
Friday, but it is not in a position to project its cash flow in
the coming months because of the adverse effects of the pilots'
strike and the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Precisely we are seeking SEC assistance in implementing a
rehabilitation plan for PAL to avoid defaulting on our loans and
breaking up company assets that may arise from creditors' action,"
PAL President Jose Antonio Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
He assured PAL creditors that current assets of the company are
more than enough to cover its maturing obligations and that they
are in no danger of not being paid in case of closure. He added
that the company has over 90 billion pesos (2.2 billion dollars)
in assets.
</P>
<P>
Under the rehabilitation plan, PAL will reduce fleet size, lay
off personnel, dispose of excess assets and inventories,
restructure route network, give up routes and frequencies to
strategic alliances and obtain the support of creditors,
financiers and unions.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 12 years, PAL has suffered aggregate losses of 21
billion pesos (512 million dollars). Last fiscal year, it
registered a loss of 8 billion pesos (195 million dollars), the
largest in its history. The recent strike by pilots aggravated the
financial woes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, PAL has decided to lay off 5,000 workers and fire all
the 620 pilots on strike.
</P>
<P>
PAL said rebuilding the airline will be long and difficult and
will entail a lot of sacrifices from all sectors concerned. It
appealed for cooperation and understanding as it strives to render
continued service to the riding public and the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, commercial bank creditors and PAL reached an
agreement, recognizing the need to reschedule PAL's obligations.

BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Sino-US law school exchanges have
developed smoothly and produced remarkable results since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was reached during the seminar on law school
education attended by presidents of more than 30 Chinese and
American law schools and well known legal experts. The seminar

<HEADLINE> China to Search for Missing Peking Man Fossils (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China's leading scientists are
planning an ever-larger search for six skullcaps of Peking Man
which disappeared more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The country's most authoritative paleoanthroplogists and
archeologist have solicited clues related to the missing
skullcaps, said Dong Junshe, a research fellow with the Institute
of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The find of Peking Man fossils, dating back about 500,000
years, around Zhoukoudian in suburban Beijing stunned the whole
world. However, the treasured six intact skullcaps disappeared
without a trace during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to publicize through the nationwide media a letter
which was co-signed by scores of CAS academicians to get support
from all over the country," said Dong here today in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Jia Lanpo, a leading Chinese paleoanthropologist, said: "These
skullcaps are most likely buried somewhere in China. But the
search might be extremely difficult."
</P>
<P>
Jia, 89, has poured more than six decades into studying Peking
Man fossils. "We must find the skullcaps as early as possible,"
said Jia, who obtained worldwide fame largely because of his
excavating skullcaps of Peking Man.

<P>
"We aim to arouse the conscience of the human being, enhancing
the development of science and world peace," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
"Potential clues might be lost forever," he said, because
almost all discoverers of the Peking Man fossils and other key
insiders are dead.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people enthusiastically responded to the research
endeavor initiated by the CAS institute, he said. Some individuals
have offered to finance the work.
</P>
<P>
"Once the CAS and the State Bureau of Cultural Relics approve
the project, we will kick it off immediately," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the authorities should better preserve
the Zhoukoudian ruins, where later excavations yielded mandibles,
facial bones, limb bones, teeth, animal fossils and 100,000-odd
stone tools.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with scientific reports, Peking Man has an
average cranial capacity of 1,075 cubic centimeters. Some skulls
are even characterized by 1,300 cubic centimeters of capacity,
equal to modern man.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chinese scientists and their global counterparts
have to rely on a broken Peking Man skull, which is now preserved
in the CAS institute.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese archaeologist Pei Wenzhong stumbled upon the first
complete skull of Peking Man in a cave at Chou-k'ou-tien on
December 2, 1929.
</P>
<P>
In 1941, some attempts were made to send the six skullcaps
and other precious fossils to the United States when the Japanese
troops invaded China.
</P>
<P>
But the bones disappeared and have never been recovered after
leaving the Peking Union Medical College, the last place for
preserving them.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets Fresh Target for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has set a
new target of hosting two million tourists by 2002 despite a
recession in the country's top foreign exchange earner since
middle last year.
</P>
<P>
"After the target is realized, the tourism industry will be
expected to contribute about 20 percent to the gross domestic
product (GDP)," said Minister for Tourism Herry Kosgey.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is planning to take serious measures to
revamp the tourism industry from the current slump, he was quoted
by Friday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"An aggressive marketing drive will be stepped up in the
coming financial year to ensure Kenya recaptures its lost
leadership position in the world of tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosgey said Kenya has the potential of hosting the targeted
visitors since the existing hotel accommodation of more than
73,000 hotel beds, international airports, an expanded Tourist
Police Unit and other infrastructure are revitalizing.
</P>
<P>
The east African country had seen more than one million
visitors by the end of 1994, according to data from the Central
Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 59 national parks, game reserves and
marine parks in Kenya, one of the leading tourist destination in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Increases Between Shanghai, Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
metropolis, and Boston, one of the most technologically developed
cities in the United States, are stepping up efforts to promote
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai's economic growth means great business opportunities
to Boston, and my mission here is to spur this momentum of
cooperation," said Robert J. Wolfgang, head of the Office of
International Trade and Business Development under the Office of
the Mayor of Boston.
</P>
<P>
Dramatic changes have taken place in Shanghai since he first
visited the city seven years ago, Wolfgang said Wednesday. He is
heading a 14-member trade delegation to Shanghai. The Chinese city
is maintaining its stable and healthy growth pattern after a
period of high-speed economic increases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Boston is home to many institutions of higher learning, such as
Harvard University, he said, and will make the most of its
scientific and technological advantages to cooperate with
Shanghai, which boasts science and technology, personnel
resources, and abundant capital.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. city is planning cooperative projects with Shanghai in
telecommunications, environmental protection technologies,
software development, biochemical research, tourism, financial
services, and education.
</P>
<P>
Boston officials are talking with Shanghai University to open a
program for business training and exchanges of teachers and
students. Later this year, Boston plans to organize 150 to 200 of
its businesses to do on-the-spot investigations in Shanghai,
Wolfgang said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the delegation include senior managers of
Boston-based multinationals and some MBA students at Bently
College.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Rejects Market Forces as Way for Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Friday that his country could not rely on
market forces to combat the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Claims that these market forces are apparently aimed at forming
transparent governments, free from corruption and nepotism and any
form of crime by the leadership are mere excuses to gain control
or to re-colonize a country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd United Malays National Organization (UMNO)
General Assembly here, Mahathir said, "This is mere fairy tale.
Market forces are not meant to improve governments, financial
management and practices of the countries under attack."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, what they do is actually allowing traders and
speculators to extract as much profits as possible from the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Hoping for market forces to create a stable currency exchange,
economy and stable politics is the same as not doing anything and
leaving everything to fate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said market forces profit from economic and financial
instability caused by the attack on the currencies.
</P>
<P>
"Why should they stabilize the conditions at the expense of
their profits?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is illogical that to resuscitate our economy and
currency, we should submit to the demands of market forces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said these forces would continue attacking the
financial and economic systems until a democratically elected
leader bows to the outside powers.
</P>
<P>
"When this happens, the economy will be opened to foreign
companies and funds to enter and take over local big companies,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir said Malaysia could still defend the local
companies from being acquired by foreigners who could only own 30
percent stake in companies and banks.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Anti-Smoking Laws Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Health and Child Welfare
Ministry of Zimbabwe Thursday said tough anti-smoking measures
need to be taken through introduction of legislation which bans
smoking in tobacco free zones, to promote public health, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing guests at a ceremony to mark World Non-Tobacco Day
in Harare, deputy minister David Parirenyatwa said the
legislation should include, among other things, the banning of
all sponsorship of sporting activities by tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
It should also map out strategies that provide economic
alternatives to tobacco farmers and agricultural workers.
</P>
<P>
Places which could be declared tobacco-free zones include
public transport, health institutions, schools and other
education institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe generates a lot of financial benefits from tobacco
growing and tobacco sales and exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
"My ministry's main concern is in protecting the health of all
the people in Zimbabwe from the ill effects of tobacco smoking,
both passive and active," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said tobacco kills up to 50 percent of smokers who start
smoking in their adolescence and continue throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
He blamed adult influence and the easy accessibility of
tobacco to youths in the country as the main reasons why a big
number of youths smoked.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco alone is believed to be killing about 3.5 million
people every year worldwide through chronic illnesses such as
pulmonary diseases and cancer.

<HEADLINE> Two Cambodian Parties Threaten to Boycott Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Two Cambodian opposition
parties, the Sam Rainsy and Son Sann Party, Friday threatened to
boycott the forthcoming elections if the electoral process is not
improved by the government and the National Election Committee
(NEC).
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, president of the Sam Rainsy Party, and Son Soubert,
president of the Son Sann Party made the announcement in a joint
statement addressed to the Friends of Cambodia, an informal group
consisting of mostly donor countries to Cambodia, such as the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders stated that none of the requirements for fair
elections set out by the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has been met. They believed that their hope for minimum
fairness in the elections has nearly vanished.
</P>
<P>
The statement said killings and intimidations continue; legal
institutions such as the Constitutional Council have been created
illegally and packed with ruling party supporters; hundreds of
thousands of citizens are denied the right to register; media
access is doled out in token amounts; and the ruling party has a
free reign.
</P>
<P>
Unless there is a commitment by the government and the NEC to
improving the electoral process, the two parties will declare on
July 5, three weeks before the scheduled polling, that they will
not take part in the July 26 election, the two leaders announced.
</P>
<P>
But they emphasized their commitment to participating in
reasonably fair elections which they believed could bring true,
long-term stability to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy is one of Hun Sen's harshest critics and his Sam
Rainsy Party is a member of the National United Front (NUF), the
other three being Funcinpec, the Son Sann Party and Khmer Neutral
Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Women and children in the Tibet
Autonomous Region enjoy good health care thanks to the extensive
efforts of local governments and the support of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The region has established a health care network covering all
urban and rural areas, with related centers and stations for women
and children available in 48 prefecture and counties.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 hospitals at or above the county level have
established gynecology and obstetrics departments, and 110
townships, or more than 60 percent of the total, have opened
health care centers for women and children.
</P>
<P>
Constantly improving health care for women and children over
the past four decades has reduced the region's infant mortality
rate from 430 per thousand the only 37 per thousand. In addition,
the mortality rate for pregnant women has dropped from 50 per
thousand to only three per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy of local women has grown from
36 years to 65 years.
</P>
<P>
The region also has cooperated extensively with international
organizations such as the the United Nations Children's Fund and
the World Health Organization in developing health care programs
for women and children.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has trained over 4,000 health care professionals for
rural areas in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Saves Stranded Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Hughes Global Services Inc.
announced Thursday it had successfully used the moon's gravity to
slingshot a stranded communication satellite into useful orbit
around the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The 3.8-ton wayward satellite had been stuck in a useless orbit
since it was launched last December for Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It now orbits at the desired 22,300 miles above the Pacific
Ocean, said the company.
</P>
<P>
The salvage mission by Hughes Global Services Inc., a
subsidiary of Hughes Space and Communications Co., marked the
first time that a private company has sent a spacecraft to the
moon for a commercial purpose.
</P>
<P>
Only NASA has used the slingshot technique for interplanetary
exploration before.
</P>
<P>
Hughes officials believe that using gravity as a fuel-saving
device will make launches cheaper or allow companies to put
heavier satellites into place.

<HEADLINE> Armey: House to Complete Finance Legislation by August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Dick Armey, Majority Leader of
the U.S. House of Representatives, promised on Thursday that the
house would complete work on campaign finance legislation by
August. Democrats however accused the Republican leadership of
delaying tactics aimed at ensuring that no bill will survive.
</P>
<P>
Armey said he had told republicans supporting campaign funding
measures that "they should be assured that proceedings on this
bill in this house will be completed in their entirety by the
August recess."
</P>
<P>
In turn, Representative Christopher Shays, a republican and
co-sponsor of one of the leading campaign finance proposals, and
other republicans agreed to back a leadership initiative that
could allow a stream of amendments to be offered.
</P>
<P>
Democrats railed at the procedural rule, approved by a mostly
party-line 221-189 vote, that would allow lawmakers to offer 258
unrelated amendments to the various campaign funding bills on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Representative David Bonior, a democrat, said the republicans
aimed to delay action and to "divide, derail and destroy any
possibility of substantive bipartisan reform."
</P>
<P>
Representative Martin Frost, a democrat, said that even if work
was finished by August it would be too late for the senate to
act.
</P>
<P>
The senate abandoned campaign finance legislation after making
little headway earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, however, argued that democrats were trying to stop
open debate.
</P>
<P>
After the procedural vote, the house began debate on what could
be the most popular of 12 proposals to revamp campaign funding
practices the house will debate in coming weeks. The proposal
that wins the most votes will become the final House version.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan proposal of Shays and Representative Marty
Meehan, a democrat, would ban so-called "soft money" --
unregulated donations to national and state political parties from
corporations, labor unions and individuals. It would also regulate
issue advertising by third parties and expand disclosure
requirements.

<HEADLINE> Maldivian President Awarded WHO Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom has been awarded the prestigious Health For All Gold Medal
by the World Health Organization (WHO), according to WHO sources
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The award was handed over Sunday to Gayoom by WHO Director
General Hiroshi Nakajima in Male, capital of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
According to the citation which accompanied the award, the
medal was given in recognition of President Gayoom's outstanding
contribution to the attainment of a social goal of health for all
in his country.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that over the past two decades, the Maldives
has made remarkable progress in the area of public health due to
the vision, initiative and dedication of Gayoom.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives had eradicated many communicable diseases,
decreased infant mortality rate from 120 to 27 per 1000 live
births and increased life expectancy from 48 to 71 years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the UNDP's Human Development Index had ranked the
Maldives far ahead of many developing nations as a country of
medium level achievement and social development.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the Maldives had only one small hospital and one
physician per 20,700 people.
</P>
<P>
Today, hospital bed capacity has increased about ten-fold, and
a ratio of 1,300 persons per physician has been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports Earns 730 million U.S. Dollars From EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam earned 730 million
U.S. dollars from exports to the European Union (EU) in the first
five months of this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Garment and textiles led Vietnam's export items to the EU,
fetching 180 million dollars or 40 percent of the country's export
turnover in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
The EU market has also opened for processed aquatic products
from 28 Vietnamese processing enterprises which earned a combined
turnover of 40 million dollars or 13 percent of the sector's total
export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Rice was another export item to European countries with 148,000
tonnes shipped to the Netherlands, 57,000 tonnes to Sweden and
4,000 tonnes to France in the period.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of exports to the EU is a drastic measure that is
helping Vietnamese export enterprises overcome outlet
restrictions. Vietnam's exports to Asian countries, Japan in
particular, have declined due to the on-going regional economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to West European countries early April this
year, Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van Khai proposed his hosts to
help Vietnamese goods enter the EU market. The businessmen
accompanying the prime minister met with their EU counterparts to
seek markets for their products.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's imports from the EU stood over 400 million dollars in
the first five months of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukranian President Leonid Kuchma has
ordered a partial suspension of this year's conscription, the
Information Office of the Ukranian Defense Ministry disclosed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, also the commander-in-chief of the Ukranian army,
issued the order Wednesday, calling on the Ukranian Armed Forces,
the National Guard, the Security Service and the Communication
Troops to stop conscription.
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Force, the Border Guard Troops and the
Civil Defense Forces could continue their recruiting.
</P>
<P>
The Ukranian army, which conscripts 100,000 people annually,
has absorbed 70,000 so far this year. The number of servicemen
will be reduced by 30,000 this year because of retirements.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, which has a 350,000 strong regular army, planned this
year to reduce it by 17,000 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here linked Kuchma's order with the government's
anticipation of considerably cutting down financial expenditure
and reducing the budget deficit to 2.5 percent of the gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan Able to Meet Food Needs by 2000, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan will be able to fully
satisfy its domestic food needs by the year 2000, President
Saparmurad Niyazov said in the capital city of Ashabad Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that Niyazov had set for its
agro-industrial complex a two-million-ton target in both grain and
unginned cotton output by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The president said the grain production goal for this year was
1.2 million tonnes. So far, the country has already purchased more
than 550,000 tonnes of summer grain from the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The current grain producing capacity for the state of Lebap
alone is 20,000 tonnes, which the president has raised to 26
tonnes for the next year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the state were optimistic about the target, saying
that the task would be fulfilled by turning waste land into arable
ones.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan, the country with 80 percent of its territory
being desert, used to give top priorities to cotton growing and
sheep husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a rapid grain production rise in recent years, food
supply in the country has witnessed steady improvement.

<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international conference
will begin here Saturday to garner support for the development of
the country's southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), press
reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, jointly organized by the Economic Relations
Division under the Ministry of Finance and the United Nations
Development Program, is also aimed at disseminating information
about the prospects of development projects in the hill districts
following the singing of the CHT peace accord between the
government and the tribals last December.
</P>
<P>
The conference, titled "peace and Chittagong Hill Tracts" and
scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, would
focus on the prospects of development in the CHT, Finance Minister
Shah A.M.S. Kibria said. "We must now consolidate the gains of the
peace treaty. We must involve everyone and take up development
schemes," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to generate greater awareness in the international
community about the prospects of investment and development in the
CHT. We want to sensitize the international community,
particularly donors, so that they are encouraged to take up
participatory programs," Economic Relations Division Secretary
Mashiur Rahman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three major objectives of the conference were to learn
about the experiences of ethnic conflicts in other countries, to
find out what sort of institutional measures could be taken up for
development and to list the economic potentials that could be
tapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands have made commitment to
extending assistance for development activities in the CHT, and
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have also shown
interest in taking up projects in the region, according to Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the embassies and the leading donor agencies
would participate in the conference, and some members of the
British parliament and representatives of some leading
governmental and non-governmental organizations and think-tanks
might also be present at the meeting.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States urged on
Thursday the Albanians separatists in Kosovo to restrain,
otherwise, conditions in the Serbian province will deteriorate
further.
</P>
<P>
If the ethnic Albanian rebels launch new offensive against
Serbs, it is "a sure-fire way" to give Belgrade another pretext to
kill innocent Albanians, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"It will not improve the situation. The goal now should be to
reduce violence on both sides," added Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubin criticized Belgrade's refusal to pull its
security forces from the province and to accept direct
international involvement in a dialogue with Albanian
representatives.
</P>
<P>
He noted those steps were demanded by the "contact group" of
nations that has been seeking peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that those were critical conditions that needed to
be met for a serious dialogue that had the prospect of succeeding,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has indicated that it will not support an independent
the Albanian-dominated province.

At least 107 fires have erupted in 28 of Florida's 67 counties
since May 25, burning more than 1800 hectares, causing at least 13

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
issued a package of decrees on economic reform with an aim to
reduce taxes and stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The decrees order a cut in the value-added tax, unification of
the agriculture tax, and the simplification of procedures for tax
payments by small and middle-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation, Kuchma explained that the
newly-elected Supreme Rada (parliament) has been paralyzed with
inactivity for more than a month, due to the fact that it has not
been able to elect a speaker. As a result, it has not been able to
review the 42 economic proposals submitted by the Ukraine cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In this situation, the president said, he was compelled to
issue these decrees.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that although a long-sustained production drop is
already under control, budget revenues and the overall economic
situation has not yet taken a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
The president said his greatest concern is that the financial
crisis would effect the stability of the Ukrainian currency hryvna
drastically, which could lead to inflation and another decline in
production.
</P>
<P>
The hryvna-U.S. dollar rate dropped from 1.8:1 to 2.05:1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
To stablize the economy, the government has no other way but
to borrow at home and abroad, the president said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Ukraine's total debt has surpassed 17 billion dollars
which includes domestic debts equivelent to 7 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Crippled by Energy Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Power shortages in Moldova have
crippled government institutions, hospitals, banks,
telecommunication services and public transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan Basa Press reported on Thursday that during the
most serious energy crisis in recent years, the capital city of
Chisinau has been hit by an ongoing series of power black-outs
with the presidential palace the only survivor of the energy
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The power predicament is the result of a June 8 decision by
Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom, Moldova's major source of energy,
to cut its gas supply in half in a bid to press for an immediate
payment of the 200-million-dollar gas dues.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom's move has affected the operation of the leading power
plant in Moldova, which provides eighty percent of the country's
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan government, which is unable to pay the debt, has
to make daily power cuts.

<HEADLINE> 52nd UMNO General Assembly Opens in Kuala Lumpur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The three-day 1998 United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) general assembly, the party's
52nd, began here Friday attended by more than 1,900 delegates.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony started with Prime Minister and UMNO
President Mahathir Mohamad inspecting a guard-of-honor mounted by
a brigade of the party's youth and women's wings followed by a
flag-raising ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir then delivered the presidential address formally
opening the general assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said that UMNO members and leaders at all levels must not
allow envy, hatred and vengeance to control them in facing the
economic crisis, and instead they must ensure that their thinking
should curtail their desires at the very least.
</P>
<P>
"Let others be dominated by the feeling of vengeance, hatred
and envy, etc. Whatever we do, it should be based on our thoughts
and judgments consistent with the needs of an advanced
civilization," he said in addressing the 1,907 delegates.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "The Challenges of Turmoil", Mahathir
spoke at length of factors that had caused the economic problems
which hit the country nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"We should understand all this. We should understand because
whether we are successful or not in our effort to overcome the
financial and economic crisis will depend on how much we all
understand the problems we are facing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not understanding what exactly attacked us is equivalent to
being blind and not knowing exactly the source of the attack.
People who do not know what exactly attacked them will create
enmities with the other people, the innocent. Thus the attackers
will have a big laugh," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the National Front component parties, local and
foreign observers were among the party's guests at the opening
along with 14 representatives of political parties from other
countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen representatives and six observers from UMNO clubs
overseas are also attending the assembly.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Issue Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government must speed up
the issuing of global bonds to address the liquidity crunch faced
by Thai businesses, leading businessmen told Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The parliament had passed four executive decrees earlier this
month, allowing the government to issue 5 billion U.S. dollar
global bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Nation reported Friday that the prime minister held a
working dinner with 15 top businessmen Thursday night to discuss
the economic problems and listen to their opinions on how to
tackle the current economic woes.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Finance
Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda also joined the dinner.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen, including Thai Bankers Association President
Banthoon Lamsam, Thai Chamber of Commerce President Vichien
Tejapaibul and Federation of Thai Industries President Thawee
Butrsunthorn, said liquidity and debt restructuring are essential
to revive the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted government spokesman Akrapol Sorasuchat as
saying the business leaders agreed that liquidity is a more
important issue than the efforts to control interest rates. They
said better liquidity will eventually cause rates to decline.
</P>
<P>
For debt restructuring, the business leaders proposed that the
government set up a neutral body to coordinate the work by holding
negotiations between creditors and debtors.
</P>
<P>
The government was also urged to help the export sector, which
is facing tight liquidity, and to promote tourism and related
businesses by strictly enforcing laws to punish those who cheat
foreign tourists.

<HEADLINE> ADB Helps Sri Lanka Improve Water Resources Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
is to help Sri Lanka improve its water resources management, the
ADB sources here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It will provide a technical assistance grant of 1.5 million
U.S. dollars to prepare a project aimed at improving water
resources management of five river basins surrounding Colombo, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Water quality has been deteriorating due to industrial and
urban pollution and increasing salinity. Several densely populated
wetland ecosystems are under severe pressure from pollution and
floods are problems in some of the basins.
</P>
<P>
The ADB project is expected to promote efficient investment in
priority sub-projects for water supply management, flood control
and watershed management. It will also restore economically
important wetland and lake ecosystems, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
With a large number of Sri Lanka's industries concentrated in
the project area, it accounts for a high and increasing share of
the country's gross domestic product, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Boost Farmers' Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has adopted a series of
measures to boost farmers' income by revitalizing the agricultural
sector, President Chandrika Kumaratunga said Thursday, according
to press reports.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a scheme for a development center at Sooriyawewa
in North Central province, the president said her government was
committed to boosting farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
The center will be built at a cost of 26.2 million U.S. dollars
to promote economic, social and cultural activities and a post
harvest technology training center will be set up.
</P>
<P>
She said a three year irrigation program envisages the
improvement of irrigation facilities initially for 2,900 hectares
now under cultivation and then the area under irrigation will
expand by another 1,100 hectares as well as allocation of
agricultural plots to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Another project encompasses the development of 5,340 hectares
which will provide settlement for 5,300 farming families at a cost
of 84.62 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the government is conscious of creating
an environment conducive to the country's farming community which
constitutes 52 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
At present yields in paddy and other crops are comparatively
low. Measures are being taken to improve this situation by
providing high yielding paddy seeds to farmers.
</P>
<P>
She stated the country is able to spend only 20 percent of its
earnings on development with 25 percent going to public servants,
another 25 percent for pensions and 30 percent on the war.
</P>
<P>
However, the president added that the government plans to set
up a large number of farms and vocation training centers in
different districts to uplift the lives of the farmers.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Thailand Up in 1st 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Thailand
during the first four months of this year increased by 3.2 percent
to about 1.9 million compared with the same period last year, but
lower than the 5.4 percent target set by the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT).
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Friday quoted TAT as saying that the
disappointing result should be mainly attributed to the big drop
in arrivals from some major Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The regional economic crisis pushed overall arrivals from east
Asia down by 7.08 percent to 973,829. The biggest drop came from
South Korea, down by 79.55 percent, followed by Indonesia, down by
67.39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Japan, the biggest single market for Thailand at
the moment, also fell by 9.81 percent to 291,615, and the weak yen
is expected to further discourage overseas travel, TAT said.
</P>
<P>
However, a positive trend has emerged among Asian countries
and regions less affected by the crisis. Arrivals from Hong Kong
rose by 40.14 percent, while the numbers of Singapore and Taiwan
tourists increased by 37.73 percent and 16.97 percent, TAT figures
showed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more tourists from European countries preferred to
spend their holidays in Thailand, with overall arrivals rising by
15.19 percent to 608,076. Russia and eastern Europe emerged as the
rapidly growing markets.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that the Amazing Thailand 1998-99 campaign has not
been achieving its goal, the TAT is scheduled to hold a meeting in
Bangkok early next month with directors of all its overseas
offices.
</P>
<P>
The Thailand Tourism Society, which groups several
private-sector organizations, is also preparing a marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
The society will also seek a meeting with Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai on ways to promote tourism and bring in more foreign
exchange.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Seek Political Solution for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO and Russia will continue
their efforts to seek diplomatic solutions to the Kosovo Crisis,
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Solana said it does not make
sense to impose a deadline on the resumption of negotiations
between the Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO will continue to support any effort to resume
dialogue between the conflicting sides in Kosovo, added Solana,
who arrived here on Thursday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO will help implement the agreement Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
reached on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Milosevic promised to resume dialogue with
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and end repressive action against
civilians there.
</P>
<P>
But Milosevic refused to withdraw Yugoslav troops immediately
from the troubled province -- the key demand of the six-nation
Contact Group, which includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is important to take a sensible attitude toward the Kosovo
crisis, Solana said. But if Milosevic cannot keep to his promise,
NATO would consider solving the crisis through military action.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have been killed since tensions escalated
in Kosovo in early March. About 65,000 of the 1.8 million
population have fled their homes in the province, where ethnic
Albanians account for 90 percent of the population. Ethnic
Albanian separatists have been seeking independence from
Yugoslavia since 1981.
</P>
<P>
In a sign to show Finland's support for international efforts
in the Balkans, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said at the
meeting with Solana that Helsinki will enhance its peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia.

MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has ratified
a program aimed at saving 42 billion rubles (about 6.9 billion

<P>
Under the program, the number of institutions receiving money

</P>
<P>
Zadornov said there will be a 20 percent cut in the workforce
of the state-owned enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Russian budget this year will have a deficit of tens of
billions of rubles thanks to economic recession, sagging exports
and tax revenues, as well as rising domestic and foreign debts.

<P>
Botanists have set up a four-hectare protection base for the
endangered plants in the mountainous areas with elevations ranging

<HEADLINE> Steel Production Strengthened to Promote China's Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- China will accelerate the
automotive steel manufacturing of its key steel producers, and
turn Baoshan Iron and Steel Group (Baogang) into a reliable supply
base for various types of auto steel by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the development plan for auto steel, Zhao Kun,
assistant general manager of Baogang, said the Chinese iron and
steel giant is now undergoing its third-phase construction which
involves 700 million U.S. dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
The two cold rolling mills in the third-phase project aim to
manufacture all types of steel for the modern auto industry,
according to Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry is one of the focuses of Baogang. Statistics
show Baogang holds 60.2 percent of the cold rolled sheet supply
and 46.2 percent of the hot rolled sheet supply for China's eight
major automobile producers.
</P>
<P>
By 2010 when the group completes its technology upgrading and
new projects, 2 million tons of auto sheet production capacity
will be added, said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
By then, 1 million tons of auto sheet steel should be added to
the existing production capacity of both Wuhan and Anshan iron and
steel groups.
</P>
<P>
A new capacity of 350,000 tons of cold rolled sheet will be
created in Panzhihua Iron and Steel Group, and that for Benxi
Group is designed to be 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Among steel sheets, automotive sheet steel is the most
technologically demanding, said Wang Xiaoqi, deputy director of
the Development Planning of China's State Administration of the
Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
The equipment and technology involved in the production of
automotive sheet steel is of great significance to the development
of the auto industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will produce 6 million automobiles in 2010. The auto
industry will consume 1.37 million tons of hot rolled sheets and
2.75 million tons of cold rolled sheets then.
</P>
<P>
Baogang merely produces one-fourth of the projected cold rolled
sheet consumption in 2010.
</P>
<P>
China's auto industry is crying for a larger supply of
domestically made sheets that "have stable quality and low price"
to substitute for imported ones, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that automakers in China, including joint
ventures, work on a closer relationship with steel suppliers in
such areas as joint development of new automobile models and
materials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Pledges Safety for Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Government has pledged
full security to foreign investors seeking to invest in the
country's trade and industry, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government's guarantee was made by Coordinating Minister
for Political and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung and Armed Forces
(ABRI) Commander General Wiranto after a meeting with President
B.J. Habibie at the Presidential office here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Tanjung said: "Foreign investors are asked
not to hesitate when they come to investing capital in the country
as there is a full security guarantee from the government."
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to meet all its commitments as
agreed upon with the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is now in the grip of a series of deep financial and
economic crisis in which inflation and prices have soared. Many
companies and factories have also been forced to close down,
resulting in a record unemployment high of 15 million.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the government had already set in motion various
measures to implement reforms in the political, economic and legal
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"But it must be understood that reforms essentially need time
and due process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said some people had misinterpreted the meaning of
reform, and had used reform as a tool to force their will upon
others, or even to flaunt the law and public interests.

<P>
In a press statement, Wiranto urged the nation to immediately
cease all "emotional expressions" which would only make it
difficult for the government and the nation to revive the
development drive.
</P>
<P>
He warned of attempts by certain forces to destroy people's
confidence in the government, including the military, which, if
not stopped, could lead to national disintegration.
</P>
<P>
Rumors circulating that former leaders of the previous
administration are to stage a comeback, or interrupt the flow of
reforms are misleading and unfounded, Wiranto said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Hails Milosevic-Yeltsin Statement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavian government said
Thursday the joint statement issued by Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Kosovo
is of great importance to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
An announcement made by Yugoslavia's Information Ministry said
the diplomatic and political means ascertained by Milosevic and
Yeltsin in their Tuesday talks in Moscow were the only way to the
final settlement of the Kosovo dispute.
</P>
<P>
Any threats of sanctions and use of force would only further
complicate the Kosovo problem, the announcement added.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, who is under threat of NATO military action to call
off the crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, agreed
in the joint statement to resume negotiations with the ethnic
Albanians but precluded a total withdrawal of Yugoslavia's
military units from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the Kremlin talks, both Milosevic and Yeltsin reaffirmed
the need to preserve Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and
opposed any sanctions and military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Thursday, the Yugoslavian government welcomed
Russia's policy of respecting the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed full support to the Serbian authorities in
their efforts to protect the people in Kosovo, curb terrorism, and
continue its dialogue with ethnic Albanians in the province in a
bid to end the crisis through political means.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have died since February in clashes
between the Serbian security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army
that seeks Kosovo's independence.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Develops Marine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province is
drafting an ambitious plan to expand its marine economy.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the marine industry to contribute 10 percent
to the province's gross domestic product by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's 1997 GDP hit 665 billion yuan, with the industrial
output for the marine industry reaching 35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shandong borders on both the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea and is
home to approximately a sixth of the nation's coastline. The
province's 50-plus bays and beaches covering some three million
hectares provide favorable conditions for developing sea
aquaculture and deepwater ports.
</P>
<P>
Shandong initiated extensive development of coastal areas in
early 1991 and has since led the nation in sea
aquaculture, chemical salt production and offshore petroleum
development.
</P>
<P>
Related industries have emerged as the backbone of the
provincial economy.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to develop its marine manufacturing sector
while significantly expanding the service industry.
</P>
<P>
The aquaculture and sea fishing industries contributes 59
percent of the province's total marine economy, with an additional
20 percent coming from aquatic product processing.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Receives 1b Dollars Trade Loan From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
signed an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of Japan that will
provide a loan of one billion U.S. dollars aimed at helping
Indonesian exporters, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The yen-denominated loan will be used for guaranteeing letters
of credits issued by banks in Indonesia, which have thus far been
rejected by most banks overseas, Finance Minister Bambang Subianto
told reporters after the signing ceremony here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five-year loan has a three-year grace period and is
separate from Japan's commitment to the International Monetary
Fund's 43 billion U.S. dollars bailout package.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the loan will help the economy by helping
exporters buy imported raw materials and parts to manufacture
exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) announced Thursday it would give an additional
50 million U.S. dollars in aid in the form of food and loan
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
USAID administrator Brian Atwood told a public forum here
Thursday the agency would spend 25 million dollars, in addition to
25 million dollars pledged earlier, to provide Indonesia with
50,000 tons of American rice.
</P>
<P>
The agency will also provide an additional 25 million dollars
in loan guarantees to support the construction of urban
environmental infrastructure, such as drinking water services and
drainage canals.
</P>
<P>
So far, USAID has allocated over 100 million dollars in
humanitarian assistance to Indonesia. It has also provided 25
million dollars in concessional loans to buy rice and other food,
and 26 million dollars in technical expertise for the Indonesian
government.

<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Bicycles, once a major means of
transportation for Chinese, are rapidly disappearing in Guangzhou,
capital of Guangdong Province and one of the most prosperous
citiesin China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three million of the city's total population of 3.9
million people are using modern modes of transportation such as
buses, cars and motorcycles thanks to the past 20-odd
years of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Individuals own some 90 percent of the city's over 600,000
motor vehicles. About two households own one car or motor bike,
according to a recent issue of China Economic Herald.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the city leads the nations with 13
public buses per 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The city's transportation department plans to further improve
public transportation to ensure all residents have access to a
public bus stop within a five minutes walk.
</P>
<P>
The city's sustained economic development has supported the
strong growth of public transportation and private vehicles,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's per capita GDP has soared to 3,000 US dollars, one
of the highest levels for a Chinese province.

<HEADLINE> Dominica Hopes to Import Oil from Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Dominica is expected to request
30,000 barrels of oil supply a day from Venezuela as Prime
Minister Edison James pays a two-day official visit to this South
American nation that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This will be James' first trip to Venezuela since he came into
office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dominica, one of the east Caribbean islands that won
independence from Britain in 1978, has to import oil worth 6
million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Having only a population of 70,000, Dominica is not an
attractive market for Venezuelan oil, but Caracas believes it is
important to maintain the Venezuelan energy presence in the
east Caribbean islands for diplomatic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela and Dominica started diplomatic relations in 1979, by
the end of which the two nations signed an agreement of friendship
and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Says House to Unveil Slimmed-Down Tobacco Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- One day after tobacco
legislation perished in the U.S. Senate, Speaker Newt Gingrich
said Thursday Republicans in the House of Representatives will
soon unveil a separate, slimmed-down bill to curtail teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich predicted that President Bill Clinton "is going to
sign."
</P>
<P>
But the White House and its allies in Congress dismissed the
effort in advance.
</P>
<P>
In the House, officials said Republicans were discussing an
approach that would fund an ad campaign discouraging teen smoking
and grant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority over
the manufacture of cigarettes, but not necessarily over nicotine.
They are also seeking to impose constitutionally permissible
restrictions on industry advertising clearly directed at minors.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted unidentified officials as saying
Republicans were discussing imposing limits on the placement of
vending machines to make it harder for teen-agers to buy
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Also under review is a plan for financial incentives to states
that take steps on their own to crack down on youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
The emerging House bill is not expected to seek higher
cigarette prices -- a centerpiece of the Senate bill killed
Wednesday and a key demand of public health groups supporting its
passage.
</P>
<P>
The house bill is not expected to touch directly on numerous
state lawsuits and the settlement the industry reached with
attorneys-general a year ago, an event that gave impetus to
attempts to enact legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters reportedly have told Republicans they are viewed by
the public as too closely allied with the tobacco industry but
don't need to pass a broad bill like the Senate measure to remedy
the damage. They fare just as well, in this view, by passing a
smaller bill.
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no reason we should be a party to
protecting an industry that is so despicable and so dishonest,"
added Representative Deborah Pryce, a Republican and head of a
task force to produce legislation.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said they had come to no decision yet on how to
finance the proposed ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
The measure that died in the Senate would have raised the price
of cigarettes by 1.10 dollar a pack, and raised an estimated 561
billion dollar or more over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Republicans attacked it as a "tax and spend" measure that was
far bigger than anything needed to deal with teen smoking, and
Gingrich said House Republicans don't "want to go into the same
kind of swamp."
</P>
<P>
As for Clinton, Gingrich said, "I don't think he's going to
veto an anti-smoking bill. I think he's going to sign it.
Particularly if it's part of an anti-drug bill."
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters there is
"no such thing as a slimmed-down bill that protects kids from
tobacco smoking....
</P>
<P>
"In short, you need to have that per pack price increase of at
least 1.10 dollar," he said.

LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- There are no blimps hovering
overhead, no inflated mascots tethered to Center Court, and
billboards are banned in the forthcoming Wimbledon Open tennis
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon is one of sport's last advertising-free zones.
</P>
<P>
According to reports form Wimbledon, Profits have grown by 10
percent the last five years, with a record 51 million U.S. dollars
generated in 1997 from the two-week tournament.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon Marketing Director Robert McCowen said: "We could
make more money in the next two or three years by selling
billboards and advertising out there. But we think in the
long-term we'd make less because television would turn around and
say we're now like any other sports event in the world."
</P>
<P>
Hefty television contracts - as in most sports - pay most of
the bills with merchandising, ticket sales and hospitality making
up the rest. Profits go to the Lawn Tennis Association, the
governing body of tennis in England.
</P>
<P>
"We could get more income if we marketed trash," McCowen said.
"There's a lot of money at the bottom of the marketplace. But we'd
kill the goose that laid the golden egg."

<P>
BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Great Wall Lubricating Oil Group

<HEADLINE> Marcos' Burial Opposed by Groups in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The incoming administration's
decision to bury former president Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes'
cemetery in Manila has aroused opposition in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Main Manila newspapers Friday reported that former president
Corazon Aquino Thursday led a street protest against the plan,
saying the heroes' cemetery was no place for a "dictator".
</P>
<P>
"Is it right to honor a dictator who ordered the killing of
thousands of Filipinos, who allowed the torture of those who
opposed him?" Aquino said at a mass rally near the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
She said if the new government continues insisting on its plan,
she would lead another "People's Power", in which Marcos was
ousted in a popular revolt in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled to Hawaii, the United States, in February 1986 and
died there three years later. His remains returned to his hometown
for a private funeral in 1993, but his family has been asking for
a state honor burial in the heroes' cemetery, citing Marcos' role
in the second World War and as the president of the country.
</P>
<P>
The question of where Marcos should be buried is emerging as
the first test for Joseph Estrada, who is to assume presidency on
June 30. Pressure and protest against the interment of Marcos are
mounting in the country.
</P>
<P>
Former senator Rene Saguisag, a human rights lawyer, warned
that impeachment may be initiated against Estrada if he pushes
through with his decision to bury Marcos.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada was unfazed by the threat, saying no law prohibited
ex-presidents from being buried at the heroes' cemetery which is
normally for war heroes and former presidents.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight human rights groups and some 10,000 Marcos regime
victims are also launching a signature drive to convince Estrada
to change his mind.

<HEADLINE> Bringing Spring Water Back To Eastern Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Jinan, the capital of east China's
Shandong Province, will soon get its spring water back again,
according to Mayor Xie Yutang.
</P>
<P>
This "spring city" was once famous for its 162 springs in the
urban area, according to the garden department, but most of them
stopped flowing in the 1970s, and water only comes out of some of
them between August and the following February.
</P>
<P>
The loss is largely attributed to growth in the city and the
excessive use of underground water, so Jinan is building a
reservoir in the western part of the city to bring water from the
Yellow River and plans to reduce consumption of underground
water.
</P>
<P>
Another reservoir is being built to supplement the city's
water supplies, the mayor says, and it won't be long before the
city gets its springs flowing again, if the two projects can go
into operation within five years and the city can cut underground
water use by 80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Annan, Bellamy Praise Landmine Treaty's Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Kofi Annan,
secretary-general of the United Nations, and Carol Bellamy,
executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund, Thursday
congratulated the 19 countries that have now ratified the treaty
to ban anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
They said the actions of these countries would lend momentum to
the urgent push to put the accord into effect this year.
</P>
<P>
Peru's ratification, the 19th so far, was made official
Thursday morning. Approval by 40 countries will make the treaty
binding international law.
</P>
<P>
"Ratification will be a giant step towards the demining of the
world," Annan said. "Delay will only add to lives lost and to the
growing expense of removing these silent killers from the earth."
</P>
<P>
He urged all countries that have signed the treaty to move
swiftly to ratify it and expressed the hope that governments that
have not signed the treaty will now do so.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement to abolish these horrific weapons is being
achieved with remarkable swiftness and resolve," Bellamy said.
"Now that we have 50 percent of the requisite ratifications, we
have every hope that governments will complete the achievement
with the greatest possible haste."
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed last December in Ottawa, prohibits the use,
production, development, acquisition, sale, stockpiling and
transfer of anti-personnel landmines, which kill and maim 26,000
civilians a year.

<HEADLINE> It's Essential for U.S. to Pay U.N. Dues: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Thursday that it is essential for the United
States to pay its 1.6 billion U.S. dollar debt owed to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the nomination of Richard Holbrooke as U.S.
ambassador to the U.N. to replace Bill Richardson who will be U.S.
secretary of energy, Annan said it is the U.S. Congress that has
made Richardson's U.N. task "much more difficult" despite his
success during his tenure of one and half years.
</P>
<P>
"If they (Congress) would have honored their commitments, I
think he (Richardson) would have even been more successful.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Richard Holbrooke will be a bit more successful and
will be luckier with Congress," the U.N. chief told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who stays in the U.N. through the end of summer
waiting for Congress confirmation, said, "It is shameful that we
have not paid our U.N. dues. The time has come for the U.S.
Congress to separate issues of abortion and U.N. dues."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government wants to pay the U.N. membership dues,
but the Congress has set preconditions for paying them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Jospin Over Asian Crisis, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton met
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday over subjects ranging
from Asia's financial crisis to the Kosovo conflict to strengthen
the often turbulent U.S.-French relationship.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Jospin had a working lunch at the White House.
Jospin stressed his desire for cordial dealings with Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We had a good visit. We had a lot of areas of agreement,"
Clinton told reporters after the lunch.
</P>
<P>
Jospin told reporters that he and Clinton "share the same
analysis" on Kosovo and that the two countries would continue to
cooperate through the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed Asian's financial crisis and the joint
foreign exchange intervention by the United States and Japan to
prop up the yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the United States decided to waive U.S. sanctions
that would have prevented French, Russian and Malaysian firms from
carrying out a 2 billion U.S. dollar gas deal in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said they did not directly discuss U.S. sanctions
policy, but added that Washington and Paris continued to disagree
on the issue. "The positions remain a little different," he said.
</P>
<P>
France has long deplored U.S. sanctions, arguing Washington had
no business imposing its will on commercial transactions between
foreign companies. The overall U.S. sanctions policy is now under
review in Washington.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the U.S, Jospin is expected to sign a civil
aviation agreement that will free up passenger and cargo traffic
between the two countries after a five-year period of controlled
growth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Turkish, Greek moves on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that the deployments of F-16 jet fighters by Greece and Turkey on
the divided island of Cyprus would destabilize the area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Turkey sent six F-16 war planes to the
northern sector of Cyprus in response to an unprecedented visit by
four Greek F-16s and two C-130 transport planes to the southern
Cypriot air base this week.
</P>
<P>
"It's destabilizing to the area," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon told a briefing. "This is a matter of concern to us
obviously."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not anticipate a U.S. military response to
mounting tension on Cyprus, calling diplomacy the "appropriate
response." But Bacon said the aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its
battle group would arrive in the Mediterranean on or about
Saturday after its June 8 departure from its home port in Norfolk,
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The Eisenhower, once it reached the region, "will be available
for any needs she has to meet there," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's special envoy to resolve the Cyprus
deadlock, Richard Holbrooke, said Thursday that the situation
there was grave and it was "not progressing positively right now."

WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that it has agreed to allow Cuba's national airline to fly over
U.S. territory on its flights to Canada.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that the authorization was negotiated
through the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal,
where Cuba had lodged a complaint that the U.S. ban violated
international overflight rules.
</P>
<P>
The United States has agreed to authorize Cubana airlines to
use two specified Cuba-Canada overland routes and to provide
normal air navigation services, said the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban air authorities have complained that Cuba's airplane
has had to make costly detours over the Atlantic on daily flights
to Montreal and Toronto While U.S. carriers flying to South
America from Miami fly over Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Some Priority Issues: Chief U.N. Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq refused to include
some of the priority issues identified by the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq's disarmament, the commision's Executive
Chairman Richard Butler said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who discussed the remaining disarmament issues with
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz during his trip to Baghdad
on June 11-15, made the comment in his latest report to the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The issues rejected by Iraq include the extent of the
production of warfare agent VX, the accounting for proscribed
missile propellants and the clarification of the concealment
actions and policies by Iraq, the 14-page report said.
</P>
<P>
Butler went to Baghdad with a so-called "road map" for Iraq to
follow in the disarmament process. Iraq was required to provide
materials, documents and information on its chemical and
biological weapons and ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The report said Iraq did not accept the commission's
requirements as a "road map," disagreeing that all of the issues
identified were issues of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused the commission of pursuing "many trivial matters
not related to disarmament that only delayed lifting the embargo"
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has destroyed its proscribed weapons and the details were
unimportant in view of the level of suffering in Iraq as a
consequence of sanctions," the report quoted Aziz as telling
Butler.
</P>
<P>
Butler insisted that the commission's work had been prolonged
"because of Iraq's incorrect declarations, unilateral
destructions, and policies and actions of concealment."
</P>
<P>
"In virtually all instances, Iraq remained firm in its
position that no relevant documents were available. However, in
limited cases Iraq would look again for documents," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
It said Aziz expressed the Iraqi government's willingness to
cooperate with the commission in the next two months as agreed
by both sides.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Wants Reconciliation With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Thursday that the United States wanted reconciliation with Iran as
the Gulf country was changing in what he called "a positive way."
</P>
<P>
"We believe Iran is changing in a positive way, and we want to
support that," Clinton said at a ceremony in the White House Rose
Garden. "What we want is a genuine reconciliation with Iran."
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciated the comments made by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami several months ago. "We are exploring what the
future might hold," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's comments reinforced an overture to Iran Wednesday by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who urged Iran to join the
United States in drawing a "road map leading to normal relations."
But Albright offered no promises of specific American actions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Asia Society, Albright noted that since Khatami
put out feelers, Washington had taken cautious steps, including
easing up on visas for Iranians, revising a travel warning and
promoting cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstandings. The Islamic Republic
should consider paralleled steps," she said.
</P>
<P>
"If such a process can be initiated and sustained in a way that
addresses the concerns of both sides, then we in the United States
can see the prospect of a very different relationship," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks on relations with Iran weres made after she
discussed with the president, Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Albright also offered a proposal that Iran could be included in
"multilateral efforts to protect international security."
</P>
<P>
"This global network has grown largely without Iranian
participation," Albright said. "But Iran would be welcome if it is
willing to make a constructive contribution."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Iran have ceded their diplomatic
relations since Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official called Albright's speech at the Asia
Society "the first comprehensive, substantive policy statement on
Iran" since Khatami's interview with CNN on relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
It follows the important U.S. decision to waive sanctions
against three foreign companies of France, Russia and Malaysia,
which have a 2 billion dollar gas deal with Iran.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Backs China's Agriculture, Power Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday
approved two loans totaling 600 million U.S. dollars for two
projects in China.
</P>
<P>
The first loan of 300 million dollars will be used to help the
Hunan power development project. This project will alleviate power
shortages in Hunan province by providing efficient, reliable and
environmentally sound power supply.
</P>
<P>
The project will develop two modern thermal units, reinforcing
the critical transmission infrastructure to improve overall system
reliability, retiring a number of small, inefficient, aging and
pollution-generating units and avoiding further proliferation of
inefficient and more polluting small plants.
</P>
<P>
The other loan of also 300 million dollars is earmarked for the
irrigated agriculture intensification II project in the country.
The main activities of this project are to construct and improve
irrigation and farmland in the five provinces of Hebei, Henan,
Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China.
</P>
<P>
The project will also promote food security, irrigation reform,
and environmental protection for the major lakes and groundwater
in the project area.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Colombian Striker Apologizes Publicly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla has
apologized publicly on Thursday for his criticism on the team's
tactics, hoping the head coach Hernan Dario Gomez would recall him.
</P>
<P>
The Parma striker, who has been kicked out the national squad
following his remarks to a radio reporter, said he wanted the coach to
take him back to the ongoing World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologize to the (soccer association) president,
to his executive, to the coach, to my colleagues and above all to the
Colombian people," said a contrite Asprilla in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"If the team coach considers my participation to be important, I am
ready to submit willingly and in a disciplined way to the rules
demanded in a World Cup," said Asprilla.
</P>
<P>
"The coach decided to kick me out of the squad because of what I
said," Asprilla said. "Nobody wants to continue being a part of this

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- France beat Saudi Arabia 4-0 to
qualify for the top 16 but playmaker Zinedine Zidane got a red card
and will miss the next match.
</P>
<P>
The host team dominated the match, especially after the 18th
minute when Mohammed Al Khilaiwi of Saudi Arabia was sent off for a
dangerous tackle.
</P>
<P>
But the host team failed to score until the 36th minute when
Thierry Henry tab in a cross from Laurent Blanc.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian team played hard in the second half though
they had one man less. That gave the French team more rooms for
attack and French substitute David Trezeguet slamed home a loose
ball to put the hosts 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
At the 25th minute, French midfielder and playmaker Zidane was
also sent off for rough play. The Saudi Arabians went all out,
trying to get a goal back.
</P>
<P>
But they suffered another blow at the 77th minute when French
goalie Fabien Barthez launched a fast counter-attack and Henry beat
the Saudi Arabian defenders with an easy shot.
</P>
<P>
Blanc hommered home another goal at the 85th minute to seal the
victory for the French team.
</P>
<P>
The win ensured the host team a berth in the top 16 no matter
what the result is in their final group match against Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Denmark were forced to a 1-1 draw by South
Africa. They need at least a draw against France to salvage the
other qualifying slot from the group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gives Some Details of Sanctions on India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sanctions against India
and Pakistan for their nuclear tests will apply to American bank
lending to the two governments, some credits and guarantees, and
military sales, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told a news conference
more details of exactly what the sanctions meant would be provided
soon.
</P>
<P>
The United States has already terminated certain military sales
and provoked licenses on some commercial sales of munitions to
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration would support efforts in
Congress to exempt agricultural credits from the sanctions. And
U.S. bank lending to the private sector in the two countries would
not be affected by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said, "The path down which India and Pakistan have
started to move with these tests is a dead end and no one else
should follow down that path."
</P>
<P>
India conducted five nuclear tests last month, sparking global
condemnations and raising tension with Pakistan, which retaliated
by carrying out its own tests.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton immediately announced sanctions against
both countries.

WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank okayed two loans
totaling 76.9 million U.S. dollars equivalent to finance
reconstruction and infrastructure projects in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The first loan of some 40.6 million dollars will be provided
for the country's reconstruction project for Eastern Slavonia,
Baranja and Western Srijem. This project will repair and rebuild
war-damaged water sector infrastructure, critically needed to
restart the local economy of these regions, while mitigating the
negative environmental impact to be caused to the adjacent nature
park by the restart of local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The second loan of 36.3 million dollars equivalent will be
utilized for the Croatia municipal environmental infrastructure
project. This project will reduce municipal wastewater pollutant
discharges into the environmentally sensitive Kastela and Trogir
Bays consistent with Croatian and European Union stands, and
improve the safety, reliability and delivery of drinking water in
the project area.

<P>
ABU-DHABI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Taliban Interim
Council Sheikh Mullah Mohammad Rabbani said Thursday that the
United Arab Emirates had promised him to help the reconstruction
of the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani made the remarks at the end of his four-day visit to
the UAE, the UAE News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to get a specific assistance during the visit,
informed sources here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said he had held talks with Vice Commander-in-Chief of
the Armed Forces Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan,
discussing ways of enhancing bilateral cooperation, probing the
possibility of the UAE's participation in the rehabilitation of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan militia group Taliban, which pursues strict islamic
rules and traditions, drove out the government troops led by
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and came to power in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, a new civil war has been continuing between the
Taliban forces, which control 80 percent of the country, and the
northern guerrilla alliance.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Have Only Short-Term Effects on Jet Makers: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Boeing said that Asia's
economic crisis will have only marginal long-term effects on the
company and the rest of the industry, although it is likely to
result in about 150 fewer commercial airplanes than anticipated
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 "Current Market Outlook" report released Thursday,
the Seattle-based airplane manufacturer also said that
single-aisle jets such as the Boeing 737 will continue to dominate
the new aircraft market over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two decades, airlines will add 17,750 airplanes
of all models worth 1.25 trillion U.S. dollars, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economic crisis, which has brought delivery
deferrals, fleet-reduction sales and a few order cancellations,
still is expected to have only short-term effects on aircraft
purchases, although it has forced Boeing to plan to slow
production of its 747 jumbo jets next year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's latest estimate said that the world's aircraft fleet
will grow 44 percent in 10 years, to 17,700 airplanes from 12,280
at the end of last year, but will double between now and 2017 to
26,200 planes.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,200 aging planes will be replaced, but about 60
percent of those already have been ordered, accounting for the
current surge of smaller jets.
</P>
<P>
Narrow-bodied aircraft, which include Boeing's 717, 737 and
757, as well as competing Airbus models, also will account for 43
percent of the dollars invested in new airplanes during the next
two decades, said the report, predicting 12,260 airplanes of this
size will be delivered in the period.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants to End Oil-For-Food Program in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The latest six-month phase
of the oil-for-food program should be the last one, Iraqi
Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon stressed here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The latest oil-for-food program should be the final one, to be
followed by the lifting of sanctions on the normal export of oil,"
Hamdoon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I have just delivered a couple of letters to the U.N.
secretary-general and to the president of the Security Council of
the United Nations, calling for a consideration by the council
that this is the last phase that Iraq will have to undertake," the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate alternative should be a total lifting of the
embargo on Iraq, which means that there will be no need to
continue any of those phases of the oil-for-food plan," Hamdoon
noted.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program which went into effect in 1996 aims to
ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq caused by
U.N. sanctions since 1990. Under the program, Iraq is allowed to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to
import food, medicine and other necessities for its people. In
February 1998, the Security Council adopted a resolution to
upgrade the oil amount that Iraq could sell every six months to
5.2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Supports Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- As African leaders set themselves to
restore peace in the Horn of Africa, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Thursday affirmed Egypt's support to all efforts towards a
peaceful solution of the Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The support was conveyed in a message Mubarak sent Thursday to
President of Burkina Faso Blaise Compaore who is the current
chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the head
of a mediation team entrusted by the OAU to Eritrea and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt fully believes that border problems will never be solved
by force, but rather through negotiations and respect of the OAU
Charter," Mubarak was quoted by the Middle East News Agency as
saying in his message.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the African mediation efforts will
succeed. African leaders met with Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The OAU mission is made up of Presidents of Burkina Faso,
Djibouti and Zimbabwe, and OAU Secretary General Salem Ahmed
Salem, Deputy Assistant to the Egyptian Foreign Minister for
African Affairs Fayza Abu el Naga said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, she said, follows up ongoing diplomatic efforts to
contain the armed conflict between the two countries and hopes
efforts led by Compaore reach a comprehensive and peaceful
settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, at last week's meeting in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,
issued a resolution that affirmed the necessity to halt aggression
and implement the proposals of the mediators.
</P>
<P>
The conflict broke out in early May. Ground fighting has
subsided since June 11. The U.S. and Rwanda, mediating in the
conflict, have presented a four-point peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Last week Ethiopian and Eritrean foreign ministers paid
separate visits to Cairo to make their sides of story to
Egypt. Ethiopia and Eritrea accused each other of incursions.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader had sent two messages to leaders of both
countries, calling for an immediate end to fighting and
negotiations to resolve the border row that centers on a 400
square kilometers rocky triangle of land along their western
border.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest, are at odds
over at least six areas along their common border. Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

services in jurisdiction and to improve popular control over
local government agendas.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing local council leaders,
parliamentarians, permanent secretaries, resident district
commissioners and chief administrative officers, Radio Uganda

<HEADLINE> Turkish Prime Minister Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Political ties between Romania
and Turkey are "excellent," said the prime ministers of the two
countries, Radu Vasile and Mesut Yilmaz, Thursday after their
first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile said that biennial mutual
visits would take place, to which short visits would be added
whenever needed. He said that bilateral economic ties were
potential between the two countries and necessary means had been
established in order to overstep the ceiling of 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile said the two sides were ready to support investment
projects in the energy, transports, oil and machine-building
fields.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, Mesut Yilmaz said the visit to Bucharest was an
opportunity to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.
He added that a free trade agreement between Romania and Turkey
that came into force in February 1998 made a contribution to the
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mesut Yilmaz arrived in Bucharest Thursday morning on a two-day
official visit. He is the first prime minister of Turkey who
visits Romania after a 12-year break-off. Mesut Yilmaz is
accompanied by many businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a very important partner of Romania not only in the
political aspect, but also in the economic domain. The volume of
bilateral trade was 567 million U.S. dollars in 1997, and is
expected to reach 1 billion this year. Turkey is at the same time
among the most important investors in Romania.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation of Illegal Aliens Costs S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Repatriating thousands of
illegal aliens costs South Africa about 200 million Rand (37.7
million U.S. dollars) a year, South African Press Association
(SAPA) quoted a home affairs official as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to have discussions with the countries these
people originate from toward possible sharing of costs," home
affairs Director-General Albert Mokoena said.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal aliens repatriated by South Africa had
risen from 6,300 in 1991 to more than 173,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"If any of the current estimates of the number of illegals in
South Africa is correct, it is clear that it is time for a
rethink on existing methods and procedures," Mokoena said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 census listed about 500,000 illegal aliens, while a
Human Sciences Research Council study indicated there were
between 2.5 and 4.1 million in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most illegal aliens were single males between the age of 18
and 30 from Mozambique and other neighboring countries. They were
largely unskilled, competing for jobs in a category where the
country had the most unemployed people, according to the SAPA
report.
</P>
<P>
A spiraling, undocumented and uncontrolled influx of aliens
posed serious problems for South Africa, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Police figures indicated that about 14 percent of crimes were
being committed by foreigners. Their offenses included money
laundering, car theft and arms smuggling.

TOULOUSE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Denmark coach Bo Johansson pondered
the unpredicability of the sport of soccer after Thursday's 1-1 draw
with South Africa here.
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is like this. You play well for some periods of the match
and then incredibly bad periods," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is both joy and tears," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Johansson declined to comment the refereeing of the game, which
saw two Danes and one South African sent off.
</P>

Danish substitutes Mikos Molnar and Morten Wieghorst was given the
marching order in the second half, the first time that Denmark had two

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Mulls Revision of Asylum System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is considering
measures to end the abuse of its asylum system by foreigners
posing as refugees, according to a draft refugee white paper
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the document in Pretoria, Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the new refugee policy will exclude
victims of poverty or environmental disasters.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept that economic migrants should be able to use
the refugee determination process to obtain residence,
employment... or to avoid the consequences of the law concerning
illegal migration."
</P>
<P>
He said refugees should not be confused with illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the proposed new legislation, the process and time
for application for refugee status will be shortened
considerably.
</P>
<P>
The current system entitled migrants to live and work in the
country for a period pending their applications for refugee
status.
</P>
<P>
"A great number of people have found this a very useful avenue
for entering South Africa," said Deputy Home Affairs Minister
Lindiwe Sisulu.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the entire application process should not
be longer than six months and applications should include
interviews conducted by trained officials.
</P>
<P>
Sisulu said 7,676 people have been granted asylum since 1994,
and 13,934 applications are under consideration.

<HEADLINE> France Qualify with 4-0 Win over Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- France beat Saudi Arabia 4-0 to
qualify for the top 16 but playmaker Zinedine Zidane got a red card
and will miss the next match.
</P>
<P>
The host team dominated the match, especially after the 18th
minute when Mohammed Al Khilaiwi of Saudi Arabia was sent off for a
dangerous tackle.
</P>
<P>
But the host team failed to score until the 36th minute when
Thierry Henry tab in a cross from Laurent Blanc.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian team played hard in the second half though
they had one man less. That gave the French team more rooms for
attack and French substitute David Trezeguet slamed home a loose
ball to put the hosts 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
At the 25th minute, French midfielder and playmaker Zidane was
also sent off for rough play. The Saudi Arabians went all out,
trying to get a goal back.
</P>
<P>
But they suffered another blow at the 77th minute when French
goalie Fabien Barthez launched a fast counter-attack and Henry beat
the Saudi Arabian defenders with an easy shot.
</P>
<P>
Blanc hommered home another goal at the 85th minute to seal the
victory for the French team.
</P>
<P>
The win ensured the host team a berth in the top 16 no matter
what the result is in their final group match against Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Denmark were forced to a 1-1 draw by South
Africa. They need at least a draw against France to salvage the
other qualifying slot from the group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Surges to Record High in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit shot up
to a record high of 14.5 billion U.S. dollars in April, the
Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the April deficit was 9.5 percent
higher than the March imbalance of 13.2 billion dollars, the
previous record. The growth is largely blamed to the Asian
currency devaluation which facilitates their exports, pushing down
the U.S. sales abroad,
</P>
<P>
While imports declined a slight 0.9 percent in April after
hitting an all-time high the month before, U.S. exports fell even
more sharply, dropping 2.6 percent as the deepening recessions in
many Asian markets cut into U.S. sales.
</P>
<P>
For the first four months of this year, the U.S. deficit in
goods and services was running at an annual rate of 149 billion
dollars, on track to set a record this year, far surpassing last
year's imbalance of 110.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan edged down 6 percent in April to 5.4
billion dollars but was still running 13.3 percent ahead of the
same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the entire Pacific Rim region, which includes South Korea
and other countries and regions hard hit by the currency crisis,
the U.S. trade deficit in the first four months of this year
totaled 48.7 billion dollars, 38 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In April, the 2.6 percent drop in exports of goods and services
pushed them down to 77.1 billion dollars. Exports of goods fell to
55.3 billion dollars, the lowest level since February 1997.
Exports of the U.S. farm products dropped to 3.8 billion dollars,
the lowest level since September 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among the export categories declining were sales of commercial
aircraft which fell 926 million dollars to 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods and services, which hit a record high of 92.4
billion dollars in March, slipped 0.9 percent in April to 91.6
billion dollars, but still the second-highest level in history.
</P>
<P>
The 14.5 billion dollar deficit was the highest since the
government began tracking goods and services on a monthly basis in
1992. For goods alone, the deficit of 21.5 billion dollars was
also the highest in the U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the U.S. deteriorating trade performance,
the Commerce Department also reported Thursday that the deficit
in the widest measure of trade, the current account, widened in
the first quarter of this year to al all-time high of 47.2
billion dollars. This was up 4.8 percent from the previous
record, 45 billion dollar gap in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that new applications
for unemployment benefits surged 13,000 to a total of 327,000
last week.

<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Super Eagles Nigeria and last World
Cup semi-finalists Bulgaria will play a crucial group match at Parc
des Princes Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
To the Nigerians, they will be fresh in their minds with the
memorable 3-2 victory over Spain as they prepare for the clash with
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
As to the Bulgarians, the Paris stadium holds great memories for
striker Emil Kostadinov who scored a last-gasp winner to shatter
France's qualifying hopes for the World Cup finals in the United
States four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"That memory will be with me all my life," said Kostadinov, "I
hope that Friday brings me and Bulgaria even more happiness."
</P>
<P>
The two teams are familiar with each other as four years ago at
Dallas, Nigeria trounced Bulgaria 3-0 in the group stage with Daniel
Amokachi netting twice.
</P>
<P>
Amokachi is expected to get a berth in the starting line-up as
he has recovered from an injured knee which ruled him out of the
Nigeria-Spain match.
</P>
<P>
Another Nigerian star Nwanko Kanu, who plays for Italian club
Inter Milan, is also available following a stomach complaint.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will be without midfielder Anatoli Nankov who got the
first red card of this World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian coach Hristo Bonev warned his team:"To beat the
Nigerians, we have to be very disciplined, very concentrated and
every player has to be at their best."

<P>
SAINT-ETIENNE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Spain can afford no more defeat
when they meet Paraguay in their second group match here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 loss at the hands of Super Eagles Nigeria has been a major
blow to the Spaniards, who are second in the FIFA rankings behind
Brazil and have been regarded by many as one of the favorites of the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Spanish media has piled blames on coach Javier Clemente and
goal-keeper Andoni Zubizarreta after the shock defeat.
</P>
<P>
Clemente was slammed for fielding a team without a real striker
while Zubizarreta was blamed for letting in three goals in just one
match.
</P>
<P>
Clemente will have to make changes to his starting line-up but
he insisted that Zubzarreta would contiune in goal.
</P>
<P>
"We were jolted by the defeat but we've had a few days to
collect ourselves," said Clemente, "We didn't play so badly really
and if we win our two remaining matches we are through."
</P>
<P>
Paraguay, who forced Bulgaria to a 0-0 draw, will be in full
strength as tough defender Francisco Arce and striker Miguel Angel
Benitez have recovered from injuries they sustained in the first
match.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's Brazilian coach Paulo Cesar Carpegiani pinpointed
Arce as their key man in the match against the Spaniards,"Arce is
fundamental to our plan as he breaks things up and holds the line
superbly." said Carpegiani.
</P>
<P>
But the Paraguay goal-keeper Jose Luis Chilavert, a penalty and
free-kick expert, would as usual took the limelight of the match.

<HEADLINE> Batistuta Says Argentines to "Get Serious" against Jamaica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Striker Gabriel Batistuta said his squad
would "get serious" when they meet minnows Jamaica at the Parc des
Princes here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I think tings are going to get serious at the next match against
Jamaica," said the Fiorentina forward in l'Etrat near Saint Etienne.
</P>
<P>
"We need to remember the goal we scored against Japan. It was our
first in this World Cup and it's always good for team morale to star
off such a competition with a victory," said Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
He said he would expect better performance from the former World
Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
"We need to follow things up much better because we are still
aiming to be first. We need to convince ourselves that we're going to
be the champions and live up to the reputation of favorites," added
Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
As for himself, he hoped to score at least one goal at each game.
</P>
<P>
"I am the goal scorer (in the game against Japan) and I intend to
be exactly that for every match. The injury is not bothering me any
more."
</P>
<P>
Teammate Roberto Sensini called for the Argentine squad to look out
for Croatia, which they will face in their last group match on June
26.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of pressure on me as I've been made to feel that
I'm vital in the line-up. Without Maradona, I've got even more
responsibilities," said the Parma defender who is playing his third
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia seems very dangerous. They are very strong both
technically and physically. It won't be easy to beat this team," he
warned.

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- France beat Saudi Arabia 4-0 to
qualify for the top 16 but playmaker Zinedine Zidane got a red card
and will miss the next match.
</P>
<P>
The host team dominated the match, especially after the 18th
minute when Mohammed Al Khilaiwi of Saudi Arabia was sent off for a
dangerous tackle.
</P>
<P>
But the host team failed to score until the 36th minute when
Thierry Henry tab in a cross from Laurent Blanc.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian team played hard in the second half though
they had one man less. That gave the French team more rooms for
attack and French substitute David Trezeguet slamed home a loose
ball to put the hosts 2-0 ahead.
</P>
<P>
At the 25th minute, French midfielder and playmaker Zidane was
also sent off for rough play. The Saudi Arabians went all out,
trying to get a goal back.
</P>
<P>
But they suffered another blow at the 77th minute when French
goalie Fabien Barthez launched a fast counter-attack and Henry beat
the Saudi Arabian defenders with an easy shot.
</P>
<P>
Blanc hommered home another goal at the 85th minute to seal the
victory for the French team.
</P>
<P>
The win ensured the host team a berth in the top 16 no matter
what the result is in their final group match against Denmark.

Earlier on Thursday, Denmark were forced to a 1-1 draw by South
Africa. They need at least a draw against France to salvage the

<HEADLINE> Democrats Trying to Revive Tobacco Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Democratic attempt to attach
tobacco legislation to an appropriations bill was rejected by the
Senate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not let the issue die," Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle said, hours after Congress' first national tobacco
proposal perished on procedural votes Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Daschle tried to revive the legislation sponsored by Republican
Senator John McCain Thursday morning by tying it to an energy
appropriations bill only to be rebuffed, 54-44.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has also pledged to keep the issue
alive in Congress and in this fall's election campaign, saying, "I
don't intend to stop fighting for this."
</P>
<P>
Daschle said, "We are going to continue this fight in whatever
vehicle, whatever form, whatever opportunity we have."
</P>
<P>
At an unrelated Rose Garden announcement Thursday morning,
Clinton again lashed out at Republicans for killing the tobacco
legislation. "It's dead today; it may not be dead tomorrow," he
said. "I think, in the end, we will prevail."
</P>
<P>
"Big tobacco owns the Republican party and they've just proven
it again," said Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
McCain blamed cigarette makers, who waged a 40 million dollar
advertising campaign against the bill. "They're the big winners
today," he said on ABC's "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, the children of America lost, because today
3,000 children will start smoking and a thousand of them will die
early," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
Republicans countered that the bill essentially killed itself
after numerous amendments bloated it beyond its original focus --
to curb teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
"We've lost sight of the original noble cause of just dealing
with teen-age smoking and drug abuse," said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles called the bill "a crummy
effort at raising taxes."
</P>
<P>
McCain's bill would have raised at least 516 billion dollars
over 25 years, in part by raising the price. It also would have
granted the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate
nicotine and severely limited the industry's ability to advertise.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would have settled three dozen state lawsuits
against the industry in which local governments are trying to
recoup the cost of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
Negotiation last summer resulted in a deal between the states
and the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
Their 368 billion-dollar settlement of the state lawsuits was
the model for McCain's bill. But during some 80 hours of debate
over nearly four weeks, senators added provisions to cut taxes for
some married couples and self-employed workers, limit the fees of
attorneys filing lawsuits against the industry and devote some of
the money raised to drug-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
Though many of those amendments are pet Republican proposals,
the Republicans turned against the bill in a climax in which
supporters twice failed to gain the 60 votes that would have kept
it alive.
</P>
<P>
In the House of Representatives, Republicans are reportedly to
unveil a narrower anti-smoking bill this week, aimed at curbing
teen smoking and drug abuse without raising hundreds of billions
of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes," House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said in a statement. Senate Republicans
promised to pursue similar legislation.

<HEADLINE> Greece Promises EU to Meet Convergence Targets in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday gave the European
Union (EU) its plan to integrate its economy with the 15-member
group, promising that all convergence targets to join European
economic and monetary union (EMU) will be met in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The convergence plan for 1998-2001 given to the EU's Commission
and Monetary Committee says that alignment criteria can be met by
end 1998 except for consumer price inflation, which is feasible in
1999, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is now the only country which does not meet any
criteria of joining EMU, has decided to join EMU in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
The plan takes into account the repercussions of a 14 percent
devaluation of the drachma on March 14 when the currency joined
the EU's exchange rate mechanism as a stepping stone to EMU.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, average consumer price inflation is
expected to drop to 4.5 percent in 1998, 2.5 percent in 1999, 1.9
percent in 2000, and 1.7 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The public sector deficit (general government) is expected to
drop to 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998,
2.1 percent of GDP in 1999, 1.7 percent in 2000, and 0.8 percent
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The public debt is predicted to total 107.8 percent of GDP in
1998, 105.8 percent in 1999, 102.5 percent in 2000, and 99.8
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on 12-month treasury bills should fall on
average to 9.5 percent in 1998, 7.5 percent in 1999, 6.5 percent
in 2000, and 5.5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
GDP is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 1998, 3.7 percent in
1999, 3.5 percent percent in 2000, and 4.5 percent in 2001.
