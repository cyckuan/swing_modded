<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets French National Assembly, Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
Monday afternoon here with French National Assembly President
Laurent Fabius and Senate President Christian Poncelet.
</P>
<P>
Fabius said that France intends to further develop its
relations with China because of the latter's prominent status in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that he personally holds a deep respect for the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Fabius also said that deputies of the French National Assembly
from all parties are impressed by and admire the achievements made
by China in its socio-economic development, and they are convinced
that China will play a more and more important role in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the development of modern information
technology cannot replace the face-to-face contacts between
people, as the latter way of communication can better deliver the
message and increase understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has a long tradition of having contacts with
France and the elder generation of Chinese revolutionaries,
including Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yi, all studied and
worked in France in their youth times, and many Chinese
intellectuals learned arts and literature in France.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that China and France have more
contacts and increase mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Poncelet, Jiang said that he highly
appreciates the efforts made by the French Senate in promoting
exchange and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the parliaments of the two countries should make
more frequent their contacts in order to increase the
understanding and friendship between the people of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that ever since he arrived in France Friday, he has
been in an atmosphere of friendship among the French friends.
</P>
<P>
Poncelet said that he believes President Jiang's visit will
surely further promote the existing close French-Chinese
relations.

<HEADLINE> Eight Arrested at London Millennium Wheel Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight protestors participating
in an environmental demonstration on the 450-feet-high Millennium
Wheel were arrested Monday, but others remain perched on the huge
structure in central London.
</P>
<P>
Police said seven activists -- who were protesting against the
construction of controversial dams in Spain and India -- came down
voluntarily and were arrested for suspected criminal damage.
</P>
<P>
One had been arrested earlier before being able to climb onto
the wheel.
</P>
<P>
But two protesters were thought to be still at the top of the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
The protestors used climbing equipment, including harnesses, to
scale the wheel -- officially known as the London Eye -- Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The protest has been mounted by Basque environmentalists from
the group Solidarios con Itoitz and activists from the Indian
group, Narmada UK.
</P>
<P>
At one stage, a police helicopter hovered 50 meters from the
wheel, while an officer urged the protestors to come down.
</P>
<P>
Two protesters remain at the top of the wheel armed with
supplies for a long stay. A red hammock was set up at the top of
the wheel and the demonstrators pledged to stay up all night.
</P>
<P>
The wheel, which affords spectacular views over the capital,
only reached its final position last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Due to open on Millennium Eve, it is London's fourth-tallest
structure and will stay in position for at least five years, with
a capacity to carry 15,000 people a day.
</P>
<P>
The wheel's sponsor, British Airways, said it was looking into
the security implications of the protest.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators are opposing alleged environmental
destruction caused by dam projects in the Basque Country in Spain
and in the Narmada valley in the western Indian state of Gujarat.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Praises U.N. for Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Deputy Foreign
Minister Nicholas Goche praised the United Nations on Monday for
the tremendous strides it has made in fulfilling one of its
missions of maintaining a safer and better world.
</P>
<P>
Commemorating the U.N. day, he said in the past 54 years the
world body had played a central role in averting a nuclear
catastrophe despite some conflicts that continued to rage in
various parts of the planet.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. steadfast support for self-determination, democracy
and human rights led to the emergence of new independent states
like our own," Goche said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said much more still needed to be done if ideals of the U.N.
Charter were to be realized.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty has today becomes the single most important source of
human insecurity particularly in the developing world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He questioned the essence of globalization which preached about
one village while the gap between the poor and rich continued to
widen.
</P>
<P>
He said globalization would remain a pipe dream unless serious
steps were taken to reform the global economy and financial
systems that seemed to promote a gap between the poor and the
rich.
</P>
<P>
Goche said while progress had been registered in the
administrative reforms of the U.N., much more still needed to be
done as far as political reforms of the organization were
concerned.
</P>
<P>
In commemorating U.N. day this year Zimbabwe focused on youth
and ran an essay competition in which the youth were asked to
write on what they expected the U.N. to do for them in the new
millennium.

<HEADLINE> First Heart Transplant in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The first heart transplant in
Romania was performed from Sunday night to Monday morning on a
young man of 23, with the heart coming from a 24-year-old
clinically dead donator, the official Rompres news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed by a complex team headed by Dr Serban
Bradisteanu at the Floreasca Emergency Hospital in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The transplant preliminary preparations, namely the tissular
compatibility tests, took almost six hours. The surgery took place
in good conditions, and after the surgery the patient is feeling
well. The receiver's diagnosis was dilating cardiomyopathy and Jad
already suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Related to the rejection period, Dr Bradisteanu said that it
depends on several factors, among which are the immunosuppression
treatment and the patient himself.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Floreasca Hospital's Cardiovascular Surgery
Department considers the surgery a success. At present, the life
expectations for a heart-transplanted person are from 15 to 20
years, which is also a consequence of the progress in
pharmacology, Dr Bradisteanu said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the heart, the two kidneys of the donator have been
removed, one transplanted at the Fundeni Clinical Hospital in the
capital, and the second in the northwestern city of Cluj,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> IFC Finances Cement Plant in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Monday that it has signed an agreement
to invest 55.6 million U.S. dollars in Lafarge Dujiangyan Cement
Company Ltd., the largest modern cement plant in Sichuan province
of southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The project promotes foreign investment in China's remote
interior region, thus supporting a more balanced development of
the country's economy, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
The greenfield cement plant, to be built at a cost of 158.8
million dollars, will use state-of-the-art technology to produce
3,200 tons of clinker per day, corresponding to 1.24 million tons
of cement per year, for sale in Sichuan where the supply of high
quality cement does not meet existing demand.
</P>
<P>
The project is a joint venture between Lafarge China Offshore
Holding Company Limited (LCOCH) with 75 percent shareholding and
Dujiangyan Building Materials Corporation (DBMC), the local
sponsor, with 25 percent shareholding.
</P>
<P>
Lafarge S.A., the second largest cement producer in the world
with a majority shareholding in LCOCH, will provide technical
support to the project, its first major venture in interior China.
DBMC is owned by the local city government and is part of the
local administrative bureau of the building materials industry.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's financing package consists of a loan for its own
account of 25.6 million dollars and a syndicated loan of 30
million dollars for the account of Nederlandse
Financierings-Maatschappij Voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (FMO),
Caisse des Deports et Consignations, New York Life International
Inc., and Banque Worms.
</P>
<P>
Javed Hamid, the IFC's director for East Asia and the Pacific,
said the project would bring sound management, modern technology,
and jobs to one of China's less developed provinces. He added that
successful completion of the financing demonstrates that sound
investment opportunities exist in China's interior. This is the
fifth project that the IFC has financed in Sichuan province and
the seventh in the interior region.
</P>
<P>
The project will follow state-of-the-art pollution control
technologies and has been designed and implemented in full
consultation with local communities, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the IFC, part of the World Bank Group, is to
promote private sector investment in developing countries, which
will reduce poverty and improve people's lives.

<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The opening of a safe passage for
the Palestinians is "a further positive step" in the
implementation of the revised Wye accord, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The land route linking the Palestinian self-rule Gaza and the
West Bank showed continuing progress in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
This move will further contribute to the promotion of relations
between the two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel allowed the opening of the safe passage on Monday, three
weeks behind the scheduled time as stipulated in the revised Wye
accord signed on September 5 in Egypt, due to disputes over
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israel has carried out the first of the three-phased troop
withdrawal from the West Bank and released more than 300
Palestinian prisoners in two batches.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a planned tripartite meeting in the West Bank town of
Ramallah on Palestinian refugees, Moussa said the talks will
involve the Arab countries concerned with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be held on Wednesday and attended by
Moussa, Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib and
Palestinian Minister of International Cooperation Nabil Shaath, is
aimed at coordinating stances among the three sides, he added.

UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun Monday paid
tribute to Tanzania's former President Julius K. Nyerere by
saying he was a statesman and an international activist.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a memorial for Nyerere organized by the South
African Development Community, Qin said Nyerere had devoted all
his life to the independence and well-being of Tanzania as well as
the entire African continent and had played an important role in
promoting South-South cooperation and the dialogue between the
South and the North.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as the mediator in the peace process, he had
made tremendous contribution to the national reconciliation in
Burundi, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"The passing away of H.E. Mr. Julius K. Nyerere was an
immeasurable loss not only to Tanzania but also to the African
continent as a whole. At the same time, the Chinese people lost a
close and respected old friend," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the people of Tanzania and the rest of Africa
will carry on the extraordinary work that H.E. Mr. Julius k.
Nyerere had dedicated his life to and continue to strive for
progress and development of the African continent and
establishment of a fair and reasonable new international political
and economic order. The Chinese people are ready to join the
African people in such an endeavor," he added.
</P>

Nyerere died on October 14 in London of complications from
leukemia. He was 77.

WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced Monday that it will establish an
agency line with Cairo Amman Bank, one of the largest banks in
Jordan, to provide long-term financing to small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The agency line totaling 5 million U.S. dollars will be
financed with 2.5 million dollars from the IFC's Small Enterprise
Fund and 2.5 million dollars from Cairo Amman Bank.
</P>
<P>
Cairo Amman Bank, with its extensive network in the West Bank
and Gaza, is well placed to administer funds to eligible smaller
businesses for projects that cost between 300,000 dollars and 2.4
million dollars, said the IFC, part of the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
IFC Executive Vice President Peter Woicke, who signed the
agreement Sunday during a visit to the Middle East, said that SMEs
are the engine of growth in the burgeoning West Bank and Gaza
economy. As the first such agency line established under the Small
Enterprise Fund, the project introduces a new financial instrument
to provide financing to SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The Small Enterprise Fund is part of the IFC's "Extending the
Reach" initiative, which promotes investments in countries and
regions where difficult conditions hamper investment.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's projects in the West Bank and Gaza focus on creating
jobs and earning foreign exchange as well as building financing
institutions. Alongside its investments, the IFC gives advice to
frame the legal and regulatory structure that encourages
investment.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Encourages French Enterprises to Invest More in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Monday encouraged French enterprises to make more investment in
China, especially in public transport and environment projects.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to French entrepreneurs at the Paris Chamber of
Commerce, Jiang said that over the past 35 years after China and
France established diplomatic relations, the two countries have
seen a rapid growth of bilateral cooperation in the field of
economy and technology on the basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
But the potential is great for the two countries to stage
further cooperative projects, especially in construction of
infrastructure like railway, airport and expressways, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou plan to lay 1,000 kilometers of subways tracks, and
China is expected to have a boom of expressway construction in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that French enterprises can also choose environment
protection, urban construction, high technologies and farm
products processing as priorities of their investment in China.
</P>
<P>
He promised the French entrepreneurs that they will receive
full support and aid from the Chinese government in China.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Climate Conference Opens in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A major United Nations conference
opened Monday in Bonn, where ministers and senior government
officials from more than 160 countries began their 11-day
negotiations over how to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth Session of the Conference of the Parties of the
U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP5, a wide range
of political, economic and technical issues linked with the theme
are expected to encounter some 5,000 participants from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
The continuously rising emissions of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases from the wealthy nations have caused concerns.
Kofi Annan, U.N. secretary general, urged the developed countries
to contribute more to protect the world climate.
</P>
<P>
"The Kyoto Protocol must take effect in 2002," said Annan in a
letter to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol, not yet ratified by most industrial
countries, will commit the wealthy nations to cut their overall
emissions until 2012 by 5 percent compared to 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
But scientists have predicted emissions from the OECD nations
will increase 18 percent above 1990 levels by 2010 unless
effective measures are taken, and it will be a major factor that
causes global temperature rise in following years.
</P>
<P>
The OECD, namely the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, is the largest bloc of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Annan further appealed the OECD nations to help
the poor ones, financially and technically.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries must be provided with financial and
technical helps, so that they can follow the way of environment
friendly development," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
To echo Annan's appealing, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said his country would map out a "national strategy" of cutting
emissions by 21 percent by 2012. He also called on other wealthy
nations to take action.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the opening of the conference, Schroeder said,
"Those who take their responsibility seriously must take action
now."
</P>
<P>
"And those who sidestep the theme (climate protection)... will
in only a few years lose the entrance to the most important
markets in the next century," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, most industrial countries, the U.S. in the lead, said
a rapid transition to low emission economy could hurt their
industrial and commercial competitiveness. They demand developing
countries, which account for only 30 percent of the greenhouse
gases, be committed to cut emissions.
</P>
<P>
Three largest economies in the world, the U.S., Japan, and the
European Union, have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which will
become international law only after at least 55 countries,
including developed ones accounting for at least 55 percent of
developed country emissions, have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
With all these negotiations ahead, the U.N. officials did not
expect a breakthrough in Bonn. They said the COP5 was aimed to
make preparation for the next round, and crucial decisions would
be left for COP6 scheduled for the year 2000 in The Hague, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The crunch will come in The Hague," said Michael Zammit
Cutajar, executive secretary of the convention.
</P>
<P>
"The final results will have to satisfy the major industrial
countries, trigger their ratification of the protocol, and offer
incentives to developing countries to take further action in the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Bonn conference must build confidence in a successful
outcome at The Hague by adopting important technical decisions,
sending positive signals to business and industry, and engaging
ministers fully in the task of focusing and speeding up the
negotiations," said Cutajar.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Four people of one family
were killed in a big landslide in the eastern district of Mbale in
Uganda Sunday, a police source has said.
</P>
<P>
John Kimera, deputy spokesman of the Uganda Police, told
Xinhua Monday evening that the landslide was caused by a heavy
downpour in the district and police have been sent there
searching for any survivors.
</P>
<P>
"We sent policemen there and rescue work is being done to find
 survivors and provide emergency help to those displaced," he said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"Of the four people killed, there were a couple and their
six-year-old and three-year-old kids. I will give detailed
information on that tomorrow,"
</P>
<P>
he added.
</P>
<P>
In August, a landslide in the same area killed 18 people and
left many others displaced. The government has pledged to do more
to plant trees on the hills there, but all the plans have not yet
been carried out due to lack of fund, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Denies Growing Cooler to Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday denied the rumors that the Kremlin has become cooler to
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin than ever before, said Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors, which appeared in some newspapers, that the Kremlin
has changed its attitude to the prime minister and is growing
cooler to him, are lies," said the president here to the press
before a meeting with Putin at his Kremlin office.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin highly appreciated Putin's work in the Northern
Caucasus, noting that now he has "even more respect" for the
latter.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that Putin has arrived at constructive
decisions, and I'm backing these decisions," Yeltsin said,
stressing that "Putin carries through every business he undertakes,
and resolves it."
</P>
<P>
Allegations that the Kremlin has grown cooler to Putin
appeared in newspapers after Yeltsin held a meeting last week
without Putin's presence.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Putin told reporters that "the discussion in the
media of my own absence at the Wednesday meeting came as a
complete surprise to me."
</P>
<P>
He had been to Yeltsin's retreat in Zavidovo on Monday last
week to discuss his forthcoming trip to the North Caucasus, Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
As to the alleged deterioration of his relations with the
Kremlin, Putin said he believed that rumors are inevitable as long
as political struggle exists. One should work for results rather
than pay attention to rumors, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sends Record Number of Troops Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada has sent more than 4,400
troops abroad, setting a new record since 1992, the Ottawa Citizen
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The troops are deployed on 22 missions, including Bosnia,
Kosovo and East Timor, despite the latest reduction of the country
's total military forces to 60,000, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The previous high point of overseas troops since the 1950s was
recorded in 1992, when 4,300 Canadian soldiers were serving in
Somalia, Bosnia, Cambodia and other hot-spot places in the world.
</P>
<P>
There were almost 85,000 personnel in the Canadian armed forces
at that time.
</P>
<P>
As of last week, Canada assigned 639 soldiers, aviators and
sailors to East Timor despite its early commitment of 600, which
already caused complaints that the country's military was too much
stretched.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper warned that the country may have to rely heavily
on the militia to deal with issues like Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian military, however, has dismissed any concern,
saying there are abundant soldiers to deal with any domestic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Defense Staff General J.M.G. Baril also pledged
recently that the Canadian military is at its most combat-capable
state in the past three decades.

<HEADLINE> American Military Plan to Cost Canada Millions of Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian army will have to
spend at least 36 million U.S. dollars in going with an American
military plan, Canadian media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spending is needed to upgrade navigation equipment the
Canadian army bought just two years ago, as a result of big
changes being planned by the American military to its satellite
based navigation system, according to the media.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are changing the technology to prevent its use by
hostile forces and to make it more jam-proof for the future
warfare.
</P>
<P>
"We're working with the U.S. Department of Defense on this in
choosing the replacement model," army spokesman Lt.-Cmdr. Albert
Wong was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canada has bought 8,000 hand-held receivers from America to
help soldiers determine their precise position by using the global
positioning system (GPS), which relies on signals from 24 military
satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are now worried that enemies will also be able to
use the system or will try to jam the signals. The American
military has, therefore, decided on a navigation warfare program (
Navwar) to be finalized in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian army is expected to begin upgrading its GPS as
early as 2003 in conformity with Navwar, the media said.

<HEADLINE> New Delhi Assures Dhaka of Solving Border Issues Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Monday received fresh
assurance from India of reaching a solution to border problems by
February or March next year, according to the official Bangladesh
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The assurance came from Indian Border Security Force (BSF)
Chief Ram Mohan following talks between Bangladesh Rifles (BDR)
and BSF at the BDR headquarters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
As there is a stable government in India now, India is
optimistic to reach a solution on border issues by February to
March of the next year, the BSF chief said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not explain whether it would be solved through
ratification of the 1974 treaty by the Indian side or by any other
means.
</P>
<P>
Initiating the two-day conference, BDR Director General Major
General Azizur Rahman described the absence of ratification of the
1974 treaty by India as the root cause of all disputes and
conflicts along the 4,310-kilometer-long border between Bangladesh
and India.
</P>
<P>
He regretted recent incidents in some parts of the border areas
which resulted in a series of clashes, killing and kidnaps.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a BDR press release said the border coordination
conference at the Director General level began with a cordial
atmosphere here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BSF and BDR agreed in the talks to extend cooperation in
taking effective measures to stop smuggling and other border
crimes. The conference will end on October 28.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Have 3.2 Million More Phone Lines in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of two million fixed
telephone lines and 1.2 million mobile lines are to be provided
for Nigerians in the next two years, according to a new policy on
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The new policy expected to be released Tuesday also said that
five million fixed lines and four million mobile lines would be
provided within the next five years, This Day newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is determined to establish an
efficient, reliable and affordable telecommunications system in a
bid to promote rapid socio-economic and political development,
according to the new policy.
</P>
<P>
It noted that a total of 3.2 phone lines would be provided in
two years to ensure that the most populous African country would
meet or exceed the International Telecommunication Union's
recommendation of minimum tele- density of one telephone per 100
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, a national frequency management board
will be established to plan, coordinate, allocate and monitor
national radio frequency spectrum.
</P>
<P>
The communication industry would be deregulated to allow new
entrants while the state-owned national operators, including the
Nigerian Telecommunication Corporation, shall be gradually
privatized.
</P>
<P>
At present, Nigeria, with a population exceeding 120 million,
has about 600,000 telephone lines.

<HEADLINE> UK Global Trade Gap Narrows In August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
with the rest of the world narrowed to 1.9 billion pounds (3.1
billion U.S. dollars) in August from 2.2 billion pounds (3.6
billion dollars) in July, the latest official figures show.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the increase in
goods exports outstripped the rise in imports, but added the trend
for the global trade deficit was fairly flat.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the trade deficit with countries outside the
European Union also narrowed, to 1.2 billion pounds (2 billion
dollars) in September, from 1.5 billion pounds (2.5 billion
dollars) in August.
</P>
<P>
Economists had expected a deficit of 1.7 billion pounds (2.8
billion dollars). They said the improvement was largely
attributable to the high price of oil over the period.
</P>
<P>
But the underlying picture remained fairly bleak, National
Australia Bank economist James McKay said.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the underlying deficits, that is excluding oil
and erratic items, we still have got a very large deficit -- 2.1
billion pounds (3.5 billion dollars) in August and that is a
problem for the UK economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
People are also worrying that if the trade gap is improving,
the Bank of England may have less hesitation in raising interest
rates.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Drop for 3rd Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of existing homes
fell in September for the third straight month because of rising
mortgage rates, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association said that existing single-family homes
decreased by 2.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 5.13 million units.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop, existing-home sales have remained above the
5-million level for 11 months in a row. If compared with September
1998, sales have increased 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.82
percent in September, up from 6.72 percent in September 1998, but
lower than the 7.94 percent rate in August, the association said,
citing figures from Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
Last month's sales level was the lowest since May when 5
million units were sold. The 2.1 percent decline in September,
followed a 3 percent drop in sales in August and a 4 percent
decline in July. In June, sales hit an all-time high of 5.63
million units sold.
</P>
<P>
Despite September's decrease, association officials said they
expect existing homes sales to post another record year in 1999 of
an estimated 5.20 million units. That would mark a 4.8 percent
increase over last year's record of 4.97 million units, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Sales in all parts of the country were down, except for the
West where sales increased 8.33 percent to an annual rate of 1.43
million units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national median sales price for existing homes
rose 3.9 percent to 134,500 dollars in September over the same
month a year ago, the association said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Leaves U.S. Republican Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan announced here Monday that he is leaving the
Republican Party to seek the Reform Party nomination for the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"Our vaunted two-party system has become a snare and a
delusion, a fraud upon the nation," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I must leave the party that has long been my home, with regret
but no rancor, because the Washington elite of the GOP (the Grand
Old Party) has left me and the principles for which I have toiled
and fought for 40 years," Buchanan said in a fund-raising letter.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan left the Republican Party as his presidential
campaign never broke out of the single digits in polls and he
had trouble in raising money, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, who would not be assured of winning the Reform Party
nomination, began considering a third-party bid after Texas
Governor George Bush secured early dominance over Republican
money, endorsements and poll ratings.
</P>
<P>
Republicans worry that a strong Buchanan candidacy would siphon
conservative voters from the eventual Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan is the sixth person to quit the Republican Party
nomination race, leaving George Bush and five others in the field.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a potential rival, New York tycoon Donald Trump, is
also changing his party allegiance from the Republican Party, the
nominee of which has been earmarked 12 million dollars in federal
money for the general election.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the Reform Party could also be a crowded field
though Trump said he would decide early next year whether to seek
the White House.

<HEADLINE> Iran Spends Heavily on Sealing off Eastern Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran has so far spent some 900
million U.S. dollars on sealing off borders in the southeastern
province of Sistan-Baluchestan bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan
in order to curb drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the provincial security forces Brigadier General
Nasser Shabani said on Monday that as part of the country's
anti-drug campaign, the amount has been spent on setting up
concrete barriers, watchtowers and digging ditches and canals in
the border areas.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing a diplomatic delegation
comprising 25 ambassadors and officials from a number of European
and Asian embassies in Tehran who were inspecting Iran's eastern
border areas, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shabani said that after emergence of the Afghan Taliban militia
and subsequent increase in production of narcotic drugs in
Afghanistan, transfer of narcotic drugs to Iran via provincial
borders has increased.
</P>
<P>
Some 43 tons of various kinds of illicit drugs have been seized
by the provincial security forces since March 21, the beginning of
the current Iranian calendar year, while the drug haul during last
Iranian year was 18.5 tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that 27 drug smuggling bands have been
busted in the province in the past seven months and some 4,298
smugglers have also been arrested during the operations.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the country's anti-drug headquarters Hassan Fallah
on Sunday told the diplomatic delegation that over 8,000 billion
rials (about 2.67 billion dollars) is annually spent on fighting
drug trafficking in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that over 146 tons of various kinds of narcotic drugs
were seized by the security forces throughout the country during
the first six months of the current Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the official said, 146 Iranian anti-drug
personnel were killed in various operations, bringing the total
number martyred to this end to 2,088 since the Islamic revolution
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 people were imprisoned on drug-related charges, he
added.

PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
told representatives of French corporations Monday that despite the
Asia financial crisis, China's economic growth rate in the first
half of this year attained 7.6 percent and its perspective remains
bright.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Paris Chamber of Commerce, Jiang said that
in reaction to the negative impacts on China's economy from the

the Chinese government has adopted a series of economic and

He said that China's reservation of foreign hard currencies now
stands at 15 billion U.S. dollars and China's import-export volume
in the period from January to September 1999 increased by 9.4
percent as compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China will continue to invest in infrastructure
constructions, readjust its economic structure, seek growth of
agricultural production, introduce high technology and modern
enterprise systems to state enterprises, and protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's economy continues to suffer from the
effects of the Asia financial crisis, and the country's reform is
faced with deeply rooted defaults, including structural problems,
lack of consumption, increasing pressure on its export, and
redundant labor force in state enterprises and its re-employment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as a developing country with 1.25 billion
people, China must fix its strategy of development and
modernization in accordance with its current situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that past experiences have proved the present policy of
the Chinese party and government effective, correct and conforming
to the reality of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his confidence that China's reform and
construction drive will make new breakthroughs because reform,
opening and modernization have won full support of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people cherish the present environment
of peace and stability and are wasting no time in constructing
their own country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that it is with great resolve that the Chinese
people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are
following the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
striving for a strong and prosperous China and realizing the great
rejuvenization of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets French Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here on Monday with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin at the
prime minister's office in Matignon Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he remembered well his meeting with Jospin in
Hefei, Anhui Province, when Jospin visited China in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gladness to meet the prime minister again
in Paris one year later.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that he was very pleased to receive President Jiang
in his office and he was deeply impressed by their friendly, frank
and in-depth talks in Hefei.
</P>
<P>
He said that since then, French-Chinese relations have
developed very well on a solid basis of friendship.
</P>
<P>
The warmest welcoming ceremony given to Jiang this time was a
proof of it, said Jopsin.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the French government, Jospin again expressed
regret about the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by
NATO missiles during the Kosovo War.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that France will continue to seek a solution to the
world's hot crises through diplomatic and political means under
the auspices of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister said that France opposes the U.S.
plan on building anti-missile defense and deplores the rejection
by the U.S. Senate of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
He said that under the current international circumstances, a
stronger cooperation between France and China will be good for the
development of bilateral relations as well as peace and stability
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the successful visit to China by the prime
minister last year has strengthened bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that to the gladness of China, the exchange of visits
by the leaders of the two countries is increasing, political
consultations at different levels between the two governments are
going deeper, and the fields of cooperation and exchange are
expanding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his confidence that under the joint efforts by
the two governments, the good momentum in developing bilateral
relations will continue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that at the threshold of the 21st
century, the task to push forward the process of world peace,
stability and prosperity is a major challenge to the leaders of
all countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Kosovo War earlier this year should provoke
deep reflections.
</P>
<P>
"The (NATO) intervention of Kosovo should never be allowed to
set a precedent as for how to deal with international affairs.
Ethnic and religious problems are the internal affairs of a
country and they should be dealt with by the people of that
country alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the international community intends to help a
country solve its internal problems, it should do it in a peaceful
way and with the precondition of respecting the country's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the authority of the United Nations Security
Council in implementing missions of international peacekeeping and
protecting world security should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is still a developing country and that it
pledges not to seek hegemonism nor interfere in the internal
affairs of others even if it becomes powerful in the future.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that China and France will increase
dialogue, strengthen cooperation and work jointly for a new
century of peace and development.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz held talks Monday with visiting Pakistani Chief
Executive Pervez Musharraf on ways of cementing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
This is General Musharraf's first foreign trip since he toppled
the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a peaceful
military coup on October 12, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said earlier
that Musharraf, who is on a two-nation tour, will brief Saudi
officials on the conditions in his country over the past two weeks
and the reasons that led to the military coup.
</P>
<P>
He will also assure Riyadh of his resolve to maintain stability
and security, and boost prosperity in Pakistan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the fact that the new Pakistani leader chose
Saudi Arabia as the first foreign state to visit reflected the
weight of the Gulf kingdom in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf received the Saudi ambassador to Islamabad
shortly after the coup.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had voiced deep concern over the situation in
Pakistan after the coup, expressing hope that "reason" would
prevail in order to preserve Pakistan's security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf arrived in Riyadh earlier in the day on a two-day
visit and he will travel on to the United Arab Emirates later.

<P>
ATHENS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Airways (OA), Greece's
national carrier, announced Monday its new business plan aimed to
renew its fleet, to further develop and build up flights, to
strengthen its staff and to liquidate certain assets.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages the sale of OA's assets and old fleet of
Boeing 737 aircraft, and its replacement with about 25-30 new
aircraft in the next five-seven years along with expanding and
building up its flights to international destinations, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) quoted OA's Chief Executive
Rod Lynch as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lynch said that OA needed retraining and hiring of almost 1,000
employees, mainly in technical departments.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Airways would adopt a more aggressive fare policy both
on domestic and international flights, he said, adding that the
national carrier's aim was to sign powerful alliances with foreign
airlines such as British Airways, which was the main candidate to
acquire a minority stake in the Greek flag carrier.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi High Court Rules on Election Commission Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's High Court on Monday
issued a rule on the legality of an order of the Election
Commission earlier this month which declared the seats of two
former opposition legislators vacant and the legality of the
benefits they had received since joining the government.
</P>
<P>
The High Court issued the rule upon the chief election
commissioner (CEC) and the secretaries of the Cabinet Division and
the Parliament Secretariat to show cause within four weeks why the
order of the CEC vacating the two parliamentary seats shall not be
declared passed without lawful authority and of no legal effect.
</P>
<P>
It directed the two former members of parliament, Mohammad
Alauddin Ahmed and Hasibur Rahman Swapan, the CEC, the secretaries
of the Cabinet Division and the Parliament Secretariat to show
cause why the drawing of salaries, allowances, other benefits and
expenses received by Alauddin Ahmed and Swapan shall not be
declared without lawful authority and why they shall not be
directed to return the salaries, allowances and other benefits to
the state.
</P>
<P>
The court also directed the secretaries of the Cabinet Division
and the Parliament Secretariat to submit all records relating to
salaries, allowances and other benefits received by Swapan and
Alauddin Ahmed as ministers to the court.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission in a verdict on October 11 vacated the
parliamentary seats "with immediate effect" of the two lawmakers
of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who joined
the government last year, on charges of crossing the floor.
</P>
<P>
Chief Whip of the Opposition in Parliament Khandker Delwar
Hossain on Sunday filed a writ petition challenging the order of
the Election Commission, praying the seats of the two former
lawmakers be declared vacant from the day they joined the
government and they return the money they got as salaries and
allowances as ministers.
</P>
<P>
Alauddin Ahmed and Swapan, who were both elected as BNP
candidates in the general elections in 1996, were appointed as
state minister for Water Resources and deputy industries minister,
respectively, in February last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and French President Jacques Chirac share the view on world
multi-polarization, and Chirac said China will be an important
pole of the multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents held talks here Monday morning and agreed
that China and Europe, and China and France should strengthen
dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also held that the process of building a
nuclear-free world should not be affected. The relevant side
should approve the treaty of banning nuclear test as soon as
possible, and abide by the treaty of anti-ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
To further strengthen cooperation, China and France have
decided to establish a hotline between the two heads of state, and
strengthen the mechanism of consultation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reaffirmed that France has insisted on the "One China
Policy" over the past 35 years. He also expressed the support of
China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Jiang remarked that he has exchanged views with Chirac in a
face-to-face manner, saying that it is of vital importance for
leaders of the two countries to frankly voice their views on all
kinds of issues and explain their stands, which is beneficial to
enhancing mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The current world is colorful, not a unipolar world but a
multipolar one," Jiang said. "The bilateral relationship between
China and France has kept developing since the establishment of
diplomatic ties."
</P>
<P>
Jiang also dwelled on China's principle and stand on its
accession to the WTO, hoping that EU will adopt a positive,
pragmatic and flexible attitude in its negotiations with China on
this issue, so that an agreement could be reached as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Chirac promised that France will continue to make efforts to
this end.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also elaborated on the importance of cooperation in high
and new technology, hoping that the two countries will explore new
channels and fields in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he fully agreed with Jiang's views.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that both China and France are countries with a long
history of civilization and have the tradition of safeguarding
national independence.
</P>
<P>
As members of the United Nations Security Council, he said,
China and France have shouldered important responsibilities over
international affairs and the economies of the two countries are
highly complementary.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we have common language and interests in many aspects,
which is the important foundation of developing bilateral
relations of friendly cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"At the time when mankind is walking into the 21st century,
China is willing to join hands with France in consolidating and
developing the overall partnership between the two countries,
expanding and deepening the cooperation in all fields, so as to
bring happiness to the people of the two countries and to make
contributions to the progress and prosperity of the human beings,"
Jiang said.

<P>
The seven-member National Security Council headed by General
Musharraf, who is also Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdus Sattar was named as Minister of Foreign

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were
killed and seven others injured on Monday in U.S. and British
warplanes attacks on civilian targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:30 (0730 GMT) nine formations
of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombarded civilian facilities in the region,
leading to deaths of two civilians and injuries of seven others,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced the
enemy planes to flee to their bases in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At 6:35 (0335 GMT), 10 formations of U.S. and British
warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern
Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Thi-Qar, Muthana and Basra,
said the spokesman, adding Iraqi anti-aircraft units repulsed
the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have made 14,432 sorties over the
so-called northern and southern no-fly zones, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, regarding
them as unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain as they
are not covered directly by any U.N. resolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola said on Monday that the
United Nations would always play a prominent role in the Angolan
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Vice Foreign Minister George Chicoti made the statement
on the occasion of UN's 54th anniversary, acknowledging UN's
support for the consolidation of peace and national reconciliation
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
It is the first positive and friendly gesture made by the
Angolan government to the UN since the most important
international organization pulled out of the southwest African
country in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chicoti stressed that the Angolan government is devoted to the
reinforcement of democracy and promotion of human rights, and in
this context, it is possible for the UN to play a new role in
Angola in the future.
</P>
<P>
In early 1999, the Angolan government accused the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola of sheltering the rebels and
refused to retain the mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
But after a recent military victory over the rebels, the
Angolan government is paying more attention to the international
support and hoping to get more assistance for the over-two-million
war refugees in the country, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Since an all-out offensive started in mid-September, the
government troops have captured more than a dozen of cities and
towns in the central plateau occupied by the rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
including Bailundo and Andulo, long-term political and military
headquarters of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The casualties of the government troops is only one tenth of
UNITA's. At this moment, fierce battles are under way near the
city of Sanza Pombo in the north province of Uige with the
government force pursuing the rebels in the forest areas, local
newspapers said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sees Progress in Mideast Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday that she was satisfied with the
progress made in Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"You don't always need fireworks and ceremonies and meetings,
public meetings, in order to signify progress. So I am satisfied
with the fact that things are moving forward," Albright said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel has pulled out of part of the West Bank in accordance
with an agreement reached with the Palestinians in September.
</P>
<P>
And after difficult talks, Israel opened a safe passage Monday
for Palestinians traveling between the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
It has also cleared the way for guerrilla leader Nayef Hawatmeh
to enter Palestinian-ruled areas, saying it aimed to consolidate
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters who expressed scepticism over the
progress that there really is "movement." And she believed the
time frame set out for the talks on "final status" issues would be
met in September 2000 as was agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Albright will meet Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
Oslo on November 1 at a ceremony for the late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. They are expected to use the occasion to
give new impetus to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was willing to fly to Damascus to mediate between
Syria and Israel, Albright said, "As I have said before, I am
available to travel if there is something useful to be done."

</P>
<P>
Three of the victims were taken out by force from their living

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton
Monday ordered the first federal study of prescription drug prices
and the problems faced by elderly Americans in buying medicine.
</P>
<P>
Clinton directs the Department of Health and Human Services to
investigate price differences for the most commonly used drugs for
people with, and without, coverage, and drug spending by people of
different ages, as a percentage of income and a percentage of
total health spending.
</P>
<P>
The federal study would be completed within 90 days, he said
in a White House speech.
</P>
<P>
"No senior should have to forgo or cut back on lifesaving
medicine because of the cost," Clinton said in a White House
speech.
</P>
<P>
His announcement sets the stage for a major election-year
battle over Medicare drug benefits between the Democratic Party
and the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
In his Medicare speech, Clinton also lashed out at a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
Drug makers are sponsoring ads on television, radio and in
newspapers that assert Clinton's measure would put "big
government in my medicine cabinet."
</P>
<P>
The drug industry has led the fight against Clinton's proposal
to include prescription drug coverage in the Medicare health
program for the aged and disabled.
</P>
<P>
The industry calls Clinton's measure a government takeover of
the prescription medicine business that could lead to federal
price controls.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Clinton also said he would send Congress his
long-delayed legislation to reserve one-third of the non-Social
Security budget surplus for Medicare to extend its solvency and
help pay for a prescription drug benefit.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-general
Kofi Annan on Monday paid tribute to Tanzania's former President
Julius K. Nyerere, saying that he was a man of extraordinary
integrity, courage and moral authority as well as a widely
respected and admired international statesman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a memorial meeting organized by South African
Development Community at the Headquarters of the United Nations in
New York, Annan said "We meet today to honor a father and founder
of modern Africa. We meet in sorrow to rejoice at the
accomplishments of a life that mirrored the fate of the entire
Continent of Africa - from independence to maturity to wisdom."
</P>
<P>
"Above all, Nyerere, as a fonding father of Tanzania, played a
key role in promoting African independence, nation-building and
unity, and his willingness to step down from office voluntarily
after long service to his people should be a model to all
leaders," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"As succeeding generation will recall the life and legacy of K.
Nyerere, they will pay tribute to man who united, rather than
divided people, who believed that harmony and not division would
serve his people's interests, whose personal integrity became an
example not only to his won people, but to his fellow leaders
across the Continent, a man who led by example and inspiration and
not by force," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died on October 14 in London of complications from
leukemia. He was 77.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Oks Transitional Administration in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Monday authorized the establishment of a
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
</P>
<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Council said UNTAET
will be empowered to exercise all legislative and executive
authority, including the administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET is mandated to provide security and maintain law and
order throughout the territory and to establish an effective
administration.
</P>
<P>
It will assist in the development of civil and social services
of the territory and will ensure the coordination and delivery of
humanitarian, rehabilitation and development assistance from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
One component of the UNTAET will be some 9,000 troops and a
1,640 member police unit.
</P>
<P>
The troops will replace the multinational peace-keeping force
which began to be deployed in East Timor on September 20 with a
maximum capacity of 7,500 from Australia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Council gave the UNTAET an initial mandate until January
31, 2001. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier that it
may stay in East Timor for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the UNTAET is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion
U.S. dollars for the initial period, according to U.N.
Under-Secretary-General Bernard Miyet who is in charge of U.N.
peace-keeping operations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the decision of the Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly on October 19 to nullify the 1978 decree on
the integration of East Timor into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a Portuguese colony until 1975, was occupied by
Indonesia in 1976 after Portugal's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has since called East Timor a non-self-governing
territory. Under its auspices, Portugal and Indonesia agreed on
May 5 this year for a U.N.-sponsored referendum in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 referendum turned to be in favor for independence
but the outcome sparked a fierce reaction from the minority of the
locals who favor autonomy under Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Violence and Anarchy led to the Security Council's decision to
dispatch the multi-national force for the restoration of peace
and security for a total of 800,000 East Timorese.

 Ethio-Eritrean Conflict to Be Resolved Peacefully: Meles
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said here Monday that the Ethio-Eritrean border
conflict would be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with United Nations Deputy Secretary-General
Louise Frechettee, Meles said that Ethiopia was alway committed to
a durable peace and stability in the region, a spokesman for the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
However, Meles said Ethiopia required clarification of the
technical arrangement because it was inconsistent with the
framework agreement put forward by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The technical arrangement does not guarantee Ethiopia the
return of the status quo ante, Meles said, adding Ethiopia desires
a genuine document based on the framework agreement and the
modalities for the implementation of the cardinal elements of the
peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
Frechette said the UN supports the efforts exerted by the OAU
to seek a peaceful solution to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict, adding
it was the wish of the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
intensify efforts to resolve the conflicts in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Meles and Frenchette also discussed, among other issues, the
strategies designed by Ethiopia to contain the spread of the
lethal disease HIV/AIDS in the country, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
hosted Monday evening a banquet at the Elysee presidential palace
in honor of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
In a highly warm-hearted speech of toast, Chirac said that
tonight it is China who is the guest of France.
</P>
<P>
``It is a China of 5,000 years, cradle of the oldest living
civilization, and mother of a state older than history, as said
General Charles de Gaulle, a China which is standing, which is
changing and which is achieving success, which you have celebrated
shortly ago with a boom of its 50th anniversary,'' said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit of President Jiang to France also has a
symbolic meaning for cooperation between Asia and Europe, which he
said would become one of the poles in the world of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
``China and France are called to be the pioneers of the
rapprochement of Europe and Asia. It is in this spirit that, in
one year, I will go to Seoul for a Euro-Asia summit and then to
Beijing at your (Jiang's) invitation,'' said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French people are following the changes which
are taking place in China with great attention and even
fascination.
</P>
<P>
``We should and we will better know and better understand the
immense changes going on in your country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his return toast that Chinese people hold a deep
feeling toward the French people and the Chinese government pays
great importance to developing relations with France.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin, Senate president Christian Poncelet and National Assembly
president Laurent Fabius have helped increase the understanding
and trust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his confidence that under mutual efforts,
Sino-French relations will move on smoothly under the guideline of
the 1997 joint declaration on comprehensive partnership.
</P>
<P>
``The train of history is entering a new century, a conjunction
of two millennia. The people of all countries and all responsible
statesmen and political leaders should stand at the summit of
history, reflecting on the past and looking forward to the
future,'' said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that after 50 years of socialist construction,
especially 20 years of reform and opening, the Chinese people have
found their way of development which is proper to the situation of
China, and they have obtained the conditions and basis for further
development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China will continue to follow the guidelines
set by Deng Xiaoping on reform and opening, and will achieve their
great goal of modernization.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China will seek more exchange and cooperation
of mutual benefit with the people of all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
``The development of China will not only benefit the Chinese
people, but also stability and development of Asia and the whole
world,'' said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang finally said that China, with its 5,000-year-history and
having made great contributions to human civilization in the past,
will continue to strive to make contributions to humanity.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Turkey Ties Not Threaten Any Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said Monday that the good relations between Israel and
Turkey are not to oppose any other country.
</P>
<P>
Barak stressed the point at a joint press conference held with
his Turkish counterpart Bulent Ecevit after their official talks
in the prime ministry.
</P>
<P>
Barak said "Turkey is not only playing an important role in the
Mideast, but also in Europe and Central Asia. For this reason, the
relations between our two governments and our two peoples are very
good."
</P>
<P>
"According to my ideas, the relations between our two
countries will further develop," added Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak is the first Israeli prime minister to visit Turkey
since former Israeli Prime Minister Ben Gurion visited the country
secretly in 1958.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that at the invitation of Ecevit, he will pay
another official visit to Turkey in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best to make positive contributions to the
Mideast Peace process as it is very important for me," the
Israeli prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military and defense cooperation with Israel has
drawn harsh criticism and great concern from the Muslim world and
the Arab countries, which fear the military ties will change the
power balance in the Middle East and increase Israel's military
superiority over its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ecevit said that every one has understood that
the long cooperation between Turkey and Israel has brought peace
and stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries agreed to set up a fund to
finance the bilateral cooperation in technology and necessary
cooperation in economy and defense was also discussed in his talks
with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival earlier in the day, Barak attended the
inauguration ceremony of the "Israeli Prefabricated Village" in
the quake-hit province of Sakarya.
</P>
<P>
The village was built for the homeless Turks who were displaced
in the disastrous earthquake, which hit western Turkey on August
17, killing at least 17,000 people, injuring over 40,000 others
and displacing more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the Israeli government, like many other
countries, had decided to assist Turkey to heal the wounds of the
quake disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has allocated 4.5 million U.S. dollars
for the village project and Israeli nationals and Jewish
organizations in the U.S. have donated nearly 1 million dollars
for the quake victims.

<HEADLINE> CGIAR Calls For New Green Revolution to Fight Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- As the 21th Century dawns,
the world faces the prospect of a new and complex food crisis that
will require better ways of ensuring that the hungry and the
malnourished will be able to meet their food needs, according to a
new book released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The book, Food in the 21th Century: From Science to Sustainable
Agriculture, was released by the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) System Review
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Already today, there are more than 840 million people, a number
exceeding the combined population of Europe, the United States,
Canada and Japan, who do not have enough to eat. Every minute,
some 30 people die of hunger in the developing world and half of
these are infants and children.
</P>
<P>
To tackle this enormous challenge, the international community
must launch a new "Green Revolution," more powerful and
encompassing than the one that thirty years ago that doubled
production of key crops such as rice and wheat. The power of
science and information technology must be harnessed for the
benefit of the world's poor, the book said.
</P>
<P>
"Food production will have to increase by more than 50 percent
to feed an additional two billion people by 2025," said Mahendra
Shah, co-author of the book, and executive secretary of the CGIAR
System Review.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a crisis of hunger, the world community must
simultaneously confront the issues of poverty, food insecurity,
environmental degradation, and erosion of genetic resources, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The book highlights three powerful scientific developments that
can help food production keep pace sustainably with a rapidly
growing population: using biotechnology responsibly, managing
natural resources better, and harnessing the information
revolution.
</P>
<P>
New scientific advances have the potential to offer sizable
benefits in agricultural production, food quality, nutrition and
health but these have to be based on sound scientific evidence and
a system of checks and balances to gain the confidence of
producers and consumers alike, said the book.
</P>
<P>
The book also emphasizes that stronger, more effective
partnerships are the key to making science work for the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Governments, civil society, and the private sector around the
world must provide the means for mobilizing science and research
for sustainable food and agriculture," said Shah.
</P>
<P>
The CGIAR Systems Review was carried out in 1998 by an
independent panel that examined the directions and priorities of
the CGIAR System. The CGIAR, established in 1971, is an
association of 58 public and private sector members, supporting a
network of 16 international agricultural research centers.
</P>
<P>
CGIAR's mission is to contribute to food security and poverty
eradication in developing countries through research, partnership,
capacity building, and policy support promoting sustainable
agricultural development based on the environmentally sound
management of natural resources.

<P>
GAZA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Erez Checkpoint between Gaza
and Israel was extraordinarily crowded this morning as hundreds of
Palestinians awaited in their cars to pass through it and head for
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A great number of foreign reporters, policemen and military
personnel from the Israeli and Palestinian sides waited for the
historic moment when the safe passage, linking Gaza Strip to the
West Bank, would open.
</P>
<P>
At 10.30 a.m. a car with a red plate, reading F.2,386, arrived
at the check-point and became the first Palestinian who passed
through the safe passage.
</P>
<P>
Moussa Abu-Saada, the driver of the car and chief of Bani-Soha
municipality, said he was very happy to witness the opening of the
passage under the revised Wye accord. He expressed hope that all
the signed agreements will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
After Abu-Saada's car, a 50-seat bus, belonging to Palestine
Automotive Co., got into the check-point.
</P>
<P>
Bassam Mohammed, in charge of passenger transport between Gaza
and the West Bank, said that ten buses will travel between the two
areas daily, adding the revenues of the company will rise after
the event.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Fadhaer, a 24-year-old passenger, said he used to be
jobless in Gaza and hoped to find a work after opening the safe
passage.
</P>
<P>
Mo'taz Sherrir and his four friends embarked on the first bus
from Gaza to Hebron to play football with their friends in the
West Bank city on the occasion of opening the safe passage.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage between Erez Checkpoint and Tarkumiyah,
northwest Hebron is 44 kilometers long.
</P>
<P>
The situation along the passage was quiet and the Israeli
military did not show any sign of high alert for the event.
</P>
<P>
Marzouq, a Palestinian taxi driver, said he does not believe the
safe passage is unsafe for the Palestinian passengers.
</P>
<P>
He called his wife with his mobile phone to assure her of the
situation. He promised her to take her for a visit to Hebron on
Tuesday on the same road.
</P>
<P>
Marzouq was confident that the economic development in Gaza and
the West Bank will flourish due to the safe passage as the
commodity movement is no longer restricted within the two
areas. He expressed the belief that his income will grow too.
</P>
<P>
At midday, the first bus arrived safely in Tarkumiyah after a
two-hour journey in line with the schedule. Its passengers got
down in Hebron and were let in after the Israeli security men
checked their identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Before opening the passage, Palestinian Minister of Civil
Affairs Jamil Al-Tarif said it will be a "historic step" in the
process of the Palestinian interim self-rule and a "great
achievement" in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage will surely strengthen mutual trust between
the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, observers said, hoping that
it will lead to peace and development in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Interest Rates Rise in Treasury Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. interest rates on
short-term Treasury securities increased in Monday's auction to
the highest levels in more than 16 months.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department sold 10 billion dollars in three-month
bills at a discount rate of 4.995 percent, up from 4.990 percent
last week. It sold another 8 billion dollars in six-month bills at
a rate of 5.115 percent, up from 5.000 percent.
</P>
<P>
The three-month rate was the highest since June 15, 1998, when
the bills sold for 5.010 percent while the six-month rate was the
highest since June 22, 1998, when the rate was 5.120 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors -- 5.145 percent for three-month bills with a
10,000-dollar bill selling for 9,873.70 dollars and 5.338 percent
for a six-month bill selling for 9,741.40 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Federal Reserve said that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, picked up to 5.47
percent last week from 5.42 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Continues To Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer confidence
fell in October for the fourth straight month, the Conference
Board reported Tuesday, showing a successful effort by the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates to cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, the U.S. prominent business research
group, said its Consumer Confidence Index declined to 130.1, down
from the revised 134.2 in September. The index now dropped nearly
nine points from its peak of 139 in June.
</P>
<P>
"The leading economic numbers and stock market volatility are
sending mixed signals to consumers," says Lynn Franco, director of
the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "But consumers'
overall confidence in the current state of economy is higher than
it was a year ago, which generated better-than-expected holiday
spending."
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S.
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence was apparently affected by the higher
interest rates. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates
twice since June, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down to
10,019.71 on October 15 from the record closing high of 11,326.04
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in its report that a larger
proportion of consumers expect business conditions to become worse
in the next six months -- 7.6 percent versus 6.8 percent in
September.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the report said, 14.5 percent of consumers expect
fewer jobs to be available, up from 13.2 percent in the prior
survey. Income expectations also deteriorated, with 23.1 percent
of consumers anticipating an increase in their income, down from
26.8 percent in September, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence survey is based on a representative
sample of 5,000 American households. The index has a base of 100,
set in 1985.

BERLIN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- American Jim Courier rallied to
beat Marc Rosset on Tuesday and move into the second round of the
Eurocard Open in Stuttcart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The former world No. 1, who took a month off after the U.S.
Open to heal an injured ankle, won the match 4-6, 7-6(8-6), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Courier, now ranked No. 41, also paid tribute
to Payne Stewart, the golfer who died in an airplane accident
Monday and with whom Courier was acquainted. Stewart was on the U.
S. Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very saddened for the loss, not only for Payne's family,
but also for his agents and family. It's a tragedy when something
like that happens," Courier was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seventh-seeded Nicolas Kiefer had to quit when he twisted his
left ankle in the first set against Andrei Pavel in a second-round
match.
</P>
<P>
And Magnus Larsson dropped out with a back injury, allowing
fifth-seeded Greg Rusedski to advance to the third round.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer was serving for the set at 5-3 when he slipped on the
carpet surface. His ankle heavily taped, Kiefer played three more
games and lost them all before giving up.
</P>
<P>
He was taken to a hospital for a detailed examination. Kiefer
is one of the players trying to qualify for the season-ending ATP
Tour World Championship in Hanover next month that brings together
the top eight players of the year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Pete Sampras, Patrick Rafter and Carlos Moya, who
are injured, all other top ranked players are playing the

of how to provide water to the arid and semi-arid lands and how to
manage water resources for domestic use," Ngeny said in his
keynote address.
</P>
<P>
He said that most African people, especially those living in
the arid and semi-arid lands, spend most of their time searching
for water.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, water scarcity, pollution and
floodings will be "the most important challenge for the next
century".
</P>
<P>
The workshop is expected to contribute to African countries'
goal of providing sufficient clean water for the poor majority in
rural and urban areas, according to United Nations Environment
Program, the organizer of the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Economic Reforms Top in Kuwaiti Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Abdullah Al-Sabah said Tuesday that the government is
giving first priority to economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to "continue its comprehensive
economic and financial reforms," Saad told the 9th National
Assembly (parliament), which started its second regular term on
Tuesday after the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of years, especially after the oil prices in
the world market hit a decade low last year, the Kuwaiti
government has been planning to reform its oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
The 8th National Assembly was dissolved last May following an
unreconcilable rift with the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti cabinet passed a number of reform bills
aimed at diversifying state revenues, reducing government
spending and erasing budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Those bills have been presented to the new parliament after it
was elected early July.
</P>
<P>
Although most lawmakers agreed on the need to reform the
economy, many of them voiced objection to or reservation over the
details of the government-proposed reform package.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators even threatened to block the bills and put
forward their own versions.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Saad stressed the necessity of cooperation
between the government and parliament, adding that the government
will not attain its goals without constructive cooperation from
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti prime minister also listed national defense and
fighting against drugs and illegal arms as the government
priorities.

<HEADLINE> China's Laid-Offs Want Stable Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua)-- Stable social security is
something that laid-off workers in China want most, according to
the latest survey results released by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
Among 10,000 laid-off workers surveyed, some 73.2 percent said
they wanted their basic living requirements to be met when asked
what kind of help they needed most.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 83.4 percent were not willing to terminate the
existing labor contracts with their companies for fear of losing a
stable life.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there were 7.42 million laid-off workers
in China in the first half of this year, two million of which had
found jobs by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Another survey by the ministry shows that by yearend, China's
laid-off population will hover around seven million, partly
because of the still-sluggish global economy.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the ministry said that China is striving
to build its social security systems, composed of the basic living
standard system for the laid-offs, the old-age pension system, and
the minimum living standard system for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, some 79 million Chinese citizens had taken
part in the unemployment insurance system, which started in 1986,
according to the ministry.

aiming to offer full treatment to more drug-addicted prisoners,
according to a Government House press release.
</P>
<P>
The project also aims to improve the condition of prisons and

narcotics-relevant prisoners and 9,000 drug dealers-prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, three special institutions for drug addicts
and 21 jail training centers will be constructed, while a prisoner
data system will be set up and the Department of Corrections
Hospital Central Prison renovated.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Corrections would transfer some of its works
such as training and health protection to the private sector and
cooperate with private organizations on jail works system
development under government supervision.
</P>
<P>
The National Research Center was asked to study the complete
plan to solve drugs problem by setting up the drugs control
network.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Behavior Controlling would establish more
rehabilitation centers in order to allow the community and
religious institutions to share responsibility in curing drug
addicts.

</P>
<P>
China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd. planned to auction a large

books and containers of the world's oldest alcoholic beverage,
which was owned by imperial families.

Guan Liang, Lin Fengmian, Wu Zuoren, Pang Xunqin, Wu Guanzhong and
Chen Yifei, will be available for viewing by collectors.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers also aim to sell watercolor paintings, prints

</P>
<P>
Among the 212 Chinese paintings, Lotus and Ducks by Qi Baishi,
the Song of Spring and Stand Alone as Flowers Fall both by Xu
Beihong, and Red Mountains in Autumn by Li Keran all represent the
highest artistic level of Chinese painting masters.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the auction house, Chinese classical

</P>
<P>
An Album of Paintings by Chen Hongshou is expected to fetch up

dynasties.
</P>
<P>
One of the most unusual items to be auctioned is the set of

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Presents New State Budget to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister
Avraham Shochat presented on Tuesday the government's state budget
for the year 2000 to the Knesset (parliament) for its ratification.
</P>
<P>
The new budget, totalling 227.426 billion shekels (about
54.149 billion U.S. dollars), is scheduled to come up for the
first reading in the Knesset on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The budget calls for reduced unemployment benefits, higher
national health insurance premiums and national insurance payments
for the rich and more tax collection.
</P>
<P>
The budget estimates that the government will reap 3.6 percent
more in tax revenues in 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the government plans to increase
expenditure on infrastructure to 190.47 million dollars in 2000
from this year's 119 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Transfer payments, which include welfare and other benefits,
constitute 30.7 percent of the budget, debt servicing accounts for
28.8 percent, security 17.9 percent, civil expenditure 16.2
percent and investment 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget shortfall for 2000 is projected at 2.476 billion
dollars, which is slated to be made up from the sale of government
companies and banks, loans and capital to be raised abroad and
other loans from the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
The budget, if passes the first reading in the Knesset, may
have some changes before it goes through the second and third
readings later this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the coalition partner Shas has said it will not support
the budget in the Knesset unless its budget demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Shas demands additional millions of dollars for its school
education system, for which the Finance Ministry refuses to
give.

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Urged to Protect Ecotourism Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- With the alarming rate of
environmental destruction, the Philippine House Tourism Committee
on Tuesday called on local Filipinos to help protect ecotourism
environment.
</P>
<P>
Rosenda Ann Ocampo, chairman of the committee, said that
indigenous natives can be tapped to protect what remains of the
nation's natural forests, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ocampo noted that only 119,000 hectares of the country's
mangrove forest remain, and of the 43 rivers being monitored by
the government, about half are polluted, 40 of which are now
biologically dead.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that about 25 hectares of the country's forest
cover are being denuded every hour.
</P>
<P>
"The best way we could check these destruction is to recruit
the people themselves who have been the guardians of our
environment," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ocampo urged for consolidation of concerned policies to protect
indigenous people who are actively joining in the ecotourism
protection.
</P>
<P>
The policies should help lay down a tourism framework based on
a balanced economic growth and environmental protection as well,
she added.
</P>
<P>
"The wealth of our resources could be optimally utilized if
they are protected, but the primacy of the environment and the
culture of our people must be preserve," she stressed.

<P>
KUNMING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- No opium-poppy blossoms can be
found among the three-million flower basins at the massive
Horticulture-Expo garden in this capital city of southwest China's
Yunnan Province, which neighbors the notorious Golden Triangle
area straddling the borders of Laos, Burma and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
With 2,500 types of flowers and plants, the 218-ha garden in
the northeastern suburbs of Kunming, the provincial capital, has
attracted millions of domestic and overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
"The exposition is aimed to be unique in showing special
flowers," said Guo Guanggui, manager of a horticulture company
under the Yunnan Provincial Bureau of Horticulture Expositions.
</P>
<P>
The province has gone to great lengths to collect rare flower
varieties across the country and even purchased many from overseas,
Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Along the garden's 800-meter avenue, and in the 4,000-sq-m
grand greenhouse, rare and beautiful flowers such as the camellia,
lily, meconopsis, tulip, jacaranda and pansy can be seen
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
With richly-colored petals, the poppy is a pretty flower, Guo
said, but it isn't planted anywhere in the Kunming garden.
</P>
<P>
"Although we want visitors to the garden to be able to see all
kinds of beautiful flowers, how can we accept the poppy flower
which looks so simple but has evil fruit?" Guo questioned.

<P>
In fact, poppies now are not only prohibited in the garden, but
also in Yunnan, a region where for years hallucinogenic mushrooms
and opium poppies were grown to support a flourishing drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Li Hanbai, vice governor of the province, said that anti-drug
drive has always been an important task for his province and the
country as a whole. Now, opium-poppy planting is forbidden and
illegal drug-trafficking has been kept within limits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yunnan has invested 300 million yuan to carry out a
series of cooperation projects on growing economically-viable
plants in the Golden Triangle area, according to Li, who is also
head of the province's anti-drug office.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1.46-ha crops and latex trees have been planted in the
area, controlling the spread of opium-poppy planting.
</P>
<P>
Drug-related crimes were a serious problem in the province in
the 1980s, he said, adding that many young people became addicted
to narcotics in the decade.
</P>
<P>
But statistics show that the number of drug addicts dropped
from 57,000 in the early 1990s to 44,000 this year, down 22.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past nine years, Yunnan has dealt with thousands of
drug-related crimes, arrested more than 660,000 people and seized
over 38 tons of drugs, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Mashed Potatoes Rated New Brain Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Nutritionists have discovered
that mashed potatoes have the power to improve memory within
minutes of eating them, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new brain food seems to be most helpful for the elderly and
those with bad memories, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The worse a subject's memory, the more improvement there
seemed to be," leading researcher Randall Kaplan of the University
of Toronto was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In their latest study, Kaplan and his team found that memory
was significantly improved for 20 healthy elderly people within 15
minutes after they ate mashed potatoes or barley.
</P>
<P>
The effects could last for about an hour, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Early experiments have shown that animals injected with glucose
fared better at remembering locations of shelters. Humans who had
ingested a glucose drink also proved enhanced memory.
</P>
<P>
Kaplan explained that he chose mashed potatoes because of their
high glucose content and their easy form of quick digestion, which
ensures supply of glucose to the brain within 15 minutes.

</P>
<P>
A contingent from the UAE armed forces left here for France on
Tuesday to undergo training, the official WAM news agency

This was the second battle group the Gulf country has sent for
peace-keeping mission in the Yugoslav province. The first 1,200
soldiers are there patrolling a designated area together with
French forces.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is the only Arab country to take part in the NATO-led
KFOR. NATO and Russian forces were deployed there in June
following a two-month NATO-led air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The bombing campaign was launched on the excuse that the
Yugoslav government violated human rights by cracking down on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who sought independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Feeling sympathy for the ethnic Albanians, mostly Muslims, the
UAE supported the NATO bombing.

<HEADLINE> Freed Japanese Hostages Fly Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Four Japanese hostages, freed
Monday, were flown by a charter plane from Bishkek, capital of
Kyrgyzstan, to Tokyo Tuesday morning, reported Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese geologists are generally in good health although
each of them lost several kilograms. They need psychological and
moral adaptation after two months in captivity, said the Kyrgyz
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The geologists and their Kyrgyz translator were kidnapped as
hostages by militants infiltrating from Tajikistan in south
Kyrgyzstan on August 23, and later taken to Tajik territory.
</P>
<P>
A participant in the hostage-release operation told reporters
that the hostages were surrendered Monday morning in the Jergatal
district of Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The decisive stage of the talks that began Friday was very
difficult and was interrupted several times. Finally, with active
assistance from Tajik representatives, the militants
unconditionally surrendered the hostages to Kyrgyz and Tajik
special forces, he said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Urges Members to Quicken Steps toward Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) member states have been urged to reduce
their tariffs to zero by July next year to facilitate the creation
of a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 5th COMESA Meeting on Trade and Customs Tuesday
in Lusaka, Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said analysis clearly
shows that a free trade area will lead to increased trade,
increased investment and higher employment in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the whole world was looking to the
region to see if a free trade area would be attained by October
31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He assured the member states that the loss of revenue due to
tariff reduction would be insignificant and could be offset
through reform of the domestic tax system.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry
Minister David Mpamba said trade in agricultural products within
COMESA would not be balanced if some member states continued to
subsidize their products.
</P>
<P>
He said agriculture had potential to boost economic growth
within the region.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for countries in the region to
prepare themselves for the declining international support as the
new millennium draws nearer.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that it was only through the creation of a
free trade area that the region would withstand the pressures
resulting from the declining level of international support.
</P>
<P>
He also assured member states that the COMESA secretariat was
addressing the revenue loses that they would incur once the free
trade area was established next year with the help of the
International Monetary Fund.

ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of the

aid for Afghanistan for the years of 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The WFP Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation for
Afghanistan will provide 115,800 tons of food aid in 2000 and
86,050 tons in 2001, WFP Representative for Afghanistan Mike
Sackett said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Increasing internal displacement and 16 percent reduction in
the 1999 cereal harvest in Afghanistan will increase the
requirement for food aid in 2000, Sackett said.

<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 76 assorted firearms
and a large amount of prohibited drugs were seized from suspected
drug traffickers by police in the northern Philippines during the
last six months, Philippine News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Calinisan, Central Luzon regional director of the
Philippine National Police (PNP), was quoted as saying a total of
3,614 suspected drug pushers and users were arrested during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, more than 10 million pesos (250,000 U.S.
dollars) worth of illegal drugs were seized, adding that this was
the result of the police's intensified campaign against illegal
drugs, especially shabu or metamphetamine hydrochloride.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said Central Luzon police authorities were asking
the Central Luzon Rehabilitation Center, the biggest and modern
drug rehabilitation center in Pampanga province to decongest
various rehab centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of arrested shabu pushers and users resulted
in the overcrowding of jails in the region, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Urge Speedy Reform of United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday will call on
the United Nations to modernize some elements of its structure to
meet the challenges of the new century and to better help the
world's poor.
</P>
<P>
"We need to hurry up and really shake up the UN, so it can do a
more effective job in helping the poorest countries," British
International Development Secretary Clare Short told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
The secretary is scheduled on Tuesday to give a speech to the
United Nations dignitaries to sternly criticize the supra-national
organization, a BBC report said later.
</P>
<P>
Short will make clear that both in-fighting and excessive
bureaucracy could prevent the world organization from reaching its
aims and fulfilling its vision.
</P>
<P>
She would also call on the UN to place renewed focus and energy
on meeting the challenges of globalization, growing inequality and
conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
But Short will emphasize that the reform for the UN to face the
challenges will need a change in attitude not just from within the
UN itself but from the countries who make up its members as well,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> China to Correct CCF Cooperation Adopted by Unicom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official from
the Ministry of Information Industry today said that the "China-
China-foreign" form of cooperation adopted by the China United
Telecommunication Corporations (Unicom) violated relevant State
laws and regulations and should be corrected.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in August the ministry asked Unicom to terminate
this cooperation form, under which a Sino-overseas joint venture
enters into cooperation with Unicom, and that Unicom is doing so
through fair negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the practice will help to regulate the
styles of Sino-foreign cooperation, adding that China protects the
rights and interests of foreign investors and will do so in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's stand on this issue has been stated
clearly, and he hopes the parties involved in the contracts will
take a cooperative attitude to come to an agreement through fair
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side will deal with the issue properly under the
principle of "protecting the legal interests of investors as far
as possible," said the official, adding that the detailed measures
will be negotiated by Unicom and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He urged foreign investors to cooperate on the issue, saying, "
Any kind of delay will cause loss for themselves and they would
have less opportunity to enter China's telecommunication market
for regulatory cooperation in the future."
</P>
<P>
Unicom is China's second-largest telecom operator.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Iraq to Hold Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian-Iraqi Trade
Committee is scheduled to meet Saturday in the Iraqi capital
Baghdad, the head of Egypt's Trade Center in Baghdad said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Public Business Sector Mokhtar Khatab will
arrive in Baghdad Saturday to co-chair the meeting with Iraqi
Minister of Trade Mohammad Mehdi Salah, Auni Hashem told Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee will discuss ways of promoting the
bilateral economic and trade ties by further raising Egypt's
exports to Iraq under the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food program, Hashem
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the program in December 1996, Egypt
has exported some 600 million U.S. dollars worth of goods to Iraq,
making it the largest exporter to Iraq among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deal allows Iraq, which has been under U.N. trade
sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to export a
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
The committee is also to examine the obstacles to bilateral
trade, including the high expenses for land and maritime
transport, Hashem said.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Khatab will also meet with Iraqi
officials to discuss other issues of mutual interest, and attend
the opening ceremony of the Baghdad International Fair on November
1, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two Egyptian companies, representing the food, medical,
electronic and engineering sectors, will take part in the fair,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Khatab will be accompanied by a group of businessmen, who will
discuss with their Iraqi counterparts the establishment of joint
ventures in Iraq, Hashem said.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Peacekeeping Costs Nigeria Eight Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has spent some 8 billion
U.S. dollars on peacekeeping operations in Liberia, President
Olusegun Obasanjo said Monday in the country's capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of figures have been given as Nigeria's peacekeeping
expenditure in that country but I think the figure is about 8
billion dollars," the president said at an official reception for
the last batch of Nigerian troops withdrawn from Liberia, reported
the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The troops, with about 60 members, returned at the weekend and
were met at the Abuja airport by Deputy Defense Minister Dupe
Solaja.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo noted that in addition to the expenditure, some 500
Nigerian soldiers lost their lives during the conflict while
"hundreds of others were injured, some maimed for life."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria provided the bulk of the regional intervention force,
ECOMOG, dispatched to end the seven-year civil war breaking out in
Liberia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
At its peak, some 15,000 troops, 12,000 of them from Nigeria
were deployed in that country.
</P>
<P>
After the installation of President Charles Taylor two years
ago, most of the troops were re-deployed to neighboring Sierra
Leone to help the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah fight
a rebel insurgency.

<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Land and
Resources, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China
Association for Science and Technology held a meeting here today
marking the 110th Anniversary of the birthday of Li Siguang,
founder of China's modern geology research and a pioneer of
geological studies in new China.
</P>
<P>
Presentation of the Sixth Li Siguang Geological Science Awards
and a publication ceremony for "The Geology of China (Expanded
Edition)" which was first written by Li, were part of the event.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji extended congratulations to the award
winners and the publication of the book.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the study of geology, a basic science, should
always be strengthened. He urged the geologists across the country
to carry on Li's work ethic and innovative spirit, and make new
contributions to the socialist modernization cause.
</P>
<P>
To learn from Li is to carry forward his spirit of scientific
innovation, said Vice-premier Wen Jiabao at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
He said that such an attitude will help promote scientific
development in today's China and make the country a more powerful
international competitor.
</P>
<P>
Li has set a good example for Chinese scientists, Wen said,
adding that Li is one of the Chinese geologists who did the most
field experimentation and prospecting.
</P>
<P>
Wen presented the Sixth Li Siguang Geological Science Awards to
17 geologists. Some 83 geologists have won the award since it was
established in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The Geology of China" was published in Britain in 1939,
introducing to the west for the first time the geological
formations in China. It has been published in several languages
including English, Russian and Chinese.

<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China's National Tourism
Administration (NTA) today announced the theme of next year's
tourism campaign will be "China New Millennium" and unveiled a
package of tourist activities for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wenzhen, director of NTA's Marketing and Communications
Department, said at a press conference here that China New
Millennium will be inaugurated with celebrations in Beijing and
ten other cities nationwide starting on the evening of December 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The ten cities include Shanghai in east China, Sanya in
southernmost Hainan Province, Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan
Province, Zhengzhou in central Henan Province, Harbin in
northeastern Heilongjiang Province and Urumqi in northwestern
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
An "Altar to the Century" will be erected in Beijing to serve
as the central site for the celebrations, which will last through
January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
China New Millennium activities will focus on the country's
World Heritage sites, Yang said. To date, 21 scenic spots in China
have been named to the World Heritage list by UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
Various tourist activities organized by provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions also make up an important
part of China New Millennium, including the Ice and Snow Festival

</P>
<P>
NTA Deputy Director Zhang Xiqin said that calling next year
China New Millennium is an important step for promoting the
country's tourism industry in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China has attached a theme to each year's tourism
events -- a strategy which has boosted the rapid growth of the
country's tourism. A steady increase of overseas tourists has been
reported this year.
</P>
<P>
NTA statistics indicate that by the end of September, more than
53 million overseas tourists had visited China, up 14.6 percent
over the same period last year, from which China earned 103
million U.S. dollars, up 11.82 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here Tuesday morning on a state visit to Portugal at the
invitation of Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio.
</P>
<P>
This is Jiang's first state visit to the country. In 1993,
Jiang stopped over and visited the country on his way back from a
foreign visit.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement delivered at the airport, Jiang said
that China has attached great importance to its relationship with
Portugal, which has enjoyed smooth development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the
two countries have been deepened constantly, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president pointed out that the two governments have
also maintained good cooperation on the issue of Macao's return to
China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "China is willing to make continued efforts,
together with the Portuguese government and people, to further
consolidate the long-term and stable bilateral relationship of
friendly cooperation oriented toward the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he is looking forward to exchanging views with
Portuguese leaders on developing bilateral relationship and issues
of common concern, and that he expected wide contacts with people
from all sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president believes that his visit will further

DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh

place in the country, she said.
</P>
<P>

that her government welcomes more banks in the country as this
would create healthy competition and ensure better service and
generate a bigger push to the national economy.

The prime minister noted that her government attaches highest
importance to the development of banks in the private sector for
the expansion and development of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> China Needs A High-Caliber Judge Team: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today that a high-caliber team of judges needs to be formed if
fairness in the judiciary is to become a widespread reality.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, member of the political bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee and secretary of the
Central Political Science and Law Committee, made the remark while
addressing 166 presidents of China's Intermediate People's Courts
who are currently enrolled in professional training courses in
Beijing.

<P>
Within the next three years, China plans to provide training
courses to judges at the deputy-presiding level at its
Intermediate People's Courts or above, in an effort to improve the
professional capabilities of the country's judges.
</P>
<P>
Luo pointed out that people's courts at all levels should work
to safeguard judicial fairness, which is at the heart of the
socialist democratic and legal system and vital for the country's
reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that people's courts across China should firmly
oppose and fight against local self-interest.

<HEADLINE> China Cracking Down on Illegal Fishing Along Yangtze River (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A joint action to crack down on
illegal fishing activities involving electric shock devices,
explosives and poisoning along the Yangtze River is well underway.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Fishery Bureau under the Ministry of
Agriculture (MA), the enforcement activity includes fishery and
public security departments of seven provinces and two
municipalities along the longest river of China, including Jiangsu,
Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze, rich in aquatic resources, is home to many
endangered aquatic animals and fish, and its freshwater fishing
output accounts for 60 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, rampant illegal fishing has diminished the
aquatic resources and damaged the ecological environment along the
river, with some species of fish on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhengguo, director of the Office of the Yangtze River
Fishery Resources under MA, said that of all illegal fishing
activities, fishing with electric devices is the most destructive.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the electric prod touched, fish, big or small, are
doomed, and even if some survive, they basically lose their
reproductive ability," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Become Important Helicopter Market: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China will become one of the
world's most important helicopter markets in the 21st century,
experts attending an international seminar said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a report released at the "99 China International Seminar on
Helicopters", French 'copter developer Eurocoptor said that Asia
is currently the fastest-growing helicopter market in the world,
and China's market is becoming the envy of the world's major
helicopter manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Chi Yaozong, deputy manager of China Aviation Industry
Cooperation II said China's large population, vast area,
complicated landforms and inconvenient transportation routes in
some areas make it a potential haven for 'copter makers.
</P>
<P>
China will work with foreign countries to develop and
manufacture helicopters because its technology doesn't meet world
levels, Chi added.
</P>
<P>
With their unique function, helicopters will play an
irreplaceable role in China's oil exploration, geology, tourism,
emergency rescue, news reporting, security, administration and air
defense, experts here noted.
</P>
<P>
Attending today's seminar were the world's major helicopter
manufacturers including U.S. Bell Aircraft Corporation, Boeing
Corporation, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, France's Eurocopter
and Italy's Augusta Corporation.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of China Aviation Industry Cooperation Wang
Jianqiu said that China plans to research and develop a wider
range of projects together with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The experts attending the seminar here also called on the
Chinese government to make and enforce relevant aviation laws and
regulations to push forward the country's helicopter industry.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Cambodia Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in
Cambodia declined sharply in the first nine months of 1999, down
from 796 million U.S. dollars during the same period of 1998 to
240 million dollars, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that the Cambodian Investment Board of the
Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) approved 66 projects
worth 240 million dollars from January to September this year,
compared with 120 projects worth 796 million dollars in the same
period last year, the Cambodia Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of this year, only 15 proposed projects
worth 60 million dollars were approved, while 45 projects worth
369.3 million dollars were approved during the same period of
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to economic analysts and CDC officials, the decreases
were due to several factors, including poor infrastructure, high
cost of transportation, frequent crimes and unclear land tenure,
as well as the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that wood processing, tourism and agriculture
were the sectors suffering sharp drops in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Proposed investment in wood processing is down from 179 million
dollars in the whole of 1998 to only 14 million dollars so far
this year. Hotel investment projects have declined from 106
million dollars in 1998 to 25 million dollars in the first nine
months of this year. Proposed investments in agriculture have
dropped from 41 million dollars in 1998 to roughly 5 million
dollars in the first nine months this year.
</P>
<P>
About half of this year's approved projects so far are in the
garment sector, accounting for 89 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that investments from Asia and the
Pacific region, especially from the ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries, drastically declined. In all
of 1998, ASEAN countries pledged 187 million dollars in capital
investment while so far this year the total is only 32 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Religious Believers Enjoy Freedom In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- In front of a holy cross in a
Christian church, with seven candles flickering below the portrait
of a just-deceased member, more than 20 men and women, young and
old, are singing hymns led by a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
The scene is a memorial service at the Shanghai Community
Church in southwestern Shanghai, China's leading industrial and
commercial city, where religious believers of all faiths are free
to worship as they choose.
</P>
<P>
Later, in his office, the 71-year-old minister Shi Qigui showed
Xinhua a hymn he wrote in celebration of the 20th anniversary of
religious activities in churches in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
While playing a tape-recording of the song, Shi said that 4,000
of the 150,000 Christians in the city offered prayers of thanks
for the event during a service last month at the downtown Huangpu
Stadium. A choir of 600 people sang Shi's composition.
</P>
<P>
Outside his office, a young couple was waiting to discuss their
wedding plans at the 74-year-old church.
</P>
<P>
About five km north of the church is the Jade Buddha Temple,
where long queues of pilgrims and tourists of all nationalities
filled the temple halls hazy with smoke from incense, while monks
performed ritual tasks.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year-old temple, well-known for its two jade statues of
Buddha, hosts more than 1.5 million visitors annually, one-third
of whom come from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Jue Xing, not yet 30 and the temple's abbot, is one of the 600
graduates of the Shanghai Institute of Buddhist Studies.
</P>
<P>
"People normally became monks or nuns to extricate themselves
from starvation before New China was founded in 1949," said the
abbot, who is also vice-president of the Shanghai Buddhist
Association. "But we young people turn to Buddhism because of our
real belief."
</P>
<P>
He said that his temple has opened its library to the public
and holds a Buddhist service once a week, and that plans are
underway to set up an internal computer network.
</P>
<P>
Changes have also been taking place at St. Ignatius' Church,
the largest Catholic church in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
A square was built in front of the church over the past two
years, and construction of an 11-story building is near completion.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ai Zu Zhang, deputy bishop of the Shanghai Catholic
parish, said that the expansion aims to prepare the church for the
new millennium.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Hungarian Former PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here
today with Horn Gyula, former prime minister of Hungary and former
chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP).
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Hungary enjoy a long-term friendship and
bilateral relations in politics, economy, science, technology,
military and culture have witnessed steady development in recent
years, despite the drastic changes in their domestic and
international situation.
</P>
<P>
The close contact between the leaders of the two countries has
advanced Sino-Hungarian ties, Li said. He said that China attaches
importance to its relations with Hungary and respects the decision
of the Hungarian people for their development path, as well as
their domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed appreciation for Hungary's adherence to its policy
for friendship with China. He expressed hope that the two
countries would make joint efforts to advance their friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC), spoke highly of the contributions made by the HSP to the
growth of Sino-Hungarian relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reason why the CPC has actively conducted
international exchanges is to strive for a peaceful international
environment for China's modernization drive and contribute to
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The continued growth of the friendly cooperation between the
CPC and HSP on the basis of independence, equality, mutual respect
and non-interference in each other's internal affairs conforms to
the interests of the two countries and their people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the two parties to further advance
bilateral relations under the current complicated international
situation so as to make new contributions to the development of
the two countries' relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Horn said that the international community has closely followed
the reform and opening up in China and has given much credit to
China's rapid development.
</P>
<P>
China's experience is worth studying and learning from, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Hungary appreciates China's choice to respect different nations
for their development path, Horn said, adding he hopes that

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asks India to Adopt Clean Development Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
asked India to adopt a target for reducing green house gas
emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and take up the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) as a tool for addressing issues of
climate change.
</P>
<P>
India would benefit financially from assuming a target under
the protocol because only parties with emissions target could take
advantage of all the benefits under the protocol flexibility
mechanisms, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CDM would mean flow of new investments and transfer of clean
technology to India, which has the investment potential of more
than 1 billion U.S. dollars every year, said Richardson, who
arrived here on Monday to make preparations for a planned visit to
New Delhi by President Bill Clinton early next year.
</P>
<P>
CDM is a provision in the Kyoto Protocol that offers a way to
buy cleaner but more expensive advanced technology instead of
cheaper but dirtier technology.
</P>
<P>
Richardson told a seminar on climate change sponsored by the
Confederation of India Industry that CDM is a win-win situation
for both the United States and India as any further delay in
reducing the greenhouse gases would alter the climate and the
damage might never be undone.
</P>
<P>
"There are opportunities for cooperation in the area of clean
energy development," the U.S. official said, adding that U.S.
companies could deliver investment capital to fuel economic growth
in the South Asian country and offer managerial and technical
expertise to their Indian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Richardson urged India to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and exercise restraint on its
missile program to ensure peace in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in India's interest to live in a neighborhood
bristling with nuclear arsenals," Richardson said in his address
at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
He urged India to stop production of fissile material and join
the United States and other countries to immediately negotiate a
global fissile material cutoff treaty and exercise control on
fissile material export.
</P>
<P>
Richardson hinted at an early end to economic sanctions imposed
on India following its nuclear tests in May last year, saying,
"Our hope is that President Bill Clinton will have the authority
to end the certification very soon."
</P>
<P>
Stating that Clinton is likely to visit India in the first
quarter of next year, he said the U.S. administration is "very
pleased" that the new government in India has unilaterally
fulfilled its commitment to maintain a moratorium on nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Richardson will deliver a "letter of
friendship" from President Clinton to Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee congratulating him on his victory in the election last
month.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Govt Team to Attend U.N. Human Rights Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Home Affairs
David Lan will lead a 10-member delegation to a United Nations
hearing on Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's (HKSAR) human
rights report in Geneva, Switzerland on November 1.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which is
the treaty monitoring body of the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR), will examine the first human rights
report compiled by the HKSAR Government under the covenant
covering the first year after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"Although China, our sovereign state, has yet to ratify the
ICCPR, the Central People's government has made special
arrangement for the HKSAR to submit the report to the treaty
monitoring body and to attend this hearing. This indicates that
the 'one country, two systems' principle is being implemented
successfully," Lan noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are very delighted to have this opportunity to answer
directly and openly the questions that will be put forward by the
Human Rights Committee. Moreover, we will update the committee on
the latest developments with regard to the human rights situation
in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A number of non-governmental organizations are expected to be
present at the hearing. Their attendance is highly welcomed as
this is exactly how the reporting system works," he said. "I
believe the NGOs have an important role to play in the process as
the Committee will be presented with a wide range of views and
perspectives."
</P>
<P>
The ICCPR report was compiled by the HKSAR government. Prior to
its drafting, the HKSAR government carried out wide public
consultation on its outline.

<HEADLINE> Khatami's Trip to France "Turning Point": FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Tuesday that the groundbreaking visit of
President Mohammad Khatami to France is a "turning point" in
Tehran-Paris relations.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's visit to France, to start on Wednesday, is the first
one by an Iranian head of state since the victory of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the state-run Tehran radio, Kharrazi said Khatami
will be received in Paris with the highest level of protocol and
with respect to all Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the visit itself will be a message to Iran,
France, the European Union and other regions that Iran enjoys an
important position in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's visit to Paris had been set in April at the
invitation of his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, but was
delayed due to differences between on some protocol issues,
particularly the issue of champagne on banquets as the French
tradition demands.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the two countries reached a deal to
arrange Khatami's visit at the time of the general conference of
the United Nation Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization in Paris and Chirac would also cancel a formal
banquet for Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials said that Khatami's visit would be
an official and formal one with respect to all Islamic values
following mutual agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the visit would be a venue for the two sides
to exchange views on different issues.
</P>
<P>
It is natural that the two sides will have some differences on
certain issues, and it is natural for the two sides to express
their views without interfering in the other's internal affairs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
But the European countries, France included, have expressed
concern over Iran's stance on such issues as international
terrorism, the Middle East peace process and weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said recently that
French leaders would talk with Khatami on the issue of the arrest
of 13 Iranian Jews on charge of spying for Israel, which Iran
termed as an "internal affair."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities have been urged by the Western
countries to release these Iranian Jews, after the U.S. and Israel
denied any intelligence link with them.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that Khatami would focus talks with French
leaders on Iran's economic cooperation with France and the
European Union as well as dialog among civilizations, a famous
proposal made by Khatami soon after he took office two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Repeats U.S. Commitment to Israeli Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen on Tuesday reiterated U.S. commitment to
Israel's security, saying the Clinton Administration is working to
get Congress approval of a 1.2-billion-U.S.-dollar aid package to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I pledged to the prime minister, to the people of Israel, that
the U.S. is absolutely committed to Israel's defense and
security," Cohen said at a joint news conference with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak after their talks.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is on a one-day brief visit to Israel, the last stop of
his nine-nation tour to the Middle East. He discussed with Barak
the Middle East peace process and the threats that the region is
facing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely convinced that a strong and secured Israel
is one pillar in the U.S. policy in the region," he said. "That
will allow Israel to take necessary steps in the peace process,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
A just, comprehensive and enduring peace between Israel and
all its neighbors is critical to the long-term security in the
region, and thus fundamental to U.S. security interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen welcomed the "concrete steps" Barak has taken to revive
the stalled peace process, referring to the latest
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed in Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt early last month.
</P>
<P>
He said the renewed spirit of partnership in the peace process
has brought strong hope that a comprehensive peace could be made
on all its tracks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is "fully committed" to the 1.2-
billion-dollar aid package he promised to Israel for the funding
of the implementation of the Wye agreement which was signed last
October.
</P>
<P>
The administration is working with Congress to get the aid
package approved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed a foreign aid bill worth 12.6 billion dollars
early last week because it did not include the 1.9-billion-dollar
aid he promised to Israel, the Palestinians and Jordan as part of
the Wye deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, Israel would receive 1.2 billion dollars as
compensation for its troop redeployment in the West Bank. The
Palestinian National Authority would receive 400 million dollars
in economic assistance, and Jordan 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Barak called the aid essential to the
implementation of the Wye peace accord since Israel would have to
move some military bases when transferring lands to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived here late Monday night from Jordan. He had also
visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Kuwait and Oman.

</P>
<P>
In the race on October 17, Hakkinen finished third, behind

deflectors.

<HEADLINE> India, US Sign Declaration on Energy Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
signed a joint declaration on energy cooperation here Tuesday with
Washington stressing its desire to "re-engage" with New Delhi on
issues of international security, terrorism and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who arrived here Monday
to make preparations for a planned visit to India by President
Bill Clinton early next year, told the press that his country is
keen about scientific cooperation with India in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, signed by Richardson and Indian Minister of
External Affairs Jaswant Singh, envisages cooperation in
conventional energy projects, renewable energy, clean coal
technology, energy efficiency and related environmental aspects.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. official was non-committal on bilateral
cooperation in the use of nuclear energy for civilian purposes,
saying that is something for future discussions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also recognize that the future development of the
energy sector must take into account the growing demand for energy
and the importance of judicious utilization of limited resources
in the most efficient and equitable manner, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, the two countries would cooperate
in research and development of climate-friendly energy sources and
technology for balanced and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua)-- The People's Bank of China will
expand the supply of currency and loans to support the reform of
state-owned enterprises, which are in urgent need of a modern
management system, the bank's president Dai Xianglong said
recently.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will also buy bonds held by commercial banks
so as to enlarge the circulation of currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank will also increase loans to
commercial banks, particularly those medium and small-sized
financial institutions, to promote the development of small
businesses and private economy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will speed up the pace of reform of commercial
banks and lend greater support to the newly-established four asset
management companies, which specialize in managing bad debts of
state-owned commercial banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the central bank will also improve means of
settlement to ensure the speedy flow of corporate funds. Meanwhile,
the bank will hasten a review of trust and investment companies
and regroup them more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the central bank will support state-
owned enterprises' direct effort in raising funds so as to lower
their debt ratio against their assets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank is drafting regulations to allow
securities companies to raise funds from commercial banks through
mortgaging with their shares, and to issue short-term loans to
raise funds.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Aidid In Ethiopia for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Somali warlord, Hussein
Aideed, leader of the one of the main factions in the Horn of
Africa country, held secret talks with Ethiopian officials in the
Ethiopian capital late last week, informed sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government urged the faction leader to end his
collaboration with Eritrea and other Ethiopian enemies who are
using Aideed controled Somali areas as the springboard against
Ethiopia, the sources said
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Amharic weekly Reporter,
Aideed made his visit after his military campaign against Ethiopia
by supporting the Oromo Liberation Front, and the AI-Ittihad in
exchange of receiving arms from Eritrea ended in defeat.
</P>
<P>
Aideed was trying to figure out what his future would be since
he has lost his footing in his party and his clan.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting what it called reliable sources, said
that Aideed has been given conditions to stop collaborating with
Ethiopian enemies.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia also told Aidid to participate in the effort to bring
about a sustainable peace in Somalia just as one faction leader
and not to present himself as a president of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has been authorized to restore peace in Somalia by
the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Libya had persuaded Aidid to talk with
Ethiopia and search for safety assurances.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Aidid at first was reluctant to come to
Ethiopia because of the humiliation of his defeat.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Aidid had threatened to destabilize Ethiopia
which he described as "the most fragile country in the region on
which he can wreak havoc at will.
</P>
<P>
Also in July, Aidid went to Tripoli to discuss "a wide range of
matter" with Ethiopia. This was after Colonel Abdullah Irad,
AL-Ittihad senior official, was shot dead in a part of Mogadishu
controlled by Aidid.
</P>
<P>
It has also been reported that Osman Atto and Omar Hajji, both
leaders of another faction in Somalia, are holding discussions
with Ethiopian officials. No details of the meeting were revealed.

</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian National Steel Company and Italian Danieli
Company Monday signed an agreement on a joint project to produce
wide-steel sheets, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
With a capital investment of 232 million U.S. dollars, the two
companies will spend 36 months to build a unit with an annual
production capacity of 1.05 million tons at Iran's Khuzestan Steel
Complex, southwestern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Over 85 percent of the investment will be financed by an
Italian institution and covered by the Italian State Insurance
Company (SACE), IRNA said without mentioning the other 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The repayment is to begin 24 months after the contract's
ratification and will be based on a 10-year term and be paid
biennially through sale of the project's output.
</P>
<P>
The output includes sheets with a thickness of 5-150
millimeters, width of 1.1-4.5 meters and length of 2.5-24 meters
used in manufacturing oil and gas pipelines, high pressurized
steam tanks and ship, the agency said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the FIFA Inspection
Team Alan Rothenberg said that England had an excellent bid for
the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"England has excellent bid," the American told a press
conference Tuesday morning. "We have spent five days in England
and the tour had been very impressive."
</P>
<P>
However, the inspection team, who arrived in England last
Thursday after a five-day tour in Germany, did not give English
bidders any hint that they have any advantage against their
European rival.
</P>
<P>
"Each of Germany and England is excellent," said Rothenborg. "
We are no decision makers, it is up to the FIFA executive board to
vote for the final winner. Our job is to make the report not the
decision."
</P>
<P>
England's 2006 World Cup Campaign, led by Alec MacGivan, have
spared no efforts to entertain the FIFA inspection members, who
enjoyed a grand tour in England, in which they visited football
stadiums, met government officials and royal members, soccers fans,
watched a premier league match, wined and dined in fabulous
dinners.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident for our bid, " said McGiven. "We have real
chance of success."
</P>
<P>
England is competing with Germany, South Africa and Morocco for
the right to host the event in seven years' time.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's 24-member executive committee will base their nomination
of the host country of the 2006 championships on the Rothenberg
committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
A decision is due a week after the Euro 2000 championship final
next July.

LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- World soccer legend Sir Bobby
Charlton hopes Manchester United to play in the English F.A. Cup
this season.
</P>
<P>
Charlton, one of United's greatest players and now a club
director, said on Tuesday he would be speaking to fellow board
members ahead of an F.A. deadline next Monday for United to make
up their minds.
</P>
<P>
Charlton told BBC Radio 5: "We have a responsibiity to the
history of the game."
</P>
<P>
He indicated he would like United to play in both the F.A.Cup
and next January's inaugural world club championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In July, Charlton described the new tournament as "a unique
opportunity that the club would be foolish to miss".
</P>
<P>
But he also expressed his sadness that United were unlikely to
defend the trophy they won last season as part of a unique treble.
</P>
<P>
United accepted in principle an invitation to play in the club
championship in June. The English F.A. offered them an exemption
from the domestic competition because of the club's congested
fixture list.

<HEADLINE> ILO Sees Infrastructure as Resource for Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Infrastructure in developing
countries in Asia and the Pacific constitutes a vast resource for
jobs, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Regional Office
for Asia and the Pacific said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As a resource for jobs, infrastructure is relatively untapped,
ILO Regional Director Mitsuko Horiuchi said to engineers and
development planners from 10 countries who gathered here for a
two-day ILO workshop.
</P>
<P>
Horiuchi pointed out that the ILO's programs had created 3
million workdays of employment for Cambodians while helping them
rebuild war-torn infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The organization is also planning for training East Timorese to
take up the many jobs to be offered in the building sector as the
violence in the territory has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The director also promoted the ILO's idea of labor-based
technology, saying it offered "much more than a temporary fix."
</P>
<P>
"Wherever unemployment challenges are great and the cost of
labor relatively low, labor-based work methods should be the
technology of choice," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, she said, the adoption of labor-based technology
in onging government programs would create 1.2 million new jobs
for no more than it would cost to continue using equipment-based
methods.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the workshop, many of the directors of public
works agencies, are seeking to achieve the right balance between
labor and technology in order to create sustainable employment in
the infrastructure sector in their countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consul General Urges Stronger Partnership With HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States has given
its support for Hong Kong's continued economic success over the
years, and it is looking forward to advancing that strong
partnership, U.S. Consul General for Hong Kong and Macao Michael
Klosson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a welcoming luncheon sponsored by the American Chamber of
Commerce, Klosson said what happens in Hong Kong matters very much
to the United States because of the "extensive ties" between
people in the two places, their shared attachment to universal
values and their common interests.
</P>
<P>
This was Klosson's first public speech since he took up his
post as U.S. Counsul General for Hong Kong and Macao in August.
</P>
<P>
"So we will be partners in Hong Kong's quest in the next
century to become an even greater international city," said
Klosson, also a career Foreign Service officer with 24 years of
experience in East Asia, Europe and senior State Department
positions.
</P>
<P>
Klosson, who came to Hong Kong in 1971 as a young professor,
said that 27 years later when he returned to Hong Kong, what
struck him the most is "how much the very nature of Hong Kong
itself is expressed by the idea of change."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has always been a work in progress," he said, adding
that what's different now is that it's up to the Hong Kong people
and their government, within the framework of the Basic Law, to
shape their own future in most areas.
</P>
<P>
One of the things that has changed dramatically since he last
lived in HK is the economy, Klosson said.
</P>
<P>
He said that when he left HK in 1972, HK was a city dominated
by low-cost manufacturing, where hard work and cheap labor gave HK
a competitive edge. But now, he returned to a city dominated by
property, banking, retail and other services, where sophistication
and expertise provide the edge in a high-cost environment.
</P>
<P>
Judging from what he has read and seen in the past two months,
Klosson said he has found that Hong Kong is now seeking to chart
its future through the portals of the knowledge-based economy of
bits and bytes.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with a more sophisticated economy, higher education
opportunities in HK has expanded, Klosson said. The number of HK
students going on to college or university has risen from less
than two percent to 18 percent. "This is a major change," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the

delegation of former Thai ambassadors to China here this afternoon.
</P>

24 years ago. He said he appreciates the contribution made by the
former ambassadors to the friendly cooperation between the two

</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes that bilateral cooperative relations will be
furthered with the joint efforts of both sides.
</P>

Thailand's first Ambassador to China, noted China's enormous
achievements over the past several years. He said that he would

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the concept of "One Country, Two Systems," Klosson said
China has kept the basic promises it made to respect Hong Kong's
high degree of autonomy. That means that Hong Kong's future, for
the first time in its history, is largely in its own hands.
</P>
<P>
"Patterns are being set right now, precedents are being
established that will have repercussions far into the future,
including on the perceptions of the international community," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the "One Country, Two Systems" idea has never been
tried before, Klosson considered the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region as a pioneering endeavor.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized economic openness, saying it has kept Hong Kong
competitive with other cities that have lower costs or other
advantages. "This openness has allowed Hong Kong to change over
the years, and it will enable Hong Kong to adapt to the challenges
of the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Klosson welcomed recent steps by the HK SAR government toward
introducing increased openness, transparency and competition in
various service sectors, such as telecommunications, and look
forward to progress elsewhere, such as banking and air services.
</P>
<P>
"Government has an important role to play in fostering this
openness, and Hong Kong, like other developed economies, must
continue to ensure that its financial markets are well regulated,
and that its goods and services markets are truly open and
competitive, " Klosson said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has a very broad agenda of engagement and
cooperation with Hong Kong that embraces trade and investment,
international economic policy and law enforcement cooperation,
Klosson said.
</P>
<P>
Two priority areas of potential cooperation between the U.S.
and HK are environmental protection and air services, Klosson
concluded.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Emphasizes on Combating Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Home Minister Purna
Bahadur Khadka emphasized the need for combined effort and
coordination among countries to resolve the problem of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of a three-day SAARC (South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) level workshop for
drug control here Tuesday, Khadka said the problem is of immense
concern not only to individual countries but also to the region
and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are over 6 million drug addicts in
the SAARC region and the majority among them are youths, he said,
adding that specific ways have to be found out in time to get rid
of this dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
Khadka noted that as various countries are involved in the
production, sale and consumption of narcotic drugs, regional
network should be established to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
SAARC secretary general Nihal Rodgrigo said on the occasion
that as narcotic drugs have a negative financial, social and
political impact, ways of resolving the problem must be found and
that the SAARC organization has also laid emphasis on combating
narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight people from governmental and non-governmental
organizations of the SAARC countries are attending the workshop
which will be held from October 26 to 28.
</P>
<P>
SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and the Maldives.

<HEADLINE> Australian Consumer Watchdog to Probe Olympic Ticketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (ACCC) Tuesday said it would investigate
whether Sydney Olympic organisers may have misled or deceived the
Australian public over the Games' ticket offer.
</P>
<P>
The ACCC inquiry came amid public outcry over the revelation
that only a third of Olympic tickets were available to the general
public, despite organisers' promises every Australian would have
an "equal chance" of getting tickets.
</P>
<P>
For some high demand sessions, public availability dropped
further as the best tickets were allocated to the rich or to those
with connections to the Olympic "family".
</P>
<P>
The ACCC inquiry will investigate whether the Sydney Olympic
Organising Committee (SOCOG) contravened Trade Practices Act
sections dealing with misleading and deceptive business.
</P>
<P>
"There have been seemingly poor and deceptive marketing
practices, quite possibly in breach of the Trade Practices Act,"
ACCC chairman Professor Fels said.
</P>
<P>
"The public should have been kept fully informed at all stages
of the true facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
While the ACCC had the power to issue fines of up to 200,000
Australian dollars (132,000 U.S. dollars), Fels said SOCOG's
behaviour was not fraudulent or criminal and it was seeking
solutions, including refunds, rather than penalties.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics Minister, Michael Knight, welcomed the
investigation and said he was confident it would clear up any
concerns Professor Fels had.
</P>
<P>
"SOCOG has informed the ACCC that it will be cooperating fully
with their inquiry and will expect to have a good result at the
end of that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Plan Video Evidence to Defend Vieira </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal's Patrick Vieira will go
into the dock over his spitting shame less than 24 hours after he
faces Fiorentina in the Gunners' make-or-break bid to qualify for
the second round phase of the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association have confirmed Thursday at the Watford
Hilton hotel as the date of his personal hearing to answer two
counts of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
It follows his sending off at West Ham on October 3 - after he
was accused of spitting at Hammers defender Neil Ruddock - and
then tangling with a police officer in the players' tunnel when
leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
The FA studied video evidence to level the spitting charge and
also received a police report in which Vieira was said to have
clashed with an on-duty officer when storming back to the Upton
Park dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
But Arsenal are ready to present their own video evidence to a
three-man FA disciplinary commission which they believe will show
the player was subjected to continued provocation throughout the
match.
</P>
<P>
Vieira, 23, who has already been sent off four times in his
Arsenal career, has already admitted the spitting offence and has
made a public apology.
</P>
<P>
He served an automatic one-match suspension for his latest
dismissal - for two yellow cards at West Ham - by missing Saturday
's 3-2 Premiership win at Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
But he fears an extended suspension and heavy fine if found
guilty at the hearing on Thursday.

should make the most of the opportunities, and protect themselves
as well.

cooperation of the parliaments between the two countries, and the
Chinese NPC is ready to strengthen cooperation with the Namibian
Parliament, and contributes to the bilateral friendly cooperation.

existing friendship between the two countries and parliaments.

<P>
He spoke highly of China's achievements in developing its
economy and helping people out of poverty, and said that the
policies the Chinese government is following conforms to the
situation and Chinese people's interests.
</P>
<P>
Namibia will firmly support the Chinese government's peaceful
reunification policy, he added.

PARIS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain, France and the European Union are waiting for the
results of the examination by the group of experts who met on
Monday in Brussels on the security of British beefs. The experts
will decide whether the French decision to keep embargo on British
beefs in fear of mad cow disease is scientifically justified.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. enterprises are seeking employees desperately because
the country is badly lacking labor force. An investigation in 110
cities recently showed that four out of five U.S. cities are
deficient in labor. The U.S. Federal Board of Reserve sees this as
a potential source of inflation because it results in rising
salaries.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- The nationalist right-wing party of Democratic Union of
Center (UDC) led by Zurich millionaire Christoph Blocher has won
23 percent of the votes on Sunday in the Swiss legislative
elections. The UDC, which opposes a rapprochement between
Switzerland and the European Union and is tainted with xenophobic
colors, is from now the first party of the country ahead of the
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
-- Moscow has subjected Chechnya to a total blockade by closing
on Sunday the frontier between it and the neighboring Ingush, in
fear of "infiltration" of terrorists into the Russian territory.
Thousands of Chechen refugees fleeing the war are blocked at the
border.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Agencies Enjoy Brisk Business In North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite a growing number of TV
programs about courting and finding the perfect match, many young
men and women are turning increasingly to marriage agencies to
find their life-long partners.
</P>
<P>
There are over 50 marriage agencies in the port city of Tianjin
in north China. These agencies are run by the state as well as
individuals from all walks of life including retired cadres,
teachers and those who have been laid off from state-run work
units. There is no age limit when seeking help to find a potential
partner. Age groups range from 20 to 70 years of age.
</P>
<P>
In a marriage center attached to the Ministry of Agriculture,
people who decide to find their partners have to pay a
registration fee of 200 yuan (about 24 U.S. dollars) a year until
they find their perfect match.
</P>
<P>
Personal details such as age, stature, income and a brief
description of what kind of person they are looking for are filled
out by clients. This information is put on the Internet by
agencies. To safeguard the privacy of clients, personal details
such as names, addresses and telephone numbers are withheld.
</P>
<P>
In the past, marriage was decided by parents. Most young people
found their potential spouses through matchmakers. Selecting a
partner was mainly limited to acquaintances, colleagues or
classmates. The opportunity to meet people was severely limited.
</P>
<P>
Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy, great
changes have taken place in this regard. Young people are becoming
more open-minded and they are more likely to choose someone
through a marriage agency or via the Internet, said Jiang Jianjun,
an official with the local Civil Affair Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Jiang predicts that marriage agencies have a huge potential in
China. However, those agencies do not deal with foreigners and
overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The marriage agencies are facing competition from perfect match
TV programs shown during prime time which attract a substantial
slice of advertising.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Up by 16 Pct in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output grew by 16.7 percent year-on-year in September with
cumulative output increasing by 12.7 percent in the first nine
months compared to the same period of last year, according to data
released Tuesday by Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB).
</P>
<P>
EDB attributed the strong rise in September to hefty gains in
the chemicals and electronics clusters which ran up by 32.9
percent and 14.8 percent year-on-year respectively in the month.
</P>
<P>
In the electronics cluster, September saw strong gains in
telecommunication equipment and computer peripherals boosted by
export demand for mobile products and printers respectively.
Growth was also registered in the computers and semiconductors
industries.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster continued to lead gains in Singapore's
manufacturing industry in September on back of the 63.5 percent
year-on-year growth in pharmaceuticals and 61.1 percent
year-on-year increase in the industrial/specialty chemicals in the
month.
</P>
<P>
Due to the 19.1 percent year-on-year contraction in the
transport engineering sub-cluster and 6.1 percent year-on-year
decline in the process engineering sub-cluster, the output of
engineering cluster declined four percent in September compared to
the same period of last year, although the output of the precision
engineering sub-cluster grew 9.7 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of this year, cumulative outputs of
the electronics cluster and the chemicals cluster increased by
21.5 percent and 19.4 percent respectively compared to the same
months of last year while the cumulative output of the engineering
cluster contracted by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the period.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Zhuhai Bridge to Be Completed By November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a bridge linking
Macao with Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong Province will be
completed by November. Construction of the bridge began in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, called "Lotus Bridge", will be open to the public
before the handover of Macao on December 20. The lotus, considered
as a symbol of prosperity in Macao, has been chosen as the
regional flower for the Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Designs for the bridge were done by the Wuhan No.4 Surveying
Institute attached to the Chinese Railways Ministry and affiliated
organizations in Macao. The bridge is 1,560 meters long, 30 meters
wide and has six lanes. The bridge will act as a second land route
between Macao and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
As vehicles drive along the left hand side of the road in Macao
and drive along the right hand side in Zhuhai, two lanes have been
specially built at both ends of the bridge to help vehicles change
lanes before they pass through the main bridge.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Enters Tourism Peak Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- With a substantial increase
in tourist arrivals in October, Nepal has entered the tourism's
peak season.
</P>
<P>
October, the first tourism's peak month, has recorded an
increase of around 45,000 inbound tourists by air so far, the
Kathmandu Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals by air comprise around 90 percent of the total
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a year which was marked as a Visit Nepal Year, about
60,000 tourists visited the country during October, setting a
record since 1962. In 1997, the figure was around 56,000.
</P>
<P>
October's figure matters a great deal in Nepal's travel
business, as this is the month that sees the highest number of
tourist arrivals in the year.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and travel agencies also reported good news of
flourishing business in October. Five-star hotels in Kathmandu
claim an occupancy of up to 90 percent so far.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors for tourist boom is the increased number of
inbound international airlines, especially flying to and from
Europe.

<P>
In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Council said UNTAET
will be empowered to exercise all legislative and executive
authority, including the administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET is mandated to provide security and maintain law and
order throughout the territory and to establish an effective
administration.
</P>
<P>
UNTAET acting official Ian Martin told reporters in Dili,
capital of East Timor, on Tuesday that he has met with the task
force of the Post Popular Consultation in East Timor (P4TT) and
the Indonesian Army (TNI) to discuss steps on the hand-over
process.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed matters relating to safeguarding some
important assets such as at telecommunication station, power plant
center, ports, and logistic warehouses which have so far been kept
by the Army personnel together with Interfet (U.N. peacekeeping
force in East Timor)," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 925 Army personnel are still in East Timor and
that the KRI Teluk Penyu warship is now standby at the port of
Dili to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
Martin said that there will be an official hand-over ceremony
in Dili, attended by the P4TT task force, UNTAET and TNI members.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a Portuguese colony until 1975, was occupied by
Indonesia in 1976 after Portugal's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has since called East Timor a non-self-governing
territory. Under its auspices, Portugal and Indonesia agreed on
May 5 this year for a U.N.-sponsored referendum in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The August 30 referendum turned to be in favor for independence
but the outcome sparked a fierce reaction from the minority of the
locals who favor autonomy under Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Violence and anarchy led to the Security Council's decision to
dispatch the multi-national force for the restoration of peace and
security for a total of 800,000 East Timorese.

<HEADLINE> Russian 2000 Budget Passed in Duma First Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma approved
the government's draft budget for the year 2000 after its first
reading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the suggestions by the government, the Duma
plenary session passed in principle the budget with 247 parliament
members voting for, 65 against and four abstaining.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that "Tuesday,
October 26, marks the deadline for passing the federal budget in
the first reading." Otherwise, there were "well-grounded fears
that the 2000 budget would not be passed in four readings by the
Duma in its present composition," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Duma in its present composition does not approve the
2000 budget, it will mean that there will not be a new budget
before March or April next year. Thus the financing will actually
start not sooner than May," Itar-Tass quoted Andrei Korotkov, head
of the governmental information department as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Vladimir Putin is very much concerned about a possibility of
leaving the Russian troops in Chechnya without proper financing in
case the 2000 budget is not passed in time," said Korotkov on
Monday.

BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua)-- Certain progress has been made
during last week's Sino-US talks on compensation of the losses
resulting from the US-led Nato bombing attack against the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang
Qiyue here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have exchanged views candidly and profoundly, and
decided to continue talks on this issue, Zhang said at the routine
press conference.
</P>
<P>
She also disclosed that China has discussed about its entry

organization.
</P>
<P>
Summers is here to attend the 12th meeting of the China-US

trade, treasury and finance.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question concerning China's relations with the
Vatican, Zhang said China is willing to improve its ties with
Vatican only under two preconditions. First is that Vatican should
severe its so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and the
other is it should commit not to interfere into China's internal
affairs in the name of religious issues.

<HEADLINE> Resettlement Helps Chinese Peasants Rid Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 26 (Xinhua)-- He Xinhai, a peasant of Hui
ethnic group, no longer worries about not having enough food for
his family of five after harvesting 3,000 kg of wheat and corn
this year.
</P>
<P>
He's family moved from a drought-stricken area in Ningxia
called Xihaigu early this year and have resettled in Hongsibao
Resettlement Village.
</P>
<P>
In his early thirties, He Xinhai is one of 300,000 rural
residents in Ningxia, in northwest China, who have benefited from
the resettlement program launched by the central government in
1983. The program aims to resettle people from impoverished areas
such as Xihaigu.
</P>
<P>
Drought is the main cause of poverty in Xihaigu which receives
less than 200 mm of rainfall each year. More than 70 percent of
the two million people in the area were living under the poverty
line by the middle of the 1980s despite the State's efforts to
eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 Ningxia began building villages to relocate farmers by
pumping water from the Yellow River to irrigate barren land.
Twenty-four resettlement villages have been completed so far.
Hongsibao is the largest.
</P>
<P>
Investment for the resettlement project has already generated
800 million yuan and 40,000 ha of farmland has been developed.
Eighty percent of resettled residents come from the Hui minority.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement has also improved the environment. Tongxin County,
for example, planted 400,000 trees after 200 people migrated to
other settlements.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is spending three billion yuan to develop 133,000 ha of
irrigated farmland for the resettlement of one million poverty-
stricken people. In the next three years, 670,000 more people are
expected to be relocated.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Tuesday noon announced the formation of his
35-member new cabinet, which involves all existing political power
elements and professionals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference here, the president said the
new cabinet does not bear a specific name, but it has the
character as a National Unity Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet was formed after a compromise and exchange of
interests amongst various parties.

<P>
"This is what we could reach for now, and I hope that it can

<P>
The head of state furthermore reiterated the task of the vice
president, who will be responsible for the troubled regions of
Irian Jaya and Maluku. The president himself will cope with
problems in Aceh.

the province. They have also demanded that Islamic law be applied
in the province.

<P>
In addition, Wahid said, the vice president will have a task to
monitor human rights and environmental issues, problems which have
been abandoned by many Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
The president also reminded that the current ministries will
have a different character from the previous ministries.
</P>
<P>
Ministries, except for the Education Ministry and Law and Legal
Affairs Ministry, will not directly be involved in technical
matters.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet consists of three coordinating ministers, 16
ministers leading departments, 13 state ministers, and three

NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Museums of Kenya
is about to open a pre-historic site to the public in south
Nyanza, southwestern Kenya.
</P>

The site, Thim Lich Ohinga, which means terrifying dense
forest, is believed to have been built and later abandoned some
300 to 500 years ago, " Daily Nation" newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the site which is 70 kilometers from the Home Bay town, all
the remains are of the fortress-like structure.
</P>
<P>
Set strategically atop a hill, the site has six stone wall
enclosures rising 10 feet high. According to local folkfore, the
huge enclosures were used to ward off enemies from neighboring
clans and tribes.
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of potential in this site as a tourist
attraction, and plan to restore it, publicize it and seek donor
funding to run it," Isaya Onjala, a research scientist with the
National Museums of Kenya said.

<P>
ANKARA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Monday that the
friendly Turkish-Israeli ties are not targeted at any third
country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "the relations between Turkey and
Israel are very good and these ties do not pose any threat
against any third country."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military and defense cooperation with Israel in
recent years has drawn harsh criticism and great concern from the
Muslim world and Arab countries, which fear the military ties will
change the power balance in the Middle East and increase Israel's
military superiority over its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreon has said that "we
will not have double standard on Turkey at the Helsinki Summit of
the European Union (in December). We will not present a list of
conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece's principle attitude is that Turkey's
candidacy for the EU must be real and must not be only for show.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- The 6th Court of First Instance of Ankara has taken a
restrictive measure on the properties of former Prime Minister
and banned pro-Islamic Welfare Party leader Necmettin Erbakan and
his 87 friends.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his 87 friends are accused of hiding trillions of
Turkish Liras (millions of U.S. dollars) from Turkey's Treasury.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Large-scale Hydropower Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China expects to develop its
hydro-electric power capacity to 125 million kw by the year 2010,
or 33.1 percent of its exploitable hydroelectric power resources,
according to the China State Power Corporation (CSPC).
</P>
<P>
China has the richest hydro-electric power resources in the
world, with exploitable water energy resources estimated at 376
million kw, ranking the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
The CSPC source notes that the hydropower stations at the Three
Gorges, Xiaolangdi in central China and Er'tan in Sichuan province
are among the ranks of the world's largest ones.
</P>
<P>
China has made fast progress in hydro-electric power industry
since the founding of New China in 1949, and especially since the
reform and opening-up drive began in late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Total hydropower generating capacity and annual electricity
output have risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh respectively,
in 1949, to the present 53 million kw and 190 billion kwh. This
makes China the third in terms of hydropower generating capacity
and annual electricity output in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the CSPC experts said that there is still a lot to be
done so as to make use of China's enormous water energy resources,
for the country's total generating capacity accounts for only 13.8
percent of what is exploitable.

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian Shah Police Employees Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 ex-employees of the
former Iranian Shah's secret police Savak staged a demonstration
Monday in front of the presidential office, demanding justice for
them, the Tehran Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters complained that they are still living in
uncertain circumstances two decades after the Islamic revolution
which ousted the Shah regime in 1979, the conservative daily said.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that their cases be reviewed and justice be
administered while reminding the Iranian government of the general
amnesty granted by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini
for the "innocent employees" of the former Shah's secret police
Savak and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times gave no details about the demonstration, but said
that it highlighted the fact that the people in Iran, regardless
of their cultural and social backgrounds, enjoy civil liberties,
including the right to voice their grievances in front of the
presidential office.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government wants
to achieve 4.4 million tourist arrivals by 2004, a two-fold
increase over the 1998 figure of 2.14 million arrivals, Philippine
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Gemma Araneta of Department of Tourism expressed
confidence in attaining this target in the light of a
520-million-peso (13 million U.S. dollars) program aimed to
maximize visitor arrivals through varied means.
</P>
<P>
Visitor arrivals by the year end is estimated to reach 2.54
million, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Araneta declared that the program will revitalize the industry
through exploration and adventure, spurring domestic tourism,
highlighting the country's treasures; and encouraging Filipinos
abroad to explore their roots in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Pacific-Asia Travel Association showed that
the Philippines ranked a poor 12th in the top Asia-Pacific
destinations with 2,222,523 arrivals in 1997, while Hong Kong
topped the list with 10,406,261 arrivals.
</P>
<P>
In addition to tourism arrivals, Araneta envisions increased

percent contribution to the country's Gross Development Project by
2002 from 8.7 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Famine Strikes More Districts in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The districts in Kenya facing
famine have risen to 21, "East African Standard" newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The affected districts are scattered in five provinces, mainly
in Rift Valley and Eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of rains has resulted in growing concern that
Kenya faces a massive famine while in some districts it is
attributed to cattle rustling other than the weather.
</P>
<P>
In Turkana District, the ruling party branch Chairman Japheth
Ekidor said Monday that people in the northern part of the
district had migrated southwards in search of food, water and
pasture.
</P>
<P>
Ekidor called on the government and non-governmental
organizations to send relief food and medical services to those
threatened with famine, especially to children and women.
</P>
<P>
However the Kenyan government says it will ensure the current
famine affecting many parts of the country does not lead to loss
of life.
</P>
<P>
Shariff Nassir, Minister of State in the Office of the
President, said Monday that continued food assistance will be
provided to areas experiencing food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he was personally monitoring the food
situation throughout the country to ensure nobody dies of hunger.

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition Leader Welcomes UN E. Timor Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia's opposition Labor
Party Leader Kim Beazley Tuesday welcomed the United Nation's
decision to take over the peacekeeping role in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Beazley told the reporters that the decision would help
Australia, which has so far shouldered the bulk of the military
burden in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He said that once it became a U.N. force rather than a
U.N.-mandated force, the costs would be more widely spread.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the U.N. force would have the right powers to
create security on the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beazley said the greater U.N. role in East Timor should also
help Australia in the difficult task of rebuilding its relations
with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has voted to authorize almost 11,000 U.N. troops,
military observers and police to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor will replace
the International Force in East Timor, which was dispatched last
month to restore order.

exercise restraint on its missile program to ensure peace in south
Asia.
</P>

Addressing a seminar of the Confederation of Indian Industry on
"Climate Change" here, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said,
"It is not in India's interest to live in a neighborhood bristling
with nuclear arsenals."
</P>

He urged India to end its production of fissile material, to
bring immediate negotiations for a global Fissile Material Cutoff
Treaty, strengthen its export controls, restrain its missile
program and adhere to the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who arrived here Monday night to prepare the
grounds for President Bill Clinton's visit to India early next
year, had hinted at an early end to economic sanctions imposed on
India, saying: "Our hope is that President Bill Clinton will have
the authority to end the certification very soon."
</P>
<P>
Stating that Clinton was likely to visit India in the first
quarter of next year, he said that the U.S. administration was
"very pleased" that the new government in India has unilaterally
fulfilled its commitment to maintaining a moratorium on nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
He will also deliver a "letter of friendship" from President
Clinton to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee congratulating him
on the electoral victory.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to

grabbing a 17.1-percent share of the U.S. market, up from a 13.4-
per cent in the same quarter a year ago, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
Compaq, according to IDC, sold 1.78 million computers, gaining
a 15.3-percent share of the market, compared to the 15 percent a
year ago. IDC also said Dell finished ahead of Compaq in the July-
September period.
</P>
<P>
However, Compaq remained No.1 on a worldwide basis, with a 13.8-
percent share of the global PC market, compared with Dell's 11.6-
percent share, according to IDC. Compaq shipped 3.8 million total
units in the quarter, while Dell shipped a total of 3.2 million
units.
</P>
<P>
"Going forward, it's going to be a neck-and-neck race. Unless
somebody slips up, they're going to be going at each other's
throats for months to come," said John Brown, IDC research
director. "That should be good for consumers... because value is
probably going to be one of the single-most important factors in
choosing."
</P>
<P>
Dell is in a position of strength because its direct sales
model reduces costs by being more efficient, said Charles Smulders,
principal analyst for Dataquest's worldwide PC program.
</P>
<P>
Dell's strategy of providing made-to-order computers is
generating more than 30 million dollars in sales in the United
States each day, according to Charles Smulders, principal analyst
for Dataquest's worldwide PC program. He said other companies that
keep large inventories on hand are forced to pass on some of those
storage costs to consumers or suffer from weaker earnings.
</P>
<P>
"Dell now is moving on to what we call the next generation of
PC market economics... which focuses on driving down the cost per
sale. One way to do that is to drive down internal costs."
Smulders said.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide PC shipments rose 23.2 percent to 28.6 million units
in the third quarter amid strong U.S. sales and rebounding demand
in Asia, Dataquest said. IDC reported that global PC sales jumped
25 per cent to 27.9 million units.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Australian Troops to Be Part of UN E.Timor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Up to 2,000 Australian troops
will be part of the United Nations peacekeeping force that will
take over from the Australian-led multi-national forces in
mid-January, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has voted to authorize almost 11,000 U.N. troops,
military observers and police to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor will replace
Interfet (International Force in East Timor), which was dispatched
last month to restore order.
</P>
<P>
Downer said it was unlikely the current Australian troops in
East Timor would be back home by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"The expectation in New York is that the Interfet operation
dominated by Australia will be replaced by a peacekeeping
operation around the middle of January," he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"There will still be Australian troops involved in the
peacekeeping operation. There'll be between 1,500 and 2,000, we
think, at this stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 2.5-billion-Australian dollar (1.65 billion
U.S. dollars) a year cost of Australia's participation in Interfet
would diminish substantially.
</P>
<P>
"It's a second consideration but it's an important
consideration from Australia's point of view and the blue-helmeted
operation will save us money," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The primary consideration ... is to make sure that the job is
done in East Timor and is done effectively and done as quickly as
possible," he added.

<HEADLINE> Africa-Asia Business Forum Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The first Africa-Asia
Business Forum (AABF) opened here Tuesday with its main objective
to promote trade and investment between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad officiated the forum
financed by the Japanese government and organized by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in collaboration with the
Malaysian government, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) of the World Bank Group and the Malaysian South-South
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Mahathir called on both the private
and public sectors in Asia and Africa to form sustainable smart
partnerships for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"If we Asian nations become genuine partners in African
development and not exploiters of wealth and opportunity, and if
we Asian nations can help enrich Africa with our capital, skills
and technology, we will benefit from the increased trade and
opportunities that a wealthier Africa will offer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The gap of ignorance between what Africa and Asia can offer
each other must be closed by bridges of knowledge and
understanding, he said, adding this Africa-Asia Business forum is
a bridge that has brought so many African and Asian businessmen
together for direct contacts for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The four-day forum attracted some 320 business executives from
23 African countries and six Asian countries including China along
with trade experts and consultants to lay the groundwork for
enhanced trade ties between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
The forum seeks to provide a platform for participants to
exchange information, develop closer relationships and engage
potential new partners in business discussions, to facilitate the
sharing of experiences on trade and investment diversification
between Africa and Asia as well as in global commercial relations,
and to conclude agreements on specific business arrangements that
will underscore future relations between the African and Asian
private sectors, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
They said the forum will feature one-to-one business meetings
between businessmen from the two regions, and will also feature a
series of seminars to expose participants to a range of available
services and respond to specific inquires on doing business in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The main focus of the forum would be in such areas as food
industry and health products, engineering and electronics,
textiles and garments, information and communication technology,
wood products, plastics and financial services, they told
reporters before the opening of the forum.
</P>
<P>
After officiating the forum, Mahathir also launched a forum
exhibition participated in by 147 companies from Africa and 129
companies from Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also launched an Asia-Africa Investment Technology and
Promotion Center website.
</P>
<P>
The programs of the forum are designed to assist investors from
Africa and Asia in becoming aware of the requirements, procedures
and ethics of doing business in the respective regions.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the United Nation Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Asian foreign direct investments
to Africa increased to 600 million U.S. dollars in 1996 from 18
million dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The AABF was formed following the second Tokyo International
Conference on African Development in October 1998 which developed
an Agenda for Action to support African development in the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Intel Unveils 15 New Pentium III Processors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. Monday rolled
out 15 new Pentium III processors, including a lightning-fast
733MHz, in the biggest product launch in its history, according to
reports from the chip maker.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the introduction of the processors once
again pits the world's largest maker of semiconductors against its
rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which unveiled a 700MHz chip
in its Athlon family earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Paul Otellini, executive vice president and general manager of
Intel's architecture business group, said the 733 megahertz
version is the world's fastest processor, adding that the product
launch was the chip giant's biggest in its 31-year history.
</P>
<P>
Experts said all the new products were made using a new process
technology called 0.18 micron, resulting in semiconductors that
have finer line widths between transistors and thus more
transistors on a silicon wafer.
</P>
<P>
Intel said the new Pentium III chips have 28 million
transistors compared with about 8.5 million in the Pentium III
processors made using the older 0.25 micron technology. The new
technology enables faster processing that consumes less power.
Moreover, the new process is expected to lower manufacturing costs
over the long term.
</P>
<P>
The Pentium III running at 733 MHz was priced at 776 dollars,
in quantities of 1,000. The Pentium III Xeon for servers and
workstations, running at 733MHz, was priced at 826 dollars, and
the 500MHz Mobile Pentium III was priced at 530 dollars, both in
quantities of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Intel said the fastest chips are targeted at four main product
segments: the desktop, mobile, workstation and server computers.
The new manufacturing process enabled the first line mobile
computers using Pentium IIIs, because of the lower heat
dissipation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the major computer makers announced a variety of
products designed around the new Pentium III chips. Hewlett-
Packard said Monday it's offering the faster versions of the
Pentium III in its Kayak XU800 PC Workstation. Dell Computer
followed suit and said the faster processors are available in its
desktop and notebook product lines.

<HEADLINE> Barak Names Final-Status Talks Team Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has appointed Oded Eran as head of Israel's negotiating team for
final-status talks with the Palestinians, Barak's office
announced Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Barak decided on the appointment after
consultations with Foreign Minister David Levy, the office said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Barak, on a one-day visit to Turkey on Monday, called
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to inform
him of the decision.
</P>
<P>
Eran is currently Israel's ambassador to Jordan and has been
in Amman for about three years.
</P>
<P>
He served in the past in the Israeli embassy in Washington as
minister in charge of congressional affairs and minister in charge
of diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his appointment in Jordan, Eran headed the Egypt desk
at the Foreign Ministry and was then a deputy director in the
ministry, in charge of economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, who heads the
steering committee for the talks, said Monday night that any
decision regarding the Israeli team is "an internal decision." At
the same time he voiced his hope that now the sides will be able
to "make up for the time lost."
</P>
<P>
PNA has already named its Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo as head of the negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh peace deal, the two sides are to
come up with a framework for the final-status agreement by next
February and a final agreement by next September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides launched their final-status talks on September
13. Thorny issues such as the status of Jerusalem, the
settlements, refugees, borders remain to be settled during the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Eran's appointment paved the way for holding the Oslo summit
meeting next week to be attended by Barak, Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said he will not be
attending, but Russia will send its prime minister and Jordan its
foreign minister to the summit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross is to arrive here
Tuesday afternoon to start the preparations for the summit,
meeting with both Barak and Arafat before returning to Washington
Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Indonesian New Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Alwi Shihab was appointed as
Indonesia's new foreign minister here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old holder of a doctorate in Islamic studies from
Temple University in Philadelphia, the U.S. spent years in Cairo
as a student at the Al Azhar University in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He later went to the U.S. for a teaching post and returned to
Indonesia last year to take up the post of secretary-general of
the National Awakening Party (PKB), the party which President
Abdurrahman Wahid helped found.
</P>
<P>
His older brother Quraish, a former religious affairs minister
in the short-lived cabinet of former president Soeharto, is at
present ambassador to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that Foreign Minister Alwi, Wahid's close
associate, would be able to deal with problems that may emanate
from Mideast countries (some of which recognize Israel while
others conduct intensive trade ties) as a result of that watershed
diplomatic move.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Israel, Alwi said that "diplomatic relations
with Israel will not be opened now. What is to be started is trade
and cultural relations. We have to be aware of Israel's wide
lobbies, so that trade relations are expected to be useful for
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Trade relations would lead to diplomatic relations later if
Indonesia becomes involved in the peace process in the Middle
East, he said, adding that Indonesia was expected to be able to
speak with Israel for the sake of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Alwi also wished to repair the country's relations with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said the head of state had said that all unsettled problems
had to be dealt with well.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need to demonstrate our anger too long. What is
important is they have realized we have been angry and it seems
approaches have already been made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alwi added that he had met with the Australian ambassador to
Indonesia and he had expressed the wish for an immediate recovery
of relations.
</P>
<P>
Since the Indonesian government agreed to accept foreign
peace-keepers to quell the violence in East Timor, there has been
an upsurge in anti-Australian sentiment due to the perception that
Canberra's efforts in the East Timorese crisis verge on meddling
in Indonesian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Violence rocked the territory after the United Nations Mission
in East Timor announced on September 4 that an overwhelming 78
percent of the voters opted for separation from Indonesia. The
former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has also abrogated the security
agreement with Australia, signed in 1995, last month.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Bus Fares to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Bus Service, the major
city passenger transport company, has announced a 20 percent fare
increase since November 7 in all city routes.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya Times" newspaper Tuesday quoted the firm's managing
director George Thuo as saying that the fare hike is due to
"persistent fuel price rises and poor roads".
</P>
<P>
Thuo noted that depreciation of Kenyan shilling in the last few
months has also contributed to the fare rise.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unregistered bus operators association has also
indicated that they will charge more in fares for city routes
soon.
</P>
<P>
Commuters are worried that the fare increase will have a
negative impact on the ordinary people whose income remains low as
the economy is still depressed.
</P>
<P>
The repairs of major roads destroyed by the El Nino rains in
1997 and 1998 are still under way and commuters hoped that the
fares will go down once the rehabilitation work completes.

<HEADLINE> Flood Kills Four, Traps Tourists in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed and
about 300 tourists were stranded on an island in Thailand Monday
after a tropical depression lashed the Gulf of Thailand, the
Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The four people, including a 19-year-old boy and a forestry
official, were killed in flooding in western Prachuap Khiri Khan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 300 tourists found themselves stranded on Samet
Island in the eastern province of Rayong as high tides made
vessels unable to leave the island to transport them back to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Navy put two ships on stand-by to take the tourists off the
resort island, a Rayong police officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The naval vessels, each capable of carrying 200 passengers,
were to make the one-hour crossing to the island when the tides
eased and pick up the tourists, the officer said, adding that the
tourists were not in any danger.
</P>
<P>
The depression hit the mainland of Prachuap Khiri Khan Province
Monday morning, causing flash-floods there and in neighboring
Phetchaburi Province.
</P>
<P>
An officer from the Prachuap Khiri Khan Meteorology Center said
Monday's depression had resulted in very heavy downpours. The
level of rain ranged from 72.2 to 122 millimeters and the level of
floodwater ranged from 30 centimeters to two meters.

<HEADLINE> Life Expectancy Exceeds 74 in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy in
Tianjin has reached 74.26 years, 2.26 years more than the average
in developed countries. When the People's Republic was founded in
1949, the average life expectancy in Tianjin was only 45 years.
</P>
<P>
Improved medical and health care services has been a key factor
behind the prolonged life expectancy of Tianjin residents. At the
end of 1998, the city had 3,190 medical institutions compared to
120 in 1949. Medicare professionals also increased to 68,000
compared to 5,000 in 1949. Adequately equipped hospitals and
improved medical services have also resulted in the declining
incidence of diseases and the mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
Increased disposable income has also greatly improved the
living standards of people in Tianjin. Many are consuming more
nutritious foods. Statistics show that average annual disposable
income of Tianjin residents reached 7,100 yuan at the end of 1998,
7.2 times more than in 1952. Average per capita residential space
in Tianjin also increased from 3.8 sq. meters to eight sq. meters.
</P>
<P>
While the life expectancy of Tianjin residents has increased,
population growth has been carefully monitored. Statistics show
that the birth rate has been kept under one percent in the 1990s
compared to 3.378 percent in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Oil Company Rules out Petrol Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC)
has ruled out price hikes of petroleum products, dismissing
speculation that it could follow the footsteps of India to
increase oil prices, the Kathmandu Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"NOC does not fix the price of petroleum products. So we are
not thinking in that direction. It is the cabinet that decides the
price," said an official of NOC Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, India hiked the price of petroleum products
by 35 percent, fuelling cross-border smuggling and hoarding of the
commodities in Nepal's border areas. Nepal imports petroleum
products via India.
</P>
<P>
The hiked price of diesel is around Rs 23 per liter in Indian
market, while its price stands at Rs 15.5 per liter in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
NOC officials said that the hike in the diesel price will
affect the whole consumer market "as diesel is directly related
with the country's transportation, production and even electricity
generation sector."
</P>
<P>
NOC officials stressed the need to initiate "coordination and
consultation between the authorities concerned -- Ministry of
Home, Ministry of Supplies, NOC, and the local administrations" --
to solve the problem of hoarding and smuggling in the border
areas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Says Peace, Development Remain World's Main Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Monday that maintaining world peace and seeking common
development of all countries remain the two main tasks of the
international community today and in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
While the world is undergoing a major and profound change today,
the main theme of humanity -- peace and development -- remains
unchanged, Jiang said when meeting the press at the Elysee
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet the challenge of maintaining peace and
seeking development, we must establish a just and reasonable new
international political and economic order," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
For that purpose, the international community must remain
committed to the norms governing international relations worked
out by the international community after World War II, he said.
</P>
<P>
These norms are highlighted by the five principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, restraint from
aggression against each other, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and solving international disputes and
conflicts through political means.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that these norms have helped keep 50 years of peace
in the world since the end of World War II and have proved
effective.
</P>
<P>
He said that the authority of the United Nations should be
strengthened and its role of keeping world peace and security be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for a democratic and full participation by all
countries in the process of establishing a new political and
economic order.
</P>
<P>
"All countries, big or small, have the right to participate on
an equal footing in establishing the new world order," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that it is extremely important to set the
right precedents in running international affairs at the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
"It is related to the crucial question of creating what kind of
a new century and a new international order. We should make a deep
reflection on the Kosovo War," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the emerging new international economic order, Jiang said
that the basic question concerning the issue is sticking to the
principle of cooperation for mutual benefit and seeking common
development of all countries.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of globalization, we should have international
coordination and cooperation with a global perspective. Every
country should contribute its effort to reform and make more
reasonable the current international economic and financial order,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on developed countries to do more to help developing
countries and to reduce discrepancies in economic and social
development between them. Developed countries should respect the
choice made by developing countries when the latter seek their
economic and social development, he said.
</P>

GUANGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) --Development of Guangdong's
private sector has been given a big boost as the province
introduces a range of measures to encourage economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Party committee and the government have called
for steps that will encourage equal competition within the private
sector. Laid-off workers from state or collectively-owned
enterprises, college graduates and army personnel who have
returned to civilian life will be given preferential treatment in
re-employment or finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will get more financial support from local
governments if they employ laid-off workers and the disabled. Self-
employed people and those working with private businesses will now
be entitled to social security benefits.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the rights of self-employed people and
private companies are well protected by the law. It is illegal to
coerce those within the private sector by exacting fines or
demanding money from them. Those who engage in such unlawful
activities will be dealt with accordingly by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Self-employed people and private businesses are encouraged to
start up businesses in remote, backward and mountainous areas.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Registers Drastic Fall in Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's foreign exchange
reserves dropped to 4.2 billion U.S. dollars by October 20, down
30 percent from the end of last year, the Slovakian State Bank
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the bank, commercial
banks registered the biggest fall in foreign exchange reserves,
shrinking from 3 billion dollars to 1.2 billion dollars in the
first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said the reduction in foreign exchange
reserves reflected in a certain degree the grimness of the country
's economy.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of Slovakia's gross domestic product was 2.4
percent in the first half of this year, down 3.7 percentage points
from the same period last year and marking the slowest economic
growth in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production dropped by 6.6 percent in the first
eight months and only 5 percent of the industrial sector reported
profits.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the number of registered jobless people
amounted to 510,000 across the country, bringing the unemployment
rate to a record high of 19.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's foreign debts totaled 11.8 billion U.
S. dollars by the end of last year, up 20.4 percent from 1997.
The Slovakian currency, koruna, was devalued by 4 percent and 13
percent against the euro and the U.S. dollar respectively since
the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Timber Price Hike Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua)-- Timber prices in China will rise
five to ten percent over the next eight months, with shortage of
timber and the difficulty to import timber, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Dong Xinmin, deputy director of the State
Forestry Bureau's forest products co-ordination center as saying
that "the timber prices in provinces and autonomous regions in
South China, such as Guangdong, Fujian and Guangxi, have already
begun to pick up."
</P>
<P>
He based his price-hike forecast on higher personal incomes and
an expectation that the government will invest more in wood-buying
for infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Also, as environmental consciousness grows around the world and
countries pay more attention to protecting natural forests, timber
imports are likely to become more difficult, which is another
factor contributing to the price hike, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, five million cubic
meters of timber were imported, compared to six million cubic
meters for last year.
</P>
<P>
China needs about 70 million cubic meters of wood annually,
while the annual domestic supply is about 60 million cubic meters.
The country only needs to import about ten million cubic meters of
timber to satisfy demand and to adjust the product mix.
</P>
<P>
Dong proposed that the government spend more on planting
forests to produce more high-grad timber.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Ate Millet As Staple Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have found that
ancient people living in central China 3,000 years ago ate millet
as a staple food.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is based on several tests on chemical elements
found in the remains of people from the Shang Dynasty (16th BC --
11th BC), and agrees with what was recorded by oracle bone
inscriptions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Oracle bone inscriptions, which are ancestor of "Han Zi" (
Chinese characters), were unearthed in the Yin Ruins of the late
Shang Dynasty in Central China's Henan Province, the spot where
the remains of Shang people were found.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Archeological Research Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and Minnesota University
extracted Carbon-13 and Nitrogen-15 from the ribs of the bodies,
and compared the results with the content of the two elements in
millet and wheat. The two chemicals are widely used in
archaeological studies.
</P>
<P>
They have found that in the remains of a Shang child, the
presence of nitrogen-15, which is related to the human body's
nutrition, was remarkably higher than in other children. They
theorized that the good nutrition might be a result of breast-
feeding.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the nutrition of children in the Shang
Dynasty was much higher than in the adults, which meant that they
were well cared for.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Shang People examined were all unearthed in a
big family tomb in Yin ruins. The inhabitants of the tombs were
ordinary people involved in agricultural and industrial production,
and could represent the general health condition in their times.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Faces Hearing After Boxing with Norris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Nevada Athletic Commission
will meet Friday to discuss Mike Tyson's aborted fight with Orlin
Norris and decide whether to take any action against him.
</P>
<P>
Tyson cound be fined for his late blow that prematurely ended
his fight with Norris after the first round Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The former heavyweight champion will have to wait a few days to
see if he can collect his $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Nevada boxing regulators are not expected to take any action to
suspend Tyson from the ring or change the decision in the fight
from a no contest to a disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Under Nevada law, which was changed in the wake of Tyson's
biting of Holyfield, a boxer can be fined his entire purse for an
infraction.
</P>
<P>
Norris said he did not think Tyson hit him deliberately after
the bell. An MRI showed his knee had been dislocated, and doctors
said Norris may need surgery.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended lower
Monday amids fears of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 120.32 at
10,349.93, trimming the gain of 172.56 point in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 8.02 at 1,293.63 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 0.57 at 2,815.95.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell after the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose
to 6.40 percent from 6.34 percent late Friday as bond prices,
which move in opposite direction from yields, fell because
investors were worried with the rising interest rates. The higher
bond yields drew some investors away from the stock market to bond
market.
</P>
<P>
Fears of the hike in interest rates distracted investors from
the good news about corporate earnings. AT&AMP;T rose after reporting
that its profits beat the expectations in the third quarter but
Chevron and Exxon, the Dow's oil companies, both fell despite good
earnings reports that beat analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Investors will check closely with remarks given by the Federal
reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and other officials this week on
their sentiment on interest rates. Their concerns with higher
rates jolted the stock market in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.85 at 597.31 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 1.39 at 791.22. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.93 at 417.76.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,850 down, 1,201 up and 503
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 765.63 million shares from 951.92
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Tank Delivery to Turkey Causes Tension in German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN October 25 (Xinhua)--Key roles of the two parties that
govern Germany, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) led by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and its junior partner the Greens
party, Monday night met in Berlin chancellery to cool down the
tension over whether a German firm should be allowed to deliver a
battle tank to Turkey for testing.
</P>
<P>
Officials of both parties hoped the dispute would not lead to a
split of the so-called "red-green coalition" that has been in
power for barely one year, the ARD television reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, beginning at about 9:00, was expected to continue
for 2 hours or longer.
</P>
<P>
Gunda Rostel, co-spokeswoman for the Greens party, said the
negotiation with the SPD would be "very hard." But she still
expected a compromise.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a compromise acceptable to both sides," she
said.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on security issues last week, most SPD
ministers approved Klaus-Maffei Wegmann, a defense concern in
Munich, to deliver a "Leopard-II" battle tank to Turkey for
"testing purpose."
</P>
<P>
The only minister that spoke out at the meeting against the
delivery was Greens foreign minister Joschka Fischer, but he was
overwhelmed by his SPD colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Fischer and other Greens cabinet members accused the SPD broke
last year's coalition agreements of not supplying arms to
countries with "questionable human rights record", referring to
Ankara's conflicts with rebel Kurds. Some Greens even warned the
party would quit Schroeder's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's most advanced types, the "Leopard-II" is
reported to be favorable to Turkish government, which has planned
to purchase 1,000 tanks for its army. And Klaus-Maffei Wegmann is
equally eager to win the order with a sample for testing.
</P>
<P>
But Rostel and Fischer insisted the delivery of 1,000 tanks
remained "out of consideration if the human rights record in
Turkey was not bettered, "no matter what kind of compromise would
be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Russia FM Urges Chechnya Rebels to Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia Foreign Minister Ivan
Ivanov said Monday that Russian government favored a political
solution in Chechnya but that the rebels in the breakaway republic
would have to lay down their arms before this could happen.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, speaking at a press conference after a meeting with his
Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini, confirmed his government's
willingness to enter dialogue and its conviction that "a lasting
solution can only be a political one."
</P>
<P>
He stressed however that Moscow would have no truck with
terrorists and that changing Russian borders was out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
"They have no way out other than to lay down their arms," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Moscow's position was made more difficult
because the Chechen rebels ignored all normal rules of humane
behavior in their struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
"They don't respect any type of human or humanitarian law," he
said, adding that if the rebels failed to give up their weapons,
Moscow would feel justified in using "all the means available to
the struggle against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Italian foreign
ministry, Dini expressed Italy's deep concern over the conflict in
Chechnya and asked that a "political solution" be reached as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Italy also reiterated the importance of maintaining Russia's
"national integrity" and condemned recent "terrorist attacks" in
the capital and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Igor Ivanov and Dini stressed the importance of "continual
cooperation" between the European Union and Russia in the
monitoring of the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Dini said it was essential that Moscow participate "in the
reconstruction and stabilization of southeastern Europe."

<HEADLINE> Annan Complaints Over Iraq's Delayed Import Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday complained that Security Council's sanctions
committee had been placing an increasing number of holds on Iraq's
import Contracts.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the President of the Security Council, Annan
said "I believe it would be very helpful if the committee could
undertake an early review of all applications currently on hold
with a view to expediting a decision, as appropriate, in each
case."
</P>
<P>
"To enable the Iraq program to meet the humanitarian objectives
set forth in resolution 986(1995) and 1153(1998), it is highly
desirable to find a prompt solution to this problem," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan attached to his letter a note form the head of the U.N.
Iraq program, Benon Sevan, which said the number of holds overall
continues to increase despite some efforts by te committee to lift
holds on drought-related equipment and items related to water and
sanitation and oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said almost half of the applications placed on hold were
because committee members requested additional technical details,
and the second common reason was due to concerns about end users
of the goods to be purchased.
</P>
<P>
Seven pointed out that efforts by members of the sanctions
committee and by the U.N. Secretariat would not alone sufficient
to resolve the difficulties, a special effort is also needed on
the part of Iraqi government as well as its suppliers in providing
the detailed information required by the committee in a timely
manner.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatly complained to the United Nations about the
delays in approving contracts for items it is allowed to import
under the oil-for-food agreement with the United Nations. It
usually accuses the U.S. and Britain for blocking the approval of
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Taliban to Expel bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Monday that the United States could
normalize its relations with Afghanistan if the Taliban movement
expels Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, accused of masterminding bomb
attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the offer when Taliban representative Abdul
Hakeem Mujahid called on Assistant Secretary of State Earl
Inderfurth at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed a statement by Taliban's Information
Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who said that the Taliban is ready
to solve all the issues with the United States, including that
of bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make clearer that we consider Osama bin Laden and
his activities a threat to Americans," Albright said at a news
conference. "It is very important for the Taliban, if they wish
to be treated with any sense of regularity, that he (bin Laden)
needs to be expelled to a country where he can be brought to
justice."
</P>
<P>
After Albright's news conference, State Department spokesman
James Rubin cautioned reporters that the talks between
Inderfurth and Mujahid were not "on the verge of breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said American diplomats have met periodically with
Taliban officials for some time. The head of the State
Department's counter-terrorism office met with Mujahid last
Monday in New York.

<HEADLINE> Amsterdam: Highest Hotel Occupancy in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
hotels in Amsterdam enjoy the highest occupancy rate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey by British travel-industry adviser
Horwath, 86 percent of hotel rooms are full on an average in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Four-and five-star hotels in the Dutch capital city have an
especially high occupancy rate, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amsterdam's tourist authorities said in its October
issue of Newsletter that if the Dutch capital wants to maintain
its position as fourth tourist city in Europe, it must promote its
tourism sector with an annual growth rate of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Tourist Board said economists agree in their
Hotel Report that such a growth rate will provide extra 5,000 beds
over the next four years. The required investments should pay off,
it added.
