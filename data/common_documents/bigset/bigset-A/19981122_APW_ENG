	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After warning North Korea to forsake
nuclear weapons, President Bill Clinton showed off U.S.military
power in a pre-Thanksgiving holiday visit Sunday with troops on
watch near the world's most heavily guarded border.
	   Helicoptering to a training center eight miles from the tense
Demilitarized Zone, the president shook hands with crews of M-1
tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and other military transports. His
tour was intended to underscore the U.S. security commitment to
South Korea in the face of any challenge from the communist North.
	   He also planned to address American troops later at Osan Air
Base from a U-2 spy plane hangar after attending a church service
at a U.S. Army chapel in Seoul.
	   Clinton spoke Saturday of a ``strong suspicion'' that an
underground construction project in the communist North that is
barred from U.S. inspection is nuclear related.
	   Saying the United States has an ``unshakable alliance'' with
Seoul, Clinton urged North Korea to seize ``an historic
opportunity'' for peace extended by South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung in his policy of engagement with his neighbor.
	   Kim said North Korea ``is cautiously but noticeably taking
measures to increase interaction and cooperation.'' But Kim, in
office less than a year, said he and Clinton agreed that ``we will
not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate
nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.''
	   The two leaders spoke at a news conference at the Blue House,
Seoul's presidential residence, and toasted each other later at a
state dinner.
	   An armistice, not a peace treaty, ended the 1950-53 Korean War,
and the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Close to 2
million troops are deployed on both sides of the border.
	   Security worries and Asia's economic collapse were Clinton's top
themes in South Korea, as they were earlier in Japan. He urged
Korea to continue to open its markets, resist protectionism and
prevent unfair trade practices in sensitive sectors like steel and
semiconductors.
	   He also saluted Seoul's struggle to overcome Asia's economic
upheaval. ``I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis
more prosperous, more stable, more democratic _ thanks in no small
measure to Korea's example.''
	   Clinton managed a bit of relaxation during his visit with a
surprise late-night stop Saturday at a concert featuring his
brother, Roger, and his band. The president listened to songs
off-stage at the Sejong Culture Center until Roger Clinton
introduced his brother as ``a very special person.'' The audience
of 2,000 stood and applauded.
	   On security, new unease was raised by photos from U.S. spy
satellite that show thousands of North Korean workers digging a
huge hole in a mountainside at Keumjongri, 25 miles (40 km)
northeast of North Korea's main nuclear complex, Yongbyon. North
Korea rebuffed U.S. appeals to inspect it, demanding dlrs 300
million for the privilege. Clinton has rejected that idea.

Riot breaks out in Indonesian capital, at least two killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslim rioters on Sunday
burned a Christian church and a gambling hall and hurled rocks at
soldiers who fired warning shots and tear gas. At least two people
were killed.
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks from reaching the burning church and a
police helicopter hovered above thousands of people who milled
about in the streets. Shops in the area were closed.
	   The fighting in north Jakarta was sparked by resentment among
local residents towards Christian civilian guards of the gambling
hall from the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon.
	   Residents said they burned the church and gambling hall in
retaliation after a group of Ambonese attacked a mosque early
Sunday morning.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said. Ninety
percent of Indonesians are Muslim.
	   Mobs threw rocks at a military truck carrying some 20 Ambonese
that left the scene. ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Flames shot 100 feet into the air and smoke billowed from the
gutted Christian Church of Ketapang, which is located behind a
shopping center.
	   Assailants with knives and broken bottles stabbed to death two
men. It was not known if they were Ambonese or local residents.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms. That fighting triggered
mob riots in several parts of Jakarta.
	   In May, the city was convulsed by rioting that killed 1,200
people and led to the ouster of former President Suharto after 32
years of authoritarian rule.

Naked runners attempt radio interview record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEIPA, Australia (AP) _ Organizers of the annual Running of
Bulls charity event are hoping for an entry into the Guinness
record book _ a live radio interview involving almost 200 nude men.
	   The naked runners packed around a telephone booth for an
interview Sunday with Australian Broadcasting Corp. after
completing a number of laps of Curricular Way, a large traffic
circle near the center of this bauxite mining town 2,350 kilometers
(1,450 miles) northwest of the state capital of Brisbane.
	   ``We don't believe an interview like this has ever been done
before, so we'll apply to the Guinness Book of Records to get it
officially recognized,'' said event founder and organizer Nigel
Gould.
	   ``Not that we need the publicity. Television crews were in town
from around Australia and overseas and I'll be doing interviews
with radio and TV stations in New York, Tokyo and Europe today.''
	   The event, which raises money for the Royal Flying Doctor
Service and other charities, is staged each year on the first
Sunday after the arrival of the summer monsoon season.
	   The nude runners carry plastic bags and ask for donations from
the crowd gathered at the roundabout.
	   Gould said the 196 runners had raised about 2,000 Australian
dollars (about 1,300 US dlrs) in less than 30 minutes this year.
	   ``We attracted a crowd of about 800 and there was a fantastic
party mood with the runners and the spectators all dancing in the
street,'' Gould said. ``We just hope the event gets even bigger
every year.''

Howell wins first professional tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Englishman David Howell claimed his
first professional golf tournament Sunday with a seven-stroke
victory in the Australian PGA Championship at Sydney's New South
Wales course.
	   Howell led after all of the first three rounds and extended his
overnight margin of six strokes with a closing round of 4-under-par
68 to finish with a 13-under-par total of 275.
	   His winning score was the lowest by four strokes in the four
occasions the tournament has been held on the tough links course in
the 1990s.
	   No one got closer than five shots from Howell on Sunday.
Trinidad's Stephen Ames and Australian Terry Price tied for second
place with closing scores of 68 and 69 respectively.
	   Howell, a 23-year-old from Swindon, recently completed his third
season on the European tour and his previous best placing in a pro
tournament was a second to countryman Lee Westwood in the Loch
Lomond International in Scotland this year. (djp)

	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Nick Faldo led English teammate
David Carter up to the final green, like a father leading his son,
as they closed in on the country's first-ever World Cup of Golf
title Sunday.
	   Faldo, 41, babied Carter, 26, all week, cooking him breakfast in
their villa and keeping the team in contention as Carter struggled
against wicked winds and a shoulder injury through the opening
three rounds.
	   For Faldo, doing a similar job to his father-figure role with
Lee Westwood at the last Ryder Cup, it was a first victory since
the Nissan Open at Riviera in February last year.
	   Since then he has split from longtime mentor David Leadbetter
and girlfriend Brenna Cepelak and gone through a depressing form
slump.
	   Carter said his second nine Saturday was a ``Krueger'', as in
Freddy from Nightmare on Elm Street. But Carter rose from the dead
Sunday and clinched the title with a birdie at the last.
	   ``I carried him all week and he's the bloody hero _ isn't that
great,'' Faldo joked after England's two-stroke victory over Italy.
	   Carter, who broke through for his first European Tour victory in
this year's Irish Open, got a final round 68. His birdie spared
Faldo a tough putt to win it, and he went over to the veteran, gave
him a high five and rested his head on Faldo's shoulder.
	   ``I said just make things easy on me, knock it in for me and he
did,'' said Faldo.
	   Carter had two painkilling tablets and a session of
physiotherapy each day to fight a rotator cuff problem in his right
shoulder. The last thing he wanted was a play-off.
	   ``I said to myself, well this is it, this is your first chance
to win it,'' Carter said. ``I just said come on you can do it now,
I sure as hell didn't want to go through all that stuff again.''
	   The United States, driven by the tournament's individual
champion Scott Verplank (9-under), was tied with Scotland and
Argentina for third, one behind Italy.
	   Faldo was equal second with Italy's Costantino Rocca in the
individual competition behind Verplank, who had a 63 to equal the
course record set earlier Sunday by Sweden's Patrik Sjoland.
	   Carter and Faldo collected U.S. dlrs 200,000 each from the total
U.S. dlrs 1.5 million prizemoney for giving England its first win
in 44 World Cup events while Verplank got U.S. dlrs 100,000.
	   The U.S. was 13-under for the final round and led at 6-under
through 16 holes. But John Daly struggled down the stretch,
dropping shots at the par-5 17th and par-4 18th with near misses.
	   Verplank said the team gave itself little chance before the
round and he had decided to focus on the individual title.
	   The 34-year-old has fought back after injuries and illness
stalled his career.
	   He was the U.S. amateur champion in 1984 and won on the PGA Tour
as an amateur a year later. His only other PGA victory was in the
Buick Open in 1988.
	   Argentina's Angel Cabrera and Richard Gonzalez were 1-shot
behind England in the final group but slipped to 4-under as they
both suffered bogeys at 16. Gonzalez earned the share of third with
a birdie at the last.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie had a 68 and Andrew Coltart had a
66 Sunday to get into third.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslim rioters on Sunday
set fire to a Christian church and a gambling hall and hurled rocks
at soldiers who fired warning shots and tear gas. At least five
people were killed in the ethnic violence.
	   At first, mobs blocked fire trucks from reaching the burning
church and a police helicopter hovered above thousands of people
who milled about in the streets. Soldiers with helmets, sticks and
shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Shops were shut in the area, which is less than a kilometer from
the state palace of President B.J. Habibie.
	   The fighting in north Jakarta was sparked by resentment among
local residents towards Christian civilian guards of the gambling
hall from the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms. That fighting triggered
mob riots in several parts of Jakarta.
	   Residents said they burned the church and gambling hall in
retaliation after a group of Ambonese attacked a mosque early
Sunday morning.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said. Ninety
percent of Indonesians are Muslim.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Flames shot 100 feet into the air and smoke billowed from the
gutted Christian Church of Ketapang, which is located behind a
shopping center.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross said they had recovered
five bodies of Ambonese who had been stabbed to death with knives
and broken bottles.
	   Mob leaders tried to exercise some control over the rioters,
urging them not to break into stores.
	   ``We will punish the ones who want to loot,'' one ringleader
shouted.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Thousands
of buildings and vehicles were damaged and looting was widespread.
	   The May rioting was triggered in part by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades, which has sent prices
soaring and stripped millions of people of their jobs.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade in the nation of 202 million people.
	   There was no indication of anti-Chinese sentiment in Sunday's
riot.

Myanmar gov't says opposition members quitting of free will
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military government said Sunday that
hundreds of people who have recently quit pro-democracy leader Aung
San Suu Kyi's party did so of their own free will _ despite being
detained beforehand.
	   Lt. Col. Hla Min, the government's spokesman, told reporters in
a briefing that the grass-roots members of Suu Kyi's National
League for Democracy were frustrated with ``the NLD leadership's
policy of confrontation and divisiveness.''
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked
in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over
demands that a parliament elected in 1990 be convened. The NLD won
the elections, but the military never allowed the parliament to
meet.
	   Suu Kyi staged a pair of highly publicized roadside standoffs
with authorities earlier this year to protest restrictions on her
movements and to pressure the government to meet her demands for
dialogue and the convening of parliament.
	   Neither has materialized. The government has recently been
reporting, through the official press, the resignation of hundreds
of local party members and the dissolution of local offices.
	   Hla Min said Sunday that 12 local offices had voluntarily
dissolved, comprising 1,259 people.
	   Hla Min supported his contention that NLD members were fed up
with their leaders with a videotaped interview with members who had
been kept at so-called ``guest houses'' _ detention facilities more
comfortable than the jails where hundreds of other opponents are
serving sentences.
	   The members said they were well during an ``exchange of views.''
	   The NLD released a statement Friday accusing the government of
``excessively misusing its authority'' by using threats to force
members to resign from the party.
	   The government reported that of the total of 851 party members
taken to the guest houses, including several members-elect of
parliament, 384 had returned home. Some have been held since
September.
	   They assured authorities that they had ``no intention to take
part in activities detrimental to peace and security and that they
did not agree with the NLD's call for parliament,'' one said in the
video.
	   Asked if the remaining 467 would be released only after they
could promise authorities that they would not participate in
politics, Hla Min said that no preconditions were made.
	   ``The government has no wish to detain them for any longer than
necessary and regrets the inconvenience to those involved,'' Hla
Min said. ``We hope the rest of the NLD members will soon be
home.''
	   Hla Min said that the NLD's call to convene parliament has
derailed dialogue between the government and party. Only a few
meetings have ever been held. The government refuses to meet Suu
Kyi.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, rose to prominence
during protests against military rule in 1988 that were crushed by
troops.
	   Universities have been closed since 1996, when hundreds of
students took to the streets demanding more civil rights. Hla Min
said that the Education Ministry hoped to reopen them before the
New Year.
	   Hla Min also said that the National Convention, which is
drafting a new constitution, should meet again ``in the near
future.'' It has been in abeyance since the NLD walked out in 1995,
claiming it was stacked in favor of prolonged military rule.

	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Sunday, security officials
said.
	   One Israeli jet fired an air-to-surface missile on a valley
between the Shiite Muslim villages of Zibqine and Jibal al-Boutoum,
the Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The valley, near the southern port of Tyre, is believed to be
used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen occupying a border
enclave in south Lebanon.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 7.30 a.m.
(5:30 GMT) air strike, the latest in a series of raids by Israeli
warplanes on suspected bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrilla group.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid,
saying warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon.
Israel routinely uses the word ``terrorist'' to describe the
guerrillas fighting its occupation of south Lebanon.
	   On Friday, Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of Tyre,
following a series of clashes in the south that reportedly left
four guerrillas dead.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in
casualties.
	   The air raids come at a time of heightened tension in south
Lebanon. On Monday, a Hezbollah roadside bomb killed three Israeli
soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone which Israel set up in 1985. It maintains the
occupation is necessary to shield its northern towns against
cross-border attacks.

Verplank claims individual title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Scott Verplank signed off on a
season of resurrection Sunday when his final round 63 at the World
Cup of Golf won him U.S. dlrs 100,000 for the individual title.
	   Now, after years of persisting through pain, he wants to make a
run at a United States Ryder Cup spot.
	   While the focus in the teams event was on England's Nick Faldo
and David Carter, who scored a 2-shot win over Italy, Verplank had
a stunning finish to an encouraging year.
	   He teamed with John Daly in the World Cup and the pair made a
daring charge on the final day, picking up 13 shots to finish a
5-under, three away from England, after leading through 16 holes.
	   It was the final effort of an encouraging year for Verplank, who
has had three elbow operations and two PGA Tour wins since he
claimed the U.S. Amateur championship in 1984.
	   ``I've had a very nice year, I've played pretty solid and
consistent all year long,'' Verplank said Sunday.
	   ``Knock on wood I'm over the elbow injuries. That's stuff I paid
attention to all the time. I have a regular workout schedule and
that's made a big difference this year. I've been a lot strong and
a lot more durable.''
	   A bit more improvement, a few more rounds like Sunday, and he
might get what he wants.
	   ``I would love to play Ryder Cup,'' Verplank said. ``It isn't
the same format but I'd love top get enough points for the Ryder
Cup because I think that format suits me.
	   ``If I keep doing the same stuff I'm doing and I can have a time
where I have a great week physically and mentally then I'm going to
be right there.''
	   Verplank started the final round at even par with Daly on 8-over
as the team began 10 shots behind overnight leader Argentina.
	   The pair raced through the front nine at 8-under to get square
and Verplank had birdies from the 11th to the 14th.
	   Daly was also hot, overcoming demons from earlier in the
tournament. He had a quadruple-bogey 8 Friday at the easy par-4
14th. With his team on an impressive roll he put his second shot 40
feet from the pin Sunday but curled in a great putt and pumped the
air with his fist.
	   But after the show of power, Daly's close was insipid, dropping
two shots as the U.S. challenge stalled.
	   Verplank kept at it and his birdie at the 17th made sure he
finished ahead of Faldo and Costantino Rocca, who tied for second
at 8-under.
	   Verplank had his best season so far this year, making the
season-ending Tour Championship for the first time in a decade. He
was 18th on the money list and the U.S. dlrs 1.2 million he earned
was more than the previous 10 years combined.
	   ``I had a number of near misses this year but I never felt that
I just played awesome,'' Verplank said. ``I think if I can play
another 10 years injury free and with decent help I think I could
do some pretty good stuff.''
	   Like play the Ryder Cup.

 &UR; Red Wings 4, Canucks 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia (AP) _ Norm Maracle made 28 saves
and Brendan Shanahan scored his 10th goal as the Detroit Red Wings
defeated the Vancouver Canucks.
	   Maracle, who had played only 15 minutes this season and appeared
in five career games, was stellar in his first start in goal,
replacing the injured Chris Osgood, who was out with a hip flexor.
	   The 24-year-old had a shutout bid going into the third period
but had it spoiled with less than five minutes gone on a fluke goal
when Trent Klatt's deflection went off Detroit defenseman Uwe Krupp
and into the net.
 &UR; Kings 5, Blackhawks 0
	   In Inglewood, California, Jamie Storr, making his first start in
almost six weeks, earned his third career shutout as the Los
Angeles Kings snapped a six-game losing streak with a victory over
the Chicago Blackhawks.
	   Nathan LaFayette had a goal and two assists. Olli Jokinen also
scored, Glen Murray and Ray Ferraro had power-play goals and Steve
Duchesne had two assists.
	   Their efforts spoiled Jocelyn Thibault's debut in the
Blackhawks' net and temporarily postponed the Blackhawks' 2,000th
victory as a franchise.
	   The victory was the Kings' first since Nov. 9, when they beat
the Canucks 4-3 at Vancouver on Nov. 9.
 &UR; Rangers 2, Sharks 2
	   in San Jose, California, Jarrod Skalde got his first goal of the
season but the San Jose Sharks remained winless against the New
York Rangers.
	   The Rangers, who are 2-2-3 over their last seven games, took an
early 2-0 lead. But the Sharks came back with a goal to close the
second period and Skalde's tying goal to open the third.
	   The Sharks are 0-12-2 against the Rangers _ the only team in the
NHL that San Jose has never defeated.

EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey: the season.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Stars 3, Blues 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Pierre Turgeon scored with less than 13 minutes
remaining as the St. Louis Blues overcame a three-goal deficit to
tie the Dallas Stars.
	   Mike Modano and Grant Marshall each had a goal and an assist for
the Stars, who were playing for the second straight night.
	   The Stars were without Brett Hull, who suffered a bruised kidney
Friday night and did not make the trip to St. Louis. Many in the
sellout crowd booed when Hull's name was included in the
announcement of the players who were scratched from the game. Hull
was one of the most popular players in Blues history before signing
as a free agent with the Stars in the offseason.
 &UR; Islanders 6, Predators 3
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Robert Reichel had a goal and two
assists as the New York Islanders snapped a three-game losing
streak with a win over the Nashville Predators.
	   Reichel's power-play goal 4:22 into the game made it 2-0. Trevor
Linden pounded in the rebound of Reichel's shot early in the second
period to build New York's lead to 4-1. Sergei Nemchinov scored
from close range on a backhand feed by Reichel 3:26 into the third
to make it 6-1.
 &UR; Coyotes 3, Oilers 2, OT
	   In Phoenix, Rick Tocchet scored with 52 seconds left in overtime
to lead the surging Phoenix Coyotes over the Edmonton Oilers.
	   The victory, Phoenix's NHL-high fifth in a row and second
straight in overtime, moved the Coyotes a half-game ahead of Dallas
for first place in the Pacific Division. The Coyotes are on a
league-high 11-game unbeaten streak (9-0-2).
	   Nikolai Khabibulin stopped only 13 of 15 Edmonton shots, but it
was enough to also keep alive his team's post-expansion league
record of holding teams to two goals or less _ now at 14 in a row.
The 1958-59 Montreal Canadiens, one of six teams in the old NHL,
set the record of 18 straight before the first wave of expansion in
1966.

Crime-fighting committee's recommendation ``discriminatory''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A crime-fighting committee's recommendation
that all foreign maids receive compulsory training in child abuse
prevention has been criticized as discriminatory.
	   A report released Saturday by the Fight Crime Committee said the
government should require overseas maids to receive such training
as they may not be aware of the problem because of the language
barrier, the Hong Kong Standard reported Sunday.
	   Cynthia Tellez, director of The Mission for Filipino Migrant
Workers, said the recommendation was ``discriminatory and
prejudicial,'' the report said. Most perpetrators are not foreign
maids but family members, she said.
	   Legislator Yeung Yiu-chung also told the Standard the report was
discriminatory ``because it gives the public an impression that
Filipino maids are child abusers.''
	   About 160,000 Filipinos work in Hong Kong, mostly as live-in
maids, making them the largest foreign community in the territory.
	   The committee comprises police officers, government officials
and community workers and activists. The government is not required
to adopt its recommendations.

Virus kills six Malaysian pig farmers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An outbreak of a deadly virus
among pig farmers has killed six people this year in the western
Malaysian state of Perak, a news report said Sunday.
	   Lee Chee Leong, Perak's health and environment committee
chairman, said 20 cases of the disease had been reported since last
October, including the six deaths.
	   One of the 20 was a pork wholesaler and the rest worked on pig
farms in the state. According to a preliminary report the victims
registered identical symptoms of high fever, headaches for up to
seven days, followed by drowsiness and a coma a day or two later,
the Star newspaper reported.
	   ``The Institute of Medical Research is still investigating and
the full report will be made public soon,'' said Deputy Health
Minister Siti Zaharah Sulaiman.
	   The health ministry's deputy director of disease control said
the illness, believed to be Japanese encephalitis, was passed on to
people by mosquitoes that had bitten animals infected with the
virus.
	   Health officials said the situation was being monitored closely
and pig farmers in the afflicted area had received vaccinations.
	   According to a ministry report, the disease is not transmitted
by eating pork. It said between nine and 82 cases of the virus have
been recorded each year since 1985, mainly in the states of Perak,
Penang and Sarawak. The fatality rate is between 3 percent and 60
percent.
	   In Malaysia, there are strict rules governing the sale of pork,
which cannot be eaten by the country's Muslim majority.

Three kidnapping victims turned over to Philippine authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine military officials said
Sunday three kidnapping victims have been turned over to
authorities after they were freed unharmed in the southern
Philippines.
	   An elderly Taiwanese woman and a housemaid, who were snatched
with the three last September, however, remained in kidnappers'
hands but might also be released soon, a military official said.
	   Southern Philippine military spokesman Horacio Lapinid said the
three, Gina Yang, her daughter Tza-Tza and a Filipino driver,
Nicomedes Sta. Ana, were freed by the kidnappers in Zamboanga del
Sur province to aides of Nur Misuari, a former Muslim separatist
rebel leader now serving as governor of an autonomous southern
Muslim region.
	   The aides turned over the three to Misuari and Undersecretary
Ronaldo Puno of the Department of Interior and Local Government in
Taluksangay village in Zamboanga City Sunday night, Lapinid said.
The three were then taken to a military hospital for check-ups.
	   Military sources said an unspecified amount of ransom, much
smaller than the 50 million pesos (dlrs 1.2 million) demanded by
the kidnappers was paid to the kidnappers.
	   The kidnappers are still holding Wang Tau Chu Yang, an
80-year-old Taiwanese and her Filipina housemaid, but there are
indications they would also be freed soon, Lapinid said.
	   The Yangs were seized by armed men outside their home in
Zamboanga Sept. 9 and forced to board a comandeered taxi driven by
Sta. Ana.
	   The kidnappers were believed to be former members of the Moro
National Liberation Front, the main Muslim rebel group which signed
a peace agreement with the government in 1996.
	   The Yangs' release followed that of an Italian priest, the Rev.
Luciano Benedetti, who was abducted also on Sept. 8 from his parish
in Zamboanga del Norte province.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Treviso, was turned over Nov. 15 to guerrillas
of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which is currently holding
peace negotiations with the government.
	   At least four other kidnapping victims remain in captivity in
the volatile southern region of Mindanao, including two Hong Kong
nationals and a Malaysian.
	   President Joseph Estrada promised in June to end ransom
kidnappings in six months and launched a high-profile crackdown on
kidnapping syndicates.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mobs ransacking Roman Catholic church.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslim rioters on Sunday
set fire to a Protestant church and a gambling hall and hurled
rocks at soldiers who fired warning shots and tear gas. At least
five people were stabbed to death.
	   Mobs also ransacked a Roman Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was underway, smashing stained glass windows, chalices and
a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles onto a
bonfire.
	   The ethnic and religious violence was the latest sign that the
military is increasingly hard-pushed to keep order in Indonesia's
sprawling capital of 11 million people. The nation of 202 million
is also enduring the strain of economic hardship.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms. That fighting triggered
mob riots in several parts of Jakarta.
	   In the rioting Sunday, crowds blocked fire trucks from reaching
the burning Christian Church of Ketapang and a police helicopter
hovered above thousands of people roaming the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Shops were shut in the area, which is less than a kilometer from
the state palace of President B.J. Habibie.
	   The fighting in north Jakarta was sparked by resentment among
local residents towards Christian civilian guards of a gambling
hall who had come from the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon.
Residents said a group of Ambonese had attacked a mosque early
Sunday morning.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said. Ninety
percent of Indonesians are Muslim.
	   Two dozen worshippers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross said they had recovered
five bodies of Ambonese who had been stabbed to death with knives
and broken bottles.
	   At the nearby Sacred Heart Church, a wedding party fled a crowd
that burst in, breaking altar ornaments and tearing up priests'
robes.
	   Mob leaders tried to exercise some control over the crowds,
urging them not to break into stores.
	   ``We will punish the ones who want to loot,'' one ringleader
shouted.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Thousands
of buildings and vehicles were damaged and looting was widespread.
	   The May rioting was triggered in part by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades, which has sent prices
soaring and stripped millions of people of their jobs.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade. There was no indication of anti-Chinese sentiment in
Sunday's riot.

Butcher's century lifts England to 299 for four
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score; ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Inspired by a brilliant Mark Butcher
century, England put up a brave batting performance in the face of
a daunting Australian total in the first Ashes cricket test at the
Gabba on Sunday.
	   England resumed 432 runs behind on 53 for one. When bad light
and rain stopped play on the third day, the visitors had progressed
to 299 for four, comfortably averting the follow on.
	   On a day marked by high-quality batsmanship to match the
Australian centuries by Steve Waugh and Ian Healy on the second
day, Butcher led the way with his second test century.
	   It was a timely return to form by the left-handed opener who
went into the test with woeful batting form _ managing just nine
runs from five first-class innings.
	   Butcher's 116, equaling his maiden test century against South
Africa at Leeds in August, lifted England as he shared a rollicking
second-wicket stand with Nasser Hussain, who scored 59.
	   When the day's play was cut short by 15 overs, Graham Thorpe and
Mark Ramprakash, the last recognized batting pair, were together
figuring in an undefeated 59-run stand.
	   Thirty minutes will be added to the start and stumps on the
fourth day Monday to make up for the lost time.
	   Thorpe, playing his first test since back surgery in August, hit
70 runs in a little over three hours, while Ramprakash, after a
nervous start, settled down to score 29.
	   Butcher and Hussain continued from where they left off
overnight, thrashing the much-vaunted attack during a 134-run stand
in 21 minutes over two hours.
	   The pair started the day in buoyant style, banishing leg spinner
Stuart MacGill out of the attack by taking 22 runs in three overs.
	   The unexpected attack left Mark Taylor short of options before
Michael Kasprowicz finally struck in the 20th over of the day.
	   Australia quickly wrested the initiative with the gifted wicket
of Alec Stewart when the England captain swept a MacGill full-toss
to Kasprowicz at square leg.
	   But Butcher, who suffered a nasty cut in England's tour opener
against Western Australia at the WACA in Perth, continued the
onslaught with Thorpe as partner.
	   England raced to 179 for three at lunch and was very much in
control in the post-lunch session before part-time off spinner Mark
Waugh struck.
	   Butcher, who survived being bowled off a Kasprowicz no-ball, was
brilliantly caught and bowled by Waugh, one of the seven bowlers
used by Taylor to unsettle the threatening England batting.
	   Butcher was given anti-inflammatory tablets in the pre-lunch
session when he complained of a twinge in his back soon after
Australia took the second new ball.
	   Butcher, playing in his 15th test since making his debut against
Australia at Edgbaston in 1997, batted for 278 minutes and hit 16
fours off 236 balls.
	   He reached his century with a cover-driven boundary off MacGill,
racing to his century off 179 balls. His second 50 came off just 78
balls.
	   The left-handed pair of Butcher and Thorpe put the bowling to
sword with a 72-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 100
minutes.
	   Hussain beat Butcher to his half century, but soon got into a
shell before falling. Kasprowicz softened him up with a short ball
and then squared him up with a fine outswinger that was duly edged
to wicketkeeper Ian Healy.

Chinese President leaves on visit to Russia, Japan

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin set off Sunday on a
tour of Russia and Japan, looking to push forward ties with both
nations.
	   Leaving behind a snow-covered Beijing, Jiang was traveling first
to Russia, where he and his ailing counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, were
expected to sign a statement on border demarcation and discuss
broad issues of expanding cooperation between the former Cold War
rivals. It will be their sixth summit meeting.
	   A main issue of concern will be lagging commerce between China
and Russia. Trade fell 10 percent last year to dlrs 6.1 billion and
the two want to raise the total to dlrs 20 billion by 2000.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang will also release a declaration defining some
stretches of the two nations' 4,300 kilometer (2,700-mile) border
and call for talks on the rest of the frontier, Chinese Ambassador
to Moscow Wu Tao was quoted as saying Friday by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Jiang _ who is traveling with his wife, Wang Yeping _ will also
meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and visit the Siberian city of
Novosibirsk.
	   Jiang's Nov. 25-30 visit to Japan, the first by a Chinese head
of state, is intended to help push forward China's often rocky
relations with its largest foreign trade partner.
	   Despite close economic ties, rivalry for regional influence,
memories of Japan's often brutal 1931-45 occupation of much of
China and suspicions about Tokyo's intentions toward Taiwan have
periodically upset relations.
	   China has indicated that it expects Japan to accord Jiang the
same treatment given to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who
during his visit to Tokyo last month received from Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi Tokyo's fullest apology yet for its colonial rule.
	   Jiang will also urge Japan to support China's claim to rival
Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry has said.
	   Jiang will meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito, hold talks with
Obuchi and is expected to travel to the northern cities of Sendai
and Sapporo. He also will discuss youth exchanges, as well as
cooperation in science, technology, business, and environmental
protection, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.

Report: Iraq will not let Butler dictate his terms

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not let chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler dictate his own terms in the search for
the country's most dangerous weapons, the newspaper of the ruling
Baath Party said Sunday.
	   Al-Thawra, which usually states the government's view, said
Butler and his inspectors were behaving as if they were the victor
in the latest confrontation with the United Nations over arms
inspections.
	   The inspectors returned to work last week. Iraq had cut off all
dealings with them in two steps during August and October, but it
rescinded both decisions Nov. 14, barely averting military strikes
by the United Sates and Britain.
	   ``He (Butler) has started speaking the language of a victor who
dictates his conditions,'' an Al-Thawra editorial said, referring
to Butler's demand to see certain Iraqi defense documents.
	   ``It is a mean victory,'' the paper added. ``Butler imagines
that he is armed with the presence of American troops and therefore
he has lost his balance.''
	   Despite mounting tension over weapons-related documents, U.N.
weapons inspectors have been visiting suspected sites with no
obstruction from Iraqi authorities.
	   The inspectors made their first surprise visit to a facility
with a potential to produce banned weapons Saturday. They also went
into the field Sunday, but their spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would
not reveal the number of teams or places they would visit.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before U.N. Security Council sanctions on the
country can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
the free export of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraq
insists it has met the Security Council's requirements, but the
inspectors charge it has not come clean about its weapons programs.
	   Butler has demanded that Baghdad hand over a log of chemical
ordnance it used during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war. His inspectors
found the document in July, but Iraq is refusing to give it to them
in its entirety.
	   Butler is also asking for other documents in the hope of
unraveling Iraq's biological weapons program.
	   Iraq says part of the air force document concerns its national
security, which it believes should be off-limits to the inspectors.
	   Iraqi officials, speaking privately, have said they fear
publicizing the log will strain relations with Iran since it
details amounts of chemical weapons the Iraqi air force dropped on
the Iranians during the war.
	   Iraq is also resisting handing Butler all its Defense Ministry
documents since they would expose Iraq's strategy and the weapons
it used against Iran and against the U.S.-led multinational force
in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Butler is also asking for documents related to Abu Ghraib
prison, Iraq's largest, to see whether humans were ever used as
guinea pigs during experiments on biological weapons. Iraq flatly
denies the charge.
	   ``Our freedom-loving people have determined to confront these
games and maneuvers,'' said the official Al-Qadissiya newspaper in
a front-page editorial.

Clinton warns North Korea against nuclear ambitions

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After warning North Korea to forsake
nuclear weapons, President Bill Clinton praised American troops
Sunday for remaining vigilant near the world's most heavily guarded
border where tensions are on the rise.
	   ``Our ability to succeed in promoting peace is uniquely due to
the fact that we can back up our diplomatic efforts when necessary
with military strength and that depends on you,'' Clinton told
cheering U.S. sailors, soldiers and Marines stationed at Osan Air
Base on the Korean Peninsula.
	   The president said that although recent U.S. attention has
focused on the threat from Iraq and its weapons program, the
tensions with North Korea because of its suspected nuclear
ambitions ``remain an area of great concern.''
	   ``Lately signs of danger have intensified with incursions from
the North, provocative missile tests and the question of a
suspected underground (nuclear) installation,'' Clinton said. ``So
we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you we are.''
	   Standing before a red banner bearing the ``Black Cat'' emblem of
the 5th Reconnaisance Squadron, which flies America's U-2 spy
planes, Clinton addressed a crowd of at least 1,000 military
personnel and their families huddled in parkas against the cold.
	   Behind Clinton, a row of F-16 fighter jets and A-10 Warthog
ground-attack planes stood as a reminder of the U.S. security
commitment to South Korea in the face of any challenge from the
communist North.
	   Earlier, Clinton helicoptered to the Korean Training Center
eight miles (13 km )from the tense Demilitarized Zone. He shook
hands with tank crews, pinned a promotion on a private and led
troops in singing happy birthday to a sergeant major. He then
joined soldiers for lunch.
	   The president began the day at chapel services at the U.S. Army
headquarters for Korea at Yongsan base in Seoul.
	   Clinton spoke Saturday of a ``strong suspicion'' that an
underground construction project in the communist North that is
barred from U.S. inspection is nuclear related.
	   Saying the United States has an ``unshakable alliance'' with
Seoul, Clinton urged North Korea to seize ``an historic
opportunity'' for peace extended by South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung in his policy of engagement with his neighbor.
	   Kim said North Korea ``is cautiously but noticeably taking
measures to increase interaction and cooperation.'' But Kim, in
office less than a year, said he and Clinton agreed that ``we will
not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate
nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.''

Trial of jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar resumes Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government campaign, grafs 10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The politically charged corruption
trial of Anwar Ibrahim resumes Monday amid a growing outcry over
U.S. Vice President Al Gore's remarks supporting the ousted
Malaysian deputy prime minister.
	   The Malaysian government had recessed Anwar's trial so it would
not interfere with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of
21 Pacific Rim leaders, which ended last week.
	   The weeklong pause, however, only intensified the global
spotlight focused on Malaysia and the government's treatment of the
former No. 2 leader.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his firing by
Mahathir sparked massive anti-government protests. The current
trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried on
another corruption count, as well as five of sexual misconduct, at
a later date.
	   The 51-year-old dissident leader denies all the charges and says
they are part of a political vendetta orchestrated by his former
mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Malaysia, meanwhile, has accused U.S. Vice President Gore of
meddling in its domestic affairs, following a speech he delivered
during the APEC summit in which he expressed support for the
political reform movement started by Anwar.
	   Gore's remarks have triggered a nationalistic fervor. A hot line
advertised in the government-backed New Straits Times was hooked up
over the weekend for callers to register anti-U.S. sentiments.
	   Information Minister Mohamad Rahmat said a task force would be
set up to strengthen patriotism and tackle foreign interference.
	   ``The foreign attack on the country is too big, but if people
love the country and stand united, they can reject any kind of
propaganda aimed at humiliating us,'' the minister was quoted as
saying in Sunday's Star newspaper.
	   He also said the government planned to launch a nationwide
campaign seeking the public's true sentiments over the matter.
Sign-in books will be placed at shopping malls and community
centers around the country. Government agencies will study the
entries.
	   ``The purpose is to get a true picture of the feelings of the 20
million Malaysians about problems facing the country,'' Mohamad was
quoted as saying in Sunday papers.
	   During the APEC summit, top-ranking officials from Australia,
Canada and the United States, as well as Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, angered Malaysia by meeting privately with Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, to voice concern.
	   Anwar's case sparked international outrage when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was
blindfolded by police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   A special police team appointed to investigate the beating
completed its report and submitted it Thursday to Attorney General
Mohtar Abdullah.
	   Mohtar has not yet disclosed details of the report. He said he
was studying it with senior prosecutors.
	   The prosecution's case suffered several apparent blows when its
first seven witnesses took the stand earlier this month. Prime
Minister Mahathir has been named as one of 52 witnesses that could
be called to testify against Anwar.
	   When the trial opened, the head of police intelligence, Mohamed
Said Awang, startled the court by testifying that police had
coerced statements from arrested people and made them retract
accusations leveled against Anwar, then deputy prime minister. He
also testified that he would lie under oath if ordered to.
	   Another police intelligence officer, Abdul Aziz Hussin,
demonstrated how he had forced two key witnesses to retract their
allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   Anti-government demonstrations in support of Anwar have been
held since his ouster. The trial is expected to last through next
year.

Separated Korean families yearn for reunion with loved ones

	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) _ Lee Kang-ik, 70, laboriously
climbed the peak of a North Korean mountain, knelt on the cold
granite and prayed to be reunited with the wife and daughter he
hasn't seen for nearly half a century.
	   ``Lord, how long will you prolong this tragedy? Isn't 50 years
of separation enough?'' Lee cried as tears streamed down his
wrinkled face. Overcome with emotion, he had to be helped down the
slope by others.
	   Lee was one of about 800 tourists from South Korea on an
unprecedented tour last week of Diamond Mountain, a wilderness of
high crags, steep valleys and rushing streams on the North's east
coast.
	   Most of the visitors were elderly North Korean natives who were
separated from their families during the 1950-53 Korean War, a fate
shared by 10 million people on both sides of the border.
	   No family reunions took place during the tour, a joint venture
between Seoul's Hyundai group and North Korea. The five-day,
four-night visit ended Sunday when the tourists' cruise ship
returned to the South.
	   Lee and many other separated families used the visit to the
mountain to hold memorial services for their deceased ancestors or
pray for reunions with lost families.
	   Seven months after the Korean War broke out in 1950, Lee, then
22, fled to South Korea to evade being drafted into North Korea's
army. He left behind a 20-year-old wife and a 3-month-old daughter.
	   ``I thought the war would end soon and we could be reunited,''
Lee said, heaving a sigh. ``Who could have imagined that the
separation would last 50 years _ and, maybe, forever?''
	   Forty years later in 1991, Lee, through a friend in the United
States, found that his wife, now 68, and his daughter, 48, were
still living at his native home in Haeju, a major city on the
North's west coast.
	   Pretending that he resides in the United States, Lee has since
exchanged about 50 letters with his wife and daughter. All of his
letters were first sent to the United States where they were
re-mailed to North Korea.
	   He has kept his residence in South Korea secret even to his
family in the North, because he fears his whereabouts could
endanger them. North Korea reportedly persecutes residents with
immediate relatives in enemy South Korea.
	   Park Soon-yong, 76, also a refugee from North Korea, learned
during the tour that his mother died in a U.S. bombing raid in
1951, during the height of the war. He had last seen her a year
before her death.
	   After the cruise ship arrived at Changjon port last Thursday,
Park approached North Korean officials for information about his
mother, who had a fish-processing business in the port in 1950,
away from her family in Pyongyang, the capital.
	   Responding to his repeated appeals, North Koreans checked
records and told him how his mother died.
	   On Saturday, Park held a memorial service for her. He set up a
makeshift altar on a rock on Diamond Mountain and made traditional
deep bows in her memory.
	   ``Mother, I've come to know today officially for the first time
that you died 47 years ago. I've come too late. Sorry, mother,'' he
recited in a prayer.
	   For Kim Taek-ki, 70, the trip brought fresh agony.
	   Kim had hoped to locate or hear about his parents and four
brothers he has not seen since 1950. The tour was scheduled to pass
through his native village, Onjung-ri, at the foot of Diamond
Mountain.
	   But the village of about 500 homes was gone. Several state
retreat centers stand where the village used to be. Kim found that
all 2,000 villagers were relocated to other areas 20 years ago.
	   Kim, a farmer living in eastern South Korea, became separated
from his family when he fled to the South a few months after the
war started and was drafted into the South Korean Army.
	   His oldest brother, Kim Taek-sung, was already serving in the
North Korean army.
	   ``I might have fought one of many battles against my brother
during the war,'' Kim said. ``What a tragedy. So many years have
passed since the war ended. But the real war still continues, a war
against agony.''

Regional officials sign Japanese-Russian agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido
Sunday signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation in
Russia's Far East Sakhalin region, a news agency reported.
	   The agreement comes at a time of thawing relations between
Russia and Japan, whose leaders are trying to resolve a
half-century-old dispute over the Kuril Islands, part of the
Sakhalin region just north of Hokkaido.
	   ``This is a remarkable event which is of great importance not
only for the two country's neighboring regions, but for other
territories as well,'' Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov said at a
signing ceremony, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Gov. Tatsuya Hori of Hokkaido said, ``stronger good-neighborly
ties between our territories will promote bilateral relations
between Russia and Japan at the turn of the century.''
	   The agreement made no mention of the Kurils, which Russia
claimed the islands after World War II. Japan has consistently
maintained that the seizure was illegal.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not let chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler dictate his own terms in the search for
the country's most dangerous weapons, the newspaper of the ruling
Baath Party said Sunday.
	   Al-Thawra, which usually states the government's view, said
Butler and his inspectors were behaving as if they were the victor
in the latest confrontation with the United Nations over arms
inspections.
	   The inspectors returned to work last week. Iraq had cut off all
dealings with them in two steps during August and October, but it
rescinded both decisions Nov. 14, barely averting military strikes
by the United Sates and Britain.
	   ``He (Butler) has started speaking the language of a victor who
dictates his conditions,'' said a commentary by a senior Al-Thawra
editor, referring to Butler's demand to see certain Iraqi defense
documents.

Political reforms are a tough task for troubled Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: One name for Suharto is correct.
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Last March, 1,000 legislators
obediently handed President Suharto a seventh 5-year term. Now,
with Suharto forced from office, many of those delegates profess
eagerness to scrap his authoritarian legacy.
	   Student protesters doubt it, and they have fought deadly battles
with the military this month while demonstrating their scorn for
political reforms endorsed by Indonesia's highest legislative body.
	   Still, inside the heavily guarded Parliament, legislators are
hurriedly drafting laws for perhaps the most crucial reform: the
plan by President B.J. Habibie to hold elections next year.
	   Under Habibie, a onetime protege of Suharto, change has already
swept the Southeast Asian nation since riots and protests helped
oust the 77-year-old Suharto in May after 32 years in power.
	   New political parties and trade unions are sprouting. Many
political prisoners have been freed. News organizations are much
more freewheeling than in neighboring Singapore or Malaysia.
	   But Indonesia's path toward democracy will be long and disputed.
Although the 12 decrees adopted by the People's Consultative
Assembly are broad promises of change, it is unclear how vigorously
the government will pursue them.
	   ``They can provide the first step on the road to full democracy,
but it's not the whole thing. There are a lot of things to be
done,'' said retired Lt. Gen. Hasnan Habib, a former ambassador to
the United States and now a government critic.
	   Two major sticking points linger. The assembly ignored student
demands that Suharto be put on trial and decided to only cut back
the military's presence in politics rather than ban it altogether.
	   But sharp curbs were slapped on the executive branch. One decree
limits Indonesia's president to two 5-year terms, in contrast to
Suharto's stay in office since 1965.
	   Another decree strips the presidency of emergency powers,
granted by the same assembly to Suharto earlier this year as
economic turmoil and political discontent eroded his
once-impregnable grip.
	   There is even a decree revoking dozens of Suharto-era decrees
deemed to be abuses of power. Yielding to terms of a financial
bailout plan led by the International Monetary Fund, the government
had already dumped many Suharto edicts.
	   Official perks that generated billions of dollars for the
business empires of Suharto's children are no more. They include
tax breaks for the Timor national car project and a monopoly on
cloves, the key ingredient in Indonesia's popular perfumed
cigarettes.
	   In the weeks ahead, opposition forces will be watching
Parliament while it drafts electoral laws for a vote in May or
June. Under Suharto, the ruling Golkar party guaranteed its
victories by dominating the electoral machinery.
	   There are a host of details to haggle over: Will the election be
held with the old proportional system that doles out legislative
seats according to a party's overall vote? Will it be a blend of
that system and single-seat districts? How many members does a
political party need to register? Is a signature enough proof of
membership?
	   There is doubt the election will be held on time because so much
needs to be done.
	   ``It's a daunting task,'' said Harold Koh, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor. But after
meeting Friday with Indonesian election officials, he said, ``I saw
a lot of will to carry through with those dates and those
deadlines.''
	   Doubts also persist about how aggressively the government will
try to purge itself of corruption after all but ignoring graft
among the elite for decades.
	   ``The question is where to start, because of the scarcity of
officials who are clean and credible,'' said Harry Tjan of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a private think
tank.
	   The recent session of the special assembly cited Suharto in an
edict against malfeasance but students dismissed it as rhetoric. On
Saturday, Habibie ordered a new corruption inquiry into Suharto's
wealth after an earlier investigation found no wrongdoing.
	   The assembly's pledge to reduce, not eliminate, the military's
75 appointed seats in Parliament has fueled more student protests.
The new quota has yet to be determined.
	   Critics of allocating seats to the military fear that if the
election produces a fragmented Parliament of many contentious
parties, the military may end with the biggest bloc of seats.
	   Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, whose job as the military's
head of political affairs was recently eliminated, said last week
that the armed forces support reform but warned that their primary
goal is to ensure national stability.
	   The military will not allow Indonesia to ``go any which way,
especially if it starts heading in the wrong direction,'' Bambang
said.

Rioters ransack, burn churches in Indonesian capital, at least six

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslim rioters set fire to
a Protestant church and a gambling hall Sunday and hurled rocks at
soldiers who fired warning shots and tear gas. At least six people
were killed, some of them mutilated.
	   Mobs also ransacked a Roman Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was under way, smashing stained glass windows, chalices
and a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles on to
a bonfire.
	   The ethnic and religious violence was the latest sign that the
military is increasingly hard-pressed to keep order in Indonesia's
sprawling capital of 11 million people. The nation of 202 million
is also enduring the strain of economic hardship.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms. That fighting triggered
mob riots in several parts of Jakarta.
	   In the rioting Sunday, crowds blocked fire trucks from reaching
the burning Christian Church of Ketapang. A police helicopter
hovered above thousands of people roaming the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Shops were shut in the area, less than a kilometer (one-half
mile) from the state palace of President B.J. Habibie.
	   The fighting in north Jakarta was sparked by resentment among
local residents toward Christian civilian guards of a gambling hall
who had come from the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon. Residents
said a group of Ambonese had attacked a mosque early Sunday.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said. Ninety
percent of Indonesians are Muslim.
	   Two dozen worshipers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
	   Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart. It was not known
where the victim was from.
	   At the nearby Sacred Heart Church, a wedding party fled a crowd
that burst in, breaking altar ornaments and tearing up priests'
robes.
	   Mob leaders tried to exercise some control over the crowds,
urging them not to break into stores.
	   ``We will punish the ones who want to loot,'' one ringleader
shouted.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Thousands
of buildings and vehicles were damaged and looting was widespread.
	   The May rioting was triggered in part by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades, which has sent prices
soaring and stripped millions of people of their jobs.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade. There was no indication of anti-Chinese sentiment in
Sunday's riot.

Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew hospitalized for infection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew has
been hospitalized for an infection from a minor surgical procedure,
state-run television reported Sunday.
	   A statement from Senior Minister Lee's office said he was in
stable condition at the National University Hospital after he was
admitted there Saturday, the report said.
	   Lee, 75, was receiving antibiotics intravenously and was
expected to remain in the hospital ``for the next few days,'' the
statement added.
	   No details about the infection or the surgical procedure were
given.
	   Lee had two angioplasty operations in 1996 to clear a heart
artery, but has since remained in good health.
	   The former prime minister has remained a potent voice in
Singapore politics since he stepped down from official leadership
in 1990.
	   He is credited with steering the small Southeast Asian
city-state from a colonial backwater to a thriving, affluent
nation.

Zimbabwe dismisses Pakistan for 211

<TEXT>
	   SHEIKHUPURA, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe brightened its hopes of
squaring the three-match series when it dismissed Pakistan for 211
in the second one-day international Sunday.
	   Middle-order batsman Hasan Raza scored a snail-paced 46 off 70
balls as a long Pakistan batting line-up crumbled in front of
Zimbabwe bowlers at the Sheikhpurua Stadium.
	   Saqlain Mushtaq, who came in with Pakistan struggling at 153 for
eight in 41 overs, made a rapid 29 that included 15 off medium fast
Neil Johnson's last over, to help Pakistan cross the 200-run mark.
	   He added 57 runs _ the highest partnership in the Pakistan
innings _ with Raza off 53 balls.
	   Medium fast Heath Streak had Mushtaq bowled in the last over
before trapping Raza leg before off the last ball of the innings to
finish with three wickets for 40 runs.
	   Pakistan never recovered from an early collapse as Zimbabwe hit
with three wickets before the 10th over with only 36 runs on board.
	   Saeed Anwar (2) was removed by Johnson in his first over of the
match while Aamir Sohail, who made a match-winning 91 in the first
match, was out for nought off Eddo Brandes.
	   Shahid Afridi, the world record holder of fastest one-day
international century, briefly showed his fireworks in scoring 26
off 30 balls, before he charged down the wicket and was bowled by
Streak.
	   Inzamamul Haq (34) and Yousuf Youhanna (24) put on highest
partnership of 44 runs for the fourth wicket but both fell to
off-spinner Andrew Whittal midway through the innings.
	   Whittal's bowled an economical spell of 10 overs and gave away
just 23 runs for his two valuable wickets.
	   Zimbabwe retained the same team which lost the first match by
four wickets while Pakistan made two changes. Ijaz Ahmed had a bout
of flu and was replaced by Hasan Raza while paceman Shoaib Akhtar
made way for 26-year-old seamer Muhammad Akram.

Ferry bumps into quayside in strong winds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) - A Finnish ferry with 2,600 people on
board crashed into a quayside in heavy winds in the Baltic Sea in
the middle of the night, but no one was injured, the Finnish news
agency STT reported Sunday.
	   The Silja Europa, en route from the Finnish western city of
Turku to Stockholm, Sweden, rammed into the quayside in winds of up
to 20 meters a second (45 mph) during a scheduled stopover in the
Aland islands, a Silja Line representative told STT. The vessel was
slightly damaged.
	   The ship was preliminarily repaired during the night, and it was
due to return to Turku Sunday for more extensive repairs, with most
of the cruise passengers on board. Some 200, who were headed for
Stockholm, disembarked in Mariehamn, the capital of the Aland
islands. They would later be taken to their destination in another
vessel, STT said.
	   The Silja Europa was scheduled to continue its normal run to
Stockholm from Turku on Sunday evening, Seija-Riitta Laakso of
Silja Lines told the news agency.
	   In 1994, the ferry Estonia sank en route from Tallinn, Estonia,
to Stockholm in high seas killing 852 people.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A helicopter made an emergency
landing in a rice paddy in a northern Philippine mountain village,
injuring the husband of Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,
officials said Sunday.
	   The helicopter, carrying five people, apparently was sent out of
control by strong winds Saturday, forcing the pilot to land in
Sagpat village in Benguet province, police said.
	   Police said several villagers helped the five out of the
helicopter, which was damaged in the landing, and called for
assistance.
	   Arroyo's husband, Miguel, who was among the passengers,
complained of back pains and was flown back to Manila, where he was
put into a hospital. Arroyo said her husband was undergoing a
check-up and needed to rest.
	   It was not known whether the other people aboard the helicopter
also were hurt.
	   The chopper was following another helicopter carrying the vice
president, who visited Benguet, a rice- and vegetable- producing
province about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Manila.

Top three teams keep winning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _The national championship picture didn't clear up
at all Saturday as the top three teams kept winning.
	   Tee Martin passed for one touchdown and ran for another and
Shawn Bryson ran for two scores, including a 58-yarder in a
24-point second period, as No. 1 Tennessee overwhelmed
emotionally-drained Kentucky 59-21 at Neyland Stadium.
	   The Vols (10-0, 7-0 SEC) should remain in the top spot in the
BCS standings that will determine which two teams play for the
national championship in the Fiesta Bowl. Tennessee can complete a
perfect season with a win next Saturday at Vanderbilt and a victory
in the SEC title game on Dec. 5 against either Arkansas or
Mississippi State.
	   ``We said after the Florida game, it's not just the win but what
we do after the win,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said, referring to
the 20-17 overtime win over the Gators on Sept. 19. ``And we've
gotten it done. Tennessee hasn't had an undefeated team since 1956,
or a team that's this close to being in the national championship
mix since 1951.
	   ``And we're excited about being a part of all of that.''
	   If Tennessee wins out, Kansas State and UCLA will need to win
their season finales in two weeks and hope the BCS computer tips
the scales in their direction.
	   The second-ranked Wildcats (11-0, 8-0 Big 12), who are one spot
behind UCLA in the BCS standings, got one touchdown pass and one TD
run from Michael Bishop to complete the first undefeated regular
season in school history with a 31-25 win at No. 19 Missouri.
	   ``I can't tell you whether we're the No. 1 team in the nation or
the No. 2 team,'' Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said. ``I haven't
watched Tennessee play. I haven't watched UCLA play.''
	   The third-ranked Bruins beat error-prone Southern California
34-17 to win their 20th straight game behind 109 yards rushing and
four touchdowns from DeShaun Foster.
	   ``Our team's good enough to win 20 games in a row, our team's
good enough to win the Pac-10 championship, our team's good enough
to compete with anyone in the country,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
``If we beat Miami, we should go to the Fiesta Bowl. That's my
opinion.''
	   Looming on the outside if two of those three teams lose, are No.
5 Florida State and No. 7 Ohio State, who beat their arch rivals on
Saturday.
	   Peter Warrick had a 32-yard touchdown reception and threw a
46-yard touchdown pass off a reverse as the Seminoles scored the
final 17 points to beat the Gators 23-12.
	   The Buckeyes beat No. 11 Michigan 31-16 for just the second time
in 11 years to win a share of the Big Ten title. But Ohio State
lost a chance to go to the Rose Bowl when No. 13 Wisconsin beat No.
16 Penn State 24-3.
	   In other games Saturday, it was Mississippi State 22, No. 9
Arkansas 21; No. 10 Notre Dame 39, LSU 36; No. 12 Tulane 48,
Houston 20; No. 14 Georgia 24, Mississippi 17; Oregon State 44, No.
15 Oregon 41 in double overtime; No. 20 Air Force 22, Rice 16; No.
21 Georgia Tech 63, Wake Forest 35; No. 23 Virginia Tech 47,
Rutgers 7; and No. 24 Syracuse 38, Temple 7.
 &UR; No. 1 Tennessee 59, Kentucky 21 &QC; 
	   Kentucky (7-4, 4-4), playing for the first time since last
week's truck crash that killed two men, including one player, and
severely injured another player, was unable generate any offense in
the first half as Tennessee scored on seven consecutive possessions
to take a 38-7 halftime lead.
	   ``I could tell you after the first few series _ we were flat,''
Wildcats coach Hal Mumme said. ``You could just see it in their
eyes. The truth of the matter is you can't go play against great
athletes as a basically emotionless team.''
	   Tim Couch, a pallbearer at his friend Scott Brock's funeral on
Wednesday, was 35-of-56 for 337 yards and two TDs for Kentucky.
 &UR; No. 2 Kansas St. 31, No. 19 Missouri 25 &QC; 
	   Missouri (7-4, 5-3) has lost 35 straight games to Top 10
opponents over the last 17 years and has lost six straight to
Kansas State, but made this one close. Missouri was at the Kansas
State 42 when Corby Jones overthrew John Dausman at the 10 with
1:19 to go.
 &UR; No. 3 UCLA 34, USC 17 &QC; 
	   At Pasadena, Calif., the Trojans (7-4, 5-3) turned the ball over
seven times, including four fumbles in 22{ minutes, as they lost to
UCLA for the eighth straight time.
 &UR; No. 5 Florida St 23, No. 4 Florida 12 &QC; 
	   At Tallahassee, Fla., Sebastian Janikowski kicked three field
goals, and Florida State's top-ranked defense limited the
high-powered Gators (9-2) to just 201 yards and 14 yards rushing.
 &UR; No. 7 Ohio State 31, No. 11 Michigan 16 &QC; 
	   At Columbus, Ohio, Joe Germaine tossed three touchdown passes
and Ohio State turned a pair of punt mistakes into scores as the
Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1) beat the Wolverines (8-3, 7-1) for the first
time in four years.
	   David Boston caught 10 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns
and Michael Wiley ran for 120 yards as John Cooper improved to
2-8-1 against the Wolverines as Buckeyes coach.
	   ``I don't feel like I've lost a game, and I'm not going to take
credit for winning this game today,'' Cooper said.
 &UR; Mississippi St. 22, No. 9 Arkansas 21 &QC; 
	   At Starkville, Miss., Brian Hazelwood kicked a 27-yard field
goal with seven seconds left as Mississippi State upset Arkansas to
take control of the SEC West race.
	   Mississippi State (7-3, 5-2) wins the SEC West title if it can
win at Mississippi on Thursday night, or if Arkansas (8-2, 5-2)
losses at LSU the following day.
 &UR; No. 10 Notre Dame 39, LSU 36 &QC; 
	   At South Bend, Ind., Jarious Jackson passed for 276 yards, ran
for 80 more and engineered the winning touchdown drive as Notre
Dame (9-1) beat LSU (4-6) to keep alive its hopes for a BCS
appearance.
 &UR; No. 12 Tulane 48, Houston 20 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Shaun King threw a career-high five touchdown
passes as Tulane remained unbeaten and won the Conference USA
championship. The Green Wave (10-0, 6-0) accepted the automatic bid
to the Liberty Bowl if they are not invited to the BCS.
 &UR; No. 13 Wisconsin 24, No. 16 Penn State 3 &QC; 
	   At Madison, Wis., Tom Burke had four sacks, and Nick Davis
scored on an 82-yard punt return as the Badgers beat Penn State
(7-3, 4-3) to earn a probable berth in the Rose Bowl. Ohio State,
Michigan and Wisconsin finished 7-1 in the Big Ten, but the Badgers
(10-1) won the tiebreaker.
 &UR; No. 14 Georgia 24, Mississippi 17 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Ga., Olandis Gary ran for 132 yards and two
touchdowns, and Georgia (8-2, 6-2 SEC) stopped Mississippi (6-3,
4-4) twice at the 1-yard line.
 &UR; Oregon St. 44, No. 15 Oregon 41, 2OT &QC; 
	   Ken Simonton ran for a 16-yard touchdown in the second overtime
to stun Oregon (8-3, 5-3 Pacific-10) in one of the wildest of the
102 Civil War games.
	   Simonton, who had 157 yards rushing and four touchdowns, broke
through the line on second-and-1, ran right and barely made it into
the end zone, and the crowd stormed the field for the second time
of the game.
	   The Beavers (5-6, 2-6) thought they won in the first overtime,
when Simonton scored his third touchdown and they appeared to stop
Oregon on downs. Thousands of fans stormed the field, but a flag
was thrown for pass interference giving the Ducks a first down.
Four plays later Oregon tied the game.
 &UR; No. 20 Air Force 22, Rice 16 &QC; 
	   At Air Force, Mike Tyler returned an interception 26 yards for a
touchdown with 8:23 remaining, as the Falcons claimed a berth in
the WAC championship game.
	   Air Force (10-1, 7-1 WAC) clinched the WAC's Mountain Division
title and will meet Pacific champion Brigham Young for the league
title on Dec. 5 in Las Vegas.
 &UR; No. 21 Georgia Tech 63, Wake Forest 35 &QC; 
	   At Atlanta, Charlie Rogers scored three touchdowns and Joe
Hamilton threw for two other scores as Georgia Tech (8-2, 7-1 ACC)
grabbed a share of the ACC title and a Gator Bowl bid.
 &UR; No. 23 Virginia Tech 47, Rutgers 7 &QC; 
	   At Blacksburg, Va., Al Clark threw two long touchdown passes to
Ricky Hall in the first half, and Virginia Tech (8-2, 5-2 Big East)
returned two of its six interceptions for touchdowns.
 &UR; No. 24 Syracuse 38, Temple 7 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, Dee Brown ran for two touchdowns, Quentin
Harris returned a 47-yard interception for another score and Rob
Konrad added a 2-yard TD run as Syracuse (7-3, 5-1) beat Temple
(2-9, 2-5) to advance to a showdown with Miami for the Big East
title.

30,000 homeless following deadly China quakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Some 30,000 people are living outside in cold
winter conditions following a series of earthquakes in southwest
China, officials said Sunday.
	   Two earthquakes Thursday in the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County in
Yunnan province and neighboring Yanyuan County in Sichuan province
killed three people and injured 1,543, at least 211 of them
seriously, officials and state media said.
	   The quakes of magnitude 5 and 6.2 caused 12,370 houses to
collapse and damaged another 161,331, the Yunnan Civil Affairs
Bureau said.
	   The area was also hit by three other quakes of magnitude 5 or
above in October. Following the latest quakes, some 30,000 people
are living outside in snow, rain and nighttime temperatures as low
as zero Celsius (32 Fahrenheit), the bureau said.
	   ``The situation is extremely serious,'' with winter clothes,
food and medicine lacking, it said.
	   Yunnan's Seismology Bureau said it could not rule out the
possibility of another quake in the area, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   It said 1,000 tents and 1,000 blankets were sent to the area but
``are far from adequate.''
	   At an emergency meeting Sunday, Yunnan's provincial government
ordered the collection of another 2,000 quilts, 3,000 blankets,
construction material, disinfectants and medicine for quake-hit
areas.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not let chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler dictate his own terms in the search for
the country's most dangerous weapons, the newspaper of the ruling
Baath Party said Sunday.
	   Al-Thawra, which usually states the government's view, said
Butler and his inspectors were behaving as if they were the victor
in the latest confrontation with the United Nations over arms
inspections.
	   The inspectors returned to work last week. Iraq had cut off all
dealings with them in two steps during August and October, but it
rescinded both decisions Nov. 14, barely averting military strikes
by the United Sates and Britain.
	   ``He (Butler) has started speaking the language of a victor who
dictates his conditions,'' said a commentary by a senior Al-Thawra
editor, referring to Butler's demand to see certain Iraqi defense
documents.

North Korea: land of political slogans and no sunglasses
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) _ Some 800 South Koreans returned
Sunday from an unprecedented sightseeing tour in North Korea with
impressions of a communist land of political slogans, few vehicles
and no sunglasses.
	   During their four-night, five-day tour to a scenic mountain on
the North's east coast, the South Koreans were repeatedly told not
to wear sunglasses.
	   Tour organizers explained that in North Korea, sunglasses are
regarded as a status symbol for high-ranking government officials
or military generals.
	   North Korean leader Kim Jong Il often appears in newspaper
photographs or on television wearing sunglasses during his
inspection trips to military units and other facilities.
	   ``If you wear sunglasses, ordinary North Koreans may be confused
and think there are many high-ranking officials in the tour
group,'' one Hyundai tour official quipped.
	   The South Korean visitors saw only one North Korean man wearing
sunglasses in a chauffeur-driven car with a Pyongyang plate number.
His identity was unknown.
	   As 11 sleek tour buses drove down a cement-paved road
exclusively built for tourists, shabby-looking North Koreans walked
across fields or along dirt paths running alongside, many carrying
heavy bags on their heads or backs.
	   Many also were working in the fields, using only small tools
such as shovels, picks and hand carts. None appeared to pay any
attention to the visitors
	   During a one-hour drive, South Koreans saw only two trucks, two
military motorized bikes and one tractor-driven cart, in which
several people were riding.
	   With limited means of transportation, walking has become a
routine part of life for most North Koreans.
	   ``The general (Kim Jong Il) has said that walking is good for
health,'' Chung Kum-chul, a North Korean tourist worker, said.
	   North Korea is awash with signs and slogans demanding or
pledging loyalty to leader Kim Jong Il. You can't turn a corner or
pass a hill without seeing a slogan or sign for Kim and his
philosophy of self-reliance.
	   There are more political slogans than road signs on the streets.
Every place visited by the late Great Leader Kim Il Sung and and
his son, Kim Jong Il, has been made a historical site with huge
revolutionary signs.
	   The first slogan that came into sight as the tourists arrived at
Changjon port aboard a cruise ship last Thursday was: ``Let's
protect with life the revolutionary headquarters led by Comrade Kim
Jong Il.''
	   Every large, flat rock located at vantage points visible to
tourists and passers-by has been painted with a political slogan.
	   Letters of a slogan carved on a huge boulder on Diamond Mountain
were 10 meters (yards) wide and 15 meters (yards) long.
	   A female North Korean tourist guide proudly said that more than
600 dynamite sticks were needed to carve one eight-letter slogan
that means in English: ``Kim Jong Il, the lodestar of
self-reliance.''
	   The carving produced 370 truck-loads of rock fragments.

Eight die in hospital from expired saline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Eight patients in a Bangladesh
hospital died hours after being given intravenous saline that
turned out to be old while 15 others developed high fever,
newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The incident caused panic at the Rangpur Medical College on
Saturday night and doctors immediately removed the saline bottles
hooked on to patients who developed the fever, local newspapers
reported, quoting officials.
	   The government immediately ordered a probe into the deaths and
the supply last month of some 4,000 bottles of saline solution that
had expired in 1982. Details of the incident were sketchy.

Howell wins first professional tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quotes, new material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Englishman David Howell claimed his
first professional golf tournament Sunday with a seven-stroke
victory in the Australian PGA Championship at Sydney's New South
Wales course.
	   Howell led after all of the first three rounds and extended his
overnight margin of six strokes with a closing round of 4-under-par
68 to finish with a 13-under-par total of 275.
	   His winning score was the lowest by four strokes in the four
occasions the tournament has been held on the tough links course in
the 1990s.
	   No one got closer than five shots from Howell on Sunday.
Trinidad's Stephen Ames and Australian Terry Price tied for second
place with closing scores of 68 and 69 respectively.
	   Howell, a 23-year-old from Swindon, recently completed his third
season on the European tour and his previous best placing in a pro
tournament was a second to countryman Lee Westwood in the Loch
Lomond International in Scotland this year.
	   Howell felt he had it won from the start of the back nine after
turning seven shots clear with birdies at the seventh and eighth
holes.
	   ``Really the whole of the back nine I knew I was totally in
control if I kept my head so it was a nice way to score my first
win,'' said Howell, who set the seal on it with further birdies on
the 12th and 15th holes.
	   Price acknowledged the chasers had failed to apply pressure on
Howell.
	   ``I was disappointed with the fact that I let it (putting
problems) get to me,'' said Price, who was a runnerup in 1994.
	   ``I played nicely in the first 12 holes but nothing was
happening and I got frustrated and let it creep into my long
game.'' (djp)

Rebels kill 3 people, abduct 40 in western Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels killed three people and abducted
another 40, including two policemen, in an attack on a village and
police station in western Uganda, it was reported Sunday.
	   The attack by the Allied Democratic Forces occurred Saturday at
Mandako village near administrative town of Fort Portal, about 316
kilometers (196 miles) west of Kampala, said the Central
Broadcasting Service.
	   The privately-own radio station said the raiders burned the
police station in the village about 12 kilometers (7 miles) west of
Fort Portal.
	   After raiding Mandako, the rebels attacked a nearby village near
a technical college which they raided last year and burned eight
students to death, said The Monitor newspaper.
	   The privately-owned newspaper made no mention of casualties at
the second village.
	   The rebels have their bases on the Congo side of the slopes of
the Rwenzori Mountains.
	   President Yoweri Museveni Museveni has said Ugandan troops are
in eastern Congo to fight the rebels, who began attacking Uganda
more than two years ago.
	   The rebels say they want to topple Museveni's government.
	   Meanwhile, police and army rounded up more than 4,000 people
around Kampala and in the northern administrative town of Gulu,
about 360 kilometers (223 miles) north Kampala, said The Monitor
and the CBS.
	   The radio said 4,000 people were rounded up in Gulu and taken to
the local stadium for questioning. The broadcast said authorities
were trying to identify sympathizers of the rebel Lord's Resistance
Army.
	   The LRA has bases in southern Sudan, Uganda's northern neighbor,
and draws its support from the Acholi people who inhabit Gulu
district. The rebels also want to oust Museveni.
	   The broadcast did not give the number of those detained after
the questioning.
	   The Monitor said about 100 people were arrested in Kampala and
its neighborhoods. It quoted police spokesman Bob Ngobi as saying
most of those arrested were suspected robbers.

Author Taslima Nasrin gets bail in a blasphemy case
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Emerging from her hideout author
Taslima Nasrin on Sunday surrendered to an appeal court to answer
charges of blaspheming Islam and was freed on bail.
	   ``I'm happy to be freed on bail, but my life is still at risk as
the Muslim fundamentalists have theratened to kill me,'' Nasrin,
36, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her
hideout.
	   Facing death threats from Islamic extremists, the writer of has
been hiding since her return to Bangladesh in September with her
mother, who is dying from colon cancer.
	   Nasrin, a poet, novelist and essayist, fled her homeland four
years ago because of the death threats and street protests that
erupted after a newspaper quoted her as saying Islam's holy book,
the Koran should be rewritten.
	   A few days after her return home a lower court ordered her
arrest in a 1994 blasphemy case filed by a Dhaka resident, who
accused her of hurting the sentiments of Muslims in her
``Nirbachityo Column'' or ``Selected Columns'', a compilation of
her newspaper articles.
	   Sunday's ruling from the High Court came after Dhaka district
court rejected her bail petition early this month and asked her to
surrender to the lower court by Jan.5.
	   Sunday is a working day in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh,
where sabbath day is observed on Friday.
	   Escorted by family members and lawyers Nasrin drove to the High
court and pleaded not guilty. She quickly left the court surrounded
by the family members.
	   Nasrin writes against male chauvinism and advocates for more
rights for women in her male-dominated society.
	   She has denied that she has made any comments against Islam's
holy book, but says she called for changes in Islamic laws to give
Muslim women more rights.
	   Her denial did not calm down her angry critics, who have offered
200,000 takas(dlrs 5,000) for anyone who kills her.
	   ``I've no freedom to move in my own country because the
fundamentalists are out to kill me,'' Nasrin said, ``But I'll never
bow to them.''

Government bails out bank weighed down by bad parastatal loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The government has undertaken a
2-billion-shilling (dlrs 33.3 million) bailout of Kenya's
fourth-largest bank after panic withdrawals by depositors, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae said depositors at the National
Bank of Kenya withdrew 1.6 billion shillings (dlrs 26 million) last
week.
	   At an unusual Saturday news conference, Nyachae told reporters
there was a plot to frighten the bank's depositors as part of a
wider scheme to compel the government to lower cash ratios banks
must hold and save troubled small banks through provision of soft
loans.
	   The troubled government-run National Social Security Fund is the
National Bank of Kenya's majority shareholder and depositor.
	   Nyachae said the government ``would not be arm-twisted.''
	   ``There are rules and regulations to be followed,'' he said.
	   Nyachae said the National Bank of Kenya was ``sound and
healthy'' but was burdened with non-performing loans, many of them
to semi-governmental parastatal firms as well as to well-connected
politicians.
	   Many of the loans were granted between 1990 and 1993.
	   Nyachae, who declared Kenya broke six months ago, said the
government has made arrangements to pay directly to the bank money
it owes to private contractors, who in turn, owe the banks huge
sums of money.
	   Since October, the Central Bank of Kenya has placed three
private banks under statutory management, and several others have
folded.
	   Nyachae advised commercial banks to discourage ``inside
lending'' to shareholders and directors and advised against
accepting undeveloped title deeds to land as collateral.

Kotonishiki wins Kyushu tournament with 14-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Kotonishiki, the first sumo wrestler ever
to win two tournaments while ranked lower than junior champion,
improved his record to 14-1 Sunday before receiving his trophy for
the 15-day Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   The No. 12 maegashira (senior wrestler), ranked near the bottom
of the senior makuuchi division, already had clinched the title
Saturday when he reached 13-1 by driving out ozeki (champion)
Takanonami.
	   On Sunday, he put both hands inside on the belt of equally
ranked Kyokushuzan and bulldozed him out.
	   Kotonishiki's only defeat came at the hands of yokozuna (grand
champion) Wakanohana on the 12th day.
	   Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, finished at 8-7.
	   ``I won the tournament because of support from all of you and I
tried as hard as I could,'' the 30-year-old Kotonishiki told
spectators.
	   He collected the winner's prize of 10 million yen (dlrs 83,000),
in addition to his seventh outstanding performance award and his
eighth technique prize, each worth 2 million yen (dlrs 17,000).
	   Kotonishiki had won only one previous title, in 1991, when he
was a 23-year-old maegashira No. 5. Above the maegashira ranks,
there are four champion ranks, from grand champion to junior
champion second class.
	   In the day's final bout, yokozuna Takanohana twisted out ozeki
Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, and wound up the
tournament at 12-3. Musashimaru ended at 11-4.
	   Takanohana had helped Kotonishiki clinch the tournament Saturday
when he defeated the leader's closest rival, No. 9 maegashira
Tosanoumi.
	   On Sunday, Tosanoumi pulled down No. 4 maegashira Tamakasuga and
received his fourth fighting spirit prize, worth 2 million yen
(dlrs 17,000), for his 12-3 record, including a victory over
Wakanohana.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai thrust out Wakanohana and
finished at 10-5, with Wakanohana at 9-6.
	   Komusubi (junior champion second class) Musoyama sent out ozeki
Takanonamai (8-7) and ended at 9-6.
	   Yokozuna Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, missed the
tournament with a back injury and needs a little more time to
recover, since light exercise still gives him pain, his training
stable master, Azumazeki, or Jesse Kuhaulua from Hawaii, was quoted
by Kyodo News agency as saying.
	   No. 1 maegashira Tochiazuma sent out No. 4 maegashira Toki (7-8)
and received his third technique prize for his 10-5 record.
	   Since he lost a majority of his bouts, Toki may be demoted in
rank before the next tournament, starting Jan. 10.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below makuuchi, No.
10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, pulled
down No. 8-ranked Toyonoumi, leaving both wrestlers at 8-7.
	   Juryo's No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam
Nyamjav, ended at 6-9, losing to makuuchi's No. 14 maegashira
Akinoshu (4-11) by a driving technique.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 56-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, twisted down No.
52-ranked Minami and finished at 5-2.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Indonesian rioters wreck church during wedding service

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ It was the wedding from hell. Before
groom Chandra Gunarto and bride Threewaty could say ``I do,'' they
had to run for their lives.
	   An angry mob of Muslim youths ran through the front doors of the
Sacred Heart Catholic Church near Jakarta's Chinatown after burning
down a nearby Protestant church during a neighborhood riot that
witnesses said started when a group of people attacked a local
mosque.
	   At least six people were killed in Sunday's violence, which came
a week after a wave of deadly student protests and riots.
	   Inside the church, the mob overturned the pews, broke plaster
statues and smashed up the confessional boxes.
	   ``We were standing at the altar and, suddenly, rocks shattered
all the stain glass windows,'' said Chandra, a 27-year-old sales
manager.
	   ``We got out as quickly as we could. We're still not married.
But we're safe,'' said Threewaty, also 27, who goes by only one
name.
	   ``We have been planning our wedding for more than nine months,''
she said sobbing. ``We've canceled the reception.''
	   The couple, the priest and about 60 guests ran to a community
hall at the rear of the church and barricaded themselves in as the
rioters went wild.
	   They ransacked the vestry, pulling the robes from closets and
throwing chalices and candlesticks on the floor, which was covered
in broken glass.
	   They lit fires inside and took pews out into the street. They
set them afire and burned dozens of Bibles and prayer books in the
bonfire. Hundreds of torn pages littered the road.
	   Riot officers broke up the melee with warning shots.
	   ``I just don't understand why they did this,'' the Rev. Soni
Wangkang said as he surveyed the wreckage.
	   A few hundred meters (yards) away, a crowd of several hundred
Muslim youths sat in the middle of a road and recited Islamic
prayers as heavily armed riot squads watched.
	   Some youths carried banners proclaiming them as members of the
``Front to Defend Islam.''
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making Indonesia the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy.
	   Wangkang said many of his 6,000 parishioners are ethnic Chinese,
a racial minority in Indonesia who have been targeted in a series
of riots in recent times because of their success in business.
	   ``But many of our people are also Indonesians. All sorts of
ethnic groups worship here,'' he said.
	   Local radio station Sonora read out long lists of Christian
wedding services that were canceled across Jakarta after Sunday's
riot.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Muslim rioters set fire to
a Protestant church and a gambling hall Sunday and hurled rocks at
soldiers who fired warning shots and tear gas. At least six people
were killed, some of them mutilated.
	   Mobs also ransacked a Roman Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was under way, smashing stained glass windows, chalices
and a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles on to
a bonfire.
	   A nearby Catholic girls' school was also trashed.
	   The ethnic and religious violence was the latest sign that the
military is increasingly hard-pressed to keep order in Indonesia's
sprawling capital of 11 million people. The nation of 202 million
is also enduring the strain of economic hardship.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms. That fighting triggered
mob riots in several parts of Jakarta.
	   In the rioting Sunday, crowds blocked fire trucks from reaching
the burning Christian Church of Ketapang. A police helicopter
hovered above thousands of people roaming the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Shops were shut in the area, less than a kilometer (one-half
mile) from the state palace of President B.J. Habibie.
	   The fighting in north Jakarta was sparked by resentment among
local residents toward Christian civilian guards of a gambling hall
who had come from the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon. Residents
said a group of Ambonese had attacked a mosque early Sunday.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said. Ninety
percent of Indonesians are Muslim.
	   Two dozen worshipers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
	   Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart. It was not known
where the victim was from.
	   At the nearby Sacred Heart Church, a wedding party fled a crowd
that burst in, breaking altar ornaments and tearing up priests'
robes.
	   Mob leaders tried to exercise some control over the crowds,
urging them not to break into stores.
	   ``We will punish the ones who want to loot,'' one ringleader
shouted.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Thousands
of buildings and vehicles were damaged and looting was widespread.
	   The May rioting was triggered in part by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades, which has sent prices
soaring and stripped millions of people of their jobs.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade. There was no indication of anti-Chinese sentiment in
Sunday's riot.

Report: Iraq will not let Butler dictate his terms

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not let chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler dictate his own terms in the search for
the country's most dangerous weapons, the newspaper of the ruling
Baath Party said Sunday.
	   Al-Thawra, which usually states the government's view, said
Butler and his inspectors were behaving as if they were the victor
in the latest confrontation with the United Nations over arms
inspections.
	   The inspectors returned to work last week. Iraq had cut off all
dealings with them in two steps during August and October, but it
rescinded both decisions Nov. 14, barely averting military strikes
by the United Sates and Britain.
	   ``He (Butler) has started speaking the language of a victor who
dictates his conditions,'' Al-Thawra said in a commentary written
by senior editor Iman Ahmad, referring to Butler's demand to see
certain Iraqi defense documents.
	   ``It is a mean victory,'' the paper added. ``Butler imagines
that he is armed with the presence of American troops and therefore
he has lost his balance.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also said Sunday that some
documents Butler wants cannot be found or would take so long to
wade through that a promised U.N. Security Council review of Iraq's
cooperation in weapons destruction would never take place.
	   ``He has asked for alleged documents that do not exist,'' Aziz
told reporters after a symposium attended by Arab officials from
half a dozen Arab countries in solidarity with Iraq.
	   Aziz said Butler was asking ``for access to all the archives of
the government of Iraq.... It is quite provocative if you want to
dig in the whole archives ... which might take decades.''
	   The deputy prime minister said Butler could be trying to create
the climate for an attack by the huge U.S. force which remains in
the Gulf.
	   ``He is either creating a superficial pretext to justify
aggression or he is undermining or confusing the preparation for
the comprehensive review,'' Aziz said.
	   The review _ which Iraq hopes will lead to an easing of U.N.
sanctions on the country _ is to take place when the inspectors
declare that Baghdad is complying with their demands.
	   Despite mounting tension over arms documents, U.N. weapons
inspectors have been visiting suspected sites with no obstruction
from Iraq.
	   The inspectors made their first surprise visit to a potential
arms-making facility Saturday. They went into the field again
Sunday, but their spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not reveal the
number of teams or places they would visit.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   The sanctions ban the free export of oil and have devastated
Iraq's economy. Iraq insists it has met the Security Council's
requirements, but the inspectors charge it has not come clean about
its weapons programs.
	   Butler has demanded that Baghdad hand over an air force document
that is a log of chemical ordnance used during the 1980-1988
Iraq-Iran war. His inspectors found the document in July, but Iraq
is refusing to give it to them in its entirety.
	   Iraq says part of the air force document concerns its national
security, which it believes should be off-limits to the inspectors.
	   Iraqi officials, speaking privately, have said they fear
publicizing the log will strain relations with Iran since it
details amounts of chemical weapons the Iraqi air force dropped on
the Iranians during the war.
	   Iraq is also resisting handing Butler all its Defense Ministry
documents since they would expose Iraq's strategy and the weapons
it used against Iran and in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Butler also is asking for documents on Iraq's biological weapons
program and for prison records to see whether humans were used in
experiments on biological weapons. Iraq flatly denies the charge.

Kwame Ture _ the ex-Stokely Carmichael _ to be buried in Guinea

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Kwame Ture, the 1960s radical who spread
the cry of ``Black Power'' throughout the United States and the
world was to be buried Sunday in his adopted African homeland.
	   Ture, who changed his name from Stokely Carmichael after he
moved from the United States to Guinea in 1968, died Sunday of
prostate cancer at age 57.
	   Ture, who spent nearly his entire adult life preaching the
ideals of leftist revolution, will be memorialized Sunday with a
service at the university in Conakry and then buried in a public
cemetery, friends say.
	   Dozens of Ture's friends have been asked to come to Ture's
funeral, including Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan and Ture's first ex-wife, the South African singer
Miriam Makeba.
	   It was not yet clear who would be attending.
	   Ture, who was born in Trinidad but raised in New York, began his
political career began as a college student in the 1960s, helping
to integrate public transportation in the American South as a
freedom rider. He soon became one of the best-known _ and most
fiery _ figures of the era, popularizing the term ``Black Power''
and changing the way the once-nonviolent civil rights movement was
viewed.
	   He headed the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee, an
important center of leftist activism in the `60s, and later became
the honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers.
	   Angered by the Panthers moves to ally themselves with white
radicals, Carmichael left the group, changed his name and moved to
Guinea in 1968, invited by Guinea's brutal Marxist dictator, Sekou
Toure.
	   Ture quickly became a fringe political figure and a man largely
forgotten except for his `60s activism. He spent the rest of his
life lecturing and writing, preaching black power and championing
socialism while condemning America, capitalism and Zionism.

Report: Mid-air collision averted in northern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An eight-seater jet swerved four seconds
before it would have collided with an Indian Airlines Airbus-320
near a northern city, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Three years ago, two commercial jetliners collided near New
Delhi, killing all 349 people on board in the world's worst midair
collision.
	   Since then, at least a dozen near-miss incidents have been
reported in and around India's capital.
	   The mass-circulation Indian Express newspaper reported that the
pilot of the Haryana state government's King Air jet with three
people on board swerved Friday when he saw the Airbus with about
150 people on board approaching at the same altitude near
Chandigarh, the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states.
	   The paper quoted aviation officials as saying the King Air jet
was instructed to maintain an altitude of 3,500 meters (11,500
feet). A few minutes after reaching that altitude at a speed of 400
kph (250 mph), pilot Bhushan Nanda found the Airbus, which was
flying in from New Delhi, approaching some 400 meters (yards) away
on the same altitude. The Airbus was flying at a speed of about 600
kph (375 mph).
	   The Indian Airlines pilot, said he never saw the eight-seater
jet. The paper quoted him as saying that the Chandigarh air traffic
control had asked him to descend to 11,500 feet as he was preparing
to land.
	   Chandigarh is 225 kilometers (140 miles) north of New Delhi.
	   Officials at Chandigarh airport were not immediately available
for comment. The government's air safety directorate routinely
investigates all complaints of violations of safety rules.
	   Indian air traffic controllers separate aircraft by a height of
1,000 feet (305 meters) over its crowded air corridors.

Tanker and icebreaker unable to reach port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Thick ice prevented a nuclear-powered icebreaker
from clearing a path for a tanker bringing fuel to frozen villages
along the Arctic coast in Russia's Far East, a news agency reported
Sunday.
	   The icebreaker Sovietsky Soyuz, accompanying the tanker Uiku,
was unable to clear a channel to the East Siberian Sea port of
Pevek in the Far Eastern Chukchi autonomous region, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   The Sovietsky Soyuz was able to break through the ice, but by
the time it returned to the tanker, the channels had frozen over
again with one-meter (yard) thick ice, the report said.
	   The two vessels on Sunday were about 130 kilometers (80 miles)
from Pevek, situated about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) west of the
Bering Strait, which separates Russia and Alaska.
	   They had hoped to reach Pevek Saturday and deliver the badly
needed fuel which would allow local villagers to remain through the
winter, but were able to negotiate only 13 kilometers (8 miles)
over a 12-hour period, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The vessels drifted Sunday while they waited for air
reconnaissance to provide information on clear waterways to the
coast, ITAR-Tass said.

Roving teams of teachers to be deployed in Philippine hinterlands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government will send about 300
teachers in roving teams to hinterland villages, including those
infested with communist or Muslim rebels, to teach residents
reading, writing and arithmetic, an official said Sunday.
	   The tutorial program, which starts next month, is aimed at
out-of-school youths and illiterate senior citizens, the official
said.
	   Although the Philippines has a high literacy rate, many remote
rural and tribal areas remain out of reach of basic government
services like education.
	   Education Undersecretary Victor Andres Manhit said the teachers
would teach 40 hours a week in each area until residents learn how
to read and write and do basic mathematics. He did not say how long
the program would last.
	   Manhit said the program is part of President Joseph Estrada's
promise to reach out to illiterate Filipinos in remote areas and
those isolated by the country's insurgency problems.
	   Estrada, who took office in June, has promised to devote his
six-year term to easing the plight of millions of poor Filipinos.

Assyrians occupy Swiss church in support of Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Some 60 Assyrian Christians have
occupied a Zurich church in support of Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, city police said Sunday.
	   The group of men, women and children entered the Fraumuenster
church in the heart of the old town Saturday afternoon, announcing
they intended to start a hunger strike aimed at preventing Ocalan's
extradition from Italy to Turkey.
	   Church officials abandoned attempts to have them forcibly
removed after two men doused themselves with gasoline. The group
identified itself as belonging to the ``Bethnahrin Patriotic
Revolutionary Organization.''
	   Assyrians are recognized as a minority in Turkey.
	   Ocalan was freed in Rome Saturday amid a barrage of protests
from Turkey, which wants him handed over as a terrorist.
	   Leaving the hospital where he'd been in custody, he told the
thousands of Kurds from throughout Europe who came to Rome in his
support to return home.
	   Ocalan was freed by a court decision Friday rejecting a Turkish
warrant for his arrest because Italian law forbids extradition to
countries where someone faces the death penalty. The court said
Ocalan had to stay in Rome, but that order could be lifted next
month.

Tense Central African Republic goes to legislative polls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls opened at around 0600 GMT. Voting is due to end at
around 1900 GMT and early results are not expected until at least
Monday.

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Voters in the troubled
Central African Republic went to the polls on Sunday in the first
round of legislative elections held despite fears of ethnic
violence.
	   United Nations peacekeepers and government soldiers cruised the
streets and guarded polling stations in the capital of Bangui,
where there were no early reports of fighting.
	   However, voting began about two hours later than scheduled at
around 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) as a result of lack of election materials.
Electoral commission officials said polling would continue until at
least 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) to compensate for the delay.
	   Thousands lined up patiently in the streets at several voting
points in the capital that were without voting cards. Other rural
villages were hampered by the lack of supervisors or international
observers, National Electoral Commission officials said.
	   The vote began despite President Ange-Felix Patasse's bid to
postpone it amid growing concerns the elections could trigger
ethnic fighting or reignite insurrection by the military.
	   At least five people have been killed in recent weeks of
pre-election violence that authorities say was linked to ethnic
rivalries.
	   More than 840 candidates are vying for 109 parliamentary seats,
the vast majority of which are now controlled by Patasse's ruling
Movement for the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique, or MLPC.
	   At least 23 opposition parties are putting up candidates, many
chosen on ethnic lines _ a move that threatens to exacerbate
already tense relations between the country's various groups.
	   A second round is expected to be held in December.
	   Elections officials have conceded that facilities for polling
stations in some outlying areas have not received proper equipment
or ballots while other areas have failed to complete voter
registration.
	   Through the 1960s and '70s, the Central African Republic fell
under the tyrannical rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel Bokassa,
who was accused of corruption murder, torture and cannibalism
before being ousted in a bloodless 1979 coup.
	   In his wake, the Central African Republic remains a troubled and
isolated country that at times appears to be teetering on anarchy.
Armed bandits frequently attack motorists and rival factions fight
for territory.
	   Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against Patasse, whose election win in 1993 ended more
than a decade of army rule.
	   For years, French troops helped maintain a semblance of
stability until they pulled out earlier this year. A United Nations
peacekeeping force replaced the French.
	   Independent from French colonial rule since 1960, the Central
African Republic has lurched from one crisis to the next for much
of that time.

Socialist finance ministers prepare euro-zone cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE expected around 1900 GMT after start of meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gather Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The ministers are set to formally release a document entitled
``The New European Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to
use their new ascendancy in the EU to make growth and job-creation
the top economic priority.
	   Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15
nations, including the four largest - Germany, France, Italy and
Britain.
	   ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together an open,
competitive and successful economy with a just and human society,''
says a draft of the program posted on the Internet by European
socialist parties.
	   ``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment
society, a society in which there are job opportunities for all
citizens.''
	   The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be
staying out of the euro project for now.
	   The socialist ministers will meet at a Brussels hotel on the eve
of the regular monthly meeting of all 15 EU nations, the first for
Lafontaine who took office after his Social Democratic Party won
elections in September.
	   In their nine-page ``policy agenda'' the socialist ministers
support public spending on infrastructure and public services as
``vital for the future of the prosperity of our society'' and call
for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a stake in
the development of the European economy.''
	   However the document also insists tight budgets are essential to
underpin the euro's stability. It lists ``a commitment to monetary
stability (and) sustained fiscal discipline'' as priorities.
	   The socialists call on the new European Central Bank to take
account of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its
starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc.
	   EU ministers will be able to repeat their recent calls for lower
rates Monday when they are joined by Wim Duisenberg, the central
bank's president. So far, he has been unmoved, pledging to use the
ECB's legal independence from governments to resist political
pressure.
	   Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy
differences persist among the socialists.
	   Britain has little time for French and Italian plans to impose
shorter working weeks. The French are wary of British- and
Dutch-style labor market flexibility. Several countries have doubts
about French plans to raise cash for huge pan-European road and
rail projects, and Britain rejects talk of setting EU-wide taxation
rates.
	   Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when ministers
debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to the
Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder
more of the burden.

England's Westwood wins Dunlop Phoenix
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYAZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Lee Westwood, helped by a tree for one of
his two birdies, shot a one-under-par 70 Sunday and won in Japan
for the second consecutive week, taking the Dunlop Phoenix
tournament by three strokes.
	   The English golfer collected 45 million yen (dlrs 375,000) from
a purse of 250 million yen (dlrs 2 million) for his seventh victory
of the season. He also won four tournaments in Europe and one in
the United States.
	   Westwood started Sunday's final round two strokes ahead of
Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland. Both players made an early bogey
before Clarke birdied the seventh, cutting the margin to one shot.
	   Clarke had a chance to draw level at the eighth, but missed a
10-foot (3-meter) birdie putt.
	   Westwood went ahead by two again with a birdie on the ninth, and
by three on the 465-yard, par-4 10th, where his 4-iron shot headed
to the left, hit a tree, and bounced on to the green.
	   He sank a 50-foot (15-meter) putt for birdie.
	   ``That was really the turning point,'' said Westwood.
	   ``When the ball hits a tree and goes on to the green, you're
lucky. As soon as something like that happens, you think it's going
to be your day,'' he added.
	   He finished at 13-under 271 to 274 for Clarke, who shot a 71
Sunday and collected 22.5 million yen (dlrs 188,000) for second.
	   ``My mental attitude this week was as good as it's ever been. It
would be difficult to see how I could have been better around the
greens,'' Westwood said.
	   ``I don't put any pressure on myself,'' he said. ``I'm always
happy if I win but I'm not bothered if I lose. Golf's not the
be-all and end-all. I'm still earning more than the average wage.''
	   Westwood won the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters in Japan last
week and collected 21 million yen (dlrs 175,000) for that, giving
him a total of 66 million yen (dlrs 550,000) for two weeks here.
	   Japan's Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki shot a 72 and placed third with
276.
	   Tied for fourth at 277 were American Jeff Sluman and Japan's
Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki and Shigeki Maruyama. Sluman shot 72,
``Jumbo'' Ozaki 71 and Maruyama the day's best score of 67 on the
6,846-yard, par-71 Phoenix Country Club course.
	   Defending champion Tom Watson of the United States shot a 72 for
294 and tied for 55th with Dinesh Chand of Fiji and Retief Goosen
of South Africa. Chand shot a 71 and Goosen a 74 Sunday.

French interior minister says he will return to post soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement,
recovering from a week-long coma brought on by an allergic reaction
to anesthesia, says he will return to his post ``in the coming
weeks.''
	   Appearing Saturday evening at a film festival in Belfort, in
eastern France, Chevenement said his convalescence was progressing
on schedule.
	   ``God didn't want me, but the devil didn't either, so I came
back,'' Chevenement said.
	   Chevenement's heart stopped for nearly an hour Sept. 2 after he
was administered curare, a muscle relaxant known to cause allergic
reactions in some patients, just ahead of planned gall bladder
surgery. He spent eight days in a coma.
	   The French press had painted a grim picture of the chances of
full recovery for the 59-year-old Chevenement.
	   But doctors said the minister would suffer ``neither physical
nor neurological aftereffects.''
	   Chevenement is a key figure in Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Cabinet.
	   He has held several ministry portfolios in previous governments,
including industry, education and defense. He resigned as defense
minister in 1991 to protest France's involvement in the Gulf War.
	   As interior minister, he is responsible for the nation's police
and security forces.

Officials studying Marcos general's right to military honors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with family spokesman saying Ver's body may be flown
directly to northern Ilocos home province, Ver's mother prefers
burial in hometown, new 13th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government was studying Sunday
whether to accord military funeral honors and burial in a heroes'
cemetery to one of the most powerful generals under the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Gen. Fabian Ver, 78, died Saturday of lung malfunction at a
hospital in Bangkok, a family spokesman said. Ver had been linked
to widespread human rights violations and to the 1983 assassination
of anti-Marcos opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said a military team was
reviewing guidelines to decide whether Ver could be given military
honors when his body is brought back to the Philippines, and
whether he could be buried in a heroes' cemetery in an army camp in
metropolitan Manila.
	   Mercado said other family members of Ver, including three sons
who were former military officers, could return home anytime
because they no longer pose threats to national security.
	   ``Their era has long passed and we don't think there will be
trouble if they return,'' Mercado said in a Manila radio interview.
He added that there has been no request from Ver's family to bury
him in the heroes' cemetery, where military men are traditionally
laid to rest.
	   During Marcos' 20-year rule, Ver headed the presidential
security force before being appointed by Marcos as his chief of
staff.
	   He fled with the Marcos family to Hawaii after the strongman was
ousted in the military-backed ``people power'' revolt in February
1986.
	   Former Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos had banned the
return of Ver and his three sons on grounds they posed a security
threat.
	   President Joseph Estrada, however, had said Ver could return on
condition that he would face the charges against him.
	   Before he died, Ver was able to talk on the telephone to his
wife, Aida, and his youngest daughter, Faida, in California; sons
Wyrlo and Rexor in Hawaii; and another son, Irwin, in San
Francisco, said Mel Amado Jr., a spokesman for the Ver family.
	   Ver underwent lung surgery last year and a gall bladder
operation early this year, which may have led to a deterioration of
his health.
	   Former congressman Roquito Ablan Jr., a close friend of the
Vers, told The Associated Press by telephone from Bangkok that they
planned to bring Ver's body back to Manila Tuesday or Wednesday.
	   Amado, however, said there were plans to send the body directly
to Ver's northern home province of Ilocos from Bangkok. Amado added
that Ver's mother would prefer to bury her son in their hometown of
Sarrat.
	   One of the last images of Ver seen by Filipinos was at the
height of the 1986 revolt when he was urging Marcos during a live
television broadcast to give the order to bomb mutinous troops
holed up in two suburban camps surrounded by hundreds of thousands
of civilian supporters.
	   Ver rose from the rank of private to four-star general in his
four decades in the military.
	   He was accused of involvement in the assassination of Aquino,
Mrs. Aquino's husband, at Manila's airport but was acquitted while
Marcos was still in power.
	   After Mrs. Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial in which 16 soldiers were convicted of killing her husband.
Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in absentia
and the case against him was shelved.
	   The trial, however, failed to determine who ordered the
killing.

Military parade, pledge to fight Israel on independence day

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon marked Independence Day on Sunday
with a military parade and a pledge to fight Israel.
	   Army infantry units marched to a military band and bagpipers,
followed by freshly painted tanks and armored vehicles, along an
avenue near the National Museum in downtown Beirut.
	   The parade route was symbolic of peace and national unity
because it had served as a killing ground and a crossing point
between the divided capital during the 1975-90 civil war between
Muslims and Christians.
	   President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other top
officials looked on. President-elect Emile Lahoud, the army
commander who will be inaugurated Tuesday, stayed away to give
Hrawi his last show as leader but later joined in a reception.
	   On the eve of the 55th Independence from France, Hrawi pledged
in a televised address: ``We will not give up one grain of our
national soil and our national dignity.''
	   Israel occupies 10 percent of Lebanese territory in the south,
which it says is necessary to protect its border towns against
attack. It has held onto the land since 1985, despite efforts by
Lebanese guerrillas to oust occupying the force.
	   Hrawi also reiterated Lebanon's commitment to Middle East peace
based on the ``land for peace'' principle, pledging to stick with
neighboring Syria in any negotiations with Israel.
	   Israel has offered to withdraw from Lebanon in exchange for
security guarantees. Both Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker
in this country where it maintains 30,000 troops, rejected the
offer.
	   Lahoud, who was elected by Parliament Oct. 15 after winning
popular backing and the all-important approval of Syrian President
Hafez Assad, has rebuilt the fractured military since he became the
nation's top general in 1989.
	   He has brought the army closer to Syria's military and has taken
a hard line on the conflict with Israel _ though the army has
largely stayed out of the fighting in the south.
	   ``I am confident that the prime mission of the army will
continue to be the resistance until the end of the Israeli
occupation,'' he said in his Order of the Day comments to the
troops.
	   ``Israel is the enemy ... Syria is the friend,'' Lahoud's orders
said.
	   Despite Sunday's ceremony, some Lebanese feel Independence Day
remains marred by Israel's occupation and Syria's virtual control
of decision-making in this nation wedged between the two powerful
Middle Eastern foes.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a letter to Hrawi that
Washington supports the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Lebanon. He added that the United States remains
committed to achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in
the Middle East.

Slovenes take to municipal polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenians went to the polls Sunday,
in municipal elections that are expected to reflect their wish to
maintain the status-quo of progress toward joining the European
Union and NATO.
	   Though the municipal vote is not directly linked to national
politics, results are likely to show the nation's satisfaction with
their national government.
	   It is expected that the strongest party in the governing
coalition, the Liberal Democratic Party, will maintain its status
as strongest on the municipal level as well. But its coalition
partners, the Peoples Party, may pay the penalty of a series of
scandals within its ranks with a drop in support.
	   The Liberal Democrats look set to collect some 25 percent of the
vote, the Social Democrats, the strongest opposition party, 16
percent, and the United List of Democrats about 13 percent.
	   The People's Party, which came second in 1996 parliamentary
elections, should place fourth, with about 9 percent according to
the polls.
	   Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. local time (0600 GMT) and will
close 12 hours later, with the first preliminary results possible
late in the day. Altogether, 189 municipalities are part of the
vote. General elections are scheduled for 2000.

Iranian police seize 1.4 tons of drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police have seized 1.4 metric tons
(1.5 tons) of drugs in northeastern Iran, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
	   Anti-drug agents in Khorasan province confiscated the opium in
two separate raids on Friday, the agency said.
	   It said two smugglers were arrested during the raids and their
vehicles confiscated.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the
oil-rich Gulf and Europe.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.

Free State rallies against West Indies in SAfrican cricket match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies batting
practice was spoiled by young Johan van der Wath on Sunday as Free
State scored 188 to set a huge 438 for victory on the third day of
their four-day match.
	   The match at Springbok Park is the final first-class fixture
before the first test in a five-match series which starts in
Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   The visitors' final six wickets fell for just 12 runs, as Van
der Wath improved on his fine first innings performance by taking
five wickets for just 26 runs to reduce the West Indies second
innings to rubble. Van der Wath, making his first-class debut,
ended with a match analysis of eight for 87.
	   The visitors' poor batting bodes ill for them going into the
Johannesburg test, where they will be up against bowling better
than even Van der Wath or even Hansie Cronje, who was the other
destroyer with his swing bowling reaping him three for 23.
	   The day started with thoughts of extended batting practice for
the West Indies, and the speculation centered on when Lara would
declare in an attempt to keep the game alive as a spectacle for the
paying public. But in a dramatic final 40 minutes of the innings,
the Free Staters finally looked like the defending four-day
champions of South Africa they are.
	   Free State nearly succumbed to the West Indies pace as opener
Kosie Venter was dropped in the second over the first by the first
innings destroyer Nixon McLean.
	   On Saturday, the West Indies ground their way to a lead of 361
runs in their second innings against Free State.

Britain's Peter Dumbreck wins Formula 3 race
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Britain's Peter Dumbreck outdueled Brazil's Richard
Mauricio and won the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix Sunday by
three-hundredths of a second. Earlier, a fireman was killed and
four other people were injured when a car hit them during a minor
race.
	   The fatal accident occurred during the saloon car event when a
vehicle plowed into two firemen and three other people when they
were trying to put out a fire in another car.
	   Despite a third-place finish in the first half of the race,
Dumbreck drove his Dallara F398 Toyota-TOM'S to victory in the
30-lap race with a combined time of one hour, 12 minutes, 49.588
seconds.
	   ``I went to the last thinking I've just got to finish this lap
because here you're always in danger of going off,'' said Dumbreck.
	   The 6.2-kilometer (3.8-mile) circuit around the Portuguese
enclave's narrow streets and hairpin bends is run in two legs of 15
laps each. Driving at an average 151.26 kph (93.78 mph), Dumbreck
kept behind Mauricio in the second leg, which was good enough for
him to win.
	   Dumbreck had recorded his best time of 2 minutes, 15.727 seconds
in the final lap of the first leg, driving at an average 162.32 kph
(100.86 mph).
	   Although Mauricio was fastest in the second leg, the 19-year-old
Brazilian's fifth-place finish in the first 15 laps left him second
overall with a combined time of 1:12:49.591.
	   Brazil's Enrique Bernoldi finished third in a Dallara F398
Renault-RS, after starting the second leg in the pole position.
	   ``I had a good start, but the problem was everyone just went
past me and I couldn't do anything,'' said the 20-year-old
Bernoldi, who was visibly disappointed at finishing in the same
place he did last year.
	   Mauricio, who recorded the fastest time in Saturday's qualifying
in his Dallara F398 Honda-Mugen, said he ``didn't know why'' he
couldn't shake off the 25-year-old Dumbreck, from Kircadly,
Scotland, the Japanese Formula 3 champion.
	   ``Dumbreck didn't let go. I was so close but he just went ahead
by a fraction of a second,'' said Mauricio, who placed seventh in
the British Formula 3 race early this year.
	   Bas Leinders, a 23-year-old Belgian driver, recorded the fastest
lap, covering the last lap of the first leg in 2 minutes, 14.491
seconds at an average 163.81 kph (101.79 mph). He finished eighth
overall.
	   Macau's 21-year-old Andre Couto brushed the barrier with his
Dallara F397 Opel-Spiess while turning at the notorious 90-degree
Lisboa Bend.
	   Couto swerved, stopped, and restarted. He fell behind the pack,
but caught up and finished seventh.
	   Security for the race was tight after two unidentified men on a
motorcycle hurled a homemade explosive on the circuit Friday. The
motive for the attack was not known.
	   Originally conceived as a weekend treasure hunt in cars, the
event attained Formula 3 status only in 1983. Formula 1 champions
Michael Schumacher, Mikka Hakkinen and David Coulthard all have
driven in this race, Asia's longest-running auto-racing event.

Socialist finance ministers prepare euro-zone cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATE expected around 1900 GMT after start of meeting &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gather Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The ministers are set to formally release a document entitled
``The New European Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to
use their new ascendancy in the EU to make growth and job-creation
the top economic priority.
	   Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15
nations, including the four largest - Germany, France, Italy and
Britain.
	   ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together an open,
competitive and successful economy with a just and human society,''
says a draft of the program posted on the Internet by European
socialist parties.
	   ``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment
society, a society in which there are job opportunities for all
citizens.''
	   The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be
staying out of the euro project for now.
	   The socialist ministers will meet at a Brussels hotel on the eve
of the regular monthly meeting of all 15 EU nations, the first for
Lafontaine who took office after his Social Democratic Party won
elections in September.
	   In their nine-page ``policy agenda'' the socialist ministers
support public spending on infrastructure and public services as
``vital for the future of the prosperity of our society'' and call
for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a stake in
the development of the European economy.''
	   However the document also insists tight budgets are essential to
underpin the euro's stability. It lists ``a commitment to monetary
stability (and) sustained fiscal discipline'' as priorities.
	   The socialists call on the new European Central Bank to take
account of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its
starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc.
	   EU ministers will be able to repeat their recent calls for lower
rates Monday when they are joined by Wim Duisenberg, the central
bank's president. So far, he has been unmoved, pledging to use the
ECB's legal independence from governments to resist political
pressure.
	   Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy
differences persist among the socialists.
	   Britain has little time for French and Italian plans to impose
shorter working weeks. The French are wary of British- and
Dutch-style labor market flexibility. Several countries have doubts
about French plans to raise cash for huge pan-European road and
rail projects, and Britain rejects talk of setting EU-wide taxation
rates.
	   Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when ministers
debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to the
Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder
more of the burden.

Iranian police seize 1.4 tons of drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police have seized 1.4 metric tons
(1.5 tons) of drugs in northeastern Iran, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
	   Anti-drug agents in Khorasan province confiscated the opium in
two separate raids on Friday, the agency said.
	   It said two smugglers were arrested during the raids and their
vehicles confiscated.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to get drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to the
oil-rich Gulf and Europe.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.

Regional officials sign Japanese-Russian agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional Sakhalin governor comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido
Sunday signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation in
Russia's Far East Sakhalin region, a news agency said.
	   The agreement comes at a time of thawing relations between
Russia and Japan, whose leaders are trying to resolve a
half-century-old dispute over the Kuril Islands, part of the
Sakhalin region just north of Hokkaido.
	   ``This is a remarkable event which is of great importance not
only for the two country's neighboring regions, but for other
territories as well,'' Sakhalin Gov. Igor Farkhutdinov said at a
signing ceremony, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Farkhutdinov said that the implementation of offshore oil and
gas projects in Sakhalin was a priority in establishing the
cooperation pact with Hokkaido. ``The main problem facing the Kuril
Islands is the energy problem,'' he said.
	   Gov. Tatsuya Hori of Hokkaido said, ``stronger good-neighborly
ties between our territories will promote bilateral relations
between Russia and Japan at the turn of the century.''
	   The agreement made no mention of the dispute over the Kurils,
which Russia claimed after World War II. Japan has consistently
maintained that the seizure was illegal.

Ethnic, religious tensions trigger riots in Indonesian capital

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deep-seated ethnic and religious
tensions erupted in the capital of crisis-ridden Indonesia Sunday
when mobs of Muslim youths attacked and burned four Christian
churches.
	   At least six people were killed in violence that broke out less
than one kilometer (one-half mile) from the presidential palace, a
little more than a week after deadly clashes between students and
security personnel also triggered rioting.
	   Troops fired shots and volleys of tear gas to break up rampaging
crowds.
	   Some of the victims' bodies were mutilated. Dozens were reported
injured in fighting between the local Muslim majority and Christian
migrants originally from the eastern Indonesian city of Ambon.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said.
	   Three churches were burned and one was trashed, officials said.
	   A gambling hall was set afire and a Catholic girls' school near
the city's main cathedral was ransacked and partly burned.
	   The military said Muslim residents were angered by
unsubstantiated rumors that Christians had attacked a mosque.
	   The violence comes as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic
crisis in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as
inflation and unemployment rates soar.
	   President B.J. Habibie warned recently that his country could
face a major breakdown in law and order. He is at the center of
protests over his plans to change Indonesia's political system,
which opponents say fall short of introducing true democracy.
	   Jakarta's central military commander, Lt. Col. Widodo, and a
bodyguard were stabbed and seriously injured in one brawl.
	   Local television stations reported that 10 people had been
arrested after rival mobs attacked one another, some holding rivals
captive.
	   Looting and arson were reported in several areas in the north
and west of the capital, the home of dozens of ethnic groups.
	   At least five armored personnel carriers were deployed to
protect a shopping mall, and some troops fired at looters, a
witness said.
	   Squads of soldiers protected several churches as night fell.
	   Witnesses said ethnic Chinese residents gathered in groups armed
with sticks and knives to protect their homes. Although not
directly targeted Sunday, they have been attacked during previous
rioting.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making Indonesia the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy.
	   Muslim preachers tried to calm angry crowds by reading passages
from Islam's holy book, the Koran, over loud hailers as hundreds of
followers sat in a major road.
	   Outside one university campus, about 2,000 people threw rocks
and built a bonfire.
	   The violence was the latest sign that the military, under
pressure over human rights abuses, is increasingly hard-pressed to
keep order in the city of 11 million people.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms.
	   On Sunday, mobs broke into a Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was under way, smashing stained glass windows, chalices
and a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles on to
a bonfire.
	   Some youths carried banners proclaiming them as members of the
``Front to Defend Islam.''
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks from reaching the burning Christian
Church of Ketapang. A police helicopter swooped through a pall of
black smoke as thousands of people roamed the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Two dozen worshipers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Many local Muslims complained that the Ambonese were involved in
illegal gambling.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
	   Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart. It was not known
where the victim was from.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Thousands
of buildings and vehicles were damaged and looting was widespread.
	   The May rioting was triggered in part by discontent over the
economic crisis.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade and commerce.

Sampras and Rios battle for No. 1 at ATP Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras or Marcelo Rios. It's come
down to the last week of the season to determine who will finish
the year as No. 1 in the world.
	   In one of the closest finishes in recent years, Sampras leads
Rios by a mere 33 points going into the ATP Tour World Championship
that start Tuesday.
	   The season-ending event brings together the eight players with
the best results during the year and the list can differ slightly
from the current computer rankings, which are based on the results
of the last 52 weeks.
	   This is the first time since 1995 that the championship has a
bearing on the No. 1 season-ending ranking.
	   Sampras, 27, should have a mental edge over Rios, the eccentric
Chilean who can cap a fine year by regaining the No. 1 ranking he
has already held during two brief spells this year.
	   But Rios, 22, is competing at the exclusive event for the first
time, while Sampras has won it four times already and always excels
in the prestigious tournament.
	   Sampras is also gunning for an unprecedented achievement _
finishing as No. 1 in the world for six years in a row.
	   Sampras shares the record of five with fellow American Jimmy
Connors.
	   ``It's a record that might not ever be broken. It is that hard
to do,'' Sampras said.
	   ``I'll do whatever it takes to do it because it's definitely up
there with the greatest achievements in tennis,'' Sampras said last
month at the tournament in Stuttgart.
	   Stuttgart was one of the six stops on the indoor European
circuit for Sampras as he chased points in an attempt to pad his
advantage over Rios. Never before had Sampras played six straight
weeks in Europe.
	   Sampras won only one of the six tournaments, reflecting the
mixed season he's had this year. He captured Wimbledon for the
fifth time, but won no other Grand Slam and has four titles this
year.
	   Rios on the other hand captured a tour-high seven titles. But
the left-handed Chilean also has lacked consistency in the finish
of the season.
	   Injuries forced him to drop out of two European events (Sampras
also withdrew from one) and he lost last week in the quarterfinals
in Santiago, where a victory would have propelled him to No. 1.
	   Every time Rios had a chance of overtaking Sampras in the last
few weeks, Sampras managed to stay in a given tournament longer
then the Chilean.
	   No. 3 Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion, also had
a chance of seizing the top-ranking but finally gave in to injuries
and will not compete in Hanover.
	   So, although he has been far from dominant, Sampras has received
some help from his rivals and goes into the championship ahead of
Rios.
	   Sampras and Rios are seeded at the head of the two groups of
eight players under the round-robin format of the event. The top
two from each group advance into the semifinals.
	   If Sampras wins the dlrs 3.5 million championship, he will end
as No. 1. The same is true for Rios.
	   There are other possibilities. For Rios to finish No. 1, he has
to win at least two matches in Hanover _ and win one more match
than Sampras.
	   If Rios fails to win at least two matches, Sampras will finish
as the season's No.1 no matter what he does in the tournament,
which is played on an indoor hard-court surface.
	   Sampras has complained about the lack of attention his
achievements are getting back home.
	   ``It is not easy to do year in, year out, win Grand Slams and be
No. 1. I feel much more respected in Europe than I do in the
States, from the press and from the people.
	   ``Americans expect me to win every match I play,'' said Sampras,
who has won 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's
record.
	   In addition to Sampras and Rios, the six other players in the
event are: Andre Agassi, Carlos Moya, Alex Corretja, Karol Kucera,
Tim Henman and Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Richard Krajicek qualified but
also had to pull out with a knee injury.
	   At this time last year, Agassi was playing challenger events in
an attempt to battle back into the top rankings after falling as
low as No. 141.
	   The American has surged back to No. 4 after winning five
tournaments this year and the former No. 1 has a good shot of
winning the championship again after his triumph in 1990.

OPEC ministers gather to discuss weakest oil market in 11 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ It has been a truly horrible year for
OPEC, and bets are it will continue that way.
	   As oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries began heading to Vienna on Sunday for a meeting later in
the week, Algeria's oil minister Yousef Yousfi went on a
four-nation Gulf tour to brainstorm on how to boost prices.
	   OPEC has a ``price crisis'' on its hands, Yousfi said Saturday
in Kuwait, his first stop.
	   Also on Yousfi's initerary were Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, all OPEC members.
	   ``We're studying all ways and solutions that would boost the
prices,'' Yousfi said, calling for ``collective measures to favor
all (oil) countries,'' without elaborating.
	   Oil ministers from the 11-member organization will meet in
Vienna on Wednesday with oil prices hovering around 9 dollars below
their group's target of dlrs 21 a barrel.
	   Non-OPEC Russia, Mexico and Oman have also been invited.
	   Most analysts say the choice facing OPEC is whether to agree to
more output reductions in an effort to boost prices, or opt to
extend current cuts.
	   OPEC is split on the issue, and analysts are betting they won't
agree on further cuts, but instead extend present cuts through to
the end of 1999.
	   Indicating just how bad things are, December crude oil closed in
New York on Friday at dlrs 12.14 a barrel, nudging 11-year lows
again after hitting a 12-year low in June.
	   An ill-judged decision last winter to increase oil production
fed into Asia's financial crisis, which slashed demand from there
by about half and had a knock-on effect in world economies. The
result _ a global oil glut.
	   Faced with oversupply and slipping demand, OPEC agreed to cut
production in June, keeping 2.6 million barrels a day from the
market. The agreement is set to run for one year.
	   OPEC output totals about 24.3 million barrels a day.
	   But the effect on prices has been negligible, with some analysts
pointing out there's just too much oil around for cuts to make a
short-term difference.
	   OPEC has been split into factions over the last few months.
Kuwait and Algeria keen for more cuts, but Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and non-OPEC Mexico opposing them.
	   Saudi Arabia produces 8 million barrels a day, the biggest quota
in the organization. Both it and Venezuela are worried about losing
market share to other producers, especially in the United States.
	   Venezuela even hinted last week it may not stick to the current
cut in production.
	   While low prices are good news for consumers, many OPEC states
are facing potentially serious situations back home.
	   In Saudi Arabia, where oil provides over 70 percent of the
national income, economic growth this year will drop to a
negligible 0.3 percent compared to 7 percent in 1997, a banking and
ratings agency said Saturday.
	   ``For every one dollar fall in the oil price, it is estimated
that the country loses in the vicinity of dlrs 2.5 billion in
budget revenues,'' Cyprus-based Capital Intelligence said in a
report.
	   With average prices falling from dlrs 18 in 1997 to around dlrs
12, Saudi Arabia can expect just dlrs 26 billion in oil export
revenues, 24 percent below budget, the agency said.
	   Kuwait's state-run news agency said last week it expected oil
revenue for 1998 to be 45 percent lower than last year.

Skinner wins second straight NASCAR exhibition race in Japan

	   MOTEGI, Japan (AP) _ Mike Skinner took the lead on the 140th of
201 laps, outdueled Jeff Gordon in the final corner and won by
0.153 seconds Sunday, his second straight NASCAR exhibition race
victory in Japan.
	   The 41-year-old resident of Susansville, California, posted an
unofficial time of 2 hours, 45 minutes, 58.000 seconds, or 112.558
mph (180.09 kph) in his Monte Carlo Chevrolet.
	   Organizers, unable to provide official times because of computer
problems, gave only Skinner's winning margin over Gordon, who also
drove a Chevrolet.
	   Jeremy Mayfield was third in a Taurus Ford.
	   The NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500 was the third and last
race in a three-year series held under a contract with Japanese
organizers to promote the sport worldwide.
	   Rusty Wallace won the event in 1996 at the 1.54-mile
(2.46-kilometer) Suzuka Circuitland road course, and Skinner
triumphed last year, also at Suzuka.
	   The victory Sunday was worth dlrs 134,045 from a purse of dlrs 1
million.
	   Skinner started from the third position, behind Mayfield and
Gordon, and made his charge on the 140th lap around the 1.5-mile
(2.4-kilometer) Motegi Twin Ring oval track.
	   He kept the lead to the end.
	   ``Our car was very, very good. When we put tires on it, it would
just go,'' said Skinner. ``I probably cool my tires down more than
anybody else. Our car on hot tires would push very, very bad.''
	   He added that Gordon was better over short runs along the
course, while his car did better on the long runs.
	   ``We knew we had to stop at the corners ... and just go really
slow getting in there and really slow in coming out just like in
the road race at Suzuka,'' Skinner said.
	   Last year, Skinner was the Winston Cup's 40-year-old rookie of
the year when he drove to his first victory in high-level
competition at Suzuka.
	   In Sunday's race, Gordon, of Pittsboro, Indiana, was seeking his
14th victory of the season. At age 27, he was the youngest driver
to win three Winston Cup championships.
	   Mayfield, from Owensboro, Kentucky, won his only Winston Cup
title in the Pocono 500 at Long Pond, Pennsylvania, in June.
	   The field of 31 included 13 Winston Cup stars, 11 Winston Cup
West competitors, four Japanese, two Busch Grand drivers and one
from the Craftsman Truck Series.
	   Bill France, president of NASCAR, said at the opening ceremony
that said the race will continue in the future.
	   ``I'm very pleased to announce that we'll return again in 1999
with our stock cars and hope that you'll be here to join us once
again,'' he said.
	   Japanese racing officials said details have yet to be worked out
for the Winston Cup West to have a race of its championship series
staged in Japan.

Southern Indian city woos computer software firms with technology

park &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Aggressively wooing foreign computer
software companies, a city in southern India unveiled a technology
park Sunday where companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and
Sun Microsystems have set up shop.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called it the ``biggest and
most exciting development in the information technology sector in
India.''
	   The 10-story building, part of the Hitech City project on the
outskirts of Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh state, was built
a little over one year after Microsoft chief Bill Gates extracted a
promise from state Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu that he would
improve the infrastructure there.
	   Microsoft and Oracle have taken up one floor each in the
building. The rest of the space has already been taken up by other
software companies, according to S.D. Kulkarni, chairman of Larsen
and Toubro, which constructed the building.
	   The park, spread over 160 acres (65 hectares) is estimated to
cost the government 15,000 million rupees (dlrs 352 million). When
completed over the next five years, it is expected to employ 10,000
people.
	   In a message to Naidu, Microsoft chief Gates said such
investments will improve the local infrastructure and attract
foreign investors.
	   Software export from Andhra Pradesh touched 5,000 million rupees
(dlrs 117 million) this year, a tenfold increase since Naidu became
chief minister about five years ago.
	   In recent months, Naidu has toured foreign countries to invite
investors to Andhra Pradesh state. He spends hours every day,
surfing the internet to scout for investors or to chat with venture
capitalists.
	   In a country where computers are few and resistance to them from
trade unions is fierce, Naidu has increased computerization of
government records in Andhra Pradesh state to make information
easily available to the public.
	   ``Information Technology can be effective tool to restore
credibility in the government,'' Naidu said.

Military parade, pledge to fight Israel on independence day

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon marked Independence Day on Sunday
with a military parade and a pledge to fight Israel.
	   Army infantry units marched to a military band and bagpipers,
followed by freshly painted tanks and armored vehicles, along an
avenue near the National Museum in downtown Beirut.
	   The parade route was symbolic of peace and national unity
because it had served as a killing ground and a crossing point
between the divided capital during the 1975-90 civil war between
Muslims and Christians.
	   President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other top
officials looked on. President-elect Emile Lahoud, the army
commander who will be inaugurated Tuesday, stayed away to give
Hrawi his last show as leader but later joined in a reception.
	   On the eve of the 55th Independence from France, Hrawi pledged
in a televised address: ``We will not give up one grain of our
national soil and our national dignity.''
	   Israel occupies 10 percent of Lebanese territory in the south,
which it says is necessary to protect its border towns against
attack. It has held onto the land since 1985, despite efforts by
Lebanese guerrillas to oust occupying the force.
	   Hrawi also reiterated Lebanon's commitment to Middle East peace
based on the ``land for peace'' principle, pledging to stick with
neighboring Syria in any negotiations with Israel.
	   Israel has offered to withdraw from Lebanon in exchange for
security guarantees. Both Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker
in this country where it maintains 30,000 troops, rejected the
offer.
	   Lahoud, who was elected by Parliament Oct. 15 after winning
popular backing and the all-important approval of Syrian President
Hafez Assad, has rebuilt the fractured military since he became the
nation's top general in 1989.
	   He has brought the army closer to Syria's military and has taken
a hard line on the conflict with Israel _ though the army has
largely stayed out of the fighting in the south.
	   ``I am confident that the prime mission of the army will
continue to be the resistance until the end of the Israeli
occupation,'' he said in his Order of the Day comments to the
troops.
	   ``Israel is the enemy ... Syria is the friend,'' Lahoud's orders
said.
	   Despite Sunday's ceremony, some Lebanese feel Independence Day
remains marred by Israel's occupation and Syria's virtual control
of decision-making in this nation wedged between the two powerful
Middle Eastern foes.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a letter to Hrawi that
Washington supports the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Lebanon. He added that the United States remains
committed to achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in
the Middle East.

Official says Taiwan looks to China for improvement in ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China has the power to determine whether
relations with Taiwan improve, but any hardened attitude by Beijing
will feed pro-independence sentiment here, a top official was
quoted as saying Sunday.
	   ``In the end, whether future developments in relations are
benign or malignant is to be determined in Beijing,'' Lin
Chung-ping was quoted as telling Cabinet officials by the
mass-circulation United Daily News. Lin is vice chairman of the
cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   Beijing's oppression and isolation of Taiwan could help bring an
election victory here in 2000 by a president who would scrap the
ruling Nationalist Party's avowed goal of future reunification with
China, Lin said.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalists driven from mainland
China by Communist forces in 1949. Beijing considers the island a
breakaway province to be isolated and brought under its control by
force if necessary. Critics here say Beijing's aggressive stance
has reduced support in Taiwan for reunification, and boosted
politicians advocating Taiwanese nationalism.
	   Taiwan still calls itself the Republic of China, the name of the
government established by Sun Yat-sen in 1912 and later moved to
Taiwan. But a future leader might adopt a new name in hopes of
making the split formal and permanent, Lin was quoted as saying.
	   The island's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
advocates independence and already governs more than half the
island at the local level.
	   Lin called a recent meeting between the two sides' top
negotiators a ``new milestone, but also a crossroads.''
	   He urged China to drop its demand that Taiwan agree to immediate
talks on political issues related to reunification, saying dialogue
on practical matters stood a better chance of achieving results.
	   His reported comments reflect Taiwan's view that it is doing all
it can to improve relations, but that Beijing's petulance and
unrealistic demands are holding that back.
	   The mid-October visit of top envoy Koo Chen-fu to China marked
the highest level contact between the sides since China severed
talks in June 1995 over Taiwan's campaign to assert itself
internationally.
	   The sides agreed to keep talking about a restoration of
dialogue, and top Chinese negotiator Wang Daohan agreed to visit
Taiwan next spring.

	   SHEIKHUPURA, Pakistan (AP) _ Neil Johnson's brilliant maiden
century powered Zimbabwe to a convincing six-wicket victory over
Pakistan in the second one-day international Sunday to level the
three-match series 1-1.
	   After restricting the home team to 211 in 50 overs, Zimbabwe
romped home to 212 for four in 40.4 overs, with Andy Flower
remaining unbeaten on 15 and captain Alistair Campbell not out on
one.
	   ``I hope we will continue the good work in the last match
(Tuesday). All the players gave their best, especially Johnson and
Flower (Grant), who gave us the solid foundation of 101,'' said
captain Campbell.
	   Johnson brought up his century in the 39th over when he drove
part-time spinner Saeed Anwar to cover boundary for his 13th four
of the innings before Shahid Afridi had him bowled with Zimbabwe
needing only three runs for victory.
	   ``I will cherish this moment for the rest of my life, but I was
a little disappointed not to be there in the middle when victory
came,'' said Johnson after his Man of the Match winning knock.
	   The fast improving Zimbabweans, who have beaten India once and
defeated world champions Sri Lanka twice, recorded their only
second one-day international victory against Pakistan in 18
matches. Their only win before Sunday came in 1995 when they beat
Pakistan by 74 runs at Harare in 1995.
	   Openers Grant Flower (42) and Johnson put their team on road to
victory with a supreb 101 off 114 balls for the first wicket.
Flower top edged off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq to Saeed Anwar at
short fine leg in the 18th over before Mushtaq bowled Craig Evans
(2) off a straight delivery.
	   Aamir Sohail removed Murray Goodwin, who made 30 before he was
bowled while attempting to hit a big hit off Pakistan captain's
left-arm spin.
	   The 28-year-old left-handed Johnson, who hammered 74 in
Zimbabwe's four-wicket loss against Pakistan in the first match
Friday, played a determind knock of 103 with 13 fours and
capitalised on a wayward Pakistan bowlers during his 122-ball
innings with some attractive strokeplay.
	   Mushtaq was the only impressive off the Pakistani bowlers,
claiming two wickets for 43 off his 10 overs. Experienced Wasim
Akram and Muhammad Akram struggled for their line and length and
remained wicketless conceding 31 runs each.
	   Pakistan never recovered from the early collapse when it was
reduced to 36 for three by the end of 10th over. Hasan Raza, the
youngest ever Test player, who made his debut here at the
Sheikhupura Stadium against Zimbabwe in 1996 at the age of 14 years
and 234 days, and Saqlain Mushtaq's quick 29 lifted them from 153
for eight to 211 all out in 50 overs.
	   Mushtaq hit Johnson for 15 runs in the penultimate over, which
featured a straight six over the bowler's head.
	   Raza and Mushtaq put on 57 runs for the ninth wicket _ a new
record for Pakistan _ bettering the previous best of 45 made by
Mushtaq and Salim Malik against India at Toronto in 1995-96 season.
	   ``We never tried to build up a partnership and all the batsmen
fell while playing rash strokes,'' conceded Aamir Sohail.
	   ``Zimbabwe deserved to win as they totally outclassed us. They
are no more babes in international cricket and we really have to
work hard to clinch the series,'' he said.
	   Pakistan's long batting line-up struggled in front of Zimbabwe
seamers and then spinners. Off-spinner Andrew Whittall got rid off
two key batsmen Inzamamul Haq (34) and Yousuf Youhanna (24) midway
through the innings and conceded just 23 runs in his steady 10-over
spell.
	   Shahid Afridi, the world record-holder of fastest one-day
International century, showed his fireworks briefly in making 26
off 30 balls, before he charged down the wicket off Heath Streak
and lost his leg stump.
	   Saeed Anwar (2) and Aamir Sohail (0) departed after playing
reckless strokes off Johnson and Eddo Brandes respectively.
	   Medium fast Streak chipped in with three wickets for 40, which
included Mushtaq and Raza in the last over of the innings.
	   The decisive match of the series will be played at Rawalpindi
Tuesday before the three-Test series arts at Peshawar from
Thursday.

Albanian referendum on draft Constitution calm amid slow voting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Albanians trickled into polling booths
amid apparent calm Sunday, in a controversial referendum meant to
give Europe's poorest country its first post-communist
Constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported no
obvious violence or voter intimidation. But they cited slow voter
turnout since polls opened at 0700 local time (0600 GMT.) The 4,700
polling stations nationwide were to close at 1800 local time.
	   Turnout was the key factor in the referendum on a draft
Constitution that would outline basic civil, human and democratic
rights in this Balkan nation that shed Europe's most isolated
communist dictatorship in 1991.
	   Albania's powerful opposition Democratic Party has urged all
supporters to boycott voting and says low turnout will prove the
government has little support among the population.
	   The draft, with advice from Western legal experts, would give
Albanians the right to legally change their religion and identify
themselves as members of an ethnic minority. It would also define
property rights and allow the government to expropriate land deemed
of national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while in richer, non-Muslim
neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   Western officials see the boycott as an attempt to force the
government into calling early elections.
	   Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the chief opposition
politician who played a key role in ant-government unrest earlier
this year, late Sunday morning claimed turnout will be so low as to
pronounce the draft ``a dead body.''
	   Berisha, the former president who was forced to resign after
months of anarchy last year, said his supporters counted only 352
voters at a sample of 14 of the nation's 4,700 polling stations in
the first four hours of voting. Almost two million of Albania's 3.2
million people are eligible to vote. But an estimated 300,000
voters live outside Albania and can't cast their ballots.
	   Snow also closed four roads in northern Albania and slowed, or
halted voting in some areas.
	   Fearing low voter turnout, the government recently scrapped a
law requiring more than 50-per cent attendance to validate a
referendum. Now, any number of voters is enough and the draft is
seen as near-certain to pass.
	   Albania's Central Voting Committee released no early turnout
figures, and referendum results were expected only late Monday. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has
several hundred people monitoring the vote, will also review the
fairness of the process late Monday.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
Tirana suburb, said the Constitution will help boost prosperity in
Europe's poorest nation.
	   ``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and
walked on an unpaved road like all Albanians - looking reality in
the eye,'' said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station
as well. ``I voted for the future.''
	   Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling booth from the roofs of
nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle police throughout Tirana
searched cars with license plates from outside of Tirana.
	   Other than a heavier police presence, Tirana streets showed no
signs of tensions as residents perused street vendors' wares or
sipped coffee on sidewalk tables. Small pockets of voters gathered
in front of the schools and post offices used as polling booths but
no lengthy lineups were visible.
	   All voters who spoke to reporters at polling booths said they
voted to approve the draft Constitution.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb.
``Hope is the only thing that we can really do.''

Train travelers brace for strike on eve of European walkout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the eve of a Europe-wide rail strike, travelers
in France braced for disruptions that were to slow train traffic
across the country beginning Sunday evening.
	   The national train company, the SNCF, predicted that France
would be heavily affected by Monday's European strike, when railway
workers in six countries were to protest liberalization plans.
	   Disruptions in French traffic were set to begin at 8:00 p.m.
(1900 GMT) Sunday.
	   The SNCF said that only 280 of 680 normally scheduled trains
would be operating Monday in the northeast of France and that
connections to western France would also be severely disrupted.
	   Trains from northern France to the south would be the least
affected by the European strike, the SNCF said.
	   Internationally, no trains were expected to run from France to
Belgium and the number of Eurostar trains going to London were seen
cut in half.
	   Traffic is also expected to be severely disrupted in Spain,
Belgium, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. Unions will hand out
leaflets to commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the
Netherlands in a bid to stop plans to further privatize the sector.
	   In France, the European one-day walkout won't be the end of
travelers' woes.
	   French train conductors' unions have called a nation-wide strike
for next Friday, saying they lack sufficient staff.
	   French rail workers are well known for their frequent walkouts.
In late 1995, train workers brought France to a near standstill for
more than three weeks over a government plan to reduce benefits.
	   On Sunday, train traffic remained disrupted in parts of southern
France as workers in the Marseille area extended their walkout for
a thirteenth day.
	   However, the workers were set to vote later Sunday on a proposal
that would allow them to return to work.
	   Rail workers there want the SNCF to hire 30 more train
conductors by the end of the year. The proposal under consideration
would provide 23 new employees.

Russians head to Russia

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - After winning in the United States, Canada, Germany
and now France, the Russians are heading home -- in more ways than
one.
	   The Russians added two more victories in the Grand Prix figure
skating series over the weekend at the Lalique trophy competition,
upping their count to 10 victories in 16 events for the season.
	   Now it is on to the home country at the Cup of Russia in Moscow.
Russians, of course, will be favored, even though the winners in
Paris won't be there. They will be making a rare visit home.
	   World champion Alexei Yagudin, who has taken three Grands Prix
and two more Open competitions in the last five weeks, is anxious
to go back to his native St. Petersburg for a while.
	   ``I haven't seen my family in four months,'' Yagudin said. ``I
had to leave Russia because it was impossible to skate there.''
	   He moved to New Jersey to be with his new coach, Tatiana
Tarasova and has developed a new artistic ability to go with his
great technical talent.
	   For the second meet in a row he landed a clean quadruple jump to
overtake American Michael Weiss in the men's event. Weiss tried a
quad but missed his slightly although he led after the short
program.
	   Women's winner Maria Butyrskaya has been also been on the road
for six weeks between Grand Prix and other competitions. She is
anxious to get back to Moscow.
	   ``It's very difficult. I have to travel constantly because most
of the pro-am competitions are in the United States,'' Butyrskaya
said. ``So I am looking forward to going home and rest and then
practice.''
	   Butyrskaya rallied to beat American Nicole Bobek, who failed to
hold her lead after the short program. Still Bobek came close to
her first victory in a major competition in nearly four years.
	   France had victories in the ice dance and pairs. Marina
Anissina, a former Russian, and Gwendal Peizerat, had a dramatic
routine to music from ``The Man in the Iron Mask'' in their ice
dance win. It featured an unusual move where she lifts him off the
ice for a long distance down the ice.
	   Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Benardis won the pairs program.
	   Although the Cup of Russia won't have any of the Paris winners
competing, it won't be lacking for Russian favorites.
	   It is scheduled to have Yevgeny Pluschenko and Alexander Abt in
the men's event with Yelena Sokolova and Irina Slutskaya in the
women's competition.
	   Pluschenko has already won in Skate Canada this year, Sokolova
in the Nations Cup and Slutskaya is a two-time European champion.
	   World champion pairs Yelena Berezynaya and Anton Sikarulidze are
also competing along with ice dance winners Angelika Krylova and
Oleg Ovsiannikov.
	   After the Cup of Russia, the final Grand Prix is the NHK Trophy
in Japan.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deep-seated ethnic and religious
tensions erupted in the capital of crisis-ridden Indonesia Sunday
when mobs of Muslim youths attacked or burned at least four
Christian churches and then went on a riot spree.
	   At least six people were killed in violence that broke out less
than one kilometer (one-half mile) from the presidential palace, a
little more than a week after deadly clashes between students and
security personnel also triggered rioting.
	   Troops fired shots and volleys of tear gas to break up rampaging
crowds Sunday.
	   Most of the dead were stabbed and some of the bodies were
mutilated. Dozens were reported injured in fighting between the
local Muslim majority and Christian migrants originally from the
eastern Indonesian city of Ambon.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said.
	   Three churches were burned and one was trashed, officials said.
	   Witnesses said other Christian places of worship had also been
attacked.
	   A gambling hall was set afire and a Catholic girls' school near
the city's main cathedral was ransacked and partly burned.
	   Dozens of stores and other buildings were attacked and cars set
afire.
	   The military said Muslim residents were angered by
unsubstantiated rumors that Christians had attacked a mosque.
	   The violence comes as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic
crisis in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as
inflation and unemployment rates soar.
	   President B.J. Habibie warned recently that his country could
face a major breakdown in law and order. He is at the center of
protests over his plans to change Indonesia's political system,
which opponents say fall short of introducing true democracy.
	   Jakarta's central military commander, Lt. Col. Widodo, and a
bodyguard were stabbed and seriously injured in one brawl.
	   Local television stations reported that 10 people had been
arrested after rival mobs attacked one another, some holding rivals
captive.
	   Looting and arson were reported in several areas in the north
and west of the capital, the home of dozens of ethnic groups.
	   At least five armored personnel carriers were deployed to
protect a shopping mall, and some troops fired at looters, a
witness said.
	   Squads of soldiers protected several churches as night fell.
	   Witnesses said ethnic Chinese residents gathered in groups armed
with sticks and knives to protect their homes. Although not
directly targeted Sunday, they have been attacked during previous
rioting.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making Indonesia the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy.
	   Muslim preachers tried to calm angry crowds by reading passages
from Islam's holy book, the Koran, over loud hailers as hundreds of
followers sat in a major road.
	   Outside one university campus, about 2,000 people threw rocks
and built a bonfire.
	   The violence was the latest sign that the military, under
pressure over human rights abuses, is increasingly hard-pressed to
keep order in the city of 11 million people.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms.
	   On Sunday, mobs broke into a Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was under way, smashing stained glass windows, chalices
and a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles on to
a bonfire.
	   Some youths carried banners proclaiming them as members of the
``Front to Defend Islam.''
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks from reaching the burning Christian
Church of Ketapang. A police helicopter swooped through a pall of
black smoke as thousands of people roamed the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Two dozen worshipers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Many local Muslims complained that the Ambonese were involved in
illegal gambling.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
	   Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart. It was not known
where the victim was from.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule. Thousands
of buildings and vehicles were damaged and looting was widespread.
	   The May rioting was triggered in part by discontent over the
economic crisis.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade and commerce.

Swissair CEO defends installation of in-flight entertainment
</HEADLINE>
system &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair ``did everything correctly''
in installing a state-of-the-art entertainment system switched off
last month in the wake of the crash of Flight 111, the airline's
chief executive said in an interview published Sunday.
	   Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video-on-demand
system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit,
after Canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on
wiring and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the
MD-11.
	   ``It's the leading product, customers liked it, and its
installation was correctly certified,'' CEO Jeffrey Katz was quoted
as saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung. ``As far as we know
now, we did everything correctly.''
	   Swissair is the only customer for the system, manufactured by
manufactured by Phoenix-based Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.
	   The plane bound from New York to Geneva crashed Sept. 2 off the
coast of Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people on board. The cause of
the crash has yet to be determined.
	   Katz declined to comment on lawsuits filed against the airline.
``But we are prepared,'' he added.
	   ``The important thing is for us to be certain'' of the cause,
Katz said. ``That's the only way we can prevent this tragedy
recurring. Only then will we worry about the legal questions.''
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said Swissair is in
contact with lawyers in the United States, Switzerland and France
over possible settlements.

Senior figure in Suharto's party says he should be detained:
</HEADLINE>
report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior figure in former President
Suharto's ruling Golkar party says the autocrat should be placed
under house arrest during investigations into claims he plundered
Indonesia's economy to build vast personal wealth, a report said
Sunday.
	   Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the Golkar faction in the nation's
House of Representatives, said that placing travel restrictions on
Suharto would appease growing public anger over allegations of
corruption in his amassing a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine
at dlrs 4 billion.
	   ``The government should place former President Suharto under
house arrest,'' The Jakarta Post quoted Marzuki as telling
reporters.
	   On Saturday, President B.J. Habibie launched a commission of
inquiry into corruption allegations against his predecessor and
one-time mentor.
	   Suharto has repeatedly denied accusations of corruption.
	   The commission is an apparent concession to student
demonstrators who have fought bloody street battles with the
military in recent weeks, and who demand that Suharto be tried for
illegally enriching himself and his family during his 32 years in
power.
	   Habibie so far has ignored calls by opposition figures and
students to detain Suharto.
	   Golkar chairman and Minister of State Akbar Tanjung said
Saturday the government had no plans to impose travel bans on
Suharto.
	   Critics and opponents of Suharto say he plundered the wealth of
Indonesia by allowing his six children and a small group of cronies
to build huge business empires under his patronage. They also
accuse him of stashing a fortune away in overseas bank accounts.
	   Suharto has lived as a virtual recluse since quitting amid riots
and protests on May 21.
	   Akbar said the commission would ``examine and investigate the
wealth of former President Suharto.''
	   Members of the commission have not yet been appointed. However,
they would have ``credibility and high integrity within the nation
and state,'' Akbar said.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark the May riots, in which
1,200 people were killed.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug
 &UR; Stars 3, Blues 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Pierre Turgeon scored with less than 13 minutes
remaining as the St. Louis Blues overcame a three-goal deficit to
tie the Dallas Stars.
	   Mike Modano and Grant Marshall each had a goal and an assist for
the Stars, who were playing for the second straight night.
	   The Stars were without Brett Hull, who suffered a bruised kidney
Friday night and did not make the trip to St. Louis. Many in the
sellout crowd booed when Hull's name was included in the
announcement of the players who were scratched from the game. Hull
was one of the most popular players in Blues history before signing
as a free agent with the Stars in the offseason.
 &UR; Islanders 6, Predators 3
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Robert Reichel had a goal and two
assists as the New York Islanders snapped a three-game losing
streak with a win over the Nashville Predators.
	   Reichel's power-play goal 4:22 into the game made it 2-0. Trevor
Linden pounded in the rebound of Reichel's shot early in the second
period to build New York's lead to 4-1. Sergei Nemchinov scored
from close range on a backhand feed by Reichel 3:26 into the third
to make it 6-1.
 &UR; Coyotes 3, Oilers 2, OT
	   In Phoenix, Rick Tocchet scored with 52 seconds left in overtime
to lead the surging Phoenix Coyotes over the Edmonton Oilers.
	   The victory, Phoenix's NHL-high fifth in a row and second
straight in overtime, moved the Coyotes a half-game ahead of Dallas
for first place in the Pacific Division. The Coyotes are on a
league-high 11-game unbeaten streak (9-0-2).
	   Nikolai Khabibulin stopped only 13 of 15 Edmonton shots, but it
was enough to also keep alive his team's post-expansion league
record of holding teams to two goals or less _ now at 14 in a row.
The 1958-59 Montreal Canadiens, one of six teams in the old NHL,
set the record of 18 straight before the first wave of expansion in
1966.

Family of Asian Games hopeful compensated after fatal accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has bought insurance for its 1,400 national
team athletes, and compensation already has been paid to the family
of an Asian Games gold medal hopeful who was killed last month, an
official newspaper said Sunday.
	   The death of Wang Zeshou, China's top woman mountain biker, in
an accident in road training in October ``highlighted the need for
greater protection for the fragile careers of the country's sports
stars and their dependents,'' the Business Weekly said.
	   Wang was a favorite for the gold medal in mountain cycling at
the Asian Games in Thailand next month, it said.
	   The People's Insurance (Life) Co. of China, which signed a
contract with the China Sports Foundation in September to cover the
national team, paid 300,000 yuan (dlrs 36,000) to Wang's parents
and husband earlier this month, the newspaper said.
	   That was the maximum amount under the insurance contract, which
entitles national team athletes to between 3,000 yuan (dlrs 360)
and 300,000 yuan in compensation for accidents, the newspaper said.
	   The contract ``is expected to ease Chinese athletes' worries
over the financial consequences of injury,'' it quoted Zhang
Faqiang, deputy director of the State General Administration of
Sports, as saying.
	   Efforts to secure insurance for Chinese athletes were
accelerated after Sang Lan, a 17-year-old gymnast, broke her neck
in a warmup vault at the Goodwill Games in July, leaving her
paralyzed with no feeling in her lower body or hands.

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In March, 1,000 legislators obediently
handed Indonesia's President Suharto a seventh five-year term. Now,
with Suharto forced from office, many of those delegates profess
eagerness to scrap his authoritarian legacy.
	   Student protesters doubt their sincerity, and they have fought
deadly battles with the military this month while demonstrating
their scorn for political reforms endorsed by Indonesia's highest
legislative body.
	   Still, inside the heavily guarded Parliament, legislators are
hurriedly drafting laws for perhaps the most crucial reform: the
plan by President B.J. Habibie to hold elections next year.
	   Under Habibie, once Suharto's protege, change has already swept
the Southeast Asian nation. Riots and protests helped oust the
77-year-old Suharto in May after 32 years in power. Suharto, like
many Indonesians, uses only one name.
	   New political parties and trade unions are sprouting. Many
political prisoners have been freed. News organizations are much
more freewheeling than in neighboring Singapore or Malaysia.
	   But Indonesia's path toward democracy will be long and
difficult, and possibly jeopardized by social tensions. On Sunday,
Muslim youths vandalized or burned at least four Christian churches
in Jakarta, triggering riots in several parts of the city.
	   Although the 12 decrees adopted by the People's Consultative
Assembly are broad promises of change, it is unclear how vigorously
the government will pursue them.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deep-seated ethnic and religious
tensions erupted in the capital of crisis-ridden Indonesia Sunday
when mobs of Muslim youths attacked or burned at least four
Christian churches and then went on a riot spree. At least six
people were killed in violence that broke out less than one
kilometer (one-half mile) from the presidential palace, a little
more than a week after deadly clashes between students and security
personnel also triggered rioting. Troops fired shots and volleys of
tear gas to break up rampaging crowds Sunday. Most of the dead were
stabbed and some of the bodies were mutilated. Dozens more were
reported injured in fighting between the local Muslim majority and
Christian migrants originally from the eastern Indonesian city of
Ambon. (INDONESIA-RIOT)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After warning North Korea to forsake
nuclear weapons, President Bill Clinton praised American troops
Sunday for remaining vigilant near the world's most heavily guarded
border where tensions are on the rise. ``Our ability to succeed in
promoting peace is uniquely due to the fact that we can back up our
diplomatic efforts when necessary with military strength and that
depends on you,'' Clinton told cheering U.S. sailors, soldiers and
Marines stationed at Osan Air Base on the Korean Peninsula. The
president said that although recent U.S. attention has focused on
the threat from Iraq and its weapons program, the tensions with
North Korea because of its suspected nuclear ambitions ``remain an
area of great concern.'' (CLINTON-ASIA)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians trickled into polling booths
amid apparent calm Sunday, in a controversial referendum meant to
give Europe's poorest country its first post-communist
Constitution. Foreign election observers and national media
reported no obvious violence or voter intimidation. But they cited
slow voter turnout since polls opened at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT.) The
4,700 polling stations nationwide were to close at 1800 local time.
Turnout was the key factor in the referendum on a draft
Constitution that would outline basic civil, human and democratic
rights in this Balkan nation that shed Europe's most isolated
communist dictatorship in 1991. (ALBANIA)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gather Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1. The ministers are set
to formally release a document entitled ``The New European Way,''
which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new ascendancy
in the EU to make growth and job-creation the top economic
priority. Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the
EU's 15 nations, including the four largest - Germany, France,
Italy and Britain. ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together
an open, competitive and successful economy with a just and human
society,'' says a draft of the program posted on the Internet by
European socialist parties. (EU-SOCIALISTS)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not let chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler dictate his own terms in the search for
the country's most dangerous weapons, the newspaper of the ruling
Baath Party said Sunday. Al-Thawra, which usually states the
government's view, said Butler and his inspectors were behaving as
if they were the victor in the latest confrontation with the United
Nations over arms inspections. The inspectors returned to work last
week. Iraq had cut off all dealings with them in two steps during
August and October, but it rescinded both decisions Nov. 14, barely
averting military strikes by the United Sates and Britain. (IRAQ)

Iraq says Butler asking for government records, personal diaries

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The government said Sunday that documents
on Iraqi disarmament sought by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler have either already been seen by his inspectors or have
nothing to do with their work.
	   The documents have emerged as a new flashpoint in the dispute
between Iraq and the United Nations after Iraq reversed its ban on
the inspectors working in the country and they resumed inspections
last week.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said some of the documents in
question are long lost and Butler's insistence on having them was
meant to give the United States and Britain a pretext to mount a
military strike on Iraq.
	   ``Butler has asked for a series of alleged documents ... that do
not exist,'' Aziz told reporters after a symposium attended by
representatives from half a dozen Arab countries in solidarity with
Iraq.
	   Aziz said Butler was asking ``for access to all the archives of
the government of Iraq.... It is quite provocative if you want to
dig in the whole archives of the government of Iraq which might
take decades.''
	   He accused Butler of attempts to undermine the comprehensive
review the U.N. Security Council has pledged to undertake once the
inspectors declare that Baghdad is full compliance with their
demands.
	   Asked if Butler's demands could lead to military strike, Aziz
said: ``He's either creating a superficial pretext to justify the
American aggressions or he is trying to confuse and undermine the
comprehensive review.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency published the letters that Iraq's
Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi sent to Butler in reply to
his demand for documents.
	   In them, al-Qaisi makes clear for the first time that an air
force log sought by Butler contains an inventory of chemical
ordnance the Iraqi army used during 1983-1988.
	   He told Butler Iraq will only show his inspectors ``the relevant
parts'' of the document, which he said was hand-written by a
non-commissioned officer.
	   Al-Qaisi also said Butler has asked for the records of the
Ministry of Defense, the Military Industrialization Commission and
other government bodies which he did not name.
	   He gave a list of the visits the inspectors have made to these
establishments, including offices of Iraq's General Intelligence
and the General Directorate of Security.
	   ``These were intrusive inspections which continued for long
hours.... This demand, coming at this particular time, is more of a
provocative nature than professional,'' al-Qaisi said.
	   Al-Qaisi said Butler was asking for diaries of high-ranking
Iraqi army officers. He said these diaries were either destroyed or
had already been given to the inspectors and were no longer in
Iraq's possession.
	   Al-Qaisi revealed for the first time that the orders to destroy
some of Iraq's illegal weapons and some related documents was
verbally given by Aziz himself.
	   Iraq's scrapping of these weapons and documents has complicated
the work of U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq since they are seeking
verification that the weapons were indeed destroyed.
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. Security Council sanctions
on the country can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
the free export of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraq
insists it has met the Security Council's requirements, but the
inspectors charge it has not come clean about its weapons programs.
	   Iraq had cut off all dealings with the inspectors in two steps
during August and October, but it rescinded both decisions Nov. 14,
barely averting military strikes by the United Sates and Britain.
	   Despite mounting tension over documents, the inspectors have
been visiting suspected sites with no obstruction from Iraqi
authorities.
	   They made their first surprise visit to a suspected arms-making
facility Saturday. They also went into the field Sunday, but their
spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not reveal the number of teams
or places they would visit.

Survey says Spaniards favor talks with ETA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A strong majority of Spaniards favor
government negotiations with the armed Basque separatist group ETA,
which two months ago declared a ceasefire in its 30-year campaign,
according to an opinion poll published by a Sunday newspaper.
	   The poll, run in the conservative daily ABC, said 74.7 percent
of those interviewed said they favored talks while 22.4 percent
were opposed and 2.9 did not answer.
	   Carried out by the private firm Eco Consulting, the survey said
56.2 percent of those quizzed favored some concession to the gunmen
while 18.9 percent believed none should be made.
	   The remaining 24.9 percent wavered between saying all or a lot
of ETA's demands should be met while some declined to answer.
	   The paper said 1,001 people were questioned between No. 16-17,
exactly two months after ETA announced the beginning of its first
open-ended and unconditional truce. The survey had an error margin
of 3.1 percent.
	   Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has said ETA must
provide greater proof of its long-term intentions before full
negotiations can be launched. He has nonetheless authorized
contacts to sound out the group.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for
independence of northern Spain's Basque region. Dealing with ETA
has been one of the Spanish government's chief problems over the
past three decades.
	   Asked by the French paper Le Monde whether he is prepared to
negotiate beyond the autonomy the Basque country already enjoys,
Aznar last week replied: ``We will not pay a political price in
exchange for an end to violence.''
	   He has, however, intimated that the government is more open to
yielding to ETA's demand that all of the group's 535 jailed members
be transferred to jails in the Basque region.
	   ETA members have called on the government to make this a first
step toward talks to resolve the conflict.
	   While ETA does not command widespread public support in the
Basque region, parties which favor its demand for independence
predominate in the regional parliament.

Albanian referendum on draft Constitution calm amid slow voting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls close at 1700 GMT. Results expected Monday &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians trickled into polling booths
amid apparent calm Sunday, in a controversial referendum meant to
give Europe's poorest country its first post-communist
Constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported no
obvious violence or voter intimidation, but they said turnout
appeared low.
	   Albania's powerful opposition Democratic Party has urged a
boycott of the referendum, saying that low turnout would show the
lack of support for the draft Constitution that would outline basic
rights. Albania shed Europe's most isolated communist dictatorship
in 1991.
	   The draft would give citizens of this Balkan nation the right to
legally change their religion and to identify themselves as members
of an ethnic minority. It would also define property rights and
allow the government to expropriate land deemed of national
interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while in richer, non-Muslim
neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   The draft Constitution is seen as likely to pass.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb.
``Hope is the only thing that we can really do.''
	   Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the chief opposition
politician who played a key role in ant-government unrest earlier
this year, claimed Sunday morning that turnout will be so low the
draft will be ``a dead body.''
	   Snow also closed four roads in northern Albania and slowed, or
halted voting in some areas.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
Tirana suburb, said the Constitution will help boost prosperity in
Europe's poorest nation.
	   ``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and
walked on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in
the eye,'' said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station
as well. ``I voted for the future.''
	   Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling booth from the roofs of
nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle police throughout Tirana
searched cars with license plates from outside of Tirana.
	   Other than a heavier police presence, Tirana streets showed no
signs of tensions as residents perused street vendors' wares or
sipped coffee on sidewalk tables. Small pockets of voters gathered
in front of the schools and post offices used as polling booths but
no lengthy lineups were visible.
	   Fearing low turnout, the government recently scrapped a law
requiring a referendum to be voted on by more than 50 percent of
eligible voters.
	   Albania's Central Voting Committee released no early turnout
figures. Referendum results were expected late Monday. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has
several hundred people monitoring the vote, will also review the
fairness of the process late Monday.

Parliament reiterates loyalty to King Hussein in his absence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Parliament on Sunday renewed its allegiance
to King Hussein, fulfilling a constitutional formality which
requires such a move after a four-month absence from the throne by
the ruler.
	   King Hussein, 63, has been away from home since July 14,
receiving treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn. It is the first time in the history of Jordan that
the king has been away from home for so long.
	   Hussein told his countrymen last week that five rounds of
chemotherapy had completely cured him of cancer. But he said he
will undergo a bone marrow transplant at the end of November to
ensure it would not recur.
	   In a 45-minute meeting under the domed Parliament chamber in the
heart of Amman, both houses of Parliament unanimously voted on a
statement that expressed ``loyalty and sincerity to His Majesty
King Hussein and the cherished Hashemite throne.''
	   The 40-member, royally-appointed Senate and the 80-member
elected Chamber of Deputies also expressed confidence in Crown
Prince Hassan, Hussein's younger brother who is acting as regent in
the king's absence.
	   Such calls are necessary under the constitution, which requires
the legislature to convene a meeting to ``look into'' the king's
absence after he has been away for four months.
	   Jordanian deputies have more powers than most of their peers in
the Arab world. They can toss out governments appointed by the
king. But they must meet jointly with the Senate to dethrone the
monarch.
	   The King, the ultimate authority in Jordan, can dissolve
Parliament and rule by decree.
	   The renewed loyalty in Hussein followed Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh's assurances to Parliament of the ``complete and full
recovery'' of the king and his expected return to Jordan in late
December.
	   ``We all look forward to the return of our leader, His Majesty
King Hussein, in the nearest future,'' Tarawneh said in a brief
address.
	   ``His Majesty sends you and the Jordanian people through you his
best wishes and great love,'' he said to a loud applause.

Yamazaki wins Elleair Ladies, Hattori takes money title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MATSUYAMA, Japan (AP) _ Chikayo Yamazaki shot a one-under-par 71
Sunday and won the 65 million yen (dlrs 541,000) Daio Seishi
Elleair Ladies Open golf tournament by two strokes.
	   It was the 34-year-old Yamazaki's first victory this season and
eighth in her career.
	   Yamazaki, who led throughout the 54-hole tournament, finished
with a 6-under 210 total after three birdies and two bogeys Sunday
on the 6,352-yard, par-72 Elleair Golf Club Matsuyama course in
southwestern Japan.
	   She collected 11.7 million yen (dlrs 97,500).
	   South Korea's Ku Ok-hee shot a 70 and tied for second at 212,
settling the season's money earnings race. Despite receiving 4.72
million yen (dlrs 39,000) Sunday, Ku now cannot catch money leader
Michiko Hattori, who shot a 74 and tied for 12th at 217 with Ok
Woo-soon of South Korea and six other Japanese.
	   Hattori, the 1985 U.S. amateur champion, is more than 13 million
yen (dlrs 108,000) ahead of Ku with one tournament left, assuring
her of her first Japan LPGA money earnings title in her eight-year
pro career.
	   Hattori, who has won four tournaments this season, has 79.59
million yen (dlrs 663,000) and Ku 65.82 million yen (dlrs 548,000).
	   Tied with Ku at 212 Sunday were South Korea's Won Jai-sook and
Japan's Aki Takamura. Won shot 71 and Takamura 72 Sunday.

Egyptian official says his country wants better ties with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Egyptian foreign minister Amr Moussa said
Sunday that his country wants to improve ties with Iran, with whom
it has been at odds since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   ``We are for positive relations between Iran and Egypt. It is
important for there to be a mutual desire for better relations,''
he said at a press conference in Oman.
	   But an Iranian newspaper on Sunday criticized Egypt for lagging
in improving ties with Iran.
	   ``Less talk and more action is needed if Egypt is to experience
normalization of ties with Iran,'' said the Iran News, which is
close to the Foreign Ministry.
	   Since President Mohammad Khatami took office last year relations
between the two nations ``warmed slightly,'' the paper said.
``Unfortunately, however, no practical steps have been taken.''
	   Egypt and Iran severed ties after the Islamic Revolution. Egypt
maintains an interests section in Tehran, which works from the
Italian Embassy.
	   Egypt recently upgraded its diplomatic mission in Iran in a sign
of thawing ties, and Saudi foreign minister Saud al Faisal traveled
to Egypt earlier this month to work on improving relations between
the two countries.
	   Tehran and Cairo have held a series of meetings between the
foreign ministers of the two countries, which have been working to
upgrade relations.
	   Recently, Iran sent trade, parliamentary and press delegations
to Egypt in a bid to improve ties.
	   Egypt is eager to improve relations, but wants Iran to end its
alleged support for fundamentalist Egyptian groups trying to topple
the secular regime of President Hosni Mubarak. Iran has denied
supporting the Egyptian radicals.
	   Moussa left Oman later Sunday for Kuwait, saying on arrival that
he hoped the U.N. weapons inspectors' work in Iraq would be carried
out without incident.

Reports: Jagger and Jerry Hall have split again: But why?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: 9th graf, note Harpers and Queen takes ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP ) _ Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall have split again and
may divorce, British tabloids agreed Sunday.
	   But the tabs divided over whether the trouble this time is an
old problem _ the Rolling Stones singer's other women, or a new one
_ his anger that their willowy, 14-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, is
already following in her mother's footsteps on the catwalk.
	   The Mail on Sunday said Jagger stormed out of the family's
London mansion and has gone to his chateau France's Loire Valley
after accusing his 42-year-old wife and onetime top model of
seeking to revive publicity for herself by modeling with Elizabeth.
	   The News of the World, however, carried a shadowy picture that
it said showed Jagger, 54, on Wednesday night leaving the Paris
apartment of an old flame, model Carla Bruni.
	   ``I don't know what all the fuss is about,'' Ms. Bruni, 31, was
quoted as telling Jason Fraser, a photographer staking out her
apartment. ``There are 7,000 girls.''
	   Enraged, Texan-born Ms. Hall has flown to New York _ without her
wedding ring, but taking the couple's youngest child, 11-month-old
Gabriel, and plans to seek a multimillion pound (dlrs) divorce
settlement through lawyers in the United States, according to the
reports.
	   Jagger is British, but lives most of the time out of the country
as a tax exile.
	   Ms. Hall and Elizabeth have received huge publicity several time
this year by appearing together modeling in glamorous collections,
including Thierry Mugler's Paris show.
	   Mother-and-daughter are on the front cover of the latest edition
of Harpers and Queen magazine, over the caption, ``Raising Miss
Jagger.''
	   In an interview inside, Ms. Hall was quoted as saying Jagger is
``furious'' about Elizabeth's modeling.
	   ``He says it is silly as she doesn't need the money,'' Ms. Hall
was quoted as saying. ``But I tell him almost every schoolgirl
wants to be a model. Elizabeth is very grown-up, polite and
mature.''
	   Jagger and Ms. Hall have lived together since the late 1970s and
married in 1991. Elizabeth is the eldest of their four children and
he has two older daughters.
	   In 1996 newspapers said Ms. Hall was seeking a divorce because
of his liaisons. But they patched it up, and when she revealed she
was pregnant, British tabloids dubbed Gabriel a ``Kiss and Make-up
Baby.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deep-seated ethnic and religious
tensions erupted in the capital of crisis-ridden Indonesia Sunday
when Muslim mobs attacked or burned at least four Christian
churches and then went on a riot spree.
	   At least six people were killed in violence that broke out less
than one kilometer (one-half mile) from the presidential palace, a
little more than a week after deadly clashes between students and
security personnel also triggered rioting.
	   Troops fired shots and volleys of tear gas to break up
rock-throwing crowds Sunday. Armored personnel carriers rolled down
streets littered with broken glass as the violence continued after
dark.
	   Most of the dead were stabbed and some of the bodies were
mutilated.
	   Dozens were reported injured in fighting between the local
Muslim majority and Christian migrants originally from the eastern
Indonesian city of Ambon.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said.
	   Three churches were burned and one was trashed, officials said.
	   Witnesses said other Christian places of worship had also been
attacked.
	   A gambling hall was set afire and a Catholic girls' school near
the city's cathedral was ransacked and partly burned.
	   Dozens of stores, other buildings and cars were damaged or
burned.
	   The military said Muslim residents were angered by
unsubstantiated rumors that Christians had attacked a mosque after
being paid by members of the ethnic Chinese minority.
	   Several stores in Chinatown were burned Sunday. Witnesses said
ethnic Chinese residents, many of them also Christian, armed
themselves with sticks and knives to protect their homes, which
were attacked during previous rioting.
	   The latest violence comes as Indonesia grapples with its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty
as inflation and unemployment rates soar.
	   President B.J. Habibie warned recently of a major breakdown in
law and order. He is at the center of protests over his plans to
change Indonesia's political system, which opponents say fall short
of introducing true democracy.
	   Jakarta's central military commander, Lt. Col. Widodo, and a
bodyguard were stabbed and seriously injured in one brawl.
	   Local television stations reported that 10 people had been
arrested after rival mobs attacked one another, some holding rivals
captive.
	   Looting and arson were reported in several areas in the north
and west of the capital, the home of dozens of ethnic groups.
	   Squads of soldiers protected several churches as night fell and
troopers fired at looters.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making Indonesia the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy.
	   Muslim preachers tried to calm angry crowds by reading passages
from Islam's holy book, the Koran, over loud hailers as hundreds of
followers sat in a major road.
	   Outside one university campus, about 2,000 people threw rocks
and built a bonfire.
	   The violence was the latest sign that the military, under
pressure over human rights abuses, is increasingly hard-pressed to
keep order in the city of 11 million people.
	   Last week, as many as 16 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms.
	   On Sunday, mobs broke into a Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was under way, smashing stained glass windows, chalices
and a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles on to
a bonfire.
	   Some youths carried banners proclaiming them as members of the
``Front to Defend Islam.''
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks from reaching the burning Christian
Church of Ketapang. A police helicopter swooped through a pall of
black smoke as thousands of people roamed the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Two dozen worshipers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away, and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Many local Muslim complained that the Ambonese were involved in
illegal gambling.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
	   Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart. It was not known
where the victim was from.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade and commerce.

Three men drown in a well in Yemen as they try to remove dead cat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three men drowned in a well in western Yemen
when they tried to remove a dead cat, the al-Thawra newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   The owner of a well in the town of Hodeida on Thursday asked a
man specialized in cleaning wells to remove a cat that had died in
his well a week earlier, the paper said.
	   The man took a rope to climb down the well but fainted from the
stench and drowned, the paper said. It said his brother and another
men followed him into the well and also drowned.
	   A fourth went down to rescue the men but was also unable to
climb back up. He was saved when the police arrived and pulled him
out. The police also retrieved the bodies of the three men and the
cat.

Journalist group says media ethics have worsened in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The majority of Hong Kong journalists believe
that media ethics have worsened in the territory over the past
year, a survey showed Sunday.
	   In the survey by the Hong Kong Journalists Association, 77
percent of its 660 members believed that journalistic ethics were
worse or much worse than a year ago.
	   However, the association said only 20 percent of those
questioned supported establishing a press council with powers to
fine media organizations.
	   The question of media ethics has come under discussion recently
after one of Hong Kong's most popular newspapers apologized last
month for paying a widower 5,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 641)
to pose with prostitutes.
	   The Chinese-language Apple Daily said that although the
newspaper did not fabricate any news, it inappropriately and
``indirectly '' paid Chen Kin-hong and others to enhance its
coverage with staged photographs.
	   Chen's wife had earlier jumped to her death after pushing their
two sons from their high-rise apartment building, reportedly
because she was upset over her husband's visit to prostitutes in
mainland China.

Despite regional crisis, investment in and out of Taiwan grows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Despite the Asian economic crisis, Taiwan
has attracted more foreign investment in the past year, while
Taiwanese investment overseas also has risen sharply, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   New direct foreign investment in Taiwan rose from U.S. dlrs 1.7
billion to dlrs 2.1 billion between July 1997 and June 1998, the
highest rate of growth since 1990, the Central Daily News reported.
	   During the same period, Taiwanese investment overseas rose from
dlrs 4.16 billion to dlrs 5.22 billion, indicating that the
crashing of currencies and markets in much of Asia has had little
effect, the paper said.
	   Buffered by more than U.S. dlrs 80 billion in foreign currency
reserves and a healthy banking system, Taiwan projects its economy
will grow by 5.3 percent in 1998. That is lower than last year, a
result of a sharp drop off in exports, but still admirable in the
region, where many countries are forecasting stagnant growth or
even contraction.

Iraq says Butler asking for government records, personal diaries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from al-Qaisi; EDITS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101,103 &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Sunday that disarmament documents
sought by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler have either
already been seen by his inspectors or have nothing to do with
their work.
	   The documents have emerged as a new flashpoint in the dispute
between Iraq and the United Nations after Iraq reversed its ban on
the inspectors working in the country and they resumed inspections
last week.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said some of the documents in
question are long lost and Butler's insistence on having them was
meant to give the United States and Britain a pretext to mount a
military strike on Iraq.
	   ``Butler has asked for a series of alleged documents ... that do
not exist,'' Aziz told reporters after a symposium attended by
representatives from half a dozen Arab countries in solidarity with
Iraq.
	   Aziz said Butler was asking ``for access to all the archives of
the government of Iraq. ... It is quite provocative if you want to
dig in the whole archives of the government of Iraq which might
take decades.''
	   The inspectors' job is to certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. Security Council sanctions
on the country can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
the free export of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraq
insists it has met the Security Council's requirements, but the
inspectors charge it has not come clean about its weapons programs.
	   Aziz accused Butler of attempting to undermine the comprehensive
review of the sanctions the U.N. Security Council has pledged to
undertake once the inspectors declare that Baghdad is full
compliance with their demands.
	   Asked if Butler's demands could lead to a military strike, Aziz
said: ``He's either creating a superficial pretext to justify the
American aggressions or he is trying to confuse and undermine the
comprehensive review.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency published the letters that Iraq's
Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi sent to Butler in reply to
his demand for documents.
	   In them, al-Qaisi makes clear for the first time that an air
force log sought by Butler contains an inventory of chemical
ordnance the Iraqi army used during 1983-1988.
	   He told Butler that Iraq only will show his inspectors ``the
relevant parts'' of the document, which he said was handwritten by
a noncommissioned officer.
	   Al-Qaisi also said Butler has asked for the records of the
Ministry of Defense, the Military Industrialization Commission and
other government bodies, which he did not name.
	   He gave a list of the visits the inspectors have made to these
establishments, including offices of Iraq's General Intelligence
and the General Directorate of Security.
	   ``These were intrusive inspections which continued for long
hours.... This demand, coming at this particular time, is more of a
provocative nature than professional,'' al-Qaisi said.
	   Al-Qaisi said Butler was asking for diaries of high-ranking
Iraqi army officers. He said these diaries were either destroyed or
had already been given to the inspectors and were no longer in
Iraq's possession.
	   Al-Qaisi revealed for the first time that the orders to destroy
some of Iraq's illegal weapons and some related documents was
verbally given by Aziz himself.
	   Iraq's scrapping of these weapons and documents has complicated
the work of U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq since they are seeking
verification that the weapons were indeed destroyed.
	   Iraq had cut off all dealings with the inspectors in two steps
during August and October, but it rescinded both decisions Nov. 14,
barely averting military strikes by the United Sates and Britain.
	   Despite mounting tension over documents, the inspectors have
been visiting suspected sites with no obstruction from Iraqi
authorities.
	   They made their first surprise visit to a suspected arms-making
facility Saturday. They also went into the field Sunday, but their
spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not reveal the number of teams
or places they would visit.

Parliament wants to probe Saudi prince's prison in a Cairo hotel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Parliament wants to question the government
about the case of a Saudi prince who allegedly turned part of a
hotel suite into a prison for his servants, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Sunday.
	   Prince Turki bin Abdel Aziz, who is King Fahd's brother, has
been investigated by police for allegedly locking up his Egyptian
servants in the 29th floor suite where he and his wife have lived
for years.
	   MENA said a deputy has asked Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury to
answer questions on whether the government is taking any action
against the Saudi Prince in the case which received wide publicity
in Egypt.
	   Twenty-seven other deputies supported the motion and asked for
an emergency debate on the problem, MENA said.
	   Two of the prince's servants escaped from a room in the Ramses
Hilton Hotel on Monday by knotting sheets together and lowering
themselves through a window to the 24th floor.
	   The two men told police that the prince locked them in the room
after they complained of mistreatment. They said other servants
were locked up, too.
	   Prince Turki, one of King Fahd's six brothers, has been living
in Egypt for years since he fell out with the royal family. He
rents two floors of the Ramses Hilton for his family and entourage.
	   Earlier this year, police launched an investigation into claims
that Turki and his wife mistreated and locked up their servants.
The latest incident follows also several complaints about the
prince's bodyguards, including Americans, beating up people who got
in their way.
	   The move to debate Prince Turki's behavior in Parliament signals
that the government is fed up and may want to deport the prince. In
an advertisement in an opposition paper Sunday, Turki complained
about a publicly campaign to discredit him.

Author Taslima Nasrin gets bail in a blasphemy case

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Controversial author Taslima Nasrin
emerged from hiding Sunday and surrendered to an appeals court to
answer charges of blaspheming Islam. The court released her on
bail.
	   Facing death threats from Islamic extremists, the writer has
been hiding since she returned to Bangladesh in September with her
mother, who is dying from colon cancer.
	   ``I'm happy to be freed on bail, but my life is still at risk as
the Muslim fundamentalists have threatened to kill me,'' Nasrin,
36, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her
hideout.
	   Nasrin, a poet, novelist and essayist, fled her homeland four
years ago because of the threats and street protests that erupted
after a newspaper quoted her as saying Islam's holy book, the
Koran, should be rewritten.
	   A few days after she returned home, a lower court ordered her
arrest in a 1994 blasphemy case filed by a Dhaka resident who
accused her of offending Muslims in her ``Selected Columns,'' a
compilation of her newspaper articles.
	   Sunday's ruling from the High Court came after Dhaka district
court rejected her bail petition early this month and asked her to
surrender to the court by Jan.5.
	   Escorted by family members and lawyers, Nasrin drove to the High
Court and pleaded innocent.
	   Nasrin has denied that she has made any comments against Islam's
holy book, but says she called for changes in Islamic laws to give
Muslim women more rights.
	   Her denial did not calm her critics, who have offered 200,000
takas (dlrs 5,000) for anyone who kills her.
	   ``I've no freedom to move in my own country because the
fundamentalists are out to kill me,'' Nasrin said, ``But I'll never
bow to them.''

Arabian bankers to sue for damages over Bavaria's decision on
</HEADLINE>
Hitler's retreat &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Arabian investors plan to sue Bavaria
state over a decision to retain control of Hitler's retreat on
Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps, claiming they lost a million
marks (dlrs 595,000) competing to install a tourist center there,
Focus magazine said Sunday.
	   The Munich-based magazine said the group had offered to invest
180 million marks (dlrs 107 million) in the project in two years of
negotiations with the Bavarian Finance Ministry and were misled
about their chances.
	   Included in the would-be investor group was the Chairman of the
Bank of Jordan and a Jordanian minister, Focus said.
	   ``Only at the end or the talks did Bavaria inform us that with
this highly sensitive project it was clear from the beginning that
Arabs would have no chance,'' of taking part, Focus quoted the
group's lawyer Ralf Brueckner as saying.
	   State finance ministry officials were not immediately available
on Sunday to comment on the report.
	   On Friday Finance Minister Kurt Faltlhauser said an old hotel on
the Obersalzberg site would be razed and a new luxury 200-bed hotel
scheduled to be opened in 2002 will be constructed.
	   The resort will include a nine-hole golf course and six ski
lifts in the area,
	   To dispel any concerns that the site might become a shrine for
neo-Nazis, Faltlhauser said the state would maintain ownership to
keep a say in its use.
	   A private operator will carry out the 60 million mark (dlrs 36
million) project.
	   Obersalzberg, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of
Munich, included a number of buildings connected by an unfinished
system of tunnels and bunkers that were designed as Hitler's Alpine
fortress. Nearby is Kehlstein peak, with a restaurant known as
``Eagle's Nest,'' also once used by Hitler.
	   State officials are preparing a documentation center on
Obersalzberg's history on the ruins of Hitler's former Nazi guest
house. It is to open next year.
	   The project, overseen by the Munich Historical Institute, has
been criticized by some as marketing the history of the Nazis.
Critics have instead demanded a memorial to victims of the
Holocaust, but the state has refused to back down.

Franco supporters call for release of Pinochet in Madrid rally

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Calling for the release of former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet, some 2,000 people gathered Sunday in
Madrid to sing fascist songs and listen to anti-democracy speeches
at the 23rd memorial rally for Gen. Francisco Franco.
	   The crowd, mostly elderly people, gathered for the near
hour-long demonstration at the Plaza de Oriente square and
throughout the meeting small groups broke into cries of ``Liberty
for Pinochet.''
	   Pinochet, 83, was arrested in October in London on a Spanish
judge's warrant. Britain's highest court is to rule this week
whether or not he may be extradited to Spain to face charges of
genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   The last time Pinochet was in Spain was for Franco's funeral in
1975.
	   Franco died at 82 on Nov. 20, 1975. His followers hold their
main annual gathering on the Sunday closest to the anniversary. But
while tens of thousands of people would have attended the rallies
in the late 1970s, attendance has dwindled sharply over the past
decade.
	   During the rally Sunday, the crowd also heard pro-Franco and
anti-democracy speeches from rightists such as Blas Pinar, one of
Spain's best known Franco supporters.
	   Dozens of the participants raised their right arms in fascist
salutes and sang the ``Face to the Sun,'' the anthem of Franco's
1939-1975 dictatorship.
	   At a separate rally, several hundred supporters of the rightist
National Unity Alliance party gathered to lay flowers at the only
remaining statue of Franco in Madrid, located outside the
Development Ministry.
	   No incidents of violence were reported Sunday although in
previous years there have been running clashes between the
rightists and anti-fascist opponents who traditionally gather in
another city square for a counter rally.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chairman of a small opposition
group was arrested after a demonstration Saturday night in support
of arrested dissident Anwar Ibrahim, even though he did not take
part, a human rights group said.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, expressed
concern that the arrest of Tian Chua may mark a massive crackdown
against dissent in Malaysia.
	   Tian, chairman of the Coalition of People's Democracy, was
picked up by five plainclothes policemen about two hours after the
demonstration had dispersed, said a statement from the rights group
Suaram.
	   He was among four people arrested during or after the
demonstration in support of Anwar, who was arrested Sept. 20, two
weeks after his firing by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sparked
massive anti-government protests.
	   Anwar is being tried on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct, which he has denied and called politically motivated.
	   The coordinator of Suaram, Elizabeth Wong, said in the statement
that she witnessed the arrest and saw Tian, a member of Suaram,
manhandled and punched at least twice by the police.
	   She said several plainclothesmen pushed her aside and one swore
at her.
	   The coalition headed by Tian has about 20 members from private
organizations and opposition political parties. None of the members
was known to have joined in Saturday night's demonstration.
	   Opposition leader Lim, secretary-general of the Democratic
Action Party, expressed shock at the arrest and called for Tian's
immediate and unconditional release.
	   He said a crackdown on dissent would ``usher in a new dark age
for democracy in the country,'' and urged Prime Minister Mahathir
to seek a political solution to the crisis.
	   Lim left later Sunday to attend an international human rights
conference in Edmonton, Canada, Nov. 26-28.
	   He also is to visit the Canadian Parliament and meet with
officials of the Canadian Subcommittee on Human Rights.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Snow capped the island of Capri and Naples' Mount
Vesuvius on Sunday, brought on by a cold snap that hit parts of
Italy with some of the most biting chill in 10 years.
	   Heavy snow also fell in Italy's northern mountains, compounding
the suffering of hundreds still living in temporary housing after
losing their homes in last year's devastating earthquake in the
Umbria and Marche regions.
	   Sporadic blackouts meant some of the people of the trailer camps
did without heat or lights during the worst of the cold Saturday.
	   ``We are alone, abandoned _ no one remembers us,'' Italy's Il
Tempo newspaper quoted one woman as yelling at reporters visiting
embittered residents of the trailer camps, where snow was shin-high
and the wind blew flakes in blustering gusts.
	   The lowest temperature recorded _ 8 degrees Fahrenheit _ was on
Mount Cimone north of Florence. It was 23 degrees in Turin in the
northwest region of Piedmont, the coldest weather there since 1988,
and 35 degrees in Rome, which escaped the snowfall.
	   The snow was the first in 10 years for the usually sunny
southern island of Capri. Onshore, up to 16 inches covered Mount
Vesuvius and surrounding peaks.

Christiaan Barnard: Diana wanted to move to SAfrica with boyfriend
</HEADLINE>
Khan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Princess Diana once asked
heart transplant pioneer Dr. Christiaan Barnard to help her and her
sweetheart move to South Africa, Barnard said.
	   The boyfriend was not Dodi Fayed, with whom she died in a car
crash on Aug. 31, 1997, but Hasnat Khan, a leading British-based
heart surgeon, Barnard was quoted as saying in the Sunday Times.
	   In October 1996, Diana told Barnard about her love for Khan,
Barnard was quoted as saying in the Johannesburg newspaper. She
asked Barnard to help Khan find a job in Cape Town, Barnard's home
town and where Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, also
maintains a residence.
	   ``There was no doubt in my mind that she was very much in love
with Khan and would have married him if he had agreed,'' Barnard
said.
	   The relationship foundered, Barnard said, because Khan ``could
not handle the publicity of living with Diana.''
	   On June 29, 1997, a London-based tabloid, the Sunday Mirror,
reported Diana and Khan had agreed to marry after a secret
friendship. The newspaper also said Diana had flown to Pakistan to
win the approval of Khan's mother and grandmother.
	   On the day the article appeared, Diana denied she was engaged to
Khan.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Deep-seated ethnic and religious
tensions erupted in the capital of crisis-ridden Indonesia Sunday
when Muslim mobs attacked or burned at least 11 Christian churches
and then went on a riot spree.
	   Police said six people were killed in violence that broke out
less than one kilometer (one-half mile) from the presidential
palace, a little more than a week after deadly clashes between
students and security personnel also triggered rioting.
	   Troops fired shots and volleys of tear gas to break up
rock-throwing crowds Sunday. Armored personnel carriers rolled down
streets littered with broken glass. The violence subsided by
mid-evening.
	   Most of the dead were stabbed and some of the bodies were
mutilated.
	   Dozens were reported injured in fighting between the local
Muslim majority and Christian migrants originally from the eastern
Indonesian city of Ambon.
	   Muslim residents said they retaliated when a group of Ambonese
threw rocks at a local mosque and smashed some windows.
	   ``Islam is the power in this area,'' one man said.
	   ``We have attacked the enemies of our religion,'' said another.
	   Four churches were burned and seven trashed, officials said,
adding that the damage toll could rise.
	   A gambling hall was set afire and a Catholic girls' school near
the city's cathedral was ransacked and partly burned.
	   Dozens of stores, other buildings and cars were damaged or
burned.
	   The military said Muslims were further angered by
unsubstantiated rumors that members of the ethnic Chinese minority
paid for the attack on the mosque.
	   Several stores in Chinatown were burned Sunday. Witnesses said
ethnic Chinese residents, many of them also Christian, armed
themselves with sticks and knives to protect their homes, which
were attacked during previous rioting.
	   The latest violence comes as Indonesia grapples with its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty
as inflation and unemployment rates soar.
	   President B.J. Habibie warned recently of a major breakdown in
law and order. He is at the center of protests over his plans to
change Indonesia's political system, which opponents say fall short
of introducing true democracy.
	   Jakarta's central military commander, Lt. Col. Widodo, and a
bodyguard were stabbed and seriously injured in one brawl.
	   Local television stations reported that 10 people had been
arrested after rival mobs attacked one another, some holding rivals
captive.
	   Looting and arson were reported in several areas in the north
and west of the capital, the home of dozens of ethnic groups.
	   Squads of soldiers protected several churches as night fell and
troopers fired at looters.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making Indonesia the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy.
	   Muslim preachers tried to calm angry crowds by reading passages
from Islam's holy book, the Koran, over loud hailers as hundreds of
followers sat in a major road.
	   Outside one university campus, about 2,000 people threw rocks
and built a bonfire.
	   The violence was the latest sign that the military, under
pressure over human rights abuses, is increasingly hard-pressed to
keep order in the city of 11 million people.
	   Last week, as many as 17 people were killed in clashes between
anti-government students and police and soldiers during a
government assembly on political reforms. The latest victim died in
a Jakarta hospital from wounds, a local television station
reported.
	   On Sunday, mobs broke into a Catholic church while a wedding
ceremony was under way, smashing stained glass windows, chalices
and a statue of the Virgin Mary and flinging pews and Bibles on to
a bonfire.
	   Some youth carried banners proclaiming them as members of the
``Front to Defend Islam.''
	   Mobs blocked fire trucks from reaching the burning Christian
Church of Ketapang. A police helicopter swooped through a pall of
black smoke as thousands of people roamed the streets. Soldiers
with helmets, sticks and shields eventually pushed them away.
	   Two dozen worshipers attending a service at the Protestant
church fled when mobs attacked. Firemen pumped water from polluted
canals to fight the blaze, but the church was gutted.
	   Mobs threw rocks at an open-backed military truck carrying 20
Ambonese that raced away, and boys poked sticks at the occupants
through the vehicle's protective wire netting.
	   ``Kill them,'' the rioters screamed.
	   Many local Muslims complained that the Ambonese were involved in
illegal gambling.
	   Officials of the Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of
Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. The
killers of one man cut off one of his ears and brandished it.
	   Assailants paraded a sixth body in a cart. It was not known
where the victim was from.
	   Six months ago, Indonesia's sprawling capital was convulsed by
rioting that killed 1,200 people and led to the ouster of former
President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Mobs at that time targeted the homes and shops of Indonesia's
ethnic Chinese minority, which is resented because it dominates
trade and commerce.

Twenty-three people freeze to death in November cold wave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Twenty three people have frozen to death
in Poland since November 16 when a cold wave hit, most of them
victims of excessive drinking, police said Sunday.
	   Alcohol was a factor in ten out of 15 deaths, said a police
spokesman Slawomir Cisowski. Most of the victims were men aged
40-60. Police did not yet have detailed reports on other deaths.
	   Police said they took some 200 people sleeping on the streets to
shelters all over the country to sober them up during the last 24
hours.
	   ``This is a suicidal recklessness,'' said Cisowski.
	   The lowest temperature reported early Sunday was in Ostroleka in
northeastern Poland, where minus -26 Celsius (-15 F) was recorded
at the ground, the PAP news agency said.

Butcher's century lifts England to 299 for four

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Inspired by a brilliant Mark Butcher
century, England put up a brave batting performance in the face of
a daunting Australian total in the first Ashes cricket test at the
Gabba on Sunday.
	   England resumed 432 runs behind on 53 for one. When bad light
and rain stopped play on the third day, the visitors had progressed
to 299 for four, comfortably averting the follow on.
	   On a day marked by high-quality batsmanship to match the
Australian centuries by Steve Waugh and Ian Healy on the second
day, Butcher led the way with his second test century.
	   It was a timely return to form by the left-handed opener who
went into the test with woeful batting form _ managing just nine
runs from five first-class innings.
	   Butcher's 116, equaling his maiden test century against South
Africa at Leeds in August, lifted England as he shared a rollicking
second-wicket stand with Nasser Hussain, who scored 59.
	   When the day's play was cut short by 15 overs, Graham Thorpe and
Mark Ramprakash, the last recognized batting pair, were together
figuring in an undefeated 59-run stand.
	   Thirty minutes will be added to the start and stumps on the
fourth day Monday to make up for the lost time.
	   Thorpe, playing his first test since back surgery in August, hit
70 runs in a little over three hours, while Ramprakash, after a
nervous start, settled down to score 29.
	   Butcher and Hussain continued from where they left off
overnight, thrashing the much-vaunted attack during a 134-run stand
in 21 minutes over two hours.
	   The pair started the day in buoyant style, banishing leg spinner
Stuart MacGill out of the attack by taking 22 runs in three overs.
	   The unexpected attack left Mark Taylor short of options before
Michael Kasprowicz finally struck in the 20th over of the day.
	   Australia quickly wrested the initiative with the gifted wicket
of Alec Stewart when the England captain swept a MacGill full-toss
to Kasprowicz at square leg.
	   But Butcher, who suffered a nasty cut in England's tour opener
against Western Australia at the WACA in Perth, continued the
onslaught with Thorpe as partner.
	   England raced to 179 for three at lunch and was very much in
control in the post-lunch session before part-time off spinner Mark
Waugh struck.
	   Butcher, who survived being bowled off a Kasprowicz no-ball, was
brilliantly caught and bowled by Waugh, one of the seven bowlers
used by Taylor to unsettle the threatening England batting.
	   Butcher was given anti-inflammatory tablets in the pre-lunch
session when he complained of a twinge in his back soon after
Australia took the second new ball.
	   Butcher, playing in his 15th test since making his debut against
Australia at Edgbaston in 1997, batted for 278 minutes and hit 16
fours off 236 balls.
	   He reached his century with a cover-driven boundary off MacGill,
racing to his century off 179 balls. His second 50 came off just 78
balls.
	   The left-handed pair of Butcher and Thorpe put the bowling to
sword with a 72-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 100
minutes.
	   Hussain beat Butcher to his half century, but soon got into a
shell before falling. Kasprowicz softened him up with a short ball
and then squared him up with a fine outswinger that was duly edged
to wicketkeeper Ian Healy.

Pro-Iraqi protesters condemn US foreign policy

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Around 50 pro-Iraqi protesters staged a
sit-in in front of the U.S. Embassy to demand the lifting of U.N.
sanctions on Iraq.
	   The protesters, mostly women, held signs with slogans against
the United States and Britain, the two countries that are the
strongest advocates of maintaining sanctions on Iraq. ``The Yanks
and Brits are the mothers of terrorism,'' said one sign.
	   ``We are here to show solidarity to the Iraqi people and to
deliver a protest paper to the American government,'' said Leila
Khaled, a Palestinian woman known for taking part in airplane
hijackings in the early 1970s.
	   ``We feel that the U.S. government is a state of terrorism,''
she said as she and five other women presented the statement to the
embassy's press attache.
	   The statement described U.S. foreign policy as ``destructive''
toward the Palestinians and such Arab countries as Iraq, Syria,
Sudan and Libya.
	   ``Your policy is based on protecting your own military interests
and presence in the region,'' it said.
	   ``We ask that sanctions be lifted,'' the statement said. The
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and
will not be lifted until the country lives up to resolutions
demanding it eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Keeping a watchful eye on the one-hour protest were hundreds of
anti-riot police in armored cars.

Afghan Taliban's ammunition container explodes in Kabul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A container full of ammunition
exploded at a military base of the hard-line Taliban Islamic
militia in the capital Kabul on Sunday. Authorities said there were
no causalities.
	   The ammunition container was parked at a Taliban military base
in the northwest Badam Bagh neighborhood of the city.
	   The explosions continued for more than five minutes, witnesses
said.
	   No one was hurt and no equipment or property was destroyed,
Taliban officials said.
	   Giant fumes of smoke could be seen from a distance as two
fire-brigade vehicles rushed toward the base.
	   The Taliban militia control roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan,
including the capital.
	   The militia is locked in a bloody conflict with the opposition
northern alliance, which controls the remaining 10 percent of the
country.

Indonesian rioters wreck church during wedding service

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ It was the wedding from hell. Before
groom Chandra Gunarto and bride Threewaty could say ``I do,'' they
had to run for their lives.
	   An angry mob of Muslim youths ran through the front doors of the
Sacred Heart Catholic Church near Jakarta's Chinatown after burning
down a nearby Protestant church during a neighborhood riot that
witnesses said started when a group of people attacked a local
mosque.
	   At least six people were killed in Sunday's violence, which came
a week after a wave of deadly student protests and riots.
	   Police said 11 churches were burned or trashed.
	   Inside the church, the mob overturned the pews, broke plaster
statues and smashed up the confessional boxes.
	   ``We were standing at the altar and, suddenly, rocks shattered
all the stain glass windows,'' said Chandra, a 27-year-old sales
manager.
	   ``We got out as quickly as we could. We're still not married.
But we're safe,'' said Threewaty, also 27, who goes by only one
name.
	   ``We have been planning our wedding for more than nine months,''
she said sobbing. ``We've canceled the reception.''
	   The couple, the priest and about 60 guests ran to a community
hall at the rear of the church and barricaded themselves in as the
rioters went wild.
	   They ransacked the vestry, pulling the robes from closets and
throwing chalices and candlesticks on the floor, which was covered
in broken glass.
	   They lit fires inside and took pews out into the street. They
set them afire and burned dozens of Bibles and prayer books in the
bonfire. Hundreds of torn pages littered the road.
	   Riot officers broke up the melee with warning shots.
	   ``I just don't understand why they did this,'' the Rev. Soni
Wangkang said as he surveyed the wreckage.
	   A few hundred meters (yards) away, a crowd of several hundred
Muslim youths sat in the middle of a road and recited Islamic
prayers as heavily armed riot squads watched.
	   Some youths carried banners proclaiming them as members of the
``Front to Defend Islam.''
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making Indonesia the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   However, religious tolerance is enshrined in the national
philosophy.
	   Wangkang said many of his 6,000 parishioners are ethnic Chinese,
a racial minority in Indonesia who have been targeted in a series
of riots in recent times because of their success in business.
	   ``But many of our people are also Indonesians. All sorts of
ethnic groups worship here,'' he said.
	   Local radio station Sonora read out long lists of Christian
wedding services that were canceled across Jakarta after Sunday's
riot.

Halard-Decugis scores career-first singles, doubles triumphs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) _ Second-seeded Julie Halard-Decugis won
both the singles and doubles titles at the same event for the first
time in a 12-year professional career Sunday at the dlrs 107,500
Volvo Women's Open.
	   The Frenchwoman's annihilation of fifth-seeded Li Fang of China,
6-1, 6-2, in just 60 minutes, pushed her No. 28 ranking on the WTA
Tour to No. 22, organizers said.
	   ``I'm so happy,'' Halard-Decugis said. ``It's the first time
I've ever won both singles and doubles at the same event.''
	   The singles victory continued a steady climb up the rankings for
Halard-Decugis, who began the season unranked after sitting out of
tennis for 18 months due to wrist and knee injuries.
	   Li, who carries her country's hopes in next month's Asian Games
in Bangkok, looked totally outclassed.
	   ``She had perfect returns, a first serve that never missed, and
I felt like I was stuck to the court,'' Li said.
	   Halard-Decugis formed the top-seeded doubles team with Els
Callens of Belgium to defeat the unseeded pairing of Rika Hiraki of
Japan and Poland's Aleksandra Olsza 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Besides being a personal triumph for Halard-Decugis, it was also
the first time in the 10 years of the Volvo Women's Open that
singles and doubles titles have been won by the same player.

Picks up 7th graf pvs. One name for Suharto is correct. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In March, 1,000 legislators obediently
handed Indonesia's President Suharto a seventh five-year term. Now,
with Suharto forced from office, many of those delegates profess
eagerness to scrap his authoritarian legacy.
	   Student protesters doubt their sincerity, and they have fought
deadly battles with the military this month while demonstrating
their scorn for political reforms endorsed by Indonesia's highest
legislative body.
	   Still, inside the heavily guarded Parliament, legislators are
hurriedly drafting laws for perhaps the most crucial reform: the
plan by President B.J. Habibie to hold elections next year.
	   Under Habibie, once Suharto's protege, change has already swept
the Southeast Asian nation. Riots and protests helped oust the
77-year-old Suharto in May after 32 years in power. Suharto, like
many Indonesians, uses only one name.
	   New political parties and trade unions are sprouting. Many
political prisoners have been freed. News organizations are much
more freewheeling than in neighboring Singapore or Malaysia.
	   But Indonesia's path toward democracy will be long and
difficult, and possibly jeopardized by social tensions. On Sunday,
Muslim youths vandalized or burned at least four Christian churches
in Jakarta, triggering riots in several parts of the city.
	   Although the 12 decrees adopted by the People's Consultative
Assembly are broad promises of change, it is unclear how vigorously
the government will pursue them.

Free State claws way toward possible win against West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with play to tea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Free State clawed their way to
within 298 runs of their 438-run target Sunday on the third day of
their four-day match against the touring West Indies at Springbok
Park.
	   This is the final warmup match for the West Indies before the
first of a five-test series starts in Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   Earlier in the day, the West Indies batting practice was spoiled
by young Johan van der Wath as they scored just 188. Van der Wath
took a career-best five for 26 in his debut first-class match.
	   Looking much better than they did in their disastrous first
innings when they were dismissed for a paltry 67, the Free State
batsmen took the fight to the much-vaunted West Indies pacemen.
Kosie Venter bludgeoned a belligerent 53 off 60 balls, and he was
supported by good batting from Gerhardus Liebenberg.
	   But the best batting of all came from young Boeta Dippenaar, who
raced to 49 with a blistering attack on leg spinner Dinanath
Ramnarine, collecting three fine boundaries off him in a single
over.
	   The visitors' poor batting bodes ill for them going into the
Johannesburg test, where they will be up against bowling better
than even Van der Wath or even Hansie Cronje, who was the other
destroyer with his swing bowling reaping him three for 23 at the
start of the day.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands angered by Italy's release of a
Kurdish rebel leader protested in front of the Italian Embassy on
Sunday, while a convoy of truckers drove through central Ankara
calling for an end of trade with Italy.
	   Children stood waving the Turkish flag as scores of trucks drove
past honking their horns and bearing banners that declared: ``An
end to trade with Italy.'' Hundreds of companies and business
groups have announced a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Turks have taken to the streets over the past week to protest
Italy's refusal to send Turkey a Kurdish rebel leader currently in
Rome. A Rome court rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for Abdullah
Ocalan on Friday, freeing him, since Italian law forbids
extraditing suspects to countries where they might face the death
penalty.
	   The court ordered Ocalan to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give
Germany time to decide whether it wants to extradite him for trial
on terrorism charges. German officials have said they have no plans
now to seek extradition.
	   Turkey holds Ocalan responsible for the deaths of tens of
thousands of people. Rebels of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
have fought for Kurdish autonomy for more than 10 years in a war
that has killed close to 37,000 people.
	   ``We are not angry at the Italian people, but we are very angry
at the Italian prime minister,'' said Nesrim Tureli, one of the
thousands chanting before the embassy.
	   ``Either Apo, or Rome,'' read a banner stuck to the embassy
gate, using Ocalan's nickname.
	   Turkish newspapers reported a large-scale military operation in
the southeastern provinces against PKK rebels. According to the
Zaman daily, 35,000 troops launched an offensive this week in the
province of Tunceli, where authorities suspect that 500 rebels are
hiding.
	   Military officials refused to comment on the report.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin questioned Sunday whether Italy
was any different from Syria, which hosted Ocalan during most of
his struggle against Turkey.
	   ``The head of the separatist organization in now being hosted in
a villa in Italy. Then, what difference is there between Syria and
Italy? In Syria, too, he was staying in a villa. Where are the
advocates of human rights, the claims of the cradle of
civilization, the fellow NATO member for the past 40-50 years?''
Sezgin asked, according to the Anatolia news agency.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed
bin Talal has bought 13.7 percent of the shares of Nigeria's United
Bank for Africa, making him the bank's largest shareholder, his
office announced in a statement Sunday.
	   The statement did not give a value for the deal but said it was
part of the prince's 500 million riyal (dlrs 133 million)
investment plan in Africa.
	   United Bank for Africa's shares grew fivefold over the last five
years because of a restructuring program following the
liberalization of the banking sector in Nigeria, said the
statement.
	   United Bank for Africa is Nigeria's third largest bank and the
largest lender to international oil companies operating there. It
has 209 branches in Nigeria and an office in New York, the
statement said.
	   Alwaleed's other African investments are in Egypt, Senegal and
South Africa.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa arrived here
Sunday on a two-day visit aimed at strengthening relations with
oil-rich Kuwait and signing a number of economic agreements.
	   Moussa will head the Egyptian delegation at a Monday meeting for
a committee the two countries have set up to strengthen ties. He
told reporters at the airport that economic relations between Egypt
and Kuwait needed legal framework in the areas of investment, trade
and prevention of double taxation.
	   He did not elaborate, but Kuwait's Foreign Ministry said several
agreements would be concluded at the end of the meeting. It gave no
details.
	   Egypt was Kuwait's main Arab ally in the 1991 Gulf War that
liberated this small Gulf state from a seven-month Iraqi
occupation.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's pharmaceutical exports are
expected to rise next year, when four new factories start
production, officials said Sunday.
	   Maher Matalqah, secretary-general of the Jordanian Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries, said drug exports accounted for 12
percent of the kingdom's total yearly exports and were the second
largest foreign currency earner after phosphate.
	   Last year's revenue from pharmaceutical exports totaled dlrs 167
million, up from dlrs 28 million in 1990. The products are sold in
35 countries, including in Europe and America, said Matalqah.
Pharmaceutical industries cover 13 factories and employ 3,000
workers, contributing to 35 percent of the Jordanian markets,
Matalqah said.

Separatists leading Quebec campaign despite voter doubts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-JEAN-SUR-RICHELIEU, Quebec (AP) _ It is a paradox that
keeps all of Canada in limbo: Most Quebeckers aren't eager for
another referendum on secession, yet they seem on the verge of
re-electing a government committed to independence.
	   Barring a surprise in the campaign's final week, separatist
Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois are expected to win
another term in provincial elections Nov. 30 and begin laying the
groundwork for Quebec's third referendum on leaving Canada.
	   If Bouchard is to be stopped, the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal
Party must win in places like Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 25 miles
(40 kilometers) southeast of Montreal. It is a district with a
history of voting on the winning side, and the separatists narrowly
won here in 1994.
	   Even the local Liberal candidate is perplexed by the Quebec
paradox.
	   ``The polls show most people don't want any more referendums,
and yet Bouchard is still popular,'' Gilles Dolbec said in an
interview at his headquarters. ``We can we do?''
	   In 1994, the Liberals finished just barely behind the Parti
Quebecois in the provincewide popular vote yet won only 47 of the
125 legislative seats, compared to 77 for the Parti Quebecois.
	   That gap exists because anti-separatist support is heavily
concentrated in Montreal and a few other pockets with large numbers
of English-speakers. The Parti Quebecois has strong support in the
majority of districts dominated by French-speakers, who make up
about 82 percent of Quebec's 7 million population.
	   Saint-Jean is overwhelmingly French-speaking. But, because of
its bellwether reputation and the close 1994 result, it is one of
18 districts now held by the separatists that the Liberals are
targeting in hopes of eking out a slim legislative majority.
	   Dolbec insists he is optimistic, but interviews with local
journalists, politicians, college students and one of their
political science teachers gave little indication of any enthusiasm
for the Liberals' provincial leader, Jean Charest, who wants to
replace Bouchard.
	   ``Charest's not a bad person,'' said Pierre Bergeron, a student
at the local junior college. ``He speaks well, but he doesn't
develop the issues.''
	   Bergeron's classmate, Chantal Girard, said Charest _ a native
Quebecker who spent more than a decade in federal politics _ is
``too Canadian.'' That can be a damaging image in a province where
voters expect their politicians to be Quebeckers first.
	   Both students agreed with political science professor Michel
Barrette that many young Quebeckers are apathetic about the
campaign. But they predicted Bouchard would win the bulk of the
votes cast by young people, even though Charest, at 40, is 19 years
younger than the popular premier.
	   Charest has stressed two themes in his campaign _ that the
threat of another secession referendum is undermining Quebec's
economy and that Bouchard's budget-cutting to erase a deficit has
ravaged the public health care system.
	   Yet at the Saint-Jean hospital, the director of medical services
said his staff accepted the need for spending cuts and has adjusted
to reforms meant to shorten patients' stays.
	   ``Mr. Charest is ringing empty bells,'' said Dr. Stephen Morgan.
``He says what Bouchard has done is awful, but he doesn't say what
he'd do instead.''
	   Morgan, a native French-speaker despite his Anglo-sounding name,
said he hadn't decided whether to vote for the Parti Quebecois or a
long-shot third party headed by 28-year-old Mario Dumont.
	   His decision, he said, will be based on prospects for providing
effective government, not on the issue of separation.
	   ``I would vote `No' in a referendum'' on secession, he said.
``But I could vote for Bouchard.''
	   That meshes with the line coming from the local Parti Quebecois
candidate, Roger Paquin.
	   ``We're still a separatist party. What we want to do is clear,''
he said. ``But we're also a provincial government, and we have to
work for the people now. This election is about a quality
government for Quebec.''
	   Opinion polls indicate two-thirds of Quebeckers don't want a
referendum during the next government's term in power. Yet Bouchard
appears to be attracting support from some of those voters with his
somewhat ambiguous promise to hold a referendum only when ``winning
conditions'' exist.
	   Commentators suggest this enables Bouchard to win backing both
from hard-line separatists and from francophones who don't want
independence but like having a feisty pro-Quebec government that is
willing to battle federal officials.
	   ``It's not clear that Quebeckers really want to get rid of
ambiguity,'' wrote Lysiane Gagnon, a columnist for the Montreal
daily La Presse. ``Most francophones have grown used to living with
sovereignty's sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. ... It's
been talked about for 30 years and it never happens, so what's the
problem?''

Defending champion Italy beats Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Italy, seeking to become the first men's team ever
to win three consecutive world titles, stayed unbeaten Sunday by
defeating Greece 15-5, 15-13, 15-1 in a second round match of the
Men's World Volleyball Championships.
	   Italy, the 1990 and 1994 world champion and 1996 Olympic silver
medalist, needed only one hour, 15 minutes for the victory at
Chiba-Makuhari near Tokyo.
	   In the 16-team second round, Italy now is 4-0 and Greece 0-4.
	   Russia's predecessor, the Soviet Union, won the women's world
championship three times in a row in 1952, 1956 and 1960, but no
men's team has accomplished that feat.
	   In another Group H match, Yugoslavia, the 1996 Olympic bronze
medalist, beat the United States, 15-6, 15-10, 15-8 and also was
4-0, along with the Netherlands and Russia.
	   ``That's extremely important because it means we're part of the
best eight teams in this tournament,'' said Yugoslavian team
captain Zeljko Tanaskovic.
	   ``Yugoslavia is a very good team. ... Our confidence is very low
at the moment, but hopefully we can prove how good we are in the
next few days,'' said American team captain Lloyd Ball, whose team
was third in the previous championships in Brazil in 1994.
	   The Netherlands, the 1996 Olympic champion, overpowered China
15-5, 15-3, 15-8, and Russia defeated Ukraine 17-15, 15-6, 15-6.
	   The United States, Greece, Ukraine and China still are winless
in the second round.
	   In Group G, undefeated Brazil, fifth in the previous tournament,
beat Bulgaria 16-17, 15-7, 15-5, 15-12 in 2 hours, 27 minutes.
	   Cuba, whose women's team defended its world title Nov. 12, beat
winless Japan 15-9, 12-15, 15-10, 17-16 in 2 hours, 30 minutes, and
also was 4-0.
	   Canada beat Spain 11-15, 15-9, 12-15, 16-14, 18-16, in 2:40, and
Argentina defeated winless South Korea 15-13, 15-10, 15-5.
	   Spain is 3-1, followed by Argentina and Canada at 2-2.
	   The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16
advanced to the current round, which lasts until Thursday. The
semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Saturday and Sunday.

At 48, Miss World gets a face lift
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HELEN QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ At 48, the Miss World beauty pageant
is undergoing a face lift.
	   The British production company Initial has done away with the
high heels and swimsuit parade before the judges. And it has made
sure that the 86 contestants will be environmentally friendly,
planting trees and taking part in a ceremonial return of hawksbill
turtle shells to the sea.
	   But the beauty contest created by former British serviceman Eric
Morley to liven up drab, post-war England is not yet free of the
kind of controversy that has brought it adverse publicity in the
past.
	   Two years ago, it was Indians demonstrating against the pageant
in Bangalore, forcing Morley and his wife, Julia, to move the
swimsuit competition to Seychelles.
	   This year it is Croatia's entry, Lejla Sehovic, stripped of her
title by the Balkan nation's Miss World franchise holder because
she is a Muslim. Muslims are a small minority of Croatia's 4.7
million people.
	   Judges voted a second time and awarded the crown to a Roman
Catholic, Ivana Petkovic. But the hue and cry in the media was so
great, the crown was returned to Sehovic, with the proviso that
Petkovic would represent Croatia next year.
	   ``The newspapers were on my side, and here I am,'' the
22-year-old business administration student announced when she
stepped off the Miss World flight from Paris into a Creole beach
party hosted by pageant organizers.
	   ``I don't think people mind at all what my religious beliefs
are.''
	   And who will care anyway when Sehovic joins other contestants in
games of beach volleyball a la Baywatch with the Indian Ocean and
swaying palms as the backdrop?
	   A holding company formed by the government of Seychelles, a
92-island Indian Ocean archipelago, is staging the event for the
second year in hopes of bolstering the country's image as a haven
for snorkelers and eco-tourists.
	   Last year the government spent dlrs 3 million to organize the
event and is prepared to do the same this year, according to
Gilbert Pool, President France-Albert Rene's special adviser.
	   Pool said beginning November 1999 the government will charge all
visitors a dlrs 100 entry fee designed to transform the unique
granite and coral islands from a simple tourist destination to an
environmental experience. But many travel agencies fear the fee
will discourage even ``good'' tourists.
	   The archipelago hosts two UNESCO World Heritage Sites _ the
Aldabra atoll, home of the world's largest population of giant
tortoises, and the Val de Mai indigenous palm forest on Praslin
Island known for the rare black parrot and the coco-de-mer, the
coconut that is the world's heaviest seed.
	   Commercial exploitation of Hawksbill shells was banned when
Seychelles signed the U.N. Convention on Trade in Endangered
Species. Local craftsmen surrendered their stock of shells intended
for combs and fans for the Far East and were trained in other
crafts with government help.
	   The Irish pop group Boyzone will headline Thursday's awards
show, which will be televised live in Britain for the first time in
a decade, and lead singer Ronan Keating will co-present with MTV
hostess, Eden.
	   Pageant organizer Francis Savy said judges will include Formula
1 racing driver Jacques Villeneuve, New Zealand rugby star Jonah
Lomu, model Christelle de St. Augustin and Pilin Leon, who won the
Miss World title as Miss Venezuela in 1981.

Jordan, Syria hold talks on Yarmouk River waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Syria ended talks Sunday on
sharing Yarmouk River water by agreeing to avoid steps that might
jeopardize plans to build a dam at Jordan's northern border with
Syria, Water Minister Hani Mulqi said.
	   The Jordanian-Syrian committee, which opened its two-day meeting
Saturday, discussed Jordanian complaints about more ditches being
dug on Yarmouk tributaries in Syria, which reduce Jordan's water
share by nearly half, Mulqi said.
	   He said Syria has set up more than 30 ditches and pumping
facilities to draw water along the Yarmouk river, dropping the flow
of water from 470 million cubic meters to 270 million cubic meters
yearly in the border area.
	   If such measures are halted, Mulqi said, it would be feasible to
build the al-Wiheh dam near the border.
	   A Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the government intends to secure funds from Arab and international
sources for the 400 million dinar (dlrs 563 million) dam, which
would hold 225 million cubic meters of water.
	   The meeting was the fourth since October 1997, when both sides
agreed to go ahead with plans to build the dam in accordance with a
1987 agreement. The Yarmouk begins in Syria, flows along the
Syrian-Jordanian border and then joins the Jordan River downstream
from Lake Tiberias in northeast Israel.
	   Jordan also is developing water-sharing plans with Israel, but
does not expect these to interfere with joint projects with Syria
such as the al-Wihdeh dam.
	   According to official statistics, Jordan's growing population _
now estimated at 4.2 million _ will need 1.2 billion cubic meters
of water annually in 1998-2000. The country's present resources
provide only 960 million cubic meters per year.

Lawmakers ask Clinton to link U.S. aid to Pakistan with democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Hoping to pressure the government to
back off its plans to impose a harsh Islamic order in Pakistan,
leading opposition lawmakers on Sunday urged the United States to
link all new aid to Islamabad to assurances the country will remain
democratic.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif introduced a constitutional
amendment in August to scrap all remaining British laws in Pakistan
and replace them with laws based on the Muslim holy book, the
Koran.
	   ``The bill ... will concentrate all powers into the hands of the
prime minister, degrade women and remove all protections for ethnic
and religious minorities,'' the opposition lawmakers said Sunday in
a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The lawmakers from the Pakistan Peoples' Party told Clinton that
any future economic assistance to Pakistan should be contingent on
the country taking concrete steps to improve democracy, creating a
free and impartial judiciary and allowing an unbiased investigation
into charges of corruption and tax evasion lodged against Sharif.
	   Under Sharif's regime, there has been a systematic dismantling
of democratic institutions, they said.
	   Sharif should not be ``rewarded for the abuse of power,'' they
wrote.
	   Sharif is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on Dec.
2 in Washington and ask him to lift the economic sanctions it
imposed on Pakistan since the country's nuclear tests in May.
	   The sanctions have shaken Pakistan's already fragile economy,
forcing it to scramble to raise funds to avoid defaulting on debt
repayment.
	   Sharif said Saturday that the amendment was necessary to curb
crime and guarantee swift justice.
	   Sharif has said that he wants a justice system like that of the
hard-line Taliban Islamic militia in neighboring Afghanistan.

Cyclone weakens and crosses Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A cyclone in the Bay of Bengal weakened
Sunday and crossed the southern coast of Bangladesh, causing no
reported casualties.
	   The storm, which had a wind speed of 115 kph (71 mph), weakened
to 50 kph (31 miles) when it hit land in the largely uninhabited
Sundarbans jungles, the weather office in the capital of Dhaka
said.
	   The ports of Mongla and Chittagong lowered their danger signals.
	   Authorities however asked thousands of fishermen to stay on land
because the seas are rough.
	   The Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, had
posted nearly 33,000 volunteers along the coast where at least 10
million people live. The region has more than 1,200 cyclone
shelters for the residents.
	   An official at the Disaster and Relief Ministry said a large
number of evacuated residents would start returning home soon.
	   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation, is buffeted by tropical
cyclones that kill hundreds of people every year. One cyclone
killed 138,000 people along the coast in 1991.

Soldiers reprimanded for `undisciplined behavior,' generals say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 160 soldiers who fired shots
at student protesters during riots and demonstrations in
Indonesia's capital last week have been punished for disobeying
orders, military chiefs said Sunday.
	   A number of officers might face courts-martial over the apparent
breakdown in the chain of command which led to soldiers firing on
demonstrators, armed forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Maarif
said.
	   ``The officers who made a mistake will face court martial for
their crimes,'' he said.
	   Up to 17 people died when armed forces opened fire on
demonstrators and others during bloody street clashes Nov. 13-14.
Hundreds were injured.
	   Doctors said last week metal bullet fragments were found in the
bodies of seven victims, despite top-level orders that only plastic
bullets or blanks were to be fired.
	   Nine of the dead were students shot by military personnel. The
latest victim died Sunday in a Jakarta hospital from wounds, a
local television station reported.
	   At a joint news conference, Syamsul and armed forces commander
Gen. Wiranto repeated claims that a small group of anti-government
agitators provoked the demonstrators to violence in an attempt to
disrupt a special sitting of the legislative assembly.
	   Wiranto said a military investigation into the street clashes so
far had failed to trace the source of the metal bullet fragments.
	   Syamsul said 163 soldiers had been punished for ``undisciplined
behavior'' for firing warning shots without orders during the
melee.
	   The nature of the punishment was not specified.
	   He said that according to checks made of weapons used, none
fired the caliber of bullets that were found in the bodies.
	   ``The metal bullets found are not the caliber of the guns
usually used by security officers,'' Syamsul said. ``We are still
investigating where the bullets came from.''
	   So far, 10 anti-government activists, including two retired army
generals, have been charged with fomenting the protests in a bid to
overthrow the government. If convicted they could be imprisoned for
life.

Philippine labor strikes, lockouts declining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The number of labor strikes and
lockouts in the Philippines has declined this year despite business
difficulties caused by Asia's financial crisis, the labor
department said Sunday.
	   The department said 712 strikes and lockouts have occurred so
far, a drop of 14 percent compared to 827 in the same period last
year. The number of workers who joined the strikes also declined by
20 percent from more than 210,000 to 175,500.
	   Early mediation by labor officials contributed to an easing of
labor unrest in the country, the department said in a statement.
	   The country, however, suffered one of its worst labor problems
when flag carrier Philippine Airlines was forced to shut down Sept.
23 due to disputes with its largest labor union and mounting debts
and losses, partly caused by the regional financial turmoil.
	   PAL laid off more than 3,000 employees at the height of its
labor and financial troubles this year, the biggest single
retrenchment in the Philippines.
	   PAL resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and started restoring
international flights last month after settling its labor problems.
It has since accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific and the two airlines are drawing up a plan to rehabilitate
the Philippine carrier.

Swissair CEO defends installation of in-flight entertainment

system &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair ``did everything correctly''
in installing a state-of-the-art entertainment system switched off
last month in the wake of the crash of Flight 111, the airline's
chief executive said in an interview published Sunday.
	   Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video-on-demand
system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit,
after Canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair ``did everything correctly''
in installing a state-of-the-art entertainment system switched off
last month in the wake of the crash of Flight 111, the airline's
chief executive said in an interview published Sunday.
	   Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video-on-demand
system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit,
after Canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on
wiring and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the
MD-11.
	   ``It's the leading product, customers liked it, and its
installation was correctly certified,'' CEO Jeffrey Katz was quoted
as saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung. ``As far as we know

Family, friends mourn Hutchence one year after his suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ One year after his death, INXS star
Michael Hutchence was remembered Sunday by 250 fans and family at a
small chapel in the Sydney suburb of North Ryde.
	   The chapel was packed with fans clutching flowers and cards as
Hutchence's brother Rhett paid tribute, a friend read a poem,
prayers were said and a solo saxophonist played.
	   Hutchence's partner, Paula Yates, their daughter Tiger Lily and
fellow INXS band members did not attend the service.
	   Yates and Tiger Lily, who remained in London Sunday, were
invited to the ceremony but did not respond, Hutchence's father,
Kel Hutchence, said.
	   Band members sent a wreath of flowers with a message that they
had chosen to grieve in private. It was thought they attended a
private memorial service with Hutchence's family earlier in the
day.
	   After the 40-minute service, Kel Hutchence unveiled a memorial
in the grounds of the Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens and
Crematorium to mark the life of the singer who committed suicide in
a Sydney hotel room last Nov. 22 at the age of 37.
	   ``I just want to unveil this memorial and dedicate it to the
memory of our beloved Michael,'' Kel Hutchence told fans and
family. ``He was a good and loving man and an excellent musician.''
	   At the peak of his and Australian band INXS's musical success,
1987 album ``Kick'' sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team blasts Serb proposal for province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer+

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team on Sunday blasted a Serb proposal for the
strife-torn province as a blueprint for cementing Serbian
domination in Kosovo, the Beta news agency reported.
	   Fehmi Agani said the only option acceptable to Kosovo's
Albanians was the U.S.-drafted plan seeking to end the crisis
through shuttle diplomacy carried out by American mediator for
Kosovo Christopher Hill.
	   Serbian authorities published Saturday their own four-page draft
proposal which gives the Albanian-majority province a form of
self-rule but keeps it within Serbia, its constitution and legal
framework.
	   ``A paper legalizing an imposed state in Kosovo, a state of
Serbian domination over (ethnic) Albanians, cannot be a subject of
negotiations,'' Agani was quoted as saying in the Serbian capital,
Belgrade, where he attended a weekend conference by the Helsinki
Committee for Human Rights in Serbia.
	   Agani belongs to the moderate, Western-backed ethnic Albanian
leadership which advocates peaceful measures to solving Kosovo's
crisis.
	   He reiterated Sunday that ethnic Albanians would be ready to
accept an interim solution by which Kosovo would remain within
Yugoslavia _ on equal status with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
Yugoslav republics _ for three to five years, after which a
referendum would decide the province's future status.
	   Kosovo is now a Serbian province.
	   Serbian president Milan Milutinovic, who last week rejected a
U.S.-sponsored draft, scheduled new talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders for Wednesday in provincial capital Pristina _ a hollow
gesture since Kosovo Albanians didn't show up for previous talks.
	   ``We shall avoid ... silly games played (by those) allegedly
ready for a dialogue on Kosovo,'' Agani said Sunday, dismissing
Milutinovic's invitation. The Albanians seek foreign mediation of
talks with Serbia, something Serbia opposes.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes since Serbia
launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. The
bloodshed abated _ but has not fully ended _ since Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic signed a de-facto peace agreement last
month, under threat of NATO attack
	   Ethnic Albanians ``are paying a high price for their right to
self-determination,'' Agani said. ``A fifth of Kosovo has been
burnt to the ground, hundreds have been killed, hundreds of
thousands have become refugees.''
	   ``That's the toll for this year alone _ we have no way of
knowing what the toll will be next year, if a solution is not
reached soon,'' he warned.

French composer Gerard Grisey dead at age 52 in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gerard Grisey, a leading modern French composer,
has died, his wife said Sunday. He was 52.
	   Grisey died of a stroke Wednesday in Paris, said Mireille
Guigui, his wife.
	   Grisey was born in 1946 in Belfort, in eastern France, and
studied music at the conservatory in Trossingen, Germany. He later
studied at the Paris Conservatoire and the Ecole Normale de la
Musique.
	   He also studied acoustics at the Faculty of Sciences in Paris.
	   In 1972 he was awarded the Rome Prize and spent the following
two years in the Italian capital.
	   In 1980, he became one of the first composers to work at the
Institute of Research and Coordination for Acoustics and Music
(IRCAM). The Paris center, dedicated to promoting modern music in
France, was the brainchild of the composer Pierre Boulez and the
late French President Georges Pompidou.
	   Grisey composed works for both ensemble and electronics. His
best known compositions include the 1977 work ``Modulations'' and
``Jour Contre Jour,'' completed in 1979. Most recently, he
completed ``Stele'' in 1995.
	   Grisey had taught at the Paris Conservatoire since 1986.
	   There was no immediate information about further survivors or
funeral plans.

Anti-Kabila group protests on steps of Belgian Royal Palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A small group of demonstrators climbed
into the the grounds of the Royal Palace in Brussels Sunday to
protest against the upcoming visit of Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Five supporters of a Congolese opposition group clambered over
the palace gates and ran onto the steps of King Albert II's
official residence. They stayed for several minutes waving banners
accusing Kabila of human rights abuse, then fled before police
arrived.
	   Officials at the palace refused to say if the monarch was inside
at the time. The royal family does not usually spend weekends at
the palace which is mostly reserved for official business.
Belgium's RTBF television network, which filmed the protest, said
there appeared to be no guards on duty outside.
	   Kabila is scheduled to start a three-day visit to Belgium
Tuesday, his first to Congo's former colonial ruler since he took
power after toppling the late President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.
	   On Friday, a Belgian lawyer filed a complaint against Kabila and
two top aides, saying they violated international law by inciting
ethnic hatred against Congo's Tutsi minority.

Albanian referendum on draft Constitution calm amid slow voting
</HEADLINE>

close at 1700 GMT. Results expected Monday. Daan correct in 8th

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians lined up in drizzling rain
Sunday to cast ballots in a controversial referendum meant to give
Europe's poorest country its first post-communist Constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported no
referendum-related violence in this Balkan nation where past
elections have been marked by gunfire and intimidation.
	   Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 35 per cent of
the nearly two million eligible voters had cast their ballots by
1230 GMT, half way through voting. Polls opened at 0600 GMT and
close at 1700 GMT but full results aren't expected until late
Monday.
	   Turnout is key to the referendum which, boycotted by opposition,
could give Albania its framework for human, civil and democratic
rights.
	   Opposition Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, who played a
key role in antigovernment unrest in September, predicted earlier
Sunday that turnout would be so low as to declare the draft
Constitution ``a dead body.''
	   Most citizens who show up to vote are expected to favor the
proposed Constitution, drafted with legal advice from Western
experts.
	   Violence has accompanied national elections in the past as
separate factions squared off outside polling booths. But the
boycott kept most opposition supporters away from the booths
Sunday.
	   Daan Everts, the head of the mission to Albania of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said before
the voting that a turnout of 40 per cent to 50 per cent would
likely be seen as reasonable, given the boycott. He said turnout
below 30 per cent or so could call the results into question.
	   The draft would give citizens the right to legally change their
religion and to identify themselves as members of an ethnic
minority. It would also define property rights and allow the
government to expropriate land deemed of national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while in richer, non-Muslim
neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb.
``Hope is the only thing that we can really do.''
	   Snow also closed four roads in northern Albania and slowed, or
halted voting in some areas. And moderate rainfall dampened voters
Sunday throughout most of the country.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
Tirana suburb, said the Constitution will help boost prosperity in
Europe's poorest nation.
	   ``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and
walked on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in
the eye,'' said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station
as well. ``I voted for the future.''
	   Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling booth from the roofs of
nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle police throughout Tirana
searched cars with license plates from outside of Tirana.
	   Other than a heavier police presence, Tirana streets showed no
signs of tensions as residents perused street vendors' wares or
sipped coffee on sidewalk tables. Small pockets of voters gathered
in front of the schools and post offices used as polling booths but
no lengthy lineups were visible.
	   Fearing low turnout, the government recently scrapped a law
requiring a referendum to be voted on by more than 50 percent of
eligible voters.

Hindu radical group asks Muslims, Christians to accept its culture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEERUT, India (AP) _ A radical Hindu group that controls the
governing party urged Muslims and Christians on Sunday to accept
Hindu culture, saying it would not go against their religious
beliefs.
	   The call by the leader of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh or
RSS came amid a week of controversy over Hindu nationalists asking
school students to sing Hindu songs in praise of Mother India, a
move that was subsequently dropped following protests.
	   The RSS is the core group that controls numerous Hindu
organizations, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in
power in India. The group promotes a brand of Hindu nationalism
that many secular Indians regard as distasteful. It has been blamed
for promoting religious intolerance, particularly against Muslims,
who make up 12 percent of India's nearly 1 billion population.
	   The Bharatiya Janata and other groups associated with the RSS
were blamed for the destruction of an ancient mosque in the
northern town of Ayodhya that Hindus also claim. The destruction
touched off nationwide Hindu-Muslim riots that left 2,000 people
dead.
	   In recent weeks, The RSS and its followers in the populous state
of Uttar Pradesh have insisted that school students sing ``Vande
Mataram,'' a popular song hailing Mother India. It was widely sung
during India's independence movement against British colonialists
but found disfavor later on because of its association with Hindu
philosophy.
	   ``Those who refuse to recite Vande Mataram are not children of
Mother India,'' said K.C. Sudharshan, RSS joint-secretary, during a
meeting in this northern town, some 100 kilometers (66 miles)
northwest of New Delhi.
	   ``Hindus cannot consider those who are not children of Mother
India as their brothers and sisters,'' Sudarshan said.
	   ``Muslims in Indonesia draw inspiration from Hindu mythology and
texts. What problem do the Muslims here have? Christians and
Muslims in India are not foreigners. They were originally Hindus,
but they embraced the religions of foreigners and set themselves
apart from their fellow Hindu countrymen.''

Israeli army destroys Hamas leaders hide-out

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli army demolished a house
Sunday used as a hide-out by two wanted Hamas leaders before they
were killed by Israeli troops earlier this year.
	   The two fugitives, Adel and Imad Awadallah, were wanted by
Palestinian authorities and Israel for alleged involvement in
attacks that killed at least five Israelis and wounded 51 more.
	   After several weeks of searches, the army found and killed the
two brothers in a rented home on the outskirts of the West Bank
city of Hebron on Sept. 11.
	   The owner of the home, Akram Mussauda was arrested shortly
afterwards by Israel for harboring fugitives.
	   Israel has destroyed dozens of Palestinian homes over the last
several years, either as a means of collective punishment for
families of militants, or because the homes were built without
permits.
	   An Israeli army spokesman said Sunday that the empty home,
surrounded by vineyards and peach trees, was illegal since it had
been built without Israeli permission.
	   Two bulldozers guarded by dozens of Israeli soldiers destroyed
the house as Mussauda's two brothers looked on. The brothers said
they would have appealed the decision to Israel's Supreme Court but
were only notified 30 minutes before the bulldozers arrived.
	   Hamas opposes Israeli-Palestinian peace-making and has claimed
responsibility for dozens of deadly attacks on Israelis.
	   The Awadallah brothers were also suspected of being behind the
killing of Hamas bombmaker as part of an internal feud in the
group.

German radical rightists retain party chairman with vast majority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FELDEN-HINTERSKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ The radical rightist
Republikaner voted overwhelmingly to keep their party chairman at a
convention in Bavaria, giving him 319 of 390 delegate votes late
Saturday, avoiding feared in-party bickering.
	   Rolf Schlierer, a 43-year-old doctor and lawyer, has led the
Republikaner since he took over from former SS Sergeant Franz
Schoenhuber in 1994. He has attempted to gain inroads with
Germany's conservative party's by steering a more moderate course
than Schoenhuber.
	   His deputy, 38-year-old Christian Kaes, the state party chairman
in Baden-Wuerttemberg, and considered a hard-line radical rightist,
surprisingly withdrew as a candidate against Schlierer shortly
before the vote, saying he wanted to avoid internal bickering.
	   Over the years Schlierer has avoided contact with the country's
other top radical rightist party, the German People's Union (DVU),
which won a surprising 13 percent of the vote in eastern Saxony
Anhalt state in April.
	   But he admitted to convention delegates in the Bavarian village
of Felden-Hinterskirchen that he had recent talks with the DVU,
because it presented a chance for the two parties to avoid
competing against each other in future elections. Still he said the
contact did not mean cooperation with the DVU.
	   The Republikaner got only 1.8 percent of the vote in national
elections in September, far less than the minimum five percent
needed to gain seats in parliament. The DVU fared no better.

Croats and Bosnian Muslims sign special ties agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DARKO LABOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Succumbing to international pressure,
Bosnian Muslims signed a controversial agreement of special ties
with neighboring Croatia Sunday.
	   The agreement, which is founded in the Dayton accords that ended
war in 1995, is to regulate and strengthen bilateral relations
between Croatia proper and the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation,
which controls 51 percent of Bosnia.
	   It is designed to outline the framework for relations, which are
dogged by distrust and suspicions.
	   The president of Bosnia's rotating tripartite government, Muslim
Alija Izetbegovic, arrived to close the deal after two prior
postponements due to opposition at home.
	   ``It is no secret that ... there have been certain reservations
and suspicions regarding the special relations agreement,''
Izetbegovic acknowledged, adding that minor changes in word
formulation of the document had helped bring about a change of
heart.
	   Most Muslims believe the deal could spell the doom of the
fledgling nation which is struggling to keep a lid on Bosnian Croat
and Serb aspirations to join their brethren in neighboring Croatia
to the west, and Serbia to the east.
	   They feel that a special ties agreement with Croatia may give it
a foot in the door and strengthen any attempts on its part to annex
the southwestern part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Croats are
numerous.
	   International observers, who brokered the deal, however, believe
it will act as a framework for future agreements in such matters as
trade, transport and military, strengthening cooperation and making
contacts more transparent.
	   ``It is up to you, whether what we do here today actually makes
the difference, or just generates another historical document that
brings no change,'' said Jacques Klein, a deputy to the
international community's top Bosnian envoy, Carlos Westendorp.
``If properly implemented, the agreements will mean jobs, they will
mean trade, they will mean integration with Europe, for Croatia,
for the federation and for Bosnia.''
	   A sub-agreement within the pact commits Croatia to lease the
port of Ploce to Bosnia in return for a free corridor for Croatia
through a narrow stretch of Bosnian territory cutting into
Croatia's southern tail.
	   Bosnian Croats, aided by their patrons in Zagreb, turned against
their erstwhile Muslim allies in 1993 and fought a bloody yearlong
war-within-a-war. It is believed that Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman has yet to fully discard alleged ambitions to carve up
Bosnia with the Serbs.
	   Relations have been on a steady mend since the war. But
lingering distrust, often punctuated by outbursts of ethnically
related violence, has hampered more substantial chances of a
lasting peace. Hardline Bosnian Croat resistance to return of
Muslim refugees also continues to poison the atmosphere.

Presidential couple takes media to court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech president Vaclav Havel and
his wife Dagmar have sued some of the country's media for
publishing allegations their relationship was in trouble, the CTK
news agency reported Sunday.
	   According to the report, the Havels have pressed charges against
one TV station, two dailies and one writer for publishing stories
indicating infidelity on the part of Havel's wife, Dagmar.
	   In October, Czech court ruled to take out of circulation a book
by Premysl Svora, called ``Seven weeks that shook the Castle''.
	   The book was an unauthorized testimony of the dramatic
circumstances surrounding Havel's 1996 life-threatening lung cancer
surgery and his subsequent marriage to Dagmar, given by one of the
doctors.
	   The book also alleged Havel's wife Dagmar had an affair with her
personal assistant.
	   In the meantime the book, often sold under the counter, became a
best-selling hit.
	   TV Nova, the country's leading TV station, Blesk, the
best-selling tabloid and Lidove Noviny published several stories
along the lines of Svora's book. They were all sued by the Havels
on Friday, CTK said, quoting Havel's press secretary Martin Krafl.
	   No one was available to comment for the Havels on Sunday.

Prime minister: Gore's remarks humiliated Malaysians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
in his first comment on U.S. Vice President Al Gore's remarks at a
Pacific Rim summit, said Sunday that Malaysians were disappointed
and humiliated, the national news agency reported.
	   Mahathir was the host for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit last week at which Gore supported the anti-government reform
movement in Malaysia. Until now, he had not commented publicly on
the vice president's remarks.
	   Gore, who represented President Bill Clinton at the summit,
praised the supporters of the reform movement of jailed former
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as ``the brave people of
Malaysia.''
	   His statement caused a furor among Cabinet ministers and many
other Malaysians, who accused Gore of interfering in Malaysia's
internal affairs. They expressed their views in letters and large
advertisements in newspapers, the national news agency Bernama
said.
	   A hot line advertised in the government-backed New Straits Times
was hooked up over the weekend for callers to register anti-U.S.
sentiments.
	   Bernama said Mahathir commended the people for speaking up
against Gore's ``offensive remarks and disgusting attitude.''
	   ``They voiced their stand because they were disappointed and
humiliated by his disrespectful remarks,'' Mahathir told reporters
after visiting a factory. ``I'm impressed by their stand as this is
the real strength of the country.''

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team blasts Serb proposal for province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team on Sunday blasted a Serb proposal for the
strife-torn Kosovo province as a blueprint for cementing Serbian
domination in Kosovo, the Beta news agency reported.
	   Fehmi Agani said the only option acceptable to Kosovo's
Albanians was the U.S.-drafted plan seeking to end the crisis
through shuttle diplomacy by American mediator Christopher Hill.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2
million.
	   Serbian authorities published Saturday their proposal to give
Kosovo a form of self-rule but keep it within Serbia.
	   ``A paper legalizing an imposed state in Kosovo, a state of
Serbian domination over (ethnic) Albanians, cannot be a subject of
negotiations,'' the news agency quoted Agani as saying.
	   Agani belongs to the moderate, Western-backed ethnic Albanian
leadership that advocates peaceful measures to solving Kosovo's
crisis.
	   He reiterated Sunday that ethnic Albanians would be ready to
accept an interim solution by which Kosovo would remain within
Yugoslavia _ on equal status with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
Yugoslav republics _ for three to five years. After that a
referendum would decide the province's future status.
	   Kosovo is now a Serbian province.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes since Serbia
launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. The
bloodshed abated _ but has not fully ended _ since Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic signed a de-facto peace agreement last
month, under threat of NATO attack
	   Serbian president Milan Milutinovic, who last week rejected a
U.S.-sponsored draft, scheduled new talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders for Wednesday in the provincial capital of Pristina. It was
a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians didn't show up for previous
talks.
	   ``We shall avoid ... silly games played (by those) allegedly
ready for a dialogue on Kosovo,'' Agani said Sunday, dismissing
Milutinovic's invitation. The ethnic Albanians seek foreign
mediation of talks with Serbia, something Serbia opposes.

Tribesmen blow up Yemen oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen blew up an oil pipeline in
northern Yemen Sunday to protest government policy, a tribal
spokesman said.
	   The Jahm tribesmen blew up the pipeline in Marib province, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital, San`a, causing a
fire but no casualties, a tribesman said.
	   The fire was burning hours after the explosion, he said.
	   It was the first attack on an oil pipeline since a truce between
the government and tribesmen in July following a series of pipeline
explosions.
	   The Jahm tribe was responsible for several of those blasts. It
had been demanding more government projects in the area, including
roads, schools and medical clinics.
	   ``We blew up the pipeline because the government has not kept it
promises to finance projects in the region,'' the tribal spokesman
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   A Yemeni official condemned the blast as ``a lawless act,'' and
said the government was building schools and roads all over Yemen
equally according to need.
	   Tribesmen attacked the pipeline carrying oil from Ma'rib to the
Red Sea port of Hodeida nine times in June and July, blowing holes
in it and then lighting the fuel on fire with a tracer round or a
blowtorch.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontent with the government.

Skinner wins second straight NASCAR exhibition race in Japan

<TEXT>
	   MOTEGI, Japan (AP) _ Stock car driver Mike Skinner knew how to
outrace rising Winston Cup star Jeff Gordon on an oval track with a
few challenging turns.
	   The 41-year-old resident of Susansville, California, took the
lead on the 140th of 201 laps, outdueled Gordon in the final corner
and won by 0.153 seconds Sunday, his second straight NASCAR
exhibition race victory in Japan.
	   Skinner posted an unofficial time of 2 hours, 45 minutes, 58.000
seconds, or 112.558 mph (180.09 kph) in his Monte Carlo Chevrolet.
	   Organizers, unable to provide official times because of computer
problems, gave only Skinner's winning margin over Gordon, who also
drove a Chevrolet.
	   Jeremy Mayfield was third in a Taurus Ford.
	   The NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500 was the third and last
race in a three-year series held under a contract with Japanese
organizers to promote the sport worldwide.
	   In 1996, Rusty Wallace won the event at the 1.54-mile
(2.46-kilometer) Suzuka Circuitland road course, and Skinner
triumphed last year, also at Suzuka.
	   The victory Sunday was worth dlrs 134,045 from a purse of dlrs 1
million.
	   Skinner started from the third position, behind Mayfield and
Gordon, and made his charge on the 140th lap around the 1.5-mile
(2.4-kilometer) Motegi Twin Ring track.
	   He kept the lead to the end in a close contest that saw half a
dozen crashes. No drivers involved were reported seriously injured.
	   ``Our car was very, very good. When we put tires on it, it would
just go,'' said Skinner. ``I probably cool my tires down more than
anybody else. Our car on hot tires would push very, very bad.''
	   He added that Gordon was better over short runs along the
course, while his car did better on the long runs.
	   ``We knew we had to stop at the corners ... and just go really
slow getting in there and really slow in coming out just like in
the road race at Suzuka,'' said Skinner, formerly a Craftsman Truck
Series star. He is a specialist in road racing.
	   Because of crashes, mechanical failures and engine trouble, only
17 drivers in a field of 31 finished all 201 laps.
	   The field included 13 Winston Cup stars, 11 Winston Cup West
competitors, four Japanese, two Busch Grand drivers and one from
the Craftsman Truck Series.
	   Last year, Skinner was the Winston Cup's 40-year-old rookie of
the year when he drove to his first victory in high-level
competition at Suzuka.
	   In Sunday's race, Gordon, of Pittsboro, Indiana, was seeking his
14th victory of the season. At age 27, he was the youngest driver
to win three Winston Cup championships.
	   Mayfield, from Owensboro, Kentucky, won his only Winston Cup
title in the Pocono 500 at Long Pond, Pennsylvania, in June.
	   Bill France, president of NASCAR, said at the opening ceremony
that said the race will continue in the future.
	   ``I'm very pleased to announce that we'll return again in 1999
with our stock cars and hope that you'll be here to join us once
again,'' he said.
	   Japanese racing officials said details have yet to be worked out
for the Winston Cup West to have a race of its championship series
staged in Japan.

Widow of liberal author Alan Paton to quit South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The widow of South African author Alan Paton,
whose book ``Cry The Beloved Country'' became a seminal work on the
oppression of blacks in the apartheid era, says she is emigrating
because of lawlessness under black rule.
	   ``I love this country with a passion, but I cannot live here any
more,'' Anne Paton, 71, wrote in an article in The Sunday Times.
	   ``There is now more racial tension in this country than I have
ever known. But it is not just about black-on-white crime. It is
about general lawlessness. The black people are suffering more than
the whites.''
	   British-born Mrs. Paton went to South Africa with her first
husband in 1963. She married Paton, 25 years her senior, in 1969
after his first wife died and she divorced her first husband, also
a South African.
	   Paton, South Africa's best-known white liberal author, wrote
``Cry The Beloved Country'' in 1950, a novel about a black priest
in search of his son who is wanted by police for the murder of a
white man.
	   It became a bestseller in South Africa and around the world
almost immediately, has sold more than 15 million copies in 20
languages and was made into a musical ``Lost in the Stars.''
	   Mrs. Paton, who will return to Britain, wrote that she is glad
that her husband, who worked throughout his life for black majority
rule in South Africa, is not alive now.
	   He died in 1988, six years before the country's first all-race
elections ended white rule and brought President Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress to power.
	   ``He would have been so distressed to see what has happened to
his beloved country,'' wrote Mrs. Paton.
	   She described a series of violent attacks on herself, on
friends, and on other elderly whites who live near her home outside
the port city of Durban.
	   She said her car was hijacked at gunpoint outside her local post
office. Six months ago a gang broke into her home, almost throttled
her, threatened to kill her, gagged her and ransacked the house.
	   A few weeks ago, two men tried to batter their way into her
house using a hammer. She pressed a panic button, one was caught
and was later released by a magistrate who said that ``banging on
my door was not an offense, and how could I prove his intent was
hostile?'' wrote Mrs. Paton.
	   The Sunday Times said that between 250,000 and 500,000 whites
have left South Africa since 1994.
	   Census results released last month said 11 percent of South
Arica's 40.58 million people are white.

India scores fifth straight victory in blind cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Continuing their spell of victories,
Indian batsmen on Sunday defeated Australia by five wickets in the
seven-nation tournament of blind cricketers that is being held in
New Delhi.
	   Manvender Singh (44) and Ramkaran Sharma (74) rescued India from
five for 64, with an unbeaten 136-run stand for the sixth wicket.
India rallied well to score 200 for 5 in 28.3 overs after
restricting the visitors for 198 for six in 40 overs.
	   Pakistan also continued its winning spree, defeating England by
six wickets. South Africa thrashed Sri Lanka by seven wickets.
	   Pakistan and South Africa, Australia, England, New Zealand, Sri
Lanka and host India _ all countries with teams among the
international elite of the sighted cricket world _ were competing
for the Kanishka Trophy. The tournament started Tuesday and the
championship will be played Nov. 28.
	   Players who range from the partially sighted to the totally
blind use special balls that emit a rattle to help batsmen direct
their bats and fielders determine where the catch can be made.
Bowlers shout ``ready?'' and wait for a ``yes'' from batsmen before
responding with a shouted ``play'' and flinging the ball.
	   Blind cricket tournaments were being played in Sri Lanka as
early as the 1940s. The Indian tournament is the first
international championship for the blind.
	   Brief scores:
	   India 200 for 5 (Manvender Singh 44 not out, Ramkaran Sharma 74
not out) defeated Australia 198 for 6 (Garry Stichcombe 34, Paul
McKenna 53, Eugene Nagruk 53).
	   Pakistan 225 for 4 in 35.2 overs (Muhammad Ashraf Bhati 94, Noor
Queresh 33, Amir Ishfaq 31) defeated England 224 for 6 in 40 overs
(Jonathan Iturby 75, Heindrick Swanepool 52, Brinley Reynolds 30).
	   South Africa 257 for 3 in 31.5 overs (Scott Field 138 not out,
Johan Kotze 48, Rury Field 35) defeated Sri Lanka 256 for 5 in 40
overs (Chandana Suriyaarachchi 102, Damika Ruwankumara 57 and Manoj
Bandara 35).

Albanian referendum on draft Constitution calm amid slow voting

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians trickled into polling booths
amid apparent calm Sunday, in a controversial referendum meant to
give Europe's poorest country its first post-communist
constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported no
referendum-related violence in this Balkan nation where past
elections have been marked by gunfire and intimidation.
	   Albania's powerful opposition Democratic Party has urged a
boycott of the vote, saying that low turnout would show the lack of
support for the draft constitution that would outline basic rights.
Albania shed Europe's most isolated communist dictatorship in 1991.
	   The draft would give citizens of this Balkan nation the right to
legally change their religion and to identify themselves as members
of an ethnic minority. It would also define property rights and
allow the government to expropriate land deemed of national
interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while in richer, non-Muslim
neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   The draft constitution is seen as likely to pass.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb.
``Hope is the only thing that we can really do.''
	   Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the chief opposition
politician who played a key role in ant-government unrest earlier
this year, claimed Sunday morning that turnout will be so low the
draft will be ``a dead body.''
	   Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 35 percent of the
nearly 2 million eligible voters had cast their ballots by midday,
despite snow that closed four roads in northern Albania and slowed,
or halted voting in some areas.
	   Violence has accompanied national elections in the past as
separate factions squared off outside polling booths. But the
boycott kept most opposition supporters away from the booths
Sunday.
	   Daan Everts, the head of the mission to Albania of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said before
the voting that a turnout of 40 percent to 50 percent would likely
be seen as reasonable, given the boycott. He said turnout below 30
percent or so could call the results into question.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
Tirana suburb, said the constitution will help boost prosperity in
Europe's poorest nation.
	   ``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and
walked on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in
the eye,'' said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station
as well. ``I voted for the future.''
	   Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling booth from the roofs of
nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle police throughout Tirana
searched cars with license plates from outside of Tirana.
	   Other than a heavier police presence, Tirana streets showed no
signs of tensions as residents perused street vendors' wares or
sipped coffee on sidewalk tables. Small pockets of voters gathered
in front of the schools and post offices used as polling booths but
no lengthy lineups were visible.
	   Fearing low turnout, the government recently scrapped a law
requiring a referendum to be voted on by more than 50 percent of
eligible voters.

Chinese president arrives for informal summit meet with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin arrived Sunday
evening for an informal summit meeting with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin that will focus on expanding cooperation between the former
Cold War rivals.
	   A main issue of concern at Monday's meeting will be lagging
commerce between China and Russia. Trade fell 10 percent last year
to dlrs 6.1 billion and the two want to raise the total to dlrs 20
billion by 2000.
	   ``Joint and active efforts must be made to improve the
situation,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Sunday, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Ivanov speaking to the Chinese news agency Xinhua, said ``Russia
and China are going through a period of deep change aimed at
increasing the economic potential and living standards of their
citizens.''
	   The two leaders will hold informal ``no-necktie'' talks at
Novo-Ogarevo, a government residence outside of Moscow. It will be
their sixth summit.
	   Ivanov said it will be the first time that Yeltsin and Jiang had
a chance to meet informally, ``which will enable the two leaders to
discuss, in a trustworthy atmosphere, important issues of mutual
cooperation, to exchange opinions on trends in the development of
world politics and to compare positions on the most important
international questions.''
	   The Russian and Chinese leaders were expected to sign a
statement on border demarcation and discuss broad issues of
expanding cooperation.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang will also release a declaration defining some
stretches of the two nations' 4,300 kilometer (2,700-mile) border
and call for talks on the rest of the frontier, Chinese Ambassador
to Moscow Wu Tao was quoted as saying Friday by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   Jiang _ who is traveling with his wife, Wang Yeping _ will also
meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and visit the Siberian city of
Novosibirsk.
	   Following decades of enmity between the Chinese and the former
Soviet Communist parties that began in the 1950s, relations between
Russia and Chinese began to thaw with a visit by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989. Last year, the two countries declared a
``strategic partnership.''
	   Jiang plans to invite Yeltsin to visit China next year for a
seventh summit meeting, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Sunday, and
quoted Kremlin sources as saying the Kremlin is prepared to accept
the invitation.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Succumbing to international pressure,
Bosnian Muslims signed a controversial agreement of special ties

Presidential couple takes media to court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech president Vaclav Havel and
his wife, Dagmar, have sued some of the country's media for
publishing allegations their relationship was in trouble, the CTK
news agency reported Sunday.
	   According to the report, the Havels have pressed charges against
one TV station, two dailies and one writer for publishing stories
indicating infidelity on the part of Havel's wife, Dagmar.
	   In October, Czech court ruled to take out of circulation a book
by Premysl Svora, called ``Seven weeks that shook the Castle''.
	   The book was an unauthorized testimony of the dramatic
circumstances surrounding Havel's 1996 life-threatening lung cancer
surgery and his subsequent marriage to Dagmar, given by one of the
doctors.
	   The book also alleged Havel's wife Dagmar had an affair with her
personal assistant.
	   In the meantime the book, often sold under the counter, became a
best-selling hit.
	   TV Nova, the country's leading TV station, Blesk, the
best-selling tabloid and Lidove Noviny published several stories
along the lines of Svora's book. They were all sued by the Havels
on Friday, CTK said, quoting Havel's press secretary Martin Krafl.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians lined up in drizzling rain
Sunday to cast ballots in a controversial referendum meant to give
Europe's poorest country its first post-communist Constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported little
referendum-related violence in this Balkan nation where past
elections have been marked by gunfire and intimidation.
	   ``We had reports of intimidation from various political parties
but we checked them out and couldn't find any serious complaints,''
said Andrea Angeli, spokesman for the OSCE observation mission.
``We have had only one minor incident. Otherwise it has been
calm.''
	   He said unknown assailants Saturday night used explosives to
damage a polling station near the northern town of Bajram Curri but
nobody was near the building at the time and it contained no voting
material.
	   He said local authorities moved the booth to another building on
Sunday and voting went on normally.

Croats and Bosnian Muslims sign special ties agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DARKO LABOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Succumbing to international pressure,
Bosnian Muslims signed a controversial agreement establishing
special ties with neighboring Croatia on Sunday.
	   The agreement, which sprang from the Dayton accords that ended
the Bosnian war in 1995, is to regulate and strengthen relations
between Croatia and the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation, which
controls 51 percent of Bosnia.
	   It is designed to outline the framework for relations, which are
dogged by distrust and suspicion.
	   Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim member of Bosnia's tripartite
presidency, arrived to close the deal after two prior postponements
due to opposition at home.
	   ``It is no secret that ... there have been certain reservations
and suspicions regarding the special relations agreement,''
Izetbegovic said, adding that minor changes in wording had helped
win him over.
	   Most Muslims believe the deal could spell doom for the fledgling
nation, which is struggling to keep a lid on Bosnian Croat and Serb
aspirations to join their brethren in neighboring Croatia to the
west, and Serbia to the east.
	   They worry that the agreement may strengthen any Croatian
attempts to annex the southwestern part of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
where Croats are numerous.
	   Bosnian Croats, aided by their patrons in Zagreb, turned against
their erstwhile Muslim allies in 1993 and fought a bloody yearlong
war.
	   Relations have been on a steady mend since the war. But
lingering distrust, often punctuated by outbursts of ethnically
related violence, has hampered more substantial chances of a
lasting peace.
	   International observers, who brokered the deal signed Sunday,
believe it will act as a framework for future agreements in such
matters as trade, transport and security, strengthening cooperation
and making contacts more transparent.
	   ``It is up to you, whether what we do here today actually makes
the difference, or just generates another historical document that
brings no change,'' said Jacques Klein, a deputy to the
international community's top Bosnian envoy, Carlos Westendorp.
``If properly implemented, the agreements will mean jobs, they will
mean trade, they will mean integration with Europe, for Croatia,
for the federation and for Bosnia.''

Israeli army destroys Hamas leaders' hide-out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli army demolished a house
Sunday used as a hide-out by two fugitive Hamas leaders before they
were killed by Israeli troops earlier this year.
	   Adel and Imad Awadallah were wanted by Palestinian authorities
and Israel for alleged involvement in attacks that killed at least
five Israelis and wounded 51 more.
	   After several weeks of searches, the army found and killed the
two brothers in a rented home on the outskirts of the West Bank
city of Hebron on Sept. 11.
	   The owner of the home, Akram Mussauda was arrested shortly
afterward by Israel for harboring fugitives.
	   Israel has destroyed dozens of Palestinian homes over the last
several years, either as a means of collective punishment for
families of militants, or because the homes were built without
permits.
	   An Israeli army spokesman said Sunday that the empty home,
surrounded by vineyards and peach trees, was illegal since it had
been built without Israeli permission.
	   Two bulldozers guarded by dozens of Israeli soldiers destroyed
the house as Mussauda's two brothers looked on. The brothers said
they would have appealed the decision to Israel's Supreme Court but
were only notified 30 minutes before the bulldozers arrived.

Jewish settlers take over historic railroad station
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NATI HARNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEBASTIA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settler youths raised Israeli
flags over a long-abandoned but highly symbolic railroad station
Sunday in the heart of the West Bank and demanded government
permission to establish a religious seminary and museum there.
	   The 30 settlers, mostly high school students from a nearby
settlement, said they were acting in defiance of the latest
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians under which Israel
withdrew from 2 percent of the West Bank Friday.
	   ``We build and continue to build ... in spite of agreements ...
as soon as the land is ours,'' said Rivka Bond one of the settlers.
	   After the group put up flags on the derelict building and began
to clean it up, an army officer served them with a military order
declaring the station a closed military area to be evacuated.
	   One of the settlers, a lawyer, read the order and said it was
illegal. The officer withdrew to consult with his superiors, but
the army sealed off the area anyhow to prevent the arrival of more
settlers.
	   The group strung lights on the building and put out tables of
food. It was not clear whether they would be allowed to stay over
night.
	   The Jewish settlement movement was born in Sebastia 23 years ago
when young religious Israeli nationalists first occupied the
railway station in defiance of the then-Labor government, which was
opposed to settling in densely populated, predominantly Palestinian
areas.
	   However the squatters were openly supported by the National
Religious Party, a junior partner in the coalition government at
the time. Although the settlers were eventually evicted from the
station, the government allowed the establishment of Kedoumim, the
first Jewish settlement in the northern West Bank, and it was soon
followed by others.
	   Today, some 150,000 Jews live in 144 Jewish settlements
throughout the West Bank, land which the Palestinians want for a
future independent state for the 1.6 million Arabs living there as
well.
	   Since the current Israeli government signed a peace deal with
the Palestinians in Washington last month, Jewish settlers have
increased their activities, taking over hilltops and expanding
existing settlements with government backing. Three trailer homes
were set-up on a hilltop near the settlement of Bat Ayin Sunday.
	   Settlers were staunch supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu until he signed the latest deal. Now, they say they will
run a candidate against Netanyahu in the next elections.
	   Under the accord, Israel will continue to withdraw from a total
of 13 percent of the West Bank in a deal which will leave some 18
settlements isolated and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory.
	   Settler leaders Sunday rejected as ``too little,'' a list of
security measures proposed for those settlements by the defense
ministry including surveillance equipment and electric fences.
	   In a letter to the army, the settlers demanded armored buses,
machine guns, tear gas, search-lights, closed-circuit television, a
helicopter landing pad at each settlement, immediate completion of
bypass roads around Palestinian cities and a long list of other
facilities and devices.
	   To finance the building of the bypass roads and relocation of
Israeli army camps, Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman left for
Washington Sunday to request American aid. A U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israel was expected to ask
for dlrs. 1.2 million.
	   In another development, the Israeli army Sunday destroyed a
house near the West Bank city of Hebron where two Islamic militant
leaders hid before Israeli soldiers gunned them down in September.
	   The two fugitives, Adel and Imad Awadallah, were wanted by
Israel for alleged involvement in Hamas attacks which killed at
least five Israelis.
	   And at least 10 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails went on
hunger strikes Sunday to protest Israel's refusal to include them
in a mass prisoner release.
	   Under the latest peace accord, Israel is to release 750
Palestinian prisoners. However Palestinian leaders were angry when
they learned that most of the first 250 set free Friday were common
criminals and not Palestinians jailed for activities against
Israel, as they had wanted.
	   Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accused
Netanyahu of violating the agreement which he said specifically
called for the release of so-called political prisoners.
	   But Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. embassy said he was
``not aware of any violation of the Wye agreement.''
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials are expected to discuss the
prisoner issue later this week.

Batistuta scores again, Fiorentina leads Roma, Juve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's league-high 11th goal of the
season spurred Fiorentina to a 3-1 win over injury-riddled
Internazionale of Milan on Sunday that put his club back alone atop
the Serie A standings.
	   The Argentine striker drove a low, 20-meter (yard) free kick
through the defensive wall in the 16th minute to put Fiorentina
ahead 2-1 after an early barrage of goals.
	   The victory improved Fiorentina's record to 7-0-3 for 21 points,
three more than both AS Roma and two-time defending champion
Juventus of Turin, which played a drab 0-0 draw with lowly Empoli.
	   Roma rallied for a 1-1 draw with Bari on Saturday.
	   At Florence, Inter played without hurt strikers Ronaldo and
Nicola Ventola and winger Francesco Moriero, plus saw veteran
Roberto Baggio leave after 68 somewhat effective minutes.
	   But Baggio, making just his second start of the season because
of knee tendon problems, was brought down in the penalty area by
'keeper Francesco Toldo three minutes into the game. Youri
Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup champions, connected on
the spot kick _ his third in two games _ to put the visitors ahead.
	   Fiorentina tied the score within two minutes, as defender
Pasquale Padalino slammed in a loose ball when Inter failed to
clear following a corner kick.
	   After Batistuta, on pace to break the record of 33 goals in a
season, gave Fiorentina the lead, German defender Jorg Heinrich
fixed the final score in the 75th with his first goal in Italy, off
a perfect assist from Brazil's Edmundo.
	   Heinrich's goal came four minutes after Inter nearly tied the
score when captain Giuseppe Bergomi's shot hit the post.
	   Inter coach Luigi Simoni's job status must again be in doubt now
that his team _ touted by many as a title favorite _ sits tied for
sixth place with a mediocre 4-3-3 record. Inter last lost at
Florence in 1987.
	   In addition to the injury problems, Inter has to fix a weak
defense. Only one of the league's 18 clubs has given up more goals
than the 17 Inter has allowed.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Udinese edged Piacenza 1-0 to snap a six-game
winless streak, Salernitana beat last-place Venezia 1-0, and
Argentine striker Ariel Ortega missed a penalty kick as Sampdoria
of Genoa settled for a 0-0 draw with Vicenza.
	   AC Milan hosted Lazio of Rome at night.
	   On Saturday, Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon's goal with 13
minutes left gave Cagliari a 1-0 upset over AC Parma, and Bologna
and Perugia drew 1-1.

Albanian referendum on draft Constitution calm amid slow voting

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians lined up in drizzling rain
Sunday to cast ballots in a controversial referendum meant to give
Europe's poorest country its first post-communist constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported little
referendum-related violence in this Balkan nation where past
elections have been marked by gunfire and intimidation.
	   ``We had reports of intimidation from various political parties
but we checked them out and couldn't find any serious complaints,''
said Andrea Angeli, spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's observation mission. ``We have had only one
minor incident. Otherwise it has been calm.''
	   Albania's powerful opposition Democratic Party has urged a
boycott of the vote, saying that low turnout would show the lack of
support for the draft constitution that would outline basic rights.
Albania shed Europe's most isolated communist dictatorship in 1991.
	   The draft would give citizens of this Balkan nation the right to
legally change their religion and to identify themselves as members
of an ethnic minority. It would also define property rights and
allow the government to expropriate land deemed of national
interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while in richer, non-Muslim
neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   The draft constitution is seen as likely to pass.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb.
``Hope is the only thing that we can really do.''
	   Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the chief opposition
politician who played a key role in anti-government unrest earlier
this year, claimed Sunday morning that turnout will be so low the
draft will be ``a dead body.''
	   Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 35 percent of the
nearly 2 million eligible voters had cast their ballots by midday,
despite snow that closed four roads in northern Albania and slowed,
or halted voting in some areas.
	   Violence has accompanied national elections in the past as
separate factions squared off outside polling booths. But the
boycott kept most opposition supporters away from the booths
Sunday.
	   Angeli said unknown assailants used explosives Saturday night to
damage a polling station near the northern town of Bajram Curri,
but nobody was near the building at the time.
	   He said local authorities moved the booth to another building on
Sunday and voting went on normally.
	   Daan Everts, head of the OSCE mission, said before the voting
that a turnout of 40 percent to 50 percent would likely be seen as
reasonable, given the boycott. He said turnout below 30 percent or
so could call the results into question.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
Tirana suburb, said the constitution will help boost prosperity in
Europe's poorest nation.
	   ``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and
walked on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in
the eye,'' said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station
as well. ``I voted for the future.''
	   Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling booth from the roofs of
nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle police throughout Tirana
searched cars with license plates from outside of Tirana.
	   Other than a heavier police presence, Tirana streets showed no
signs of tensions as residents perused street vendors' wares or
sipped coffee on sidewalk tables. Small pockets of voters gathered
in front of the schools and post offices used as polling booths but
no lengthy lineups were visible.
	   Fearing low turnout, the government recently scrapped a law
requiring a referendum to be voted on by more than 50 percent of
eligible voters.

<TEXT>
	   At Turin, where Empoli (2-4-4) stopped a three-game losing
streak, Juventus (5-3-2) saw its current winless slide stretch to
three games. The Turin club has been shut out in both outings since
star striker Alessandro Del Piero went down with a season-ending
knee injury. Empoli, tied for 15th place, was more dangerous in
attack, wasting three golden scoring chances in as many minutes
early in the second half.
 &UR; Udinese 1, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, where Piacenza hasn't won since 1969, Paolo Poggi
slotted in Danish midfielder Martin Jorgensen's cross in the 40th
minute. Udinese (3-4-3) had seen Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso
miss a penalty kick in the 24th minute. Both clubs ended the game
with 10 players, with Simone Inzaghi sent off for Piacenza (3-2-5)
early in the second half and Udinese's Alessandro Pierini expelled
in the 70th.
 &UR; Salernitana 1, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Venezia defender Fabio Bilica knocked a cross into
his own net in the 20th minute to gift-wrap the win for Salernitana
(3-1-6). Venezia dropped to 1-2-7.
 &UR; Sampdoria 0, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, where Vicenza (2-4-4) last won in 1971, 'keeper
Pierluigi Brivio dove to his left to punch away Ortega's shot from
the spot in the 22nd minute. Sampdoria is 3-3-4.
 &UR; Saturday's action &QC; 
 &UR; Roma 1, Bari 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Francesco Totti, fresh off his debut start for Italy's
national team, hit a penalty kick with nine minutes remaining to
salvage the standings point for Roma (5-3-2). Bari (2-7-1) had
taken the lead five minutes earlier on South African striker Phil
Masinga's goal.
 &UR; Cagliari 1, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Kallon drove a blast into the net after a run up
the right flank for his fifth goal of the season. Cagliari improved
to 4-2-4, while Parma fell to 4-4-2.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Perugia 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Croat striker Milan Rapajic put Perugia (3-3-4)
ahead in the 37th minute, but the hosts (3-5-2) pulled even five
minutes later on midfielder Jonathan Binotto's goal.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II threw out the usual strict
rules on attire in St. Peter's Basilica on Sunday, sharing the
altar with bare-chested, barefooted tribespeople in a Mass for
visitors from distant Oceania.
	   A blare on a conch shell opened the Mass, part of a Vatican
synod of bishops from New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and Samoa. Drums
pounded, guitars sounded, and the faithful garlanded the altar _
and the pope himself _ with flowers.
	   John Paul leaned forward from the papal throne to accept a gift
of a carved model canoe, said to symbolize the church, his own
flowered miter nearly touching the brushy headdress of the giver.
	   The colors and sounds enlivened the marble confines of the
basilica, where normally even bare arms are banned.
	   Today, John Paul told worshippers, the church is ``searching for
new impulses ... in the drive to announce the kingdom of Christ in
the diversity of culture and of human tradition, social and
religious, and in the marvelous multiplicity of their people.''
	   Through Dec. 12, 152 delegates at the Vatican synod will be
discussing the church's work in Oceania, home to 8 million of the
world's Catholics.

Marion Jones, Haile Gebrselassie win IAAF awards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FOR RELEASE AT 1900 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Marion Jones, who became the second
fastest woman ever in the 100 and 200 meters, and Haile
Gebrselassie, who set four world records, were named Sunday as the
IAAF athletes of the year.
	   The American sprinter, who picked up the award for the second
year in a row, dominated the 100 meters, 200 meters and long jump
and was an overwhelming choice for the women's prize.
	   While vote totals were not released, Jones' closest competitors
were believed to be French sprinter Christine Arron, the European
champion at 100 and 200, and Irish distance runner Sonia
O'Sullivan.
	   The men's contest was much closer, with Gebrselassie edging
Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who broke the 1,500-meter record.
	   The awards were presented at the International Amateur Athletic
Federation's annual gala in Monaco.
	   ``I've had a wonderful season and this just tops it off,'' said
Jones, who became the first woman in 50 years to win the 100, 200
and long jump at the USA Championships.
	   The former University of North Carolina basketball star compiled
an overall winning streak of 37 events that was snapped only when
Heike Dreschler beat her in the long jump at the World Cup in
Johannesburg, South Africa.
	   Jones clocked 10.90 seconds or better in 20 races in the 100 and
ran the fourth-fastest time ever _ 10.65 _ at the World Cup. The
only woman in history to run faster is the late Florence Griffith
Joyner, who holds the world record of 10.49.
	   Jones also ran the third fastest 200 meters in history, clocking
21.62 in Johannesburg. Only Griffith Joyner has run faster,
including the world record of 21.34.
	   Jones also won the women's overall IAAF Grand Prix title and was
one of three athletes (along with Gebrselassie and El Guerrouj) to
share the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot for going undefeated
in her event.
	   Jones, who got married on Oct. 3 to U.S. shot putter C.J.
Hunter, said she is skipping the entire indoor season _ including
the world indoor championships in Japan _ to concentrate on winning
four gold medals (100, 200, long jump and relay) at next year's
World Championships in Seville.
	   Jones is targetting five gold medals (100, 200, long jump and
two relays) at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   Gebrselassie, meanwhile, continued to establish himself as one
of the greatest distance runners in history as he went undefeated
in 1998 from 1,500 to 10,000 meters.
	   The diminutive Ethiopian set world indoor records at 2,000 and
3,000 meters, and smashed the outdoor records at 5,000 and 10,000 .
He also posted the year's fastest times in the 3,000.
	   ``This has been the best year of my career,'' he said. ``I've
dreamed of this athlete-of-the-year award for a long time.''
	   Gebrselassie said he thought he should have won the award in
1995 when he was edged out by British triple jumper Jonathan
Edwards.
	   Gebrselassie said he plans to run the 10,000 at the World
Championships in Seville, but he wouldn't rule out doubling in the
5,000. He said he will also concentrate on breaking Kenyan Daniel
Komen's world record in the 3,000.
	   The IAAF festivities also included a lifetime achievement award
for American heptathlete and long jumper Jackie Joyner Kersee, who
retired this year after an 18-year career that included six Olymic
medals and four world championship gold medals.
	   There were also tributes to Griffith Joyner, who died in
September at the age of 38 after suffering a seizure. Her husband,
Al Joyner, and daughter, Mary, attended the gala.

Pechstein, Romme victors at World Cup speedskating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Two Women's 1,500 meters
favorites crossed awkwardly on the last lap at the World Cup
speedskating event Sunday, and German Claudia Pechstein benefitted
to win in 2 minutes 0.21 seconds.
	   Then Dutchman Gianni Romme confirmed his superiority over the
10,000 meters, winning the event in 13:34.83.
	   Skating on his 31st birthday, Bart Veldkamp of Belgium set the
time to beat in the fifth-to-last pairing, but his 13:35.02 was
only good enough to pip German Frank Dittrich (13:38.05) for
second.
	   Romme was skating paired with Brigt Rykkje, with whom he tied
for first in last weekend's 5,000 meters in Hamar, Norway. But the
longer race is Romme's strength and Rykkje fell back to fifth.
	   Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann and American Chris Witty were chasing
Pechstein's time hard in the final pairing when the German had to
slow down to let Witty past in front of her from the outside lane.
	   Niemann-Stirnemann was suddenly well out of race and finished
only 11th but Witty lost time too, finishing third in 2:00.35,
3/100ths of a second behind second-placed Dutchwoman Tonny de Jong.
	   The defeat was Niemann-Stirnemann's first of this World Cup
cycle after winning the 1,500 and 3,000 in Hamar and the 5,000 here
in the Thialf stadium Saturday.

Pechstein, Romme victors at World Cup speedskating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Two women's 1,500 meters
favorites crossed awkwardly on the last lap at the World Cup
speedskating event Sunday, and German Claudia Pechstein benefited
to win in 2 minutes 0.21 seconds.
	   Then Dutchman Gianni Romme confirmed his superiority over the
10,000 meters, winning the event in 13:34.83.
	   Skating on his 31st birthday, Bart Veldkamp of Belgium set the
time to beat in the fifth-to-last pairing, but his 13:35.02 was
only good enough to pip German Frank Dittrich (13:38.05) for
second.
	   Romme was skating paired with Brigt Rykkje, with whom he tied
for first in last weekend's 5,000 meters in Hamar, Norway. But the
longer race is Romme's strength and Rykkje fell back to fifth.
	   Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann and American Chris Witty were chasing
Pechstein's time hard in the final pairing when the German had to
slow down to let Witty past in front of her from the outside lane.
	   Niemann-Stirnemann was suddenly well out of the race and
finished only 11th but Witty lost time too, finishing third in
2:00.35, 3/100ths of a second behind second-placed Dutchwoman Tonny
de Jong.
	   The defeat was Niemann-Stirnemann's first of this World Cup
cycle after winning the 1,500 and 3,000 in Hamar and the 5,000 here
in the Thialf stadium Saturday.

Batistuta scores again, Fiorentina leads Roma, Juve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. UPDATES with quotes. will be updated with
Milan-Lazio match, which starts at 1930 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's league-high 11th goal of the
season spurred Fiorentina to a 3-1 win over injury-riddled
Internazionale of Milan on Sunday that put his club back alone atop
the Serie A standings.
	   The Argentine striker drove a low, 20-meter (yard) free kick
through the defensive wall in the 16th minute to put Fiorentina
ahead 2-1 after an early barrage of goals.
	   The victory improved Fiorentina's record to 7-0-3 for 21 points,
three more than both AS Roma and two-time defending champion
Juventus of Turin, which played a drab 0-0 draw with lowly Empoli.
	   ``It was ugly,'' admitted Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, whose
club was shut out for a second straight game. ``We didn't play well
and failed to create any scoring chances.''
	   Roma rallied for a 1-1 draw with Bari on Saturday.
	   At Florence, Inter played without hurt strikers Ronaldo and
Nicola Ventola and winger Francesco Moriero, plus saw veteran
Roberto Baggio leave after 68 somewhat effective minutes.
	   But Baggio, making just his second start of the season because
of knee tendon problems, was brought down in the penalty area by
'keeper Francesco Toldo three minutes into the game. Youri
Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup champions, connected on
the spot kick _ his third in two games _ to put the visitors ahead.
	   Fiorentina tied the score within two minutes, as defender
Pasquale Padalino slammed in a loose ball when Inter failed to
clear following a corner kick.
	   After Batistuta, on pace to break the record of 33 goals in a
season, gave Fiorentina the lead, German defender Jorg Heinrich
fixed the final score in the 75th with his first goal in Italy, off
a perfect assist from Brazil's Edmundo.
	   Heinrich's goal came four minutes after Inter nearly tied the
score when captain Giuseppe Bergomi's shot hit the post.
	   ``My team was balanced and intelligent. We fully deserved this
victory,'' said Fiorentina coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who led Inter
to its last league title, in 1989. ``If we keep playing like this,
we can fight for the title.''
	   Inter coach Luigi Simoni's job status must again be in doubt now
that his team _ touted by many as a title favorite _ sits tied for
sixth place with a mediocre 4-3-3 record. Inter last lost at
Florence in 1987.
	   In addition to the injury problems, Inter has to fix a weak
defense. Only one of the league's 18 clubs has given up more goals
than the 17 Inter has allowed.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Udinese edged Piacenza 1-0 to snap a six-game
winless streak, Salernitana beat last-place Venezia 1-0, and
Argentine striker Ariel Ortega missed a penalty kick as Sampdoria
of Genoa settled for a 0-0 draw with Vicenza.
	   AC Milan hosted Lazio of Rome at night.
	   On Saturday, Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon's goal with 13
minutes left gave Cagliari a 1-0 upset over AC Parma, and Bologna
and Perugia drew 1-1.
 &UR; Juventus 0, Empoli 0 &QC; 
	   At Turin, where Empoli (2-4-4) stopped a three-game losing
streak, Juventus (5-3-2) saw its current winless slide stretch to
three games. The Turin club has not scored since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with a season-ending knee injury.
Empoli, tied for 15th place, was more dangerous in attack, wasting
three golden scoring chances in as many minutes early in the second
half.
 &UR; Udinese 1, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, where Piacenza hasn't won since 1969, Paolo Poggi
slotted in Danish midfielder Martin Jorgensen's cross in the 40th
minute. Udinese (3-4-3) had seen Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso
miss a penalty kick in the 24th minute. Both clubs ended the game
with 10 players, with Simone Inzaghi sent off for Piacenza (3-2-5)
early in the second half and Udinese's Alessandro Pierini expelled
in the 70th.
 &UR; Salernitana 1, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Venezia defender Fabio Bilica knocked a cross into
his own net in the 20th minute to gift-wrap the win for Salernitana
(3-1-6). Venezia dropped to 1-2-7.
 &UR; Sampdoria 0, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, where Vicenza (2-4-4) last won in 1971, 'keeper
Pierluigi Brivio dove to his left to punch away Ortega's shot from
the spot in the 22nd minute. Sampdoria is 3-3-4.
 &UR; Saturday's action &QC; 
 &UR; Roma 1, Bari 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Francesco Totti, fresh off his debut start for Italy's
national team, hit a penalty kick with nine minutes remaining to
salvage the standings point for Roma (5-3-2). Bari (2-7-1) had
taken the lead five minutes earlier on South African striker Phil
Masinga's goal.
 &UR; Cagliari 1, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Kallon drove a blast into the net after a run up
the right flank for his fifth goal of the season. Cagliari improved
to 4-2-4, while Parma fell to 4-4-2.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Perugia 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Croat striker Milan Rapajic put Perugia (3-3-4)
ahead in the 37th minute, but the hosts (3-5-2) pulled even five
minutes later on midfielder Jonathan Binotto's goal.

Assyrians occupy Swiss church in support of Ocalan

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detail. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Some 60 Assyrian Christians have
occupied a Zurich church in support of Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, city police said Sunday.
	   The group of men, women and children entered the Fraumuenster
church in the heart of the old town Saturday afternoon, announcing
they would start a hunger strike aimed at preventing Ocalan's
extradition from Italy to Turkey.
	   Church officials abandoned attempts to have them forcibly
removed after two men doused themselves with gasoline. The group
identified itself as belonging to the ``Bethnahrin Patriotic
Revolutionary Organization.''
	   They have promised to leave by Tuesday, parish president Martin
Zollinger said.
	   The protesters discussed the problems of Turkey's Assyrian
minority with churchgoers after taking part in Sunday morning's
service, he added.
	   Ocalan was freed in Rome Saturday amid a barrage of protests
from Turkey, which wants him handed over as a terrorist.
	   Leaving the hospital where he'd been in custody, he told the
thousands of Kurds from throughout Europe who came to Rome in his
support to return home.
	   Ocalan was freed by a court decision Friday rejecting a Turkish
warrant for his arrest because Italian law forbids extradition to
countries where someone faces the death penalty. The court said
Ocalan had to stay in Rome, but that order could be lifted next
month.

India's Sikh minorities celebrate 300 years of founding of
</HEADLINE>
religion &QL; 
 &UR; By DEEPAK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANANDPUR SAHIB, India (AP) _ Sikhs danced and sang on the
streets of the northern Indian town of Anandpur Sahib on Sunday,
flashing swords, blowing trumpets and riding horses and elephants
to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the founding of their
brotherhood.
	   The Sikh religion was founded by Guru Nanak in 1469 who combined
parts of Hinduism and Islam. Two hundred years later, Guru Gobind
Singh, tenth in the line of teachers, founded the Khalsa or Sikh
brotherhood by introducing military overtones in the Sikh religion
to stop persecution of its followers.
	   Followers of the religion, usually called Singh, or Lion, are
enjoined to be god fearing, self-abrogating, martial and classless.
To remind them of their duties, they sport long hair covered in a
turban and carry a sword. Sikhs are regarded as among the fiercest
martial races of India.
	   On Sunday, tens of thousands of Sikhs prayed and sang hymns at
Anandpur Sahib, 275 kilometers (170 miles) northwest of New Delhi,
to celebrate the founding of the brotherhood. They then marched
through the town's streets, led by the five holy representatives.
	   The procession included a stunning display of martial arts
skills by 300 conservative Sikhs, dressed in blue shirts and
turbans, who waved swords four-feet (one-meter) long. Others beat
drums, sounded trumpets, sang songs and chanted prayers.
	   The representatives, known as Panj Pyaraas, laid the foundation
stone of a heritage complex that Israeli architect Moshe Shafde is
building at a cost of 2,500 million rupees (dlrs 58 million). When
completed in the next three years, it will house relics associated
with the Sikh religion.
	   Most of India's nearly 20 million Sikhs live in the northwestern
state of Punjab, where a violent campaign for a Sikh homeland raged
for 10 years before it was crushed in 1994.

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Leftist and Pan-Africanist activists paid
revolutionary tributes on Sunday at the funeral of Kwame Ture, the
1960s radical who spread the cry of ``Black Power'' throughout the
United States and the world.
	   Ture, who spent nearly his entire adult life preaching socialist
upheaval and changed his name from Stokely Carmichael after he
moved from the United States to Guinea in 1968, died Sunday of
prostate cancer at age 57.
	   He was memorialized Sunday with a service at the university in
Conakry and was to be buried later in a public cemetery.
	   Although Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan and Ture's first ex-wife, the South African singer Miriam
Makeba had been asked to come, no prominent figures were visible at
the funeral ceremony.
	   Instead, about 400 people _ including Libyan and Cuban diplomats
and an array of former comrades of Ture's activist days in the U.S.
_ assembled in an outdoor pavilion underneath a 50-foot-long mosaic
of a black man breaking manacles on his hands.
	   Ture's coffin lay on a table propping up pictures of Ture and
his self-chosen namesakes, deceased African leaders Ahmed Sekou
Toure and Kwame Nkrumah.
	   The 15-car funeral procession to the funeral was led by an
ambulance with sirens blazing, followed by Ture's own ageing black
and red Deux Chevaux automobile.
	   Speakers paid homage to the deceased man under a banner that
read: ``The CIA gave me cancer. Kwame Ture.'' Ture and his family
had accused the U.S. intelligence service of giving him the disease
that eventually killed him.
	   Ture, who was born in Trinidad but raised in New York, began his
political career began as a college student in the 1960s, helping
to integrate public transportation in the American South as a
freedom rider. He soon became one of the most fiery figures of the
era, popularizing the term ``Black Power'' and changing the way the
once-nonviolent civil rights movement was viewed.
	   He headed the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee, an
important center of leftist activism in the `60s, and later became
the honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers.
	   Angered by the Panthers moves to ally themselves with white
radicals, Carmichael left the group, changed his name and moved to
Guinea in 1968, invited by Guinea's brutal Marxist dictator, Sekou
Toure.
	   Ture quickly became a fringe political figure and a man largely
forgotten except for his `60s activism. He spent the rest of his
life lecturing and writing, preaching black power and championing
socialism while condemning America, capitalism and Zionism.
	   Ismael Ghussein, secretary general of the Guinean Democratic
Party, spoke in his remembrance, saying Ture had dedicated his life
to the people.
	   ``Stokely the fighter, was always in front, beside and behind
the people of Africa in the struggle to take back what was taken
from them,'' Ghussein said.
	   Bob Brown, a longtime friend who was first arrested with Ture
more than 30 years ago and had stayed with him ever since, said
Ture's political aspirations became the center of his life.
	   ``Kwame is a struggler. He struggled all his life, he struggled
until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of the
last day,'' Brown said to loud applause and cheering.
	   ``I know that today my father is very happy, happy because he
will remain in Guinea,'' Ture's son Boucar said.
	   Forgotten in the long stream of political speeches was the human
side of a fierce socialist campaigner who was gentle to his
friends.
	   In the audience, Beverly Sylla, an American teacher who is
married to a Guinean, spoke privately of how Ture would often call
her to cheer her up after her son died of brain cancer early last
year.
	   ``He wasn't just about politics. He was caring, he was human.
And they need to say that,'' she said gesturing towards the
speakers on the podium.

	   SAINT-JEAN-SUR-RICHELIEU, Quebec (AP) _ It is a paradox that
keeps all of Canada in limbo: Most Quebeckers aren't eager for
another referendum on secession, yet they seem on the verge of
re-electing a government committed to independence.
	   Barring a surprise in the campaign's final week, separatist
Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois are expected to win
another term in provincial elections Nov. 30 and begin laying the
groundwork for Quebec's third referendum on leaving Canada.
	   If Bouchard is to be stopped, the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal
Party must win in places like Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 25 miles
(40 kilometers) southeast of Montreal. It is a district with a
history of voting on the winning side, and the separatists narrowly
won here in 1994.
	   Even the local Liberal candidate is perplexed by the Quebec
paradox.
	   ``The polls show most people don't want any more referendums,
and yet Bouchard is still popular,'' Gilles Dolbec said in an
interview at his headquarters. ``What can we do?''

Jewish settlers take over historic railroad station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEBASTIA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settler youths raised Israeli
flags over a long-abandoned but highly symbolic railroad station
Sunday in the heart of the West Bank and demanded government
permission to establish a religious seminary and museum there.
	   The 30 settlers, mostly high school students from a nearby
settlement, said they were acting in defiance of the latest
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians under which Israel
withdrew from 2 percent of the West Bank on Friday.
	   ``We build and continue to build ... in spite of agreements ...
as soon as the land is ours,'' said Rivka Bond one of the settlers.
	   After the group put up flags on the derelict building and began
to clean it up, an army officer served them with a military order
declaring the station a closed military area to be evacuated.
	   One of the settlers, a lawyer, read the order and said it was
illegal. The officer withdrew to consult with his superiors, and
the army sealed off the area to prevent the arrival of more
settlers.
	   The group strung lights on the building and put out tables of
food. It was not clear whether they would be allowed to stay
overnight.
	   The Jewish settlement movement was born in Sebastia 23 years ago
when young religious Israeli nationalists occupied the railway
station in defiance of the then-Labor government, which was opposed
to settling in densely populated, predominantly Palestinian areas.
	   However the squatters were openly supported by the National
Religious Party, a junior partner in the coalition government at
the time. Although the settlers were eventually evicted from the
station, the government allowed the establishment of Kedoumim, the
first Jewish settlement in the northern West Bank, and it was soon
followed by others.
	   Today, some 150,000 Jews live in 144 Jewish settlements
throughout the West Bank, where 1.6 million Arabs also live.
Palestinians want to create an independent state in the territory.
	   Since Israel signed a peace deal with the Palestinians in
Washington last month, Jewish settlers have increased their
activities, taking over hilltops and expanding existing settlements
with government backing. Three trailer homes were set up on a
hilltop near the settlement of Bat Ayin on Sunday.
	   Under the accord, Israel will continue to withdraw from a total
of 13 percent of the West Bank in a deal which will leave some 18
settlements isolated and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory.
	   Settler leaders Sunday rejected as ``too little,'' a list of
defense ministry proposals _ including surveillance equipment and
electric fences _ to protect those settlements.
	   In a letter to the army, the settlers demanded armored buses,
machine guns, tear gas, search lights, closed-circuit television, a
helicopter landing pad at each settlement, immediate completion of
bypass roads around Palestinian cities and a long list of other
facilities and devices.
	   To finance the building of the bypass roads and the relocation
of Israeli army camps, Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman left for
Washington on Sunday to request American aid. A U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israel was expected to ask
for dlrs 1.2 billion.
	   In another development, the Israeli army Sunday destroyed a
house near the West Bank city of Hebron where two Islamic militant
leaders hid before Israeli soldiers gunned them down in September.
	   The two fugitives, Adel and Imad Awadallah, were wanted by
Israel for alleged involvement in Hamas attacks which killed at
least five Israelis.
	   And at least 10 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails went on
hunger strikes Sunday to protest Israel's refusal to include them
in a mass prisoner release.
	   Under the latest peace accord, Israel is to release 750
Palestinian prisoners. However Palestinian leaders were angry when
they learned that most of the first 250 set free Friday were common
criminals and not Palestinians jailed for activities against
Israel, as they had wanted.

	   The group strung lights on the building and put out tables of

disperse them,'' said police spokesman Ofer Sivan.

increased their activities, taking over hilltops and expanding
existing settlements with government backing. Two trailer homes and
tents were set-up on a hilltop near the settlement of Bat Ayin
Sunday. Settlers laid a sewage pipe and said they would develop the
hilltop.
	   Settlers were staunch supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu until he signed the latest deal. Now, they say they will
run a candidate against Netanyahu in the next elections.
	   Under the accord, Israel will continue to withdraw from a total
of 13 percent of the West Bank in a deal which will leave some 18

	   Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accused
Netanyahu of violating the agreement which he said specifically
called for the release of so-called political prisoners.
	   But Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. embassy said he was
``not aware of any violation of the Wye agreement.''
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials are expected to discuss the
prisoner issue later this week.

Renegade British spy says he was harassed by terrorist in Paris
</HEADLINE>
jail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former MI5 officer who sold information about
the British intelligence agency says he was harassed by convicted
international terrorist Carlos the Jackal while held in a jail in
France.
	   ``It really got to me. I told other prisoners to shout back that
I was not there,'' David Shayler, 32, told The Mail on Sunday, the
British newspaper to which he sold secrets.
	   A Paris court last week turned down a British request for
Shayler's extradition to face charges under Britain's Official
Secrets Act. His lawyer argued that he sold information to
criticize MI5's operations and his actions had political overtones
which prohibit extradition under French law.
	   Shayler was arrested four months ago in France, where he had
fled and was reportedly considering releasing information about an
alleged British plot to kill Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, which
the British government denies.
	   He was held in La Sante prison where Carlos the Jackal, nickname
for Venezuelan-born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, is held. Sanchez was
given a life sentence last December for three murders, and is under
investigation for further terrorist attacks.
	   Shayler, an MI5 agent from 1994-97, said it was bizarre that he
wound up in the same jail as Sanchez, an international terrorist
who was among ``the biggest enemies'' of the agency.
	   Daily when he exercised in the prison yard he would hear Sanchez
calling out to him for information on what he knew about agents
working in Libya, said Shayler.
	   Shayler is trying to make a deal to be allowed back to Britain,
saying he will testify to a parliamentary committee on what he sees
as the failings of Britain's domestic intelligence agency in return
for not being arrested.
	   Britain's Home Office reiterated Shayler would be arrested, and
said it was not doing any deal.
	   ``Criminal charges remain on file. If Shayler has anything to
say he should take advice from his solicitors and approaches should
be made by them,'' a Home Office statement said.

Hack wins World Cup event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IGLS, Austria (AP) _ Georg Hackl proved he's getting better with
age Sunday. The German, winner of the last three Olympic gold
medals, won the first men's World Cup luge event of the season,
defeating Markus Prock on his rival's home track.
	   Olympic gold medallist in 1992, 1994 and 1998, the 32-year-old
Hackl got off to a first-run lead and held on to defeat Prock,
repeating the scene of his 1997 world title, where he beat out the
Austrian for gold on Prock's home ice.
	   ``A fast start, good position and good driving were the keys to
the first run,'' said Hackl, who hopes to build momentum toward the
1999 World Championships on his home course in Konigsee.
	   Hackl registered times of 49.013 and 49.047 seconds for an
aggregate of 1 minute, 38.060 seconds. Prock, third after one heat
due to a slow start, rebounded with a track-record start in the
final leg to gain the silver in 1:38.178. Teammate Gerhard
Gleirscher, the 1997 World Championship bronze medal winner,
finished third again in 1:38.195.

Thousands protest before Italian Embassy in Ankara

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands angered by Italy's release of a
Kurdish rebel leader protested in front of the Italian Embassy on
Sunday, while a horn-honking convoy of truckers drove through
Ankara demanding a halt to trade with Italy.
	   Children stood waving the Turkish flag as scores of trucks drove
past blaring their horns and bearing banners that declared: ``An
end to trade with Italy.'' Hundreds of companies and business
groups have announced a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Turks have taken to the streets over the past week to protest
Italy's refusal to extradite to Turkey rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, who came to Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum.
	   On Friday, a Rome court rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for
Ocalan, freeing him. The court cited Italian law forbidding
extradition of suspects to countries where they might face the
death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan the most ruthless of terrorists. Rebels
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have fought for Kurdish
autonomy for more than 10 years; more than 37,000 have died,
including civilians killed in PKK bombings.
	   ``We are not angry at the Italian people, but we are very angry
at the Italian prime minister,'' said Nesrim Tureli, one of the
thousands chanting before the embassy.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Turkey was planning an appeal
of the Rome court's decision on Monday.
	   Under the court's orders, Ocalan must stay in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany time to decide whether it wants to extradite him on
its own warrant on terrorism charges.
	   Ocalan's presence would be as much a headache for Germany as it
is for Italy, and German officials have consistently said they have
no plans now to seek extradition.
	   On Saturday, however, Germany's federal prosecutor issued a new
warrant for Ocalan.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told Italy's ANSA news
service the new warrant was ``a good sign.'' ANSA quoted Dini as
saying he now expected a German extradition request.
	   Meanwhile, Turkish newspapers reported a large-scale military
operation in the southeastern provinces against PKK rebels.
According to the Zaman daily, 35,000 troops launched an offensive
this week in the province of Tunceli, where authorities suspect
that 500 rebels are hiding.
	   Military officials refused to comment on the report.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin questioned Sunday whether Italy
was any different from Syria, which allowed Ocalan haven during
most of his struggle against Turkey.
	   ``The head of the separatist organization in now being hosted in
a villa in Italy. Then, what difference is there between Syria and
Italy? In Syria, too, he was staying in a villa. Where are the
advocates of human rights, the claims of the cradle of
civilization, the fellow NATO member for the past 40-50 years?''
Sezgin asked, according to the Anatolia news agency.

Marion Jones to skip indoor season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ American sprint star Marion Jones is
skipping the entire 1999 indoor season _ including the world indoor
championships in Japan _ to concentrate on her attempt to win four
gold medals at the world outdoor championships in Spain.
	   Jones said Sunday she will limit the number of meets she
competes in next year to prepare for her medal assaults at the Aug.
20-29 worlds in Seville and the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   ``Four (golds) is the goal in Seville, setting up for five the
next year in Sydney,'' said Jones, who was in Monte Carlo for the
IAAF's annual gala.
	   Jones said she plans to compete in the 100, 200, long jump and
one or both of the relays (400 and 1,600 meters) in Seville. She'll
go for all five events in Sydney.
	   ``This has been a very long year,'' said Jones, who was
undefeated on the track in 1998. ``There were no major
championships, so we competed to keep ourselves busy. Next year
that's not the case.
	   ``We're going to try to taper off the meets for '99. Competing
and doing well in the world championships is the goal. Then I want
to get ready for 2000. That's the ultimate goal.''
	   Jones said she won't run in any indoor meets, including the
March 5-7 world indoor championships in Maebashi, Japan. However,
she said she'll attend the event as a spectator because her
husband, American shot putter C.J. Hunter, will be competing.
	   Jones said she plans to train in South Africa for the outdoor
season.

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Leftist and Pan-Africanist activists paid
revolutionary tributes on Sunday at the funeral of Kwame Ture, the
1960s radical who spread the cry of ``Black Power'' throughout the
United States and the world.
	   Ture, who spent nearly his entire adult life preaching socialist
upheaval and changed his name from Stokely Carmichael after he
moved from the United States to Guinea in 1968, died last Sunday of
prostate cancer at age 57.
	   He was memorialized Sunday with a service at the university in
Conakry and was to be buried later in a public cemetery.
	   Although Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan and Ture's first ex-wife, the South African singer Miriam
Makeba had been asked to come, no prominent figures were visible at
the funeral ceremony.
	   Instead, about 400 people _ including Libyan and Cuban diplomats
and an array of former comrades of Ture's activist days in the U.S.
_ assembled in an outdoor pavilion underneath a 50-foot-long mosaic
of a black man breaking manacles on his hands.
	   Ture's coffin lay on a table propping up pictures of Ture and
his self-chosen namesakes, deceased African leaders Ahmed Sekou
Toure and Kwame Nkrumah.
	   The 15-car funeral procession to the funeral was led by an
ambulance with sirens blazing, followed by Ture's own ageing black
and red Deux Chevaux automobile.
	   Speakers paid homage to the deceased man under a banner that
read: ``The CIA gave me cancer. Kwame Ture.'' Ture and his family
had accused the U.S. intelligence service of giving him the disease
that eventually killed him.
	   Ture, who was born in Trinidad but raised in New York, began his
political career began as a college student in the 1960s, helping
to integrate public transportation in the American South as a
freedom rider. He soon became one of the most fiery figures of the
era, popularizing the term ``Black Power'' and changing the way the
once-nonviolent civil rights movement was viewed.
	   He headed the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee, an
important center of leftist activism in the `60s, and later became
the honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers.
	   Angered by the Panthers moves to ally themselves with white
radicals, Carmichael left the group, changed his name and moved to
Guinea in 1968, invited by Guinea's brutal Marxist dictator, Sekou
Toure.
	   Ture quickly became a fringe political figure and a man largely
forgotten except for his `60s activism. He spent the rest of his
life lecturing and writing, preaching black power and championing
socialism while condemning America, capitalism and Zionism.
	   Ismael Ghussein, secretary general of the Guinean Democratic
Party, spoke in his remembrance, saying Ture had dedicated his life
to the people.
	   ``Stokely the fighter, was always in front, beside and behind
the people of Africa in the struggle to take back what was taken
from them,'' Ghussein said.
	   Bob Brown, a longtime friend who was first arrested with Ture
more than 30 years ago and had stayed with him ever since, said
Ture's political aspirations became the center of his life.
	   ``Kwame is a struggler. He struggled all his life, he struggled
until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of the
last day,'' Brown said to loud applause and cheering.
	   ``I know that today my father is very happy, happy because he
will remain in Guinea,'' Ture's son Boucar said.
	   Forgotten in the long stream of political speeches was the human
side of a fierce socialist campaigner who was gentle to his
friends.
	   In the audience, Beverly Sylla, an American teacher who is
married to a Guinean, spoke privately of how Ture would often call
her to cheer her up after her son died of brain cancer early last
year.
	   ``He wasn't just about politics. He was caring, he was human.
And they need to say that,'' she said gesturing towards the
speakers on the podium.

Gadhafi calls on Africa to oppose U.S. efforts in the Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIR0, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused the
United States of trying to destabilize central Africa and urged
African countries to unite to frustrate ``this conspiracy,'' the
Libyan news agency reported Sunday.
	   Gadhafi spoke Saturday at a reception for Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, following his arrival in Libya, apparently by plane
in violation of a U.N. air embargo.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban, which
was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for trial
two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner of
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad
and Sudan, have defied the sanctions since the vote.
	   Zimbabwe, along with Angola and Namibia, have sent troops to
back the Congolese government in its fight against rebels supported
by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and has demanded
that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw forces first.
	   ``When America realized that the African continent was moving
toward unity, it created this conspiracy at the heart of the
continent in order to delay this move,'' the Libyan leader said,
according to a JANA news agency report monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
	   ``I urge our African brothers to unite against this conspiracy
which threatens the entire African continent,'' he said.

Hack wins World Cup event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IGLS, Austria (AP) _ Georg Hackl proved he's getting better with
age Sunday. The German, winner of the last three Olympic gold
medals, won the first men's World Cup luge event of the season,
defeating Markus Prock on his rival's home track.
	   Olympic gold medalist in 1992, 1994 and 1998, the 32-year-old
Hackl got off to a first-run lead and held on to defeat Prock,
repeating the scene of his 1997 world title, when he beat out the
Austrian for gold on Prock's home ice.
	   ``A fast start, good position and good driving were the keys to
the first run,'' said Hackl, who hopes to build momentum toward the
1999 World Championships on his home course in Konigsee.
	   Hackl registered times of 49.013 and 49.047 seconds for an
aggregate of 1 minute, 38.060 seconds. Prock, third after one heat
due to a slow start, rebounded with a track-record start in the
final leg to gain the silver in 1:38.178. Teammate Gerhard
Gleirscher, the 1997 World Championship bronze medal winner,
finished third again in 1:38.195.

Gadhafi calls on Africa to oppose U.S. efforts in the Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused the
United States of trying to destabilize central Africa and urged
African countries to unite to frustrate ``this conspiracy,'' the
Libyan news agency reported Sunday.
	   Gadhafi spoke Saturday at a reception for Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, following his arrival in Libya, apparently by plane
in violation of a U.N. air embargo.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban, which
was imposed in 1992 to try to force Libya to hand over for trial
two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad
and Sudan, have defied the sanctions since the vote.
	   Zimbabwe, along with Angola and Namibia, have sent troops to
back the Congolese government in its fight against rebels supported
by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and has demanded
that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw forces first.
	   ``When America realized that the African continent was moving
toward unity, it created this conspiracy at the heart of the
continent in order to delay this move,'' the Libyan leader said,
according to a JANA news agency report monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
	   ``I urge our African brothers to unite against this conspiracy,
which threatens the entire African continent,'' he said.

Jospin calls on leftist majority to stop infighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
called his parliamentary majority to order on Sunday, saying
political infighting was damaging its hold on power.
	   ``We need to stop criticizing ourselves and trying to weaken
each other,'' Jospin said Sunday, speaking at a Socialist Party
meeting on business issues. He added that the bickering was
unnecessarily exposing the majority to attack from the opposition.
	   Jospin's comments were prompted by several days of disputes over
the legacy of the late President Francois Mitterrand, as well as
disagreement over whether to grant residency to thousands of
illegal immigrants.
	   Former Prime Minister Michel Rocard stirred a tempest last week
when he charged that Mitterrand ``was not an honest man.'' The
remarks drew a deluge of condemnation from fellow Socialists and
bitter exchanges over Mitterrand's legacy continued over the
weekend.
	   Leftist politicians have also differed over the question of
illegal immigrants, with members of the Greens Party calling on
Jospin to legalize all of them.
	   The Socialist-led government has legalized the status of some
76,000 illegal immigrants but has rejected residency requested for
more than 64,000 others.
	   Thousands of illegal immigrants marched Saturday in cities
across France, demanding that the government grant them residency
status.

England wins 23-15 to top group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUDDERSFIELD, England (AP) _ A late Will Greenwood try, aided by
a lucky bounce, helped England to a 23-15 victory over Italy in a
World Cup qualifying game and earned the home team the dubious
pleasure of a first game against New Zealand in the finals next
October.
	   A full-strength England team was hanging on at 16-15 with two
minutes to go after the accurate kicking of Diego Dominguez, who
kicked all his team's points, had brought Italy back from 16-6
down. The Italians also had a perfectly good try disallowed because
the officials didn't have a clear view of the ball.
	   With tension building, Greenwood collected the ball and kicked
ahead, over the heads of two Italian defenders. The ball bounced
awkwardly for the Italians but kindly for Greenwood and the England
center ran through to cross the line for the match-clinching try
which guaranteed England top place in its qualifying group.
	   The score brought a huge feeling of relief among the 15,000
English fans at the McAlpine stadium after a disappointing
performance by the home team who were repeatedly hampered by
spoiling tactics of the Italians.
	   Determined to prevent England playing an open game, Italy, which
also had guaranteed qualification for the finals, conceded eight
penalties in the opening 10 minutes and Paul Grayson kicked two of
his first three attemps at goal to open up a 6-0 lead.
	   Argentina-born Dominguez halved England's lead with a close
range penalty after the English forwards were caught out of
position by a quickly-taken penalty by scrum half Alessandro
Troncon.
	   Grayson made it 9-3 with a 35-meter kick after the Italians were
again guilty of spoiling the play with another offside but
Dominguez kicked another penalty from 40 meters.
	   Winger Dan Luger scored the first try after England won a scrum
close to the Italian line. After a strong roll by the forwards,
Luger came inside to join the line and take a short pass from fly
half Grayson, who then kicked the conversion to give England a 16-6
half time lead.
	   Six minutes into the second half, the Italians claimed a try
when Troncon burrowed through a pile of bodies close to the England
line to ground the ball over the line. But the officials couldn't
tell whether it was a score or not and England escaped.
	   Dominguez pulled it back to 16-9 with a 35-meter penalty in the
58th minute from an England offside and then he kicked a drop goal
to take him past New Zealand's Grant Fox in the all-time scoring
list with 647 points, behind only Australia's Michael Lynagh,
Welshman Neil Jenkins and Scotland's Gavin Hastings.
	   It also cut England's lead to four points with 17 minutes left
and Grayson had the English fans groaning when he pulled a
straightforward penalty wide of the posts.
	   Dominguez was just short with a huge angled kick from just short
of the halfway line and, after a spell of Italian pressure just
short of the English line, the home team was penalized again and
the fly half kicked a close range penalty to cut the lead to 16-15
with 10 minutes left.
	   The tension was relieved when Greenwood scored his try two
minutes from the end and Grayson kicked the conversion to complete
the scoring.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ Matt Perry; Dan Luger, Jeremy Guscott, Will Greenwood,
Austin Healey; Paul Grayson, Matt Dawson; Jason Leonard, Richard
Cockerill, Darren Garforth, Martin Johnson, Garath Archer, Ben
Clarke, Martin Corry, Neil Back.
	   Italy _ Matthew Pini; Fabio Roselli, Cristian Stoica, Manuel
Dallan, Luca Martin; Diego Dominguez, Alessandro Troncon; Massimo
Cuttitta, Alessandro Moscardi, Giampiero De Carli, Carlo
Checchinato, Valter Cristofoletto, Massimo Giovanelli, Mauro
Bergamasco, Carlo Caione.

Telecom says it's still working on TV deal with Murdoch, French
</HEADLINE>
company &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN (AP) _ Telecom Italian SpA said Sunday it had yet to close
a deal that would give Rubert Murdoch's group and a French firm
almost half of Telecom's pay-television unit.
	   Murdoch, an Australian-born media magnate, has been angling for
a share in Italy's emerging pay TV market, with an eye on profits
from televising soccer games.
	   Italian newspapers reported Saturday that Murdoch was about to
announce a deal. However, Telecom said Sunday that negotiations
were continuing and no deal had been signed.
	   According to the newspaper reports, the partnership would create
a new company. Telecom would have 51 percent, Murdoch's News
International 39 percent and French broadcaster TF-1 10 percent.
	   Telecom would eventually sell part of its stake, 10 percent to
15 percent, to RAI state television.

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ In Swedish skiing, hailing from the
village of Tarnaby is like a Dominican baseball player coming from
San Pedro de Macoris. Everybody knows what's expected.
	   Anja Paerson is the latest skiing prodigy from the village in
northern Sweden, and the 17-year-old knows a lot of people are
looking for big things from her.
	   ``They were my idols when I was growing up there,'' Paerson said
of her predecessors. ``They are, like, so big at home. Skiing is
such a culture at home.''
	   Ten years after his retirement, Ingemar Stenmark remains the
biggest name in Tarnaby, his 86 victories still by far the most by
any World Cup racer. The town also produced Stig Strand, who shared
the 1983 slalom title with Stenmark, and Bengt Fjallberg, a slalom
medalist behind Stenmark in the 1982 world championships. Each has
a slope on the hometown mountain named after him.
	   ``It's my playground. I was there all the time,'' she said of
the race hill that rises behind her home.
	   Since she was only 7 when Stenmark retired, Paerson had little
opportunity to see him ski. She grew up watching Sweden's current
veteran stars, former World Cup overall champion Pernilla Wiberg
and reigning slalom champion Ylva Nowen.
	   ``They were my idols,'' she said. ``But I also had Ingemar
because he was such a great and big skier. I always looked up to
him and every time I see him I talk with him to get some advice.
Sometimes he'll come up and train with us. He's still a good skier.
He's still fast.''
	   Paerson has already made an impact this season, placing 13th and
sixth in the two giant slaloms contested so far. She was 11th in
Saturday's slalom and ranks seventh in the overall standings.
	   ``I'm comfortable in GS, and slalom is going so well now,'' she
said. ``In a few years, I'm going to try everything'' by adding
downhill and super-G to her portfolio.
	   And all the while, she'll be under intense scrutiny as she looks
to become Swedish skiing's next champion.
	   ``I kind of like that pressure because I can focus more and
more,'' she said. ``I've had this pressure all my life. They tell
me, `You could be the next one.' I'm kind of used to it so I don't
think about it very much. It's like my life; I don't think about it
that much.''

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Leftist activists and proponents of
African unity paid revolutionary tributes on Sunday at the funeral
of Kwame Ture, the 1960s radical who spread the cry of ``Black
Power'' throughout the United States and the world.
	   Ture, who spent nearly his entire adult life preaching socialist
upheaval and changed his name from Stokely Carmichael after he
moved from the United States to Guinea in 1968, died last Sunday of
prostate cancer at age 57.
	   He was memorialized Sunday with a service at the university in
Conakry and was to be buried later in a public cemetery.
	   Although Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan and Ture's first ex-wife, the South African singer Miriam
Makeba had been asked to come, no prominent figures were visible at
the funeral ceremony.
	   Instead, about 400 people _ including Libyan and Cuban diplomats
and an array of former comrades of Ture's activist days in the U.S.
_ assembled in an outdoor pavilion underneath a 50-foot-long mosaic
of a black man breaking manacles on his hands.
	   Ture's coffin lay on a table propping up pictures of Ture and
his self-chosen namesakes, deceased African leaders Ahmed Sekou
Toure and Kwame Nkrumah.
	   The 15-car funeral procession to the funeral was led by an
ambulance with sirens blazing, followed by Ture's own ageing black
and red Deux Chevaux automobile.
	   Speakers paid homage to the deceased man under a banner that
read: ``The CIA gave me cancer. Kwame Ture.'' Ture and his family
had accused the U.S. intelligence service of giving him the disease
that eventually killed him.
	   Ture, who was born in Trinidad but raised in New York, began his
political career began as a college student in the 1960s, helping
to integrate public transportation in the American South as a
freedom rider. He soon became one of the most fiery figures of the
era, popularizing the term ``Black Power'' and changing the way the
once-nonviolent civil rights movement was viewed.
	   He headed the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee, an
important center of leftist activism in the `60s, and later became
the honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers.
	   Angered by the Panthers moves to ally themselves with white
radicals, Carmichael left the group, changed his name and moved to
Guinea in 1968, invited by Guinea's brutal Marxist dictator, Sekou
Toure.
	   Ture quickly became a fringe political figure and a man largely
forgotten except for his `60s activism. He spent the rest of his
life lecturing and writing, preaching black power and championing
socialism while condemning America, capitalism and Zionism.
	   Ismael Ghussein, secretary general of the Guinean Democratic
Party, spoke in his remembrance, saying Ture had dedicated his life
to the people.
	   ``Stokely the fighter, was always in front, beside and behind
the people of Africa in the struggle to take back what was taken
from them,'' Ghussein said.
	   Bob Brown, a longtime friend who was first arrested with Ture
more than 30 years ago and had stayed with him ever since, said
Ture's political aspirations became the center of his life.
	   ``Kwame is a struggler. He struggled all his life, he struggled
until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of the
last day,'' Brown said to loud applause and cheering.
	   ``I know that today my father is very happy, happy because he
will remain in Guinea,'' Ture's son Bocar said.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Sunday that it has given U.N.
monitors all available weapons papers and accused the chief arms
inspector of ``barraging Iraq with demands for imaginary
documents.''
	   The documents have emerged as a new flashpoint in the dispute
between Iraq and the United Nations after Iraq reversed its ban on
the inspectors working in the country and they resumed inspections
last week.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Iraq has given
inspectors of the United Nations and the International Atomic
Energy Agency ``roughly'' 2,188,020 million pages of documents
since the weapons inspections began in 1991.
	   ``We have handed over all, all available documents,'' he said in
an interview with CNN. ``Asking Iraq in this artificial way is a
new tactic in order to put obstacles and create unwarranted
problems.''
	   Asked whether he thought the dispute over documents would lead
to an American and British attack on Iraq, he replied that no
Security Council resolution says Iraq will be attacked if a certain
document is not turned over.
	   ``This is ridiculous,'' he said. ``Whatever party is threatening
that ... will bear the responsibility.''
	   Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said some of the
documents in question are long lost and chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler's insistence on having them was meant to give the
United States and Britain a pretext to mount a military strike on
Iraq.

Gadhafi calls on Africa to oppose U.S. efforts in the Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused the
United States of trying to destabilize central Africa and urged
African countries to unite to frustrate ``this conspiracy,'' the
Libyan news agency reported Sunday.
	   Gadhafi spoke Saturday at a reception for Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, following his arrival in Libya, apparently by plane
in violation of a U.N. air embargo.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the flight ban, which
was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for trial
two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner of
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad
and Sudan, have defied the sanctions since the vote.
	   Zimbabwe, along with Angola and Namibia, have sent troops to
back the Congolese government in its fight against rebels supported
by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and has demanded
that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw forces first.
	   ``When America realized that the African continent was moving
toward unity, it created this conspiracy at the heart of the
continent in order to delay this move,'' the Libyan leader said,
according to a JANA news agency report monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
	   ``I urge our African brothers to unite against this conspiracy
which threatens the entire African continent,'' he said.

IAAF studies `package deal' for four world championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The governing body of track and field
could name the venues of four world outdoor championships in a
single eight-year ``package deal,'' IAAF president Primo Nebiolo
said Sunday.
	   Nebiolo said the International Amateur Athletic Federation was
studying the possibilty of awarding the championships of 2003,
2005, 2007 and 2009 at one time.
	   Nebiolo said the proposed package would also include the venues
for the world indoor championships, the World Cup and other ``most
important events'' during the eight-year time frame.
	   Without giving details, he said the IAAF hoped to work out a
deal with a television company and sponsors to secure the long-term
package.
	   Nebiolo noted that Paris, London, Berlin and Tokyo had all
expressed interest in staging future world championships. Paris and
London have already lined up bids for 2003.
	   Nebiolo's announcement appeared to clear the way for all four
cities to get the championships rather than compete against each
other. In which year each city could get the event was unclear.
	   Last Thursday, the IAAF awarded the 2001 world championships to
Edmonton, Canada, the first ever North American venue for the
IAAF's premier event.
	   Previous championships have been held in Helsinki (1983), Rome
(1987), Tokyo (1991), Stuttgart (1993), Goteborg (1995) and Athens
(1997). The 1999 worlds will be in Seville, Spain.
	   The proposed IAAF package deal would follow a similar pattern
set by the International Olympic Committee, which awarded NBC the
U.S. television rights to five Olympic Games from 2000 to 2008.
However, the IOC deal did not involve pre-selection of the venues.
	   On another issue, Nebiolo warned athletes against setting up an
association to challenge the leadership of the IAAF.
	   American sprinter Jon Drummond has sounded out athletes about
setting up their own association to assert more power in the
running of the sport.
	   ``We are living in a democratic world,'' Nebiolo said. ``People
can create associations, companies or groups if they want. But we
will not lose our control. We control athletics completely.
	   ``Tennis players created an association (the ATP) and they
control their sport. This will never happen in athletics. The
leaders are the leaders. The athletes are the athletes. The coaches
are the coaches.''

Free State on verge of victory against West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with close of play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Free State has just 26 more
runs to score to steal an improbable victory over the touring West
Indians after a dramatic third day Sunday of their four-day
encounter at Springbok Park.
	   This is the final warmup match for the West Indies before the
first of a five-test series starts in Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   Earlier in the day, the expected West Indies batting practice
was spoiled
	   by young Johan van der Wath as they scored just 188. Van der
Wath took a career-best five for 26 in his debut first class match.
	   Now, he is at the crease with the national captain, Hansie
Cronje, who has helped lead the home team to the brink of a triumph
which seemed extremely remote at the start of play. Cronje will
return to the crease Monday morning undefeated on 147, after
scoring his century in just 108 balls during speedy innings which
included 11 fours and three sixes.
	   If some of the middle order had not given their wickets away
with some injudicious stroke-selection, Free State might be sitting
even prettier than they are now.
	   It was a day the West Indies bowlers will prefer to forget, as
they were carved apart by a young team determined to make amends
for their dismal first innings of just 67.
	   Monday's play sees the tourists needing two wickets to win, but
they are up against a typically belligerent Cronje. If Monday goes
free State's Way, the West Indies players will have a
morale-sapping defeat to take to Johannesburg, rather than the
expected comfortable victory.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, a peasant party
activist who became the speaker of Poland's first post-communist
parliament, has died. He was 75.
	   Kozakiewicz died after a six-month illness Sunday in a hospital,
PAP news agency reported. The cause of death was not disclosed.
	   Kozakiewicz was a prominent activist of a Peasant Party, a
satellite party of Communists, and became a member of parliament in
1985. After the 1989 partly-democratic elections which opened a way
to democracy in Poland, he became speaker of the Sejm, the more
powerful parliament chamber. He was speaker until the 1991
elections.
	   Kozakiewicz had his own opinions but was always willing to
listen to others and ``that is why I have a positive opinion of
him,'' said Lech Walesa, former president and leader of Solidarity,
the independent trade union which toppled communism.
	   Kozakiewicz received a degree in sociology from Warsaw
University, and became a teacher after graduating. In 1984, he
received a professorship. He was also a sexologist, promoting
contraception in predominantly Roman Catholic Poland.
	   Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

Police: Ten members of Doomsday cult have arrived in Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ten members of a missing Colorado doomsday cult
feared to be planning a mass suicide are in Israel, a police
official said Sunday.
	   Cult watchers have warned that members of the Concerned
Christians might head to Israel on instruction from their leader
Monte Kim Miller. Miller has said he will die in Jerusalem in
December 1999 and will be resurrected three days later.
	   But the Jerusalem police, which established a special task force
to prepare for the influx of pilgrims during the millennium, said
the group does not appear to pose a threat to themselves or others
at this stage.
	   ``It's not so clear what they want to do. Their ideas have not
crystallized,'' said a police official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The official added the group had the ``belief that the
world will disappear,'' and police were ``keeping an eye on them.''
	   As many as 72 followers of Miller sold their belongings and left
their homes in the United States before Oct. 10, the day their
leader predicted Denver would be wiped out by an earthquake marking
the beginning of the apocalypse.
	   Israeli foreign ministry officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Israel was concerned about the Denver group and has
been trying to keep tabs on doomsday seekers who may be drawn to
the Holy Land for the millennium.

Hungarian prime minister says his nation will be ready to join the

EU by 2002 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says his
country will meet all requirments to join the European Union by
2002 and hopes to become a full member quickly thereafter, a
newspaper said Sunday.
	   The Berlin-based Die Welt daily, quoted Orban as saying that any
delay of Hungary joining the EU would be caused the by the
policitical will of the union.
	   In an early release of a report that appears in the newspaper's
Monday editions, Die Welt said that Orban acknowledged that Hungary
still had some weaknesses to overcome, including ``corruption and
the insufficient ability of the state to enforce the law.''
	   The report said that during a two-day visit to Germany, Orban
got assurances from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany's
support for Hungary's entry into the EU.
	   He and Schroeder also agreed to jointly acknowledge the 10th
anniversary of the opening of Hungary's borders for East Germans in
September 1999, the report said.
	   Hungary's decision to open the borders in 1989 led to a flood of
East Germans fleeing to the West, and eventually the fall of
communist borders and the Berlin Wall in a peaceful revolution that
changed the face of Europe.
	   On Nov. 10. Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Slovenia and Cyprus began negotiations with the EU prepatory to
eventual membership.

Iraq says it has no new documents for U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with foreign minister saying all documents
have already been handed over. EDITS throughout &QL;

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Sunday that it has given U.N.
monitors all available weapons papers and accused the chief arms
inspector of ``barraging Iraq with demands for imaginary
documents.''
	   The documents have emerged as a new flashpoint in the dispute
between Iraq and the United Nations after Iraq seemed to have eased
the dispute by allowing weapons inspectors to resume their work
last week.
	   Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Iraq has given
inspectors of the United Nations and the International Atomic
Energy Agency ``roughly'' 2,188,020 million pages of documents
since the weapons inspections began in 1991.
	   ``We have handed over all, all available documents,'' he said at
a news conference. ``Asking Iraq in this artificial way is a new
tactic in order to put obstacles and create unwarranted problems.''
	   The inspectors are working to certify whether Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before U.N. Security
Council sanctions on the country can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
the free export of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraq
insists it has met the Security Council's requirements, but the
inspectors charge it has not come clean about its weapons programs.
	   Iraq had cut off all dealings with the inspectors in two steps
during August and October, but it rescinded both decisions Nov. 14,
barely averting military strikes by the United Sates and Britain.
	   Asked whether he thought the new dispute over documents would
lead to an American and British attack on Iraq, al-Sahhaf replied
that no Security Council resolution says Iraq will be attacked if a
certain document is not turned over.
	   ``This is ridiculous,'' he said. ``Whatever party is threatening
that ... will bear the responsibility.''
	   Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said some of the
documents in question were long lost and accused chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler of asking ``for access to all the archives
of the government of Iraq.''
	   Aziz also said Butler was attempting to undermine the
comprehensive review of the sanctions the Security Council has
pledged to undertake once the inspectors declare that Baghdad is in
full compliance with their demands.
	   Asked if Butler's demands could lead to a military strike, Aziz
said: ``He's either creating a superficial pretext to justify the
American aggressions or he is trying to confuse and undermine the
comprehensive review.''
	   The official Iraqi News Agency published the letters that Iraq's
Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi sent to Butler in reply to
his demand for documents.
	   In them, al-Qaisi makes clear for the first time that an air
force log sought by Butler contains an inventory of chemical
ordnance the Iraqi army used during 1983-1988.
	   He told Butler that Iraq only will show his inspectors ``the
relevant parts'' of the document, which he said was handwritten by
a noncommissioned officer.
	   Al-Qaisi also said Butler has asked for the records of the
Ministry of Defense, the Military Industrialization Commission and
other government bodies, which he did not name.
	   He gave a list of the visits the inspectors have made to these
establishments, including offices of Iraq's General Intelligence
and the General Directorate of Security.
	   ``These were intrusive inspections which continued for long
hours.... This demand, coming at this particular time, is more of a
provocative nature than professional,'' al-Qaisi said.
	   Al-Qaisi said Butler was asking for diaries of high-ranking
Iraqi army officers. He said these diaries were either destroyed or
had already been given to the inspectors and were no longer in
Iraq's possession.
	   Al-Qaisi revealed for the first time that the orders to destroy
some of Iraq's illegal weapons and some related documents were
verbally given by Aziz himself.
	   Iraq's scrapping of these weapons and documents has complicated
the work of U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq since they are seeking
verification that the weapons were indeed destroyed.
	   Despite mounting tension over documents, the inspectors have
been visiting suspected sites with no obstruction from Iraqi
authorities.
	   They made their first surprise visit to a suspected arms-making
facility Saturday. They also went into the field Sunday, but their
spokeswoman, Caroline Cross, would not reveal the number of teams
or places they would visit.

Free State on verge of victory against West Indies

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with close of play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Free State has just 26 more
runs to score to steal an improbable victory over the touring West
Indians after a dramatic third day Sunday of their four-day
encounter at Springbok Park.
	   This is the final warmup match for the West Indies before the
first of a five-test series starts in Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   Earlier in the day, the expected West Indies batting practice
was spoiled
	   by young Johan van der Wath as they scored just 188. Van der
Wath took a career-best five for 26 in his debut first class match.
	   Now, he is at the crease with the national captain, Hansie
Cronje, who has helped lead the home team to the brink of a triumph
which seemed extremely remote at the start of play. Cronje will
return to the crease Monday morning undefeated on 147, after
scoring his century in just 108 balls during speedy innings which
included 11 fours and three sixes.
	   If some of the middle order had not given their wickets away
with some injudicious stroke-selection, Free State might be sitting
even prettier than they are now.
	   It was a day the West Indies bowlers will prefer to forget, as
they were carved apart by a young team determined to make amends
for their dismal first innings of just 67.
	   Monday's play sees the tourists needing two wickets to win, but
they are up against a typically belligerent Cronje. If Monday goes
free State's Way, the West Indies players will have a
morale-sapping defeat to take to Johannesburg, rather than the
expected comfortable victory.

	   ROME (AP) _ Snow capped the island of Capri and Naples' Mount
Vesuvius on Sunday, brought on by a cold snap that hit parts of
Italy with some of the most biting chill in 10 years.
	   Heavy snow also fell in Italy's northern mountains, compounding
the suffering of hundreds still living in temporary housing after
losing their homes in last year's devastating earthquake in the
Umbria and Marche regions.
	   Sporadic blackouts meant some of the people of the trailer camps
did without heat or lights during the worst of the cold Saturday.
	   ``We are alone, abandoned _ no one remembers us,'' Italy's Il
Tempo newspaper quoted one woman as yelling at reporters visiting
embittered residents of the trailer camps, where snow was shin-high
and the wind blew flakes in blustering gusts.
	   Temperatures fell as low as -4 degrees Farenheit at Livigno in
far northern Italy. It was 23 degrees in Turin in the northwest
region of Piedmont, the coldest weather there since 1988, and 35
degrees in Rome, which escaped the snowfall.
	   The snow was the first in 10 years for the usually sunny
southern island of Capri. Onshore, up to 16 inches covered Mount
Vesuvius and surrounding peaks.

Israeli warplanes strike guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah saying guerrilla killed Friday in new
grafs 7-8

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Sunday, security officials
said.
	   One Israeli jet fired an air-to-surface missile on a valley
between the Shiite Muslim villages of Zibqine and Jibal al-Boutoum,
the Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The valley, near the southern port of Tyre, is believed to be
used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen occupying a border
enclave in south Lebanon.
	   There was no word on casualties from the 7.30 a.m. (5:30 GMT)
airstrike, the latest in a series of raids by Israeli warplanes on
suspected bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid,
saying warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon.
Israel routinely uses the word ``terrorist'' to describe the
guerrillas fighting its occupation of south Lebanon.
	   On Friday, Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked suspected
guerrilla hideouts, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of Tyre,
following a series of clashes in the south that reportedly left
four guerrillas dead.
	   Hezbollah on Sunday issued a statement announcing the death of
one of its fighters, Ghassan Zaatar, 26, in Friday's clashes.
	   The three other dead guerrillas reportedly belonged to the
Syrian-backed Amal group.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8. None of the raids resulted in
casualties.
	   The air raids come at a time of heightened tension in south
Lebanon. On Monday, a Hezbollah roadside bomb killed three Israeli
soldiers and wounded four others, two seriously. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone which Israel set up in 1985. It maintains the
occupation is necessary to shield its northern towns against
cross-border attacks.

Roma player admits he fell down to gain key penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Give Francesco Totti credit for being frank, if not
for sportsmanship.
	   The AS Roma captain admitted Sunday that he fell to the ground
on purpose to draw a penalty whistle from the referee in his club's
1-1 Serie A home draw with Bari the day before.
	   Referee Livio Bazzoli called the foul when Totti, who made his
debut start for Italy's national team last week, went down just
inside the penalty area after light contact with Bari's Moroccan
defender Rachid Neqrouz with nine minutes left.
	   Roma was trailing 1-0 at the time.
	   ``I was ahead of Neqrouz and as soon as I felt contact I threw
myself to the ground,'' Totti said. ``The referee could have given
the penalty or let the action continue. Maybe the fact that we were
losing had an influence.''
	   The striker slotted in the spot kick for his fifth goal of the
season, while several Bari players argued the call.
	   Roma has a 5-3-2 record for 18 points, three behind Italian
League leader Fiorentina.

In crime-weary Russia, politician's death strikes a nerve
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be
mundane. Two thugs, armed with machine pistols and silencers,
stalked and killed a powerful figure, then slipped away into the
night. Police vowed to catch them and politicians expressed
outrage.
	   Usually, that would be the end of the story.
	   This time, though, the figure shot was one of the most prominent
and popular women in Russian politics, a prospective presidential
candidate with friends in the highest reaches of the Kremlin.
	   As outrage mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of
Galina Starovoitova was not going to be treated as a routine crime,
and some said it might turn out to be a watershed event in Russian
politics.
	   ``This is impossible to tolerate any longer,'' said Grigory
Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, another reform-oriented party.
``We must stop feeling powerless before the increasingly cheeky
scum. We cannot go on living as though everything is running as
usual.''
	   Starovoitova, a member of parliament and a leader of the liberal
Russia's Democratic Choice party, was walking up the stairs of her
apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young aide Friday
evening. A team of assailants _ police believe it was a man and a
woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire.
	   Starovoitova, shot three times in the head, collapsed and died
instantly, authorities said. The aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov,
was critically wounded, but managed to telephone a news agency
reporter before losing consciousness.
	   Police have recovered two guns, and are hoping that Linkov can
provide a description of the killers. He had regained consciousness
but still could not speak Sunday.
	   Although it was still not clear who killed Starovoitova or why,
the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract hit _ a
remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. Most of the killings
involve business deals and the corruption that has swamped the
government and the economy.
	   Until now, the most notorious of the killings was that of
popular television host Vladislav Litsyev, who was shot outside his
Moscow home in 1995. But there have been hundreds of others.
	   St. Petersburg has been especially plagued. Last year, the
city's deputy governor was gunned down on a central St. Petersburg
street. In the past two months alone, hitmen have claimed the lives
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.
	   So deeply has the toxin infected Russian society that President
Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that
his Federal Security Service _ the domestic successor to the KGB _
had ordered the death of Boris Berezovsky, the nation's most
prominent businessman and the head of the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
	   There is no indication that anyone attempted to carry out an
assassination of Berezovsky. But Yeltsin's order was the equivalent
of U.S. President Bill Clinton ordering an investigation into
whether the FBI was plotting to kill Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
	   Yet, as remarkable as that news was, it has been vastly
overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova. Television news since
her death has carried reports of little else. Reaction has poured
in from virtually every important figure in the country, and from
surrounding nations.
	   Yeltsin, calling her ``my comrade,'' declared that he would
personally oversee the investigation into her death.
	   There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, the
sense that a line had been crossed. Perhaps it was because she was
a woman, perhaps because she elicited impassioned support, or
perhaps because people are simply fed up.
	   But, in more characteristic fashion, her death also led to a
round of political finger-pointing.
	   Colleagues of Starovoitova declared _ without any apparent
evidence _ that her Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, were the most likely culprits in her death.
	   Historian Dmitry Likachyov, one of the nation's most revered and
trusted figures, said her killing seemed to signal the ``outburst
of a new Red Terror.''
	   By late Saturday, the name-calling had gone so far that Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin called a news conference to say there was
no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady
Seleznyov, was involved in the killing.
	   Seleznyov went on television to say he was saddened by her
death. ``But,'' he added, ``I would not like the deputies who sat
on the same bench with Galina Starovoitova in the State Duma ... to
turn this into a political show.''
	   It is too early to know where the recriminations and political
maneuvering will lead. For now, the only thing certain is the
Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian
martyrs.

Israeli warplanes strike guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Sunday, security officials
said.
	   One Israeli jet fired an air-to-surface missile on a valley
between the Shiite Muslim villages of Zibqine and Jibal al-Boutoum,
the Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The valley, near the southern port of Tyre, is believed to be
used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a base to launch attacks on Israeli
troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen occupying a border
enclave in south Lebanon.
	   There was no word on casualties from the 7.30 a.m. (5:30 GMT)
airstrike, the latest in a series of raids by Israeli warplanes on
suspected bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid,
saying warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in south Lebanon.
Israel routinely uses the word ``terrorist'' to describe the
guerrillas fighting its occupation of south Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 allied militiamen
from the zone that Israel set up in 1985. It maintains the
occupation is necessary to shield its northern towns against
cross-border attacks.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed
early Sunday in a shootout in an entertainment district of Bogota,
authorities said.
	   The agent, Frank Arnold Moreno, was killed outside a bar in the
city's so-called Pink Zone at 84th street, officials said.
	   U.S. officials and Colombian police offered no further details
about the killing, which occurred about 1 a.m., according to a
short statement released by the U.S. Embassy
	   ``At this point I have nothing at all about the circumstances,''
said DEA chief spokesman Van Quarles in Washington. He said he also
did not have information about Moreno's age, hometown or duties
with the agency.
	   The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's
leading producer and exporter of cocaine.

AEK beats Ionikos, retains second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Christos Maladenis scored one goal and
Nikos Kostenoglou added another to give AEK a 2-1 victory over
Ionikos Nikea at home Sunday in a game for the 10th round of the
Greek first division soccer league.
	   With its win, AEK retained second place in the standings with 23
points, two behind crosstown Panathinaikos.
	   Provincial club Xanthi, which drew 1-1 against Kavala, follows
in third place with 20 points. Olympiakos Piraeus is one point
behind in fourth place but with one match in hand.
	   Contrary to Panathinaikos which beat Iraklis 3-2, Olympiakos
lost 1-0 to Aris in Salonica. It was the defending champions'
second loss of the season.
	   Both Panathinaikos and Olympiakos played Saturday because of
their Champions League games Wednesday.
	   AEK had the upper hand in the first half. Ionikos controlled
play in the second period but its players could not score.
	   Striker Demis Nikolaidis, face-to-face with goalminder Vangelis
Pourliotopoulos, shot wide in the 5th minute.
	   In the 15th, Nikolaidis hit the crossbar, but Maladenis gained
the rebound to give AEK a 1-0 lead.
	   Kostenoglou made the score 2-0 with a shot in the 22nd and
Brazilian striker Paulo Andrioli converted a penalty to narrow the
gap in the 33rd.
	   Pourliotopoulos denied an increase of the score on two
occasions, including a penalty kick taken by Nikolaidis.
	   The visitors' major scoring opportunity was missed by Nikos
Froussos in the 66th, when he shot over the crossbar with goalie
Ilias Atmatzidis beaten.
	   On Saturday, Aris and Olympiakos displayed an unexciting and
dull first half. The hosts were more vigorous and aggressive losing
two major scoring opportunities.
	   The first in the 20th, when Michalis Panopoulos failed to beat
goalie Dimitris Eleftheropoulos from three meters (yards). The
22-year-old goaltender stopped the ball with an outstretched leg.
	   Five minutes later, Apostolos Liolidis' header in front of the
Olympiakos goalmouth sailed over the crossbar.
	   Seven minutes into the second half, Liolidis received a perfect
pass from Antonio Flores, pierced through the Olympiakos defense to
mark the game's only goal.
	   Olympiakos came close to level eight minutes before the end of
the hard-fought game, but Grigoris Georgatos' thundering free-kick
from 30 meters (yards) hit goalkeeper Jozef Wandzik's crossbar.
	   Panathinaikos won the match against Iraklis 3-2, but its
performance did not satisfy the 5,000 spectators at the Athens
Olympic stadium.
	   A series of defensive mistakes enabled Iraklis to score twice
and threaten to level when the visitors pressed hard in the last
minutes.
	   ``Such mistakes are not allowed by Panathinaikos,'' the club's
coach Vassilis Daniel told reporters.
	   Panathinaikos took an early lead with Croatian star Aljosa
Asanovic who curled in a left-footed free-kick from outside the
area in the 2nd minute.
	   The hosts made the score 2-0 with an own goal by Michalis
Constantinou off a corner taken by Asanovic.
	   Although Ivan Jovanovic was surrounded by four Panathinaikos
players in the hosts' area, he managed to narrow the difference in
the 36th.
	   In the 52nd, Constantinou exploited a defensive error to make
the final 3-2.

French star Keller strikes as Hammers win 2-0 at Derby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DERBY, England (AP) _ French midfielder Marc Keller fired a
spectacular 20-meter shot into the roof of the net as West Ham
scored a 2-0 victory at Derby County Sunday to move up to sixth in
the Premier League and within five points of leader Aston Villa.
	   John Hartson side-footed the first in the seventh minute after a
low pass from Israeli midfielder Eyal Berkjovic had found him
unmarked inside the Derby area.
	   And Berkovic had a big say in the second goal 18 minutes from
the end, picking out Keller with another pass from the right and
the Frenchman powered the ball home with a rising shot that flew
into the top corner for his first goal in Hammers colors.
	   West Ham goalkeeper Shaka Hislop made an acrobatic one-handed
save to keep out a header from Spencer Prior but Jim Smith's team
created few other chances to worry a Hammers team which has gained
10 points from their last four games.
	   Harry Redknapp's team now is tied on points with fourth place
Chelsea, which scored a 4-2 win at Leicester Saturday and, Leeds,
which downed Charlton 4-1. Now all three teams are closing on the
top three, who all lost.
	   Villa went down 4-2 at home to Liverpool with Robbie Fowler
scoring three times and Manchester United tumbled 3-1 at Sheffield
Wednesday. Third place Arsenal was beaten 1-0 at Wimbledon, where
injuries to Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Vieira added to the Gunners
problems ahead of Wednesday's Champions Cup game against French
club Lens.
	   Saturday's result also led to the resignation of Roy Hodgson as
Blackburn slipped to last place following a 2-0 loss at home to
Southampton.
	   In division one, Wolves overturned an early deficit to beat
local rival Birmingham 3-1 and climb five places to fifth.
Managerless Wolves is still eight points behind leader Sunderland,
which lost for the first time on Saturday, 3-2 at home to Barnsley.

Congo leader opens European trip that includes visit with pope
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Congo President Laurent Kabila opened his first
official European visit since taking power last year, coming to
Italy on Sunday for a 3-day stop that will include a meeting with
Pope John Paul II.
	   Kabila is moving to boost international credibility of his
government, which is fighting a 3-month-old war against rebels
backed by some of Congo's neighbors.
	   ``We are going to meet with men of the world to relate to them
Congo's experiences,'' he told reporters before flying out of the
Congo capital of Kinshasa on Sunday morning.
	   Kabila is headed to a French-African summit in Paris on
Thursday.
	   In Italy, he meets Tuesday with the pope and Italian President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The Roman Catholic Church's Sant' Egidio
community is trying to arrange peace talks between Kabila and the
rebels, as it has managed in other conflicts worldwide. Kabila has
ruled out talks with rebels.
	   Kabila came to power in May 1997 after leading a rebellion that
overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He now is confronted by a
force composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians who accuse Kabila of corruption,
mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.

Iranian opposition figure, wife knifed to death in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Dariush Foruhar, an opposition figure and
former labor minister, was stabbed to death Sunday along with his
wife at their Tehran home, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   It was not clear who killed Foruhar and his wife or what their
motive may have been, the agency said. It said police were
investigating the deaths.
	   Foruhar was the leader of the People's Party of Iran, a small
opposition group in Iran that is tolerated by the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.

Door open for Sainz to win title as Makinen skids out of race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated after end of day's racing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Championship leader Tommy Makinen
handed rival Carlos Sainz a big chance to take the world title in
the final race of the season Sunday when he skidded out on day one
of the Network Q rally of Britain.
	   The Finn, who led the Spaniard by two points going into the
three-day race around England and Wales, skidded on a patch of oil
on stage five, hit a concrete barrier and the impact ripped the
right rear wheel from his Mitsubishi Lancer.
	   Forced the drop out of the race, Makinen, who was aiming for a
third world title in a row, was left to wait to see how Sainz
performed. The Spaniard, driving a Toyota Corolla, needed to finish
fourth or higher to take the world title for the third time
although first since 1992.
	   Makinen was convinced he had thrown the title away.
	   ``It happened on the first left-hand bend. There was black stuff
on the surface and it just threw me completely,'' the Finn said of
the accident. ``I am very upset, I have thrown the championship
away.''
	   After 11 of the 14 stages on day one, Sainz placed second to
another for world titlist, Colin McRae, who led the Spaniard by 4.6
seconds in a Subaru Impreza.

Rose needs low scoring final round to earn card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Justin Rose bogeyed three of the last
four holes for a 74 in European Tour qualifying Sunday and now
needs something like a 69 por 70 in Monday's final round if he is
to win his card next season.
	   Star of this year's British Open, when, as an amateur, he tied
for fourth, 18-year-old Rose has failed to earn a single penny as a
pro, missing the cut all eight times.
	   In the six-round qualifying competition, Rose has improved
steadily from 131st to 58th and Sunday's round, which finished
bogey, bogey, bogey, birdie, moved him up to 51st with a 6-over,
five round total of 366.
	   But he needs to improve again Sunday to be among the 35 and ties
to earn a card.
	   ``I like to keep everyone in suspense,'' the teen-ager said
after his 74.
	   Rose is 17 strokes behind Sweden's Henrik Nystrom, who took over
at the top of the leaderboard from Scotland's Ross Drummond by
scoring a 68 and now is four strokes ahead of the field on 349.
Drummond carded a 74 and is tied for second with Italy's Marcello
Santi, whose 69 gave him a total of 353.

Tense Central African Republic goes to legislative polls

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Streams of people braved
fears of ethnic violence on Sunday to vote in the first round of
legislative elections in the troubled Central African Republic.
	   United Nations peacekeepers and government soldiers cruised the
streets and guarded polling stations in the capital of Bangui,
where there were no reports of fighting.
	   More than 840 candidates are vying for 109 parliamentary seats,
the vast majority of which are now controlled by President
Ange-Felix Patasse's ruling Movement for the Liberation of the
People of Centrafrique, or MLPC.
	   At least 23 opposition parties are putting up candidates, many
chosen on ethnic lines _ a move that threatens to exacerbate
tensions in the country.
	   An estimated 70 percent of registered voters turned out for the
poll, according to the National Electoral Commission which said it
expected initial results on Tuesday.
	   A second round is expected to be held in December.
	   Voting began late in many polling stations as a result of lack
of election materials. Electoral commission officials said polling
would continue into the night in some stations to compensate for
the delay although a number of voting points had closed by
nightfall.
	   Throughout the day, thousands lined up patiently in the streets
at voting points in the capital that were without voting cards
until at least noon. Other rural villages were hampered by the lack
of supervisors or international observers, electoral officials
said.
	   The vote went ahead despite Patasse's bid to postpone it amid
growing concerns of ethnic fighting or insurrection by the
military.
	   At least five people have been killed in recent weeks of
pre-election violence that authorities say was linked to ethnic
rivalries.
	   Elections officials have conceded that voting preparations were
incomplete in many areas and proper equipment and ballots had not
been in place in some cases.
	   Through the 1960s and '70s, the Central African Republic fell
under the tyrannical rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel Bokassa,
who was accused of corruption murder, torture and cannibalism
before being ousted in a bloodless 1979 coup.
	   In his wake, the Central African Republic remains a troubled and
isolated country that at times appears to be teetering on anarchy.
Armed bandits frequently attack motorists and rival factions fight
for territory. The country lacks even basic services and is one of
the world's poorest.
	   Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against Patasse, whose election win in 1993 ended more
than a decade of army rule.
	   For years, French troops helped maintain a semblance of
stability until they pulled out earlier this year. A United Nations
peacekeeping force replaced the French.
	   Independent from French colonial rule since 1960, the Central
African Republic has lurched from one crisis to the next for much
of that time.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed
early Sunday in an upscale entertainment district of Bogota,
authorities said.
	   Frank Arnold Moreno was shot once in the chest outside a bar in
the city's the so-called Zona Rosa about 1 a.m., officials said.
	   Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about a year, was not with
any other Drug Enforcement Administration agents at the time, said
a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Moreno was in his early 30s and had previously been assigned to
Oklahoma City, the official said.
	   The bullet went through Moreno's chest, the official said.
``Everyone is working really hard investigating it.''
	   The official would not say whether Moreno was involved in an
undercover drug investigation at the time of the killing, which
occurred in a neighborhood of restaurants, bars and discotheques
that is packed with people well after midnight on weekends.
	   DEA chief spokesman Van Quarles in Washington said he did not
have information about Moreno's age, hometown or duties with the
agency.
	   The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's
leading producer and exporter of cocaine.

Jagge leads snowy first run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Finn Christian Jagge, the 1992 Olympic
champion, took advantage of an early start number to lead the first
run of men's World Cup slalom on Sunday.
	   After three days of sunny weather, the Park City Mountain Resort
was caught in a snowstorm Sunday and it only got worse as the first
run progressed.
	   Jagge, 32, started second and placed first in 50.26 seconds, .18
faster than the day's No. 1 starter, Jure Kosir of Slovenia.
Olympic champion Hans-Petter Buraas led another trio of Norwegians
in third, .22 seconds behind.
	   Ole Kristian Furuseth, second behind Buraas in the 1998 Olympics
at Nagano, Japan, was fourth in 50.91, .01 faster than 1994 World
Cup overall champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Six Norwegians started in the top 16 and four cracked the top
five, with 1996 overall champion Lasse Kjus, the 16th racer, taking
12th, 1.57 behind.
	   Christian Mayer of Austria was sixth in 50.99, followed by
Germany's Markus Eberle in 51.34.
	   Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, runner-up the last two years to
teammate Thomas Sykora in the World Cup slalom standings, was
eighth in 51.48. Sykora didn't start because of a bruised knee.
	   Sebastian Amiez of France was ninth in 51.50 and Austria's
Olympic combined champion, Mario Reiter, rounded out the top 10 in
51.53, sharing the position with Canada's Thomas Grandi.
	   Grandi was the only North American to crack the top 30 and
qualify for the second run.

Albania referendum on draft Constitution calm as opposition boycott
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh comments from OSCE, opposition leader
disputing referendum, latest turnout results. Results expected
Monday at 1700 GMT. Daan correct in 14th graf, spokesman correct
for Andrea Agnelli.
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians voted in drizzling rain Sunday
in a controversial but peaceful referendum meant to give Europe's
poorest country its first post-communist Constitution.
	   Foreign election observers and national media reported almost no
referendum-related violence in this Balkan nation where gunfire and
intimidation have marked past elections.
	   Albania's Central Election Commission said about 46 per cent of
nearly two million eligible voters cast their ballots by 5 p.m.
(1600 GMT) _ two hours before polling stations closed _ despite a
nationwide boycott called by powerful opposition leaders. Polls
opened at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) Sunday.
	   The commission had no preliminary results on how many voted for
or against the proposed Constitution but most who voted were
expected to approve it.
	   ``The whole referendum was pretty quiet, even though everybody
kept saying that bad things would happen,'' said Andrea Angeli,
spokesman for the observer mission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. ``There was just one incident that was
apparently related to the referendum.''
	   He said unknown assailants Saturday night used explosives to
damage a polling station near the northern town of Bajram Curri but
nobody was injured.
	   Final referendum results are expected only late Monday after the
referendum authorities fly ballots in from remote regions by
helicopter and pass northern roads blocked by recent snowfalls.
	   The OSCE, which has 200 observers nationwide with police
protection, will release its report card on the election process
also Monday.
	   Voter turnout is key to the referendum which, boycotted by the
opposition, could give Albania its framework for human, civil and
democratic rights.
	   Opposition Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, who played a
key role in antigovernment unrest in September, disputed the
election committee's turnout figures and declared the draft
Constitution ``a dead body'' due to low participation. He said no
more than 31 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots.
	   ``The Albanians turned down the proposal of the most corrupted
government in Europe,'' said Berisha in a press conference an hour
after polls closed.
	   Albanian government officials weren't expected to comment until
final counts are in.
	   Violence has flared in past voting mostly as separate factions
squared off outside polling booths. But the boycott kept most
opposition supporters away from the booths Sunday.
	   Daan Everts, the head of the OSCE mission to Albania, said
before the voting that a turnout of 40 per cent to 50 per cent
would likely be seen as reasonable, given the boycott call.
	   The draft would give citizens the right to legally change their
religion and to identify themselves as members of an ethnic
minority. It would also define property rights and allow the
government to expropriate land deemed of national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while working in richer,
non-Muslim neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, a 56-year-old teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb.
``Hope is the only thing that we can really do.''
	   Snow also closed four roads in northern Albania and slowed, or
halted voting in some areas. And moderate rainfall dampened voters
Sunday throughout most of the country.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
Tirana suburb, said the Constitution will help boost prosperity in
Europe's poorest nation.
	   ``I came from my apartment where there was no electricity and
walked on an unpaved road like all Albanians _ looking reality in
the eye,'' said Majko, as electricity failed in his polling station
as well. ``I voted for the future.''
	   Army sharpshooters surveyed his polling booth from the roofs of
nearby apartment buildings and motorcycle police throughout Tirana
searched cars with license plates from outside of Tirana.
	   Fearing low turnout, the government recently scrapped a law
requiring a referendum to be voted on by more than 50 percent of
eligible voters.

	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Leftist activists and proponents of
African unity paid revolutionary tributes Sunday at the funeral of
Kwame Ture, the 1960s radical who under his original name Stokely
Carmichael spread the cry of ``Black Power'' throughout the United
States and the world.
	   Ture, one of the most prominent figures of the civil rights
movement and a man whose shifting politics took him from the
non-violence of the freedom riders to angry calls for armed revolt
and eventually to pan-African unity, died last Sunday of prostate
cancer at age 57.
	   He had spent nearly his entire adult life preaching socialist
upheaval, living for what he called ``the movement'' long after he
had become a fringe figure and his radical contemporaries had
abandoned the cause.
	   ``Kwame is a struggler. He struggled all his life, he struggled
until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of the
last day,'' Bob Brown, a longtime Ture friend told about 400
cheering people at a memorial service at Conakry's Gamal Abdel
Nasser University.
	   Speakers, some aging radicals in graying dreadlocks, paid homage
to Ture under a banner that read: ``The CIA gave me cancer. Kwame
Ture.''
	   Conrad Worrill, chairman of the U.S.-based Black United Front,
praised Ture for his early efforts at fostering pride in African
heritage.
	   ``Kwame Ture made us realize we were no longer just negroes, we
were African. We now know that even if we were born American, we
are all African,'' he said, ending his speech with Ture's own
motto: ``Ready for the revolution!''
	   Leftist rhetoric inundated the memorial, with Guinean
politicians and American activists invoking the rallying cries of
the 1960s. Again and again they decried imperialism, capitalism and
reactionary politics and praised the socialist vanguard fighting
for the revolution.
	   ``We send our revolutionary condolences to the family of comrade
Kwame Ture,'' Macheo Shabaka, a member of Ture's All-African
People's Revolutionary Party, said in a typical statement.
	   Although Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan and Ture's first ex-wife, the South African singer Miriam
Makeba had been asked to come, no such highly prominent figures
attended.
	   Instead, about 400 people _ including Libyan and Cuban diplomats
and an array of former comrades of Ture's activist days _ assembled
in an outdoor pavilion.
	   Ture's wooden coffin lay on a table, upon which hung a large
photograph of himself flanked by pictures of his self-chosen
namesakes, Guinea's Sekou Toure and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah.
	   Later, he was buried in a public cemetery. His 17-year-old son,
Bocar, sobbed as the red clay was shoveled onto the coffin.
	   ``I know that today my father is very happy, happy because he
will remain in Guinea,'' the teen-aged boy had said earlier at the
memorial.
	   Ture began his political career began as a college student in
the 1960s, helping integrate public transportation in the American
South as a freedom rider. He soon became one of the most fiery
figures of the era, popularizing the term ``Black Power'' and
changing the way the once-nonviolent civil rights movement was
viewed.
	   He headed the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee, an
important center of activism and the civil rights movement, and
later became honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers.
	   Angered by Panther moves to ally with white radicals, Carmichael
left the group, changed his name and moved to Guinea in 1968,
invited by Toure, then the country's brutal Marxist dictator.
	   Ture quickly moved to the political fringes and was soon largely
forgotten except for his `60s activism. He spent the rest of his
life lecturing and writing, preaching black power and championing
socialism and pan-African unity.
	   But often forgotten Sunday in the long stream of political
rhetoric was the human side of the fierce socialist campaigner, a
man well known to friends for his gentleness.
	   In the audience, Beverly Sylla, an American teacher married to a
Guinean, spoke privately about how Ture would cheer her up while
her son was dying of cancer.
	   ``He wasn't just about politics. He was caring, he was human.
And they need to say that,'' she said gesturing towards the podium.

	   READING, England (AP) _ Kate Winslet, star of the Oscar-winning
movie ``Titanic,'' was married Sunday to assistant film director
Jim Threapleton in a quiet ceremony at her family's local church.
	   About 150 guests, including actress Emma Thompson and actor Greg
Wise, attended the afternoon wedding at All Saints' Church in
Reading, southern England.
	   After the half-hour service the 23-year-old actress, in a white
Edwardian-style gown, posed briefly for photographs with her new
husband, 25, who wore a suit with a dark frock coat.
	   ``The whole thing was tremendously relaxed and happy. It was a
big success story today,'' said the Rev. John Mortiboys, who
conducted the service.
	   ``They were trying to keep everything as secret as possible
because you can imagine what it is like in the glare of the
publicity all of the time,'' he said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turks angered by Italy's release of a
Kurdish rebel leader rallied by the thousands in front of the
Italian Embassy on Sunday, part of a day of strident protests that
had Turks burning Italian-made clothes and setting fire to a Fiat.
	   Children stood waving the Turkish flag in the capital as scores
of trucks drove past blaring their horns and bearing banners that
declared: ``An end to trade with Italy.''
	   Hundreds of companies and business groups have announced a
boycott of Italian goods, seeking to punish Italy for its refusal
to extradite to Turkey rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who came to
Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum.
	   On Friday, a Rome court rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for
Ocalan, freeing him. The court cited Italian law forbidding
extradition of suspects to countries where they might face the
death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan the most ruthless of terrorists. Rebels
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have fought for Kurdish
autonomy since 1984; close to 37,000 have died.
	   ``We are not angry at the Italian people, but we are very angry
at the Italian prime minister,'' said Nesrim Tureli, one of the
thousands chanting before the embassy.
	   Demonstrations took place throughout Turkey, with protesters
burning Italian clothes and puppets of Ocalan. A car of the Italian
Fiat brand was burned in the western town of Izmit. In Adana,
protesters reportedly burned a picture of Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
	   Although the week of protests has been peaceful, Turkish
politicians have called for calm, fearing the rallies may turn
violent.
	   Signaling that Turkey would not tolerate any display of support
for the rebels, police have detained more than 3,000 members of the
pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party since Ocalan's arrest. Most
have since been released; their leader was arrested and charged
with being a member of the PKK.
	   The Germany-based Kurdish news agency reported Sunday that a
member of the party was beaten to death Thursday in police custody.
Officials denied the allegations, which could not be independently
verified.
	   Under the court's orders, Ocalan must stay in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany time to decide whether it wants to extradite him on
its own warrant on terrorism charges.
	   Ocalan's presence would be as much a headache for Germany as it
is for Italy, and German officials have consistently said they have
no plans now to seek extradition.
	   On Saturday, however, Germany's federal prosecutor issued a new
warrant for Ocalan.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told Italy's ANSA news
service the new warrant was ``a good sign.'' ANSA quoted Dini as
saying he now expected a German extradition request.
	   Meanwhile, Turkish newspapers reported a large-scale military
operation in the southeastern provinces against PKK rebels.
According to the Zaman daily, 35,000 troops launched an offensive
this week in the province of Tunceli, where authorities suspect
that 500 rebels are hiding. Military officials refused to comment.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Ankara was planning an appeal
of the Rome court's decision on Monday.

Mallorca leader as top Spanish teams crumble

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Top Spanish teams, Real Madrid, FC
Barcelona and Celta all slumped this weekend in a round that saw
Mallorca regaining the No. 1 spot.
	   The defeats were sure to puncture morale at all three teams as
they each prepared for tough midweek European competition matches
with Madrid facing Inter Milan and Barcelona hosting Manchester
United in the Champions League on Wednesday while Celta meets
Liverpool in the UEFA cup on Tuesday.
	   An own goal by Spanish international defender Sergi Barjuan gave
Hector Cuper's Mallorca a slim 1-0 victory over Barcelona on
Saturday.
	   The victory left Mallorca with 22 points, two more than Celta
who went into the 11th round as league leader but slumped 2-0
against second-last Alaves and bade farewell to its unbeaten
record.
	   Barcelona slipped to No. 3 with 19 points.
	   Argentine striker Claudio `Piojo' Lopez scored two goals as
Valencia drubbed Real Madrid 3-1 and moved to No. 5 on equal points
with Madrid which is at No. 4.
	   On Sunday, mid-ranking Deportivo downed third-last Villarreal
2-1 while Salamanca sank bottom-placed Extremadura by the same
score.
	   Racing de Santander was to play Espanyol later Sunday.
	   Other 11th-round results this weekend were : Tenerife 0,
Athletic de Bilbao 1; Atletico de Madrid 6, Valladolid 1; Oviedo 0,
Betis 1 ; Real Sociedad 0, Zaragoza 0.
	   In the highest scoring match of the round Aletico de Madrid
thrashed Valladolid 6-1 to leave the side at No. 6 with 17 points
and ease the pressure on Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi.
 &UR; Deportivo de La Coruna 2, Villarreal 1 &QC; 
	   Division newcomer Villarreal took the lead with a 15th-minute
goal by Moises Garcia. But Deportivo's Moroccan defender slipped in
an equalizer in the 37th and Argentine Oscar Flores made it 2-1
five minutes after the break.
	   Deportivo has 17 points while Villarreal stays with 10.
 &UR; Salamanca 2, Extremadura 1 &QC; 
	   Argentine striker Manuel Alejandro Cardetti put Salamanca ahead
in the 63rd minute. Felix Carvallo drew Extremadura level three
minutes later but Rumanian Catalin Munteanu clinched the victory
for Salamanca with a goal in the 75th.
	   Salamanca edged upward from the lower ranks with 14 points while
Extremadura stayed bottom of the 20-team first division after this
seventh defeat in 11 rounds.

PSV gaining confidence while Ajax does just enough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven and Ajax both won
their Dutch premiership games Sunday, but in rather different
styles.
	   Bobby Robson's fast-improving PSV dismissed FC Utrecht 5-0,
while on a pitch like an ice-rink below-strength Ajax could only
edge bottom club RKC Waalwijk 1-0.
	   But Ajax is now second in the league on 31 points, one behind
Feyenoord, while PSV is still only eighth.
	   The winner came in the eighth minute when Ajax's most
experienced player Danny Blind was set up by its least, teenage
striker Brutil Hose, who was playing his second first-team game.
	   But RKC showed some fight and Hose and Brazilian Wamberto were
spendthrift with the few chances Ajax created.
	   PSV's Portuguese defender Abel Xavier headed his side in front
on 22 minutes from a free kick, but the match turned on an incident
a minute before the break.
	   Defender Bernard Schuiteman's debut for Utrecht after his recent
transfer from Feyenoord turned into a nightmare after he lost the
ball and pulled down Ruud van Nistelrooy.
	   Van Nistelrooy fell into the penalty box, Schuiteman got a red
card and Van Nistelrooy got up to convert the penalty and
demoralize Utrecht.
	   Robert Fuchs, one of several Dutch players recently drafted in
by Robson to bolster a previously cosmopolitan side, drove home the
third after the break.
	   Van Nistelrooy gratefully accepted a tap-in for the fourth and
sub Gilles de Bilde headed the fifth.
	   Sunday's other game was a goalless draw between AZ Alkmaar and
Sparta Rotterdam.

Judge-ordered probe into Diana crash calls tunnel dangerous
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An expert investigating the car crash that killed
Princess Diana said in a report that the Alma traffic tunnel poses
a serious danger to motorists, a judicial source said Sunday.
	   The report said it is ``unthinkable'' that a security barrier
has never been put up in the tunnel, where Diana was fatally
injured Aug. 31, 1997, according to the source, who spoke to the
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   Since the tunnel was first used in 1956, the report said, eight
people have been killed and eight others injured in a total of 34
accidents in the right bank underpass.
	   Those figures don't include the 1997 crash, which also killed
Diana's boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and the car's driver, Henri Paul,
who was legally drunk at the time. The only survivor was bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones.
	   The report into possible causes of the crash, which was given to
the judge investigating the accident earlier this month, also lays
out a series of scenarios that could have led to the wreck.
	   It is possible, the report says, that the Mercedes in which
Diana was riding was blocked by one or more motorcycles driven by
photographers, forcing the car to enter the tunnel. Under this
scenario, Paul could have lost control immediately upon entering
the tunnel, according to the report.
	   The report, compiled by Michel Nibodeau, an automobile expert,
also said that Paul could have put the car in neutral just before
the final impact, contributing to the car's loss of control.
Witnesses have reported hearing a revving noise just before the
Mercedes entered the tunnel, supporting that theory.
	   The report was one of a series given to Judge Herve Stephan as
he tries to wrap up his investigation. Now, parties to the case can
request further probes.
	   Previous tests have also confirmed that the Mercedes brushed
against a Fiat Uno before crashing, but it is not known what role
that played in the crash. Investigators have been unable to trace
the Uno or its driver.
	   The main causes of the crash are still believed to be
drunkenness and speed.
	   The outcome of the judge's investigation will be important in
determining the fate of 10 photographers who are still under formal
investigation. It is believed they will be cleared on the
manslaughter charge, but some may be tried on the charge of failing
to aid people in danger.

Israeli defense minister looking for ways to withdraw from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday
that Israel is renewing efforts to reach an agreement in which it
could withdraw its troops from south Lebanon.
	   ``The army is there in order to give an answer to the security
threat to our northern border. I have called upon the Lebanese
government time and again to come sign a security agreement that
would change the deployment in the security zone,'' Mordechai told
reporters.
	   ``We will continue to seek initiatives and new ways of
thinking,'' Mordechai said.
	   The Israeli army carved out an enclave in south Lebanon in 1985
to protect against cross-border guerrilla raids into Israeli
communities. Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia allies from the
zone and popular pressure has mounted within Israel to bring its
soldiers home.
	   Mordechai made his remarks as he toured the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 War. Syria wants the
heights back in exchange for any peace deal but the Israeli
government has said the strategic plateau was essential for its
security.
	   Israel radio said Mordechai was also ready to restart talks with
Syria immediately on the issue of the Golan. U.S.-brokered talks
between the two parties based on territorial compromise were frozen
in 1996.
	   Syria's role to Israeli peace with Lebanon is vital because it
maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is considered the main
power-broker there. Lebanon has said it was not willing to
negotiate with Israel unless a deal included the return of the
heights to Syria.

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Finn Christian Jagge, the 1992 Olympic
champion, took advantage of an early start number to lead the first
run of men's World Cup slalom on Sunday.
	   After three days of sunny weather, the Park City Mountain Resort
was caught in a snowstorm Sunday and it only got worse as the first
run progressed.
	   Jagge, 32, started second and placed first in 50.26 seconds, .18
faster than the day's No. 1 starter, Jure Kosir of Slovenia.
Olympic champion Hans-Petter Buraas led another trio of Norwegians
in third, .22 seconds behind.
	   Ole Kristian Furuseth, second behind Buraas in the 1998 Olympics
at Nagano, Japan, was fourth in 50.91, .01 faster than 1994 World
Cup overall champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Six Norwegians started in the top 16 and four cracked the top
five, with 1996 overall champion Lasse Kjus, the 16th racer, taking
12th, 1.57 behind. The other Norwegian, 1997 world slalom champion
Tom Stiansen, failed to complete the first run.
	   Christian Mayer of Austria was sixth in 50.99, followed by
Germany's Markus Eberle in 51.34.
	   Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, runner-up the last two years to
teammate Thomas Sykora in the World Cup slalom standings, was
eighth in 51.48. Sykora didn't start because of a bruised knee.
	   Sebastian Amiez of France was ninth in 51.50 and Austria's
Olympic combined champion, Mario Reiter, rounded out the top 10 in
51.53, sharing the position with Canada's Thomas Grandi.
	   Grandi was the only North American to crack the top 30 and
qualify for the second run, scheduled for later Sunday.

Juve players weigh refusing to play Champions League game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Citing safety concerns amid rising tensions
between Italy and Turkey, Juventus of Turin players said Sunday
they do not want to play the club's upcoming Champions League match
against Galatasaray in Istanbul.
	   The countries are at odds over a Turkish Kurd rebel leader
arrested in Rome last week. Feeling is running strong in Turkey
over Italy's refusal to extradite Abdullah Ocalan for trial as a
terrorist.
	   European soccer's governing body, UEFA, is to render a decision
Monday on where and when to play the game, scheduled for Wednesday.
	   ``We players could decide not to go to Istanbul,'' Juventus
captain Angelo Di Livio said. ``We really don't want to risk our
lives. ... We still hope that UEFA will move the game to a neutral
site.''
	   General manager Luciano Moggi has acknowledged that safety is
``a big worry,'' and Juventus announced Friday that no fans will
travel with the club if it plays in Istanbul.
	   ``Our refusal (to play) is a possibility that should not be
dismissed,'' defender Gianluca Pessotto said. ``It is clear that in
Istanbul Wednesday there will not be the right conditions for a
soccer game. ... I don't see why we should take the risk.''
	   Juventus needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its
chances of qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Italian champions
have reached the cup final three straight years.

Jordan's queen describes struggle against king's cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WX114-115 &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ On a cold day in October, King Hussein and
Queen Noor bundled up in blankets and stole a few minutes from the
tortuous Middle East negotiations at Maryland's Wye Plantation to
watch migrating geese land nearby as the sun set.
	   A banal moment, the American-born queen admits, but one that was
all the more poignant because it came as Jordan's royal couple
grappled with their most daunting personal challenge in 20 years of
married life: the king's struggle with cancer.
	   Sitting in the couple's family room at their residence in
suburban Maryland, the queen said in an interview with The
Associated Press and Associated Press Television News that her
husband's illness has given her a new perspective on life.
	   ``There is no question that each moment of life is even more
precious than ever before,'' Noor said. ``Any life-threatening
situation highlights ... the importance that you place on every
aspect of life and every moment of the life of your loved ones.''
	   The king and queen have been in the United States since July,
when Hussein disclosed that he has non-Hodgkins lymphoma. After
months of treatment and chemotherapy at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, his cancer is in complete remission.
	   Noor said she and her husband expect to return to Jordan early
next year, after Hussein undergoes a marrow transplant to guard
against recurrence of the lymphoma. Like any cancer survivor,
Hussein, who has lost his hair to chemotherapy and looked frail at
Wye, will continue to be monitored.
	   Asked whether the cancer has been beaten, Noor said the doctors
would not say, ``nor would we say now, ... that he's completely
cured, but we hope and pray that this is the case.''
	   Unlike many Arabs, Hussein has been quite forthcoming about his
cancer, normally a taboo subject in the Middle East. He has
appeared several times on Jordanian television to keep his people
informed about his condition.
	   Noor said she hoped the king ``will have dispelled some of the
fear and anxiety that accompanies cancer ... by being so open about
it and about the struggle that he's undertaken to beat it.''
	   Hussein's absence, the longest period a Jordanian king has ever
been away from home, sparked so much frenzied gossip in mid-August
about a successor that the king had to deny from his hospital room
rumors that he was dying.
	   Hussein, who celebrated his 46th anniversary as Jordan's monarch
this year, has named his brother Hassan as successor. But rumors
have abounded that the royal family is riven by dissension over the
issue and that Noor is maneuvering for her eldest son to be chosen
king.
	   Hussein has eight children from three previous marriages and two
boys and two girls from his marriage to Noor.
	   Noor called the gossip ``just opportunistic exploitation of his
illness'' and said succession and transition ``will take place in
their own time.''
	   ``His majesty ... has worked very hard over the years to ensure
that the Hashemite family will serve the country in the smoothest
and most capable fashion,'' said Noor, 47.
	   On a more personal note, the queen said the cancer ordeal has
highlighted ``just how important we are to each other as well.''
	   Even as he battled cancer, the king was asked by Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators last month to fly to the Wye Plantation on
Maryland's Eastern Shore to help settle a deal on an Israeli
pullout from the West Bank.
	   President Bill Clinton said the king's influence was crucial to
the agreement that emerged.
	   The quiet moment the king and queen shared at Wye was depicted a
few weeks later on a birthday cake for Hussein's 63rd birthday on
Nov. 14.
	   The two were ``looking at the end of a difficult day with a
promise of a new day,'' said Noor. ``The scene ... seemed to
represent a very special moment in the course of his treatment and
in the course of this political struggle.''
	   The queen too has been active during her U.S. stay, honoring
appointments at the United Nations and in Washington, where she
grew up. Noor was present for the inauguration of the capital's new
Peace Corps headquarters in September with Hillary Rodham Clinton,
with whom the queen said she enjoys ``a very sisterly
relationship.''
	   Noor is also an active opponent to the use of land mines and a
campaigner for ecotourism. In addition, the queen _ an
Arab-American Christian by birth _ has been fighting hard to dispel
misconceptions about Islam and Arabs.
	   But she said her training in architecture and urban planning at
Princeton University, which involved long hours, prepared her for
the demanding life of a queen.
	   Noor was working on an airport design project in Jordan when she
met the king. The former Lisa Halaby adopted the Islamic religion
and took the name Noor al Hussein, or ``Light of Hussein,'' when
they were married in 1978.

Mass murderer goes on trial in Ukraine after leaving 52 bodies

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The killer struck at night on Dec. 24,
1995, bursting into the secluded home of the Zaichenko family.
Soon, the forester, his wife and two small sons were dead, shot
from a sawed-off, double-barreled hunting rifle.
	   Their killer escaped with a pair of wedding rings, a small
golden cross on a chain, earrings and a bundle of worn clothes.
Their house in Garmarnia, a village in central Ukraine, was set
ablaze, marking the start of a bloody trail that was to terrorize
the country for four months.
	   The trail would eventually end with the arrest of Anatoliy
Onoprienko, a forester and sailor who confessed to the killings. On
Monday, the man accused of being Ukraine's worst serial killer goes
on trial in the western Ukrainian town of Zhytomyr, charged with 52
murder counts.
	   ``I look at it very simply. As an animal. I watched all this as
an animal would stare at a sheep,'' Onoprienko said of the
slaughter in a videotaped 1997 police interview obtained by The
Associated Press.
	   The charges against Onoprienko chart a remarkable rampage that
first drew public attention with the Zaichenko slayings.
	   Other killings soon followed.
	   On the night of Dec. 30, 1995, an elusive attacker shot dead
27-year-old Petro Krychkovsky, his wife Maria, 23, and Maria's twin
sisters Lesia and Mirosia, 19, who were busy putting the finishing
touches on their new cottage in the western village of Bratkovychi.
	   Once again, the killer took gold jewelry, two passports and an
old jacket, setting fire to the house and leaving no traces.
	   Then seven people were slaughtered in Enerhodar in southeastern
Ukraine on Jan. 5, 1996. Back in Bratkovychi, a family of five was
slain in their house on Jan. 17 and two others killed on a nearby
road. A family of four, including two children, was butchered in
Fastov near Ukraine's capital Kiev on Jan. 30.
	   In western Ukraine, the anxiety became so high that no villager
ventured outside after dark. Huddled in their houses, they listened
in fear to the whispers of the night as police patrolled the
deserted streets.
	   Authorities launched a nationwide manhunt for the killer, who
left few clues and no live witnesses. A police warrant issued at
the time spoke of a pleasant-looking man of medium height, a good
marksman with his 12-gauge rifle, who was ``exceptionally cruel
toward children.''
	   ``We hardly slept, collapsing on the tables and chairs in the
city police department,'' says Myroslav Rodych, then a traffic
policeman in the western capital of Lviv.
	   The killer continued to elude police, killing another 14 people
in four attacks between Feb. 21 and March 22, 1996.
	   But the net was tightening.
	   Police found the owner of the rifle, who said the weapon was
stolen from him. A list of the man's acquaintances was compiled.
	   In the Lviv region, investigators were checking on all
suspicious people, widely using informants. One report pointed to a
man who was traveling in the region between visits to his
girlfriend in Yavoriv, near the Polish border.
	   Police investigators recall how on April 14, armed officers
followed the woman into her apartment. They saw a balding, lean man
who rushed to grab his attache case but collapsed on the floor when
hit with a machine gun butt. A sawed-off hunting rifle lay inside
the briefcase.
	   In less than four months, Onoprienko, aged 36 at the time of his
arrest, had allegedly killed 40 people, including 10 children. His
total loot in cash, electronic appliances, jewelry and worn clothes
amounted to several thousand dollars at best.
	   Confronted with evidence found hidden at the homes of his lover
and his brother, Onoprienko confessed _ not only to those 40
deaths, but to those of 12 people in 1989, authorities say.
	   In the former Soviet Union, the rampage is matched only by that
of Andrei Chikatilo, convicted and executed in 1994 for killing and
mutilating 52 women and children in neighboring Russia over a
12-year period.
	   Relatives and boarding school teachers describe Onoprienko as a
quiet, reserved youth. The admitted killer says he feels himself to
be a robot, driven for years by a dark force.
	   He has argued that he should not be tried until authorities
determine the source of this force.
	   With a thin face, prominent nose, gray eyes and receding reddish
hair, Onoprienko rambles endlessly about the CIA and Interpol,
unknown powers and future revelations. Psychiatrists, however, have
ruled him fit to stand trial.
	   There is no shadow of remorse when Onoprienko speaks of his
killing spree, of feeling both the perpetrator and the observer in
his own bloody spectacle.
	   ``I perceive it all as a kind of experiment,'' he said. ``There
can be no answer in this experiment to what you're trying to
learn.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gathered Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The ministers released a document entitled ``The New European
Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new
ascendancy in the EU to make growth and job-creation the top
economic priority.
	   Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15
nations, including the four largest - Germany, France, Italy and
Britain.
	   ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together an open,
competitive and successful economy with a just and human society,''
the document says.
	   ``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment
society, a society in which there are job opportunities for all
citizens.''
	   The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be
staying out of the euro project for now.
	   Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the
meeting said the arrival of the euro heralded ``a new phase'' that
obliged nations to cooperate on areas such as taxation, prices and
wage policy.
	   ``We must have coordination if European economic policy is to
bring results,'' Edlinger told a news conference ahead of the
meeting.
	   The socialist ministers met over dinner at a Brussels hotel on
the eve of the regular monthly meeting of all 15 EU nations, the
first for Lafontaine who took office after his Social Democratic
Party won elections in September.
	   In their 11-page ``policy agenda'' the socialist ministers
support public spending on infrastructure and public services and
call for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a
stake in the development of the European economy.''
	   However the document also insists tight budgets are essential to
underpin the euro's stability. It lists ``a commitment to monetary
stability (and) sustained fiscal discipline'' as priorities.
	   The socialists call on the new European Central Bank to take
account of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its
starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc. Edlinger said the
ECB should also keep ministers informed of monetary policy
direction.
	   EU ministers will be able to repeat their recent calls for lower
rates Monday when they are joined by Wim Duisenberg, the central
bank's president. So far, he has been unmoved, pledging to use the
ECB's legal independence from governments to resist political
pressure.
	   Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy
differences persist among the socialists.
	   Britain has little time for French and Italian plans to impose
shorter working weeks. The French are wary of British- and
Dutch-style labor market flexibility.
	   Lafontaine has found scant support for his call for exchange
rate targets to limit fluctuations between the euro and other major
world currencies. ``It won't be very soon that we'll have fixed
relations between the currency blocs,'' Edlinger said.
	   Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when ministers
debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to the
Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder
more of the burden.

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team blasts Serb proposal for province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian guerrillas saying they hold Serb
policeman, Albanians hostage.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team on Sunday blasted a Serb proposal for the
strife-torn province as a blueprint for cementing Serbian
domination in Kosovo, the Beta news agency reported.
	   Fehmi Agani said the only option acceptable to Kosovo's
Albanians was the U.S.-drafted plan seeking to end the crisis
through shuttle diplomacy carried out by American mediator for
Kosovo Christopher Hill.
	   Serbian authorities published Saturday their own four-page draft
proposal which gives the Albanian-majority province a form of
self-rule but keeps it within Serbia, its constitution and legal
framework.
	   ``A paper legalizing an imposed state in Kosovo, a state of
Serbian domination over (ethnic) Albanians, cannot be a subject of
negotiations,'' Agani was quoted as saying in the Serbian capital,
Belgrade, where he attended a weekend conference by the Helsinki
Committee for Human Rights in Serbia.
	   Agani belongs to the moderate, Western-backed ethnic Albanian
leadership which advocates peaceful measures to solving Kosovo's
crisis.
	   He reiterated Sunday that ethnic Albanians would be ready to
accept an interim solution by which Kosovo would remain within
Yugoslavia _ on equal status with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
Yugoslav republics _ for three to five years, after which a
referendum would decide the province's future status.
	   Kosovo is now a Serbian province.
	   Serbian president Milan Milutinovic, who last week rejected a
U.S.-sponsored draft, scheduled new talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders for Wednesday in provincial capital Pristina _ a hollow
gesture since Kosovo Albanians didn't show up for previous talks.
	   ``We shall avoid ... silly games played (by those) allegedly
ready for a dialogue on Kosovo,'' Agani said Sunday, dismissing
Milutinovic's invitation. The Albanians seek foreign mediation of
talks with Serbia, something Serbia opposes.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes since Serbia
launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. The
bloodshed abated _ but has not fully ended _ since Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic signed a de-facto peace agreement last
month, under threat of NATO attack
	   Ethnic Albanians ``are paying a high price for their right to
self-determination,'' Agani said. ``A fifth of Kosovo has been
burnt to the ground, hundreds have been killed, hundreds of
thousands have become refugees.''
	   In a reflection of continued tensions, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, spearheading the armed struggle for independence, on Sunday
said it was holding a Serb policeman and a group of Kosovo
Albanians loyal to the Serbs. It accused them of robbing ethnic
Albanian villagers.
	   In a statement to Kosovo's Albanian media, the KLA accused the
policeman of being ``the main organizer of all the stealing in the
region'' of Podujevo, northeast of Pristina. The ethnic Albanians,
it said, were ``spies, who in cooperation with the members of the
special Serb security forces, robbed the Albanian people and their
abandoned villages.''

	   READING, England (AP) _ Kate Winslet, star of the Oscar-winning
movie ``Titanic,'' was married Sunday to assistant film director
Jim Threapleton in a quiet ceremony at her family's local church.
	   About 150 guests, including actress Emma Thompson and actor Greg
Wise, attended the afternoon wedding at All Saints' Church in
Reading, southern England.
	   After the half-hour service the 23-year-old actress, in a white
Edwardian-style gown, posed briefly for photographs with her new
husband, 25, who wore a suit with a dark frock coat.
	   ``The whole thing was tremendously relaxed and happy. It was a
big success story today,'' said the Rev. John Mortiboys, who
conducted the service.
	   ``They were trying to keep everything as secret as possible
because you can imagine what it is like in the glare of the
publicity all of the time,'' he said.

Former premier accuses Trinidad leader of racism, corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHAGUARAMAS, Trinidad (AP) _ Former Premier Patrick Manning
accused Trinidad's first leader of Indian descent of driving a
racial wedge into society and urged his own black-led party to
begin an ``evangelical mission'' to win back power.
	   At his National People's Movement's annual convention Sunday,
Manning also repeated allegations of corruption and cronyism that
Prime Minister Basdeo Panday has vehemently denied.
	   Manning said he was launching an evangelical mission to win the
next general elections, which Panday has said he would call a year
early in 1999.
	   ``Panday cannot be forgiven for the disruption of the
inter-ethnic harmony that existed here before the United National
Congress came to power,'' Manning said.
	   Manning also repeated charges published in the local media that
multimillion-dollar contracts were given to Panday's friends
without being put out to bid.
	   When asked about the allegations, Panday called the question
insulting, and said his government was ``going to war'' against the
black-dominated media, which he accuses of racism against
Trinidadians of East Indian descent.
	   Trinidad and Tobago's 1.3 million people are about evenly
divided between descendants of African slaves and East Indians
brought as indentured laborers after slavery was abolished.
	   Panday hailed his 1995 election as a victory for racial
tolerance since he could not have won without some black votes.
Blacks had held political power in Trinidad since independence from
Britain in 1962, while Indo-Trinidadians were powerful in commerce.

	   ROME (AP) _ Snow capped the island of Capri and Naples' Mount
Vesuvius on Sunday, brought on by a cold snap that hit parts of
Italy with some of the most biting chill in 10 years. The cold
killed at least one person, a 91-year-old man.
	   Heavy snow also fell in Italy's northern mountains, compounding
the suffering of hundreds still living in temporary housing after
losing their homes in last year's devastating earthquake in the
Umbria and Marche regions.
	   Sporadic blackouts meant some of the people of the trailer camps
did without heat or lights during the worst of the cold Saturday.
	   ``We are alone, abandoned _ no one remembers us,'' Italy's Il
Tempo newspaper quoted one woman as yelling at reporters visiting
embittered residents of the trailer camps, where snow was shin-high
and the wind blew flakes in blustering gusts.
	   In Calabria in southern Italy, a 91-year-old man from the city
of Vibo Valentia died Sunday, a day after he was found unconscious
on the floor of his unheated home.
	   Temperatures fell as low as -4 degrees Farenheit at Livigno in
far northern Italy. It was 23 degrees in Turin in the northwest
region of Piedmont, the coldest weather there since 1988, and 35
degrees in Rome, which escaped the snowfall.
	   The snow was the first in 10 years for the usually sunny
southern island of Capri. Onshore, up to 16 inches covered Mount
Vesuvius and surrounding peaks.

Floods' death total reaches 18 in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The death toll from devastating floods in
western Ukraine rose to 18 Sunday after three more bodies were
discovered, officials said.
	   Seven settlements remained inundated but high waters have mostly
receded from the Zakarpattia region, where 118 settlements were
flooded this month, the Emergency Situations Ministry reported.
	   Some 2,406 houses were destroyed and 5,153 people were relocated
from the region, it said.
	   As of the weekend, about 6,000 emergency workers have restored
gas and electricity supplies and telephone communications, the
report said. Workers still have to repair several thousand
buildings, as well as numerous bridges, dams, roads and railway
lines in the area.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the relief effort, and numerous organizations and
individual citizens across Ukraine have sent aid to Zakarpattia.
	   International organizations, including the Red Cross and United
Nations and countries such as China, France, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Poland and Slovakia have also provided assistance, according
to the Foreign Ministry.

PSV gaining confidence while Ajax does just enough
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven and Ajax both won
their Dutch premiership games Sunday, but in rather different
styles.
	   Bobby Robson's fast-improving PSV dismissed FC Utrecht 5-0,
while on a pitch like an ice-rink below-strength Ajax could only
edge bottom club RKC Waalwijk 1-0.
	   But Ajax is now second in the league with 31 points, one behind
Feyenoord, while PSV is still only eighth.
	   The winner came in the eighth minute when Ajax's most
experienced player Danny Blind was set up by its least, teen-age
striker Brutil Hose, who was playing his second first-team game.
	   But RKC showed some fight and Hose and Brazilian Wamberto were
spendthrift with the few chances Ajax created.
	   PSV's Portuguese defender Abel Xavier headed his side in front
on 22 minutes from a free kick, but the match turned on an incident
a minute before the break.
	   Defender Bernard Schuiteman's debut for Utrecht after his recent
transfer from Feyenoord turned into a nightmare after he lost the
ball and pulled down Ruud van Nistelrooy.
	   Van Nistelrooy fell into the penalty box, Schuiteman got a red
card and Van Nistelrooy got up to convert the penalty and
demoralize Utrecht.
	   Robert Fuchs, one of several Dutch players recently drafted in
by Robson to bolster a previously cosmopolitan side, drove home the
third after the break.
	   Van Nistelrooy gratefully accepted a tap-in for the fourth and
sub Gilles de Bilde headed the fifth.
	   Sunday's other game was a goalless draw between AZ Alkmaar and
Sparta Rotterdam.

Israeli defense minister looking for ways to withdraw from Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Sunday
that Israel is renewing efforts to reach an agreement to withdraw
its troops from south Lebanon.
	   ``The army is there in order to give an answer to the security
threat to our northern border. I have called upon the Lebanese
government time and again to come sign a security agreement that
would change the deployment in the security zone,'' Mordechai told
reporters.
	   ``We will continue to seek initiatives and new ways of
thinking,'' Mordechai said.
	   The Israeli army carved out an enclave in south Lebanon in 1985
to protect against cross-border guerrilla raids into Israeli
communities. Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia allies from the
zone and popular pressure has mounted within Israel to bring its
soldiers home.
	   Mordechai made his remarks as he toured the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 War. Syria wants the
heights back in exchange for any peace deal but the Israeli
government has said the strategic plateau was essential for its
security.
	   Israel radio said Mordechai was also ready to restart talks with
Syria immediately on the issue of the Golan. U.S.-brokered talks
between the two parties based on territorial compromise were frozen
in 1996.
	   Gaining Syria's support for Israeli peace with Lebanon is vital
because Syria maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is considered
the main power-broker there. Lebanon has said it was not willing to
negotiate with Israel unless a deal included the return of the
heights to Syria.

Kurdish rebel leader rallied by the thousands in front of the
Italian Embassy on Sunday, part of a day of strident protests that
had Turks burning Italian-made clothes and setting fire to a Fiat.
	   Children stood waving the Turkish flag in the capital as scores
of trucks drove past blaring their horns and bearing banners that
declared: ``An end to trade with Italy.''
	   Hundreds of companies and business groups have announced a
boycott of Italian goods, seeking to punish Italy for its refusal
to extradite to Turkey rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who came to
Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum.
	   On Friday, a Rome court rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for
Ocalan, freeing him. The court cited Italian law forbidding
extradition of suspects to countries where they might face the
death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan the most ruthless of terrorists. Rebels
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have fought for Kurdish
autonomy since 1984; close to 37,000 have died.
	   ``We are not angry at the Italian people, but we are very angry
at the Italian prime minister,'' said Nesrim Tureli, one of the
thousands chanting before the embassy.
	   Demonstrations took place throughout Turkey, with protesters
burning Italian clothes and puppets of Ocalan. A car of the Italian
Fiat brand was burned in the western town of Izmit. In Adana,
protesters reportedly burned a picture of Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
	   Although the week of protests has been peaceful, Turkish
politicians have called for calm, fearing the rallies may turn
violent.
	   Signaling that Turkey would not tolerate any display of support
for the rebels, police have detained more than 3,000 members of the
pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party since Ocalan's arrest. Most
have since been released; their leader was arrested and charged
with being a member of the PKK.
	   The Germany-based Kurdish news agency reported Sunday that a
member of the party was beaten to death Thursday in police custody.
Officials denied the allegations, which could not be independently
verified.
	   Under the court's orders, Ocalan must stay in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany time to decide whether it wants to extradite him on
its own warrant on terrorism charges.
	   Ocalan's presence would be as much a headache for Germany as it
is for Italy, and German officials have consistently said they have
no plans now to seek extradition.
	   On Saturday, however, Germany's federal prosecutor issued a new
warrant for Ocalan.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told Italy's ANSA news
service the new warrant was ``a good sign.'' ANSA quoted Dini as
saying he now expected a German extradition request.
	   Meanwhile, Turkish newspapers reported a large-scale military
operation in the southeastern provinces against PKK rebels.
According to the Zaman daily, 35,000 troops launched an offensive
this week in the province of Tunceli, where authorities suspect
that 500 rebels are hiding. Military officials refused to comment.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Ankara was planning an appeal
of the Rome court's decision on Monday.

Socialist finance ministers prepare euro-zone cooperation

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gathered Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The ministers released a document entitled ``The New European
Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new
power in the EU to make growth and job-creation its top economic
priority.
	   Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15
nations, including the four largest: Germany, France, Italy and
Britain.
	   ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together an open,
competitive and successful economy with a just and human society,''
the document says.
	   ``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment
society, a society in which there are job opportunities for all
citizens.''
	   The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be
staying out of the euro project for now.
	   Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the
meeting, said the arrival of the euro heralded ``a new phase'' that
obliged nations to cooperate on areas such as taxation, prices and
wage policy.
	   ``We must have coordination if European economic policy is to
bring results,'' Edlinger told a news conference ahead of the
meeting.
	   The socialist ministers met over dinner at a Brussels hotel on
the eve of the regular monthly meeting of all 15 EU nations, the
first for Lafontaine who took office after his Social Democratic
Party won elections in September.
	   In their 11-page ``policy agenda,'' the socialist ministers
supported public spending on infrastructure and public services and
call for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a
stake in the development of the European economy.''
	   However the document also insists tight budgets are essential to
underpin the euro's stability. It lists ``a commitment to monetary
stability (and) sustained fiscal discipline'' as priorities.
	   The socialists called on the new European Central Bank to take
account of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its
starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc. Edlinger said the
central bank should also keep ministers informed of monetary policy
direction.
	   Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when ministers
debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to the
Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder
more of the burden.

Ahern predicts eventual unification of Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _This year's peace agreement in Northern
Ireland has helped make the eventual unification of Ireland
``irresistible,'' Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Sunday in
an interview that irritated many of the north's Protestants.
	   April's accord among the British and Irish governments and eight
Northern Ireland parties envisioned that the province's British
Protestant and Irish Catholic blocs would govern in coalition.
	   That government has yet to be formed, but Ahern said the accord
had removed a major factor deterring Protestants from accepting
closer ties to the rest of Ireland _ the Irish Republican Army's
30-year campaign of violence aimed at wiping out Northern Ireland.
The IRA called a truce in July 1997 and the outlawed group's allied
Sinn Fein party backed the accord.
	   Asked in an interview with the Irish national broadcasters RTE
whether Ireland might be united within 10 to 15 years, Ahern said
that seemed ``too short.''
	   ``I've said I believe it will be in my lifetime. I don't know
how long I'll live, but I do think it will happen,'' said Ahern,
47.
	   He speculated that a Northern Ireland-wide referendum within the
next 20 years might record majority support for unity, since the
accord will promote increasing cooperation between his government
and the new Belfast administration.
	   Ahern said this agenda, combined with continuing cease-fires by
the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups in Northern Ireland, would
provide ``an irresistible dynamic'' towards forming a new
all-Ireland government. He said the key was to ``keep violence out
of it.''
	   His prediction clashed fundamentally with the public position of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has said during visits to
Northern Ireland that Ireland won't be united within even the
lifetimes of his teen-age children.
	   April's accord emphasized that Northern Ireland's union with
Britain will remain so long as majority opinion in the territory
supports it. Opinion polls have consistently shown that more than
two-thirds of residents _ including virtually all the Protestants
that make up 55 percent of the population _ support their British
links.
	   Northern Ireland was founded as a Protestant-majority state in
1920, two years before the predominantly Catholic south of Ireland
won independence from Britain. Ahern's Fianna Fail party has
traditionally campaigned for an end to that partition, but has
refused to run candidates in elections north of the border.

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team blasts Serb proposal for province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 12,13 with ethnic Albanian guerrillas saying
they hold Serb policeman, Albanians hostage. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The chief of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team on Sunday blasted a Serb proposal for the
strife-torn Kosovo province as a blueprint for cementing Serbian
domination in Kosovo, the Beta news agency reported.
	   Fehmi Agani said the only option acceptable to Kosovo's
Albanians was the U.S.-drafted plan seeking to end the crisis
through shuttle diplomacy by American mediator Christopher Hill.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2
million.
	   Serbian authorities published Saturday their proposal to give
Kosovo a form of self-rule but keep it within Serbia.
	   ``A paper legalizing an imposed state in Kosovo, a state of
Serbian domination over (ethnic) Albanians, cannot be a subject of
negotiations,'' the news agency quoted Agani as saying.
	   Agani belongs to the moderate, Western-backed ethnic Albanian
leadership that advocates peaceful measures to solving Kosovo's
crisis.
	   He reiterated Sunday that ethnic Albanians would be ready to
accept an interim solution by which Kosovo would remain within
Yugoslavia _ on equal status with Serbia and Montenegro, the two
Yugoslav republics _ for three to five years. After that a
referendum would decide the province's future status.
	   Kosovo is now a Serbian province.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes since Serbia
launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in February. The
bloodshed abated _ but has not fully ended _ since Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic signed a de-facto peace agreement last
month, under threat of NATO attack
	   Serbian president Milan Milutinovic, who last week rejected a
U.S.-sponsored draft, scheduled new talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders for Wednesday in the provincial capital of Pristina. It was
a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians didn't show up for previous
talks.
	   ``We shall avoid ... silly games played (by those) allegedly
ready for a dialogue on Kosovo,'' Agani said Sunday, dismissing
Milutinovic's invitation. The ethnic Albanians seek foreign
mediation of talks with Serbia, something Serbia opposes.
	   In a reflection of continued tensions, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, spearheading the armed struggle for independence, said Sunday
that it was holding a Serb policeman and a group of Kosovo
Albanians loyal to the Serbs. It accused them of robbing ethnic
Albanian villagers.
	   In a statement to Kosovo's Albanian media, the KLA accused the
policeman of being ``the main organizer of all the stealing in the
region'' of Podujevo, northeast of Pristina. The ethnic Albanians,
it said, were ``spies, who in cooperation with the members of the
special Serb security forces, robbed the Albanian people and their
abandoned villages.''

Iraq complains of `savage campaign' over documents

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister on Sunday accused
U.N. arms inspectors of ``a savage campaign ... of disinformation''
in their quest for documents about the country's banned weapons.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, was responding to
demands last week from Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission, for material related to biological and chemical weapons
as well as long-range missiles.
	   The issue of documents is the first potential flashpoint since
Iraq on Nov. 14 announced that it would resume cooperation with
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's past nuclear program.
	   Al-Sahhaf said that Baghdad had handed over ``roughly''
2,188,020 million pages of documents to UNSCOM and the IAEA since
the weapons inspections began in 1991.
	   Butler's latest requests, he said, were seeking the impossible.
	   ``They are asking for something ... which is not existing, or
something which has nothing to do, is irrelevant, to the work of
the (U.N.) Security Council and UNSCOM,'' al-Sahhaf said.
``Anything relevant to the work of disarmament, we had already
handed over.''
	   He suggested that Butler was adopting a ``new tactic'' in order
to make it appear that Iraq was breaking its latest pledge to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   This, he said, could delay the promised review by the Security
Council of Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions.
	   Iraq wants the council's review to lead to the easing the trade
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait which
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We are witnessing again a savage campaign ... of
disinformation,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq has maintain that it has fulfilled the requirements of U.N.
resolutions. The inspectors say that Iraq has repeatedly misled
them and concealed weapons components and crucial documents.
	   The United States and Britain had been threatening military
action to force Iraq to resume cooperation with the weapons teams.
	   Asked if he thought the dispute over documents could provoke
more threats, al-Sahhaf said that Security Council resolutions
don't ``say that if you do not hand over a document that three
cruise missiles will hit your country.''
	   He added: ``This is ridiculous. So whatever party is threatening
that, he will bear the responsibility for that.''
	   Al-Sahhaf added that if Butler ``is a fair man, he should be
satisfied.''
	   Among the documents that Butler is seeking is an air force
inventory that U.N. inspectors saw last summer but were not allowed
to take.
	   Al-Sahhaf said this issue had been addressed in a letter to
Butler by Riyadh al-Qaisi, the deputy foreign minister.
	   Earlier Sunday, the official Iraqi News Agency carried the text
of the letter in which al-Qaisi disclosed that the log contains an
inventory of chemical ordnance the Iraqi army used from 1983 to
1988.
	   Al-Qaisi said Iraq will only show U.N. inspectors ``the relevant
parts'' of the document and that this had to be in the presence of
U.N. envoy Prakash Shah.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift
the sanctions.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit oil sales and bar
most financial dealings _ have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The inspectors, who were evacuated to Bahrain amid threats of
military action, returned last week and resumed inspections on
Wednesday.
	   On Sunday, U.N. teams went into the field for a fifth
consecutive day.
	   U.N. officials have refused to say how many inspectors are
working or where they have gone.
	   The Iraqi News Agency quoted the National Monitoring
Directorate, which provides Iraqi escorts for the inspectors, as
saying that missile, chemical and biological teams were at work on
Sunday.
	   The directorate said that two weapons teams that monitor imports
visited border posts with Syria and Jordan. It gave no other
details.

	   ROME (AP) _ Snow capped the island of Capri and Naples' Mount
Vesuvius on Sunday, brought on by a cold snap that hit parts of
Italy with some of the most biting chill in 10 years. The cold
killed at least one person, a 91-year-old man.
	   Heavy snow also fell in Italy's northern mountains, compounding
the suffering of hundreds still living in temporary housing after
losing their homes in last year's devastating earthquake in the
Umbria and Marche regions.
	   Sporadic blackouts meant some of the people of the trailer camps
did without heat or lights during the worst of the cold Saturday.
	   ``We are alone, abandoned _ no one remembers us,'' Italy's Il
Tempo newspaper quoted one woman as yelling at reporters visiting
embittered residents of the trailer camps, where snow was shin-high
and the wind blew flakes in blustering gusts.
	   In Calabria in southern Italy, a 91-year-old man from the city
of Vibo Valentia died Sunday, a day after he was found unconscious
on the floor of his unheated home.
	   Temperatures fell as low as -4 degrees Farenheit at Livigno in
far northern Italy. It was 23 degrees in Turin in the northwest
region of Piedmont, the coldest weather there since 1988, and 35
degrees in Rome, which escaped the snowfall.
	   The snow was the first in 10 years for the usually sunny
southern island of Capri. Onshore, up to 16 inches covered Mount
Vesuvius and surrounding peaks.

French train service slows to crawl on eve of European walkout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS as strike begins in France, ADDS details of agreement
in Marseille, EDITS throughout

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Train service across France slowed to a crawl
Sunday night on the eve of a Europe-wide rail strike.
	   The strike was expected to gather pace Sunday evening and the
national train company, the SNCF, said only about one in three
trains would be running Monday morning.
	   Traffic on Monday is also expected to be severely disrupted in
Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg, where workers are
protesting plans for more deregulation of the sector. Unions were
also expected to hand out leaflets to commuters in Germany,
Britain, Austria and the Netherlands.
	   In France, only Eurostar trains to London and the fast train
from Paris to the northern town of Lille were expected to run
normally during the one-day strike.
	   Buses were set to replace Thalys trains from Paris to Brussels,
Amsterdam and Cologne.
	   Paris commuters also faced a difficult Monday morning, with
severe disruptions seen for local train routes and some suburban
lines.
	   In France, however, the European one-day walkout won't be the
end of travelers' woes.
	   French train conductors' unions have called a nation-wide strike
for next Friday, saying they lack sufficient staff.
	   French train workers are well known for walkouts and officials
showed nervousness Sunday that the situation could worsen. In late
1995, train workers brought France to a near standstill for more
than three weeks over a government plan to reduce benefits.
	   Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said he hoped this
time that ``negotiations will prevail.''
	   Ironically, train workers in Marseille ended a thirteen-day
walkout Sunday, but said they would observe the European strike
Monday.
	   Rail workers there wanted the SNCF to hire 30 more train
conductors by the end of the year, but agreed to a plan adding 23
new workers immediately.

Moenchengladbach beats Freiburg under Rainer Bonhof
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Borussia Moenchengladbach won for the first time
in 12 matches Sunday against SC Freiburg, giving Rainer Bonhof his
first victory as coach of the troubled team.
	   Moenchengladbach beat Freiburg 3-1, failing to be rattled after
Uwe Wassmer shot the visitors into the lead just three minutes into
the contest.
	   Before the club hired Bonhoff, a veteran of Moenchengladbach's
glory teams of the seventies, the current side had folded after
early setbacks and lost back-to-back 8-2 and 7-1 blowouts.
	   But Moenchengladbach, following a draw in Bonhof's debut,
quickly overcame Freiburg's early lead on Michael Klinkert's shot
in the 17th minute, Matthias Hagner in the 33rd and Peter Wynhoff
in the 48th.
	   The second season win left Moenchegladbach one point away from
escaping the bottom of the table.
	   Watching from the stands was Berti Vogts, another former
Moenchengladbach standout. He was also coach of Germany's national
team and Bonhof his assistant.
	   ``It was hard to come back from that 1-0, but you can tell
Rainer has learned a lot,'' said Vogts.
	   The two were teammates on Moenchengladbach's seventies teams,
when the small-town club rolled up five Bundesliga titles and two
UEFA Cups.

	   ROME (AP) _ Snow capped the island of Capri and Naples' Mount
Vesuvius on Sunday, brought on by a cold snap that hit parts of
Italy with some of the most biting chill in 10 years. The cold
killed at least one person, a 91-year-old man.
	   Heavy snow also fell in Italy's northern mountains, compounding
the suffering of hundreds still living in temporary housing after
losing their homes in last year's devastating earthquake in the
Umbria and Marche regions.
	   Sporadic blackouts meant some of the people of the trailer camps
did without heat or lights during the worst of the cold Saturday.
	   ``We are alone, abandoned _ no one remembers us,'' Italy's Il
Tempo newspaper quoted one woman as yelling at reporters visiting
embittered residents of the trailer camps, where snow was shin-high
and the wind blew flakes in blustering gusts.
	   In Calabria in southern Italy, a 91-year-old man from the city
of Vibo Valentia died Sunday, a day after he was found unconscious
on the floor of his unheated home.
	   Temperatures fell as low as -4 degrees Farenheit (-20 Celsius)
at Livigno in far northern Italy. It was 23 degrees (-5 Celsius) in
Turin in the northwest region of Piedmont, the coldest weather
there since 1988, and 35 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) in Rome, which
escaped the snowfall.
	   The snow was the first in 10 years for the usually sunny
southern island of Capri. Onshore, up to 16 inches covered Mount
Vesuvius and surrounding peaks.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and South Africa are expected to sign
agreements fostering closer trade relations during a visit by Vice
President Thabo Mkebi that began Sunday.
	   Mkebi, who is expected to succeed President Nelson Mandela when
elections are held next year, was scheduled to hold negotiations
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and meet with various
political and religious leaders, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   He also is scheduled to deliver a speech at Peoples' Friendship
University. The school was a magnet for African students during the
Soviet era, when it served the government's policy of promoting
communism in Africa. Since the Soviet collapse, it has fallen on
hard times.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turks angered by Italy's release of a
Kurdish rebel leader rallied by the thousands in front of the
Italian Embassy on Sunday, part of a day of strident protests that
had Turks burning Italian-made clothes and setting fire to a Fiat.
	   Children stood waving the Turkish flag in the capital as scores
of trucks drove past blaring their horns and bearing banners that
declared: ``An end to trade with Italy.''
	   Hundreds of companies and business groups have announced a
boycott of Italian goods, seeking to punish Italy for its refusal
to extradite to Turkey rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who came to
Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum.
	   On Friday, a Rome court rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for
Ocalan, freeing him. The court cited Italian law forbidding
extradition of suspects to countries where they might face the
death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan the most ruthless of terrorists. Rebels
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have fought for Kurdish
autonomy since 1984; the conflict has killed close to 37,000
people.
	   ``We are not angry at the Italian people, but we are very angry
at the Italian prime minister,'' said Nesrim Tureli, one of the
thousands chanting before the embassy.
	   Demonstrations took place throughout Turkey, with protesters
burning Italian clothes and puppets of Ocalan, as well as an
Italian Fiat in the western town of Izmit.
	   Although the week of protests has largely been peaceful, Turkish
politicians have called for calm, fearing the rallies may turn
violent.
	   Signaling that Turkey would not tolerate any display of support
for the rebels, police have detained more than 3,000 members of the
pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party since Ocalan's arrest,
according to the party. Most have since been released; their leader
was arrested and charged with being a member of the PKK.
	   The Germany-based Kurdish news agency reported Sunday that a
member of the party was beaten to death Thursday in police custody.
Officials denied the allegations, which could not be independently
verified.
	   Under the court's orders, Ocalan must stay in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany time to decide whether it wants to extradite him on
its own, 1990 warrant on terrorism charges. Although Germany said
previously it has no plans to ask for Ocalan, a German federal
prosecutor issued a new warrant for Ocalan on Saturday.
	   Italy's ANSA news service quoted Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
as saying he now expected a German extradition request.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Ankara was planning an appeal
of the Rome court's decision on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Turkish newspapers reported a large-scale military
operation in the southeastern provinces against PKK rebels.
According to the Zaman daily, 35,000 troops launched an offensive
this week in the province of Tunceli, where authorities suspect
that 500 rebels are hiding.
	   Private television NTV said PKK arms fire had cut off main roads
in central and southeastern Anatolia.

El Salvador opens presidential campaign delayed by Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Political parties in El
Salvador held rallies Sunday to open the delayed presidential
campaign that pits former leftist rebels against the conservative
party currently in power.
	   Presidential candidates for the former guerrillas of Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front and the ruling Republican
Nationalist Alliance opened their campaigns with motorcades and
party supporters singing anthems and waving pompoms, providing a
brief diversion from the devastation Hurricane Mitch wrought in the
country.
	   The campaign for the March 7, 1999 presidential elections had
been scheduled to open Nov. 3, but was delayed for three weeks
after flooding from the storm hit the country on Nov. 2.
	   The floods left 239 people dead and 30,000 homeless in El
Salvador.
	   Francisco Flores, of the Republican Nationalist Alliance appears
to hold a solid lead in the race, according to one poll, but nearly
half the eligible voters expressed no preference or intention to
vote.
	   Flores, who at 39 would be the nation's youngest president, is
favored by 32 percent of the 1,247 voters who expressed a
preference in the poll October 18 by University Institute for
Public Opinion. The poll has a margin of error of 4 percent.
	   Facundo Guardado, candidate for the leftist Farabundo Marti
front _ known by its initials as the FMLN _ was favored by 21
percent of voters in the poll.
	   Guardado and his running mate, Nidia Diaz, fought government
troops in El Salvador's 12-year civil war, which left 76,000
Salvadorans dead.
	   Observers say that running two former rebels _ rather than
seeking out a more centrist vice presidential candidate _ may have
hurt chances for the FMLN, which took a step forward by winning the
mayorship of San Salvador in 1997 elections.
	   In those elections, the former rebels won 27 of 84 seats in
congress and 50 of the 262 mayorships.
	   The presidential race will mark the third round of voting in
which the FMLN has participated after signing the 1992 peace
accords with the government.

Georgian leader discusses treaty with Abkhazian envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Georgian leader discussed a peace treaty Sunday
with an envoy from the breakaway province of Abkhazia, leaving the
envoy optimistic about the prospects for an agreement, a news
agency said.
	   ``The Georgian and Abkhazian sides do not have insolvable
problems in the work on the draft agreements,'' Anri Dzhergenia was
quoted as saying after meeting with Georgian State Minister Vazha
Lordkipanidze.
	   The two discussed draft agreements on the return of refugees to
Abkhazia and on peace between Georgian and Abkhazia, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
	   Dzhergenia, representing Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba,
also discussed prospects for a meeting between Ardzinba and
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, but no date was set,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Abkhazians declared an independent republic after driving out
Georgian government forces in 1993 following the end of a 13-month
war.
	   Despite the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in 1994, sporadic
clashes have continued. In May, Abkhazian forces took control of
Georgia's fertile Ghali region.
	   Since 1992, more than 300,000 people have fled their homes due
to the fighting.

argument, background on last known shooting of a DEA agent in
Colombia. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed
early Sunday apparently after an argument in a bar in an upscale
entertainment district of Bogota, authorities said.
	   Frank Arnold Moreno, 37, was shot once through the chest in the
city's so-called Zona Rosa about 1 a.m. outside the El Divino bar,
U.S. officials said.
	   Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about a year, was not with
any other U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents at the time
and was shot after what one U.S. Embassy official called ``a bar
brawl.''
	   ``I don't think it had anything to do with drugs,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I understand he
was walking away and then boom, boom.''
	   The bullet went through Moreno's chest, and he was taken by two
witnesses to a Bogota hospital, where he was declared dead.
	   Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, was recently married and had
previously been assigned to Oklahoma City, officials said.
	   Authorities were unsure if a DEA agent had ever been killed in
Colombia before.
	   In 1982 a two agents investigating marijuana smuggling were
wounded in an attack in Colombia's Caribbean port of Cartagena.
	   Sunday's shooting occurred in a neighborhood or restaurants,
bars and discotheques that is packed with people well after
midnight on weekends.
	   The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's
leading producer and exporter of cocaine. Some 80 percent of the
cocaine sold and a growing amount of the heroin sold on U.S.
streets comes from Colombia.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister on Sunday accused
U.N. arms inspectors of ``a savage campaign ... of disinformation''
in their quest for documents about the country's banned weapons.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, was responding to
demands last week from Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission, for material related to biological and chemical weapons
as well as long-range missiles.
	   The issue of documents is the first potential flashpoint since
Iraq on Nov. 14 announced that it would resume cooperation with
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's past nuclear program.
	   Al-Sahhaf said that Baghdad had handed over ``roughly''
2,188,020 pages of documents to UNSCOM and the IAEA since the
weapons inspections began in 1991.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister on Sunday accused
U.N. arms inspectors of ``a savage campaign ... of disinformation''
in their quest for documents about the country's banned weapons.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, was responding to
demands last week from Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission, for material related to biological and chemical weapons
as well as long-range missiles.
	   The issue of documents is the first potential flashpoint since
Iraq announced on Nov. 14 that it would resume cooperation with
UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's past nuclear program.
	   Al-Sahhaf said that Baghdad had handed over ``roughly'' 2
million pages of documents to the two groups since the weapons
inspections began in 1991.
	   Butler's latest requests, he said, were seeking the impossible.
	   ``They are asking for something ... which is not existing, or
something which has nothing to do, is irrelevant, to the work of
the (U.N.) Security Council and UNSCOM,'' al-Sahhaf said.
``Anything relevant to the work of disarmament, we had already
handed over.''
	   He suggested that Butler was adopting a ``new tactic'' in order
to make it appear that Iraq was breaking its latest pledge to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   This, he said, could delay the promised review by the Security
Council of Iraq's compliance with disarmament resolutions.
	   Iraq wants the council's review to lead to the easing the trade
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait which
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We are witnessing again a savage campaign ... of
disinformation,'' al-Sahhaf said.
	   Iraq says it has fulfilled the requirements of U.N. resolutions.
The inspectors say that Iraq has repeatedly misled them and
concealed weapons components and crucial documents.
	   The United States and Britain had been threatening military
action to force Iraq to resume cooperation with the weapons teams.
	   Asked if he thought the dispute over documents could provoke
more threats, al-Sahhaf said that Security Council resolutions
don't ``say that if you do not hand over a document that three
cruise missiles will hit your country.''
	   He added: ``This is ridiculous. So whatever party is threatening
that, he will bear the responsibility for that.''
	   Al-Sahhaf added that if Butler ``is a fair man, he should be
satisfied.''
	   Among the documents that Butler is seeking is an air force
inventory that U.N. inspectors saw last summer but were not allowed
to take.
	   Al-Sahhaf said this issue had been addressed in a letter to
Butler by Riyadh al-Qaisi, the deputy foreign minister.
	   Earlier Sunday, the official Iraqi News Agency carried the text
of the letter in which al-Qaisi disclosed that the log contains an
inventory of chemical ordnance the Iraqi army used from 1983 to
1988.
	   Al-Qaisi said Iraq will only show U.N. inspectors ``the relevant
parts'' of the document and that this had to be in the presence of
U.N. envoy Prakash Shah.
	   The U.N. inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift
the sanctions.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit oil sales and bar
most financial dealings _ have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The inspectors, who were evacuated to Bahrain amid threats of
military action, returned last week and resumed inspections on
Wednesday.
	   On Sunday, U.N. teams went into the field for a fifth
consecutive day.
	   U.N. officials have refused to say how many inspectors are
working or where they have gone.
	   The Iraqi News Agency quoted the National Monitoring
Directorate, which provides Iraqi escorts for the inspectors, as
saying that missile, chemical and biological teams were at work on
Sunday.
	   The directorate said that two weapons teams that monitor imports
visited border posts with Syria and Jordan. It gave no other
details.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Top Spanish teams, Real Madrid, FC
Barcelona and Celta all slumped this weekend in a round that saw
Mallorca regaining the No. 1 spot.
	   The defeats were sure to puncture morale at all three teams as
they each prepared for tough midweek European competition matches
with Madrid facing Inter Milan and Barcelona hosting Manchester
United in the Champions League on Wednesday while Celta meets
Liverpool in the UEFA cup on Tuesday.
	   An own goal by Spanish international defender Sergi Barjuan gave
Hector Cuper's Mallorca a slim 1-0 victory over Barcelona on
Saturday.
	   The victory left Mallorca with 22 points, two more than Celta
who went into the 11th round as league leader but slipped 2-0
against second-last Alaves and bade farewell to its unbeaten
record.
	   Barcelona dropped to No. 3 with 19 points.
	   Argentine striker Claudio `Piojo' Lopez scored two goals as
Valencia drubbed Real Madrid 3-1 and moved to No. 5 on equal points
with Madrid which is at No. 4.
	   On Sunday, Racing de Santander drew 1-1 against Espanyol,
mid-ranking Deportivo downed third-last Villarreal 2-1 while
Salamanca sank bottom-placed Extremadura by the same score.
	   Other 11th-round results this weekend were: Tenerife 0, Athletic
de Bilbao 1; Atletico de Madrid 6, Valladolid 1; Oviedo 0, Betis 1
; Real Sociedad 0, Zaragoza 0.
	   In the highest scoring match of the round Atletico de Madrid
thrashed Valladolid 6-1 to leave the side at No. 6 with 17 points
and ease the pressure on Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi.
 &UR; Espanyol 1, Racing 1 &QC; 
	   Former Real Madrid star Victor Sanchez drove the ball home with
a 20-yard (meter) shot in the 73rd minute to draw Racing level with
Espanyol. The homeside had taken the lead with a 55th minute goal
by Joan Rivera.
	   Racing now has 16 points while Espanyol has 13.
 &UR; Deportivo de La Coruna 2, Villarreal 1 &QC; 
	   Division newcomer Villarreal took the lead with a 15th-minute
goal by Moises Garcia. But Deportivo's Moroccan defender Nourredene
Naybet slipped in an equalizer in the 37th and Argentine Oscar
Flores made it 2-1 five minutes after the break.
	   Deportivo has 17 points while Villarreal stays with 10.
 &UR; Salamanca 2, Extremadura 1 &QC; 
	   Argentine striker Manuel Alejandro Cardetti put Salamanca ahead
in the 63rd minute. Felix Carvallo drew Extremadura level three
minutes later but Rumanian Catalin Munteanu clinched the victory
for Salamanca with a goal in the 75th.
	   Salamanca edged upward from the lower ranks with 14 points while
Extremadura stayed bottom of the 20-team first division after this
seventh defeat in 11 rounds.

U.S. drug agent killed in Colombia

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed
early Sunday in an entertainment district of Bogota, apparently
after an argument in a bar, authorities said.
	   Frank Arnold Moreno, 37, was shot once through the chest in the
city's ``Zona Rosa,'' or Pink Zone, at about 1 a.m. outside the El
Divino bar, U.S. officials said.
	   Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about a year, was not with
any other Drug Enforcement Administration agents at the time and
was slain after what one U.S. Embassy official called ``a bar
brawl.''
	   ``I don't think it had anything to do with drugs,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I understand he
was walking away and then boom, boom.''
	   Moreno was taken by two witnesses to a Bogota hospital, where he
was declared dead. It was not immediately known whether Moreno was
shot from the front or behind, whether he was carrying a gun or
whether he himself fired any shots.
	   Another embassy official said Moreno and the man who killed him
was told to leave the bar just before the shooting. Police said
they were pursuing a suspect.
	   The shooting occurred in Bogota's most active nightlife area, an
upscale neighborhood of restaurants, bars and discotheques that is
packed with people well after midnight on weekends.
	   Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, was recently married and had
previously been assigned to Oklahoma City, officials said, adding
that his wife lived with him in Bogota.
	   Authorities would not say whether the killing was directly
related to a drug investigation; Colombian drug traffickers, who
have been trying to keep a low profile after the 1995 arrests of
the Cali cartel's top leaders, know that murdering a U.S. drug
agent would likely trigger a feverish investigative backlash.
	   U.S. officials said they did not think a DEA agent had ever been
killed in Colombia before. Two DEA agents were shot and wounded in
this country in 1982, in the Caribbean port of Cartagena, while
investigating marijuana smuggling.
	   The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's
leading producer and exporter of cocaine. Some 80 percent of the
cocaine and a growing amount of the heroin sold on U.S. streets
comes from Colombia.
	   Colombia has one of the world's highest murder rates, with about
27,000 murders a year, the vast majority unrelated to the country's
civil conflict and drug trafficking.

Door open for Sainz to win title as Makinen skids out of race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES after end of day's racing, ADDS Sainz quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Championship leader Tommy Makinen
handed rival Carlos Sainz a big chance to take the world title in
the final race of the season Sunday when he skidded out on day one
of the Network Q rally of Britain.
	   The Finn, who led the Spaniard by two points going into the
three-day race around England and Wales, skidded on a patch of oil
on stage five, hit a concrete barrier and the impact ripped the
right rear wheel from his Mitsubishi Lancer.
	   Forced the drop out of the race, Makinen, who was aiming for a
third world title in a row, was left to wait to see how Sainz
performed. The Spaniard, driving a Toyota Corolla, needed to finish
fourth or higher to take the world title for the third time
although first since 1992.
	   Makinen was convinced he had thrown the title away.
	   ``It happened on the first left-hand bend. There was black stuff
on the surface and it just threw me completely,'' the Finn said of
the accident. ``I am very upset, I have thrown the championship
away.''
	   After the 14 stages of day one, Sainz placed second to another
for world titlist, Colin McRae, who led the Spaniard by 3.6 seconds
in a Subaru Impreza.
	   ``Tommi has gone but the pressure is still there,'' Sainz said.
``I've got to finish in the top four yet.''

D'Alema: Italy's position on Ocalan coherent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Turkey-Italy-Kurds &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos GEV101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italy has been ``absolutely coherent'' in refusing
to extradite to Turkey a rebel Kurdish leader, Italian Premier
Massimo D'Alema said Sunday.
	   ``We have not given (Abdullah) Ocalan asylum,'' D'Alema stressed
after an informal meeting with former Turkish premier Erdal Inonu.
Both are in Geneva for a Socialist International meeting.
	   A Rome court on Friday rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for
Ocalan. It cited Italian law forbidding extradition of suspects to
countries where they might face the death penalty.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan the most ruthless of terrorists. Rebels
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have fought for Kurdish
autonomy since 1984.
	   ``We condemn terrorism and we also condemn the PKK's
terrorism,'' D'Alema told reporters.
	   Italy favors a ``peaceful solution'' of the conflict between
Turkey and Kurdish rebels, he continued. But ``this solution
requires the recognition of the Kurdish people's rights.''
	   ``Our position is absolutely coherent with our law and the
principles of international civil law,'' D'Alema said. In contrast,
Italy considers Turkey's reaction ``serious and negative,'' he
added.
	   The Italian premier recalled a statement last week in which
Ocalan said he is prepared to act to stop terrorism.
	   Hundreds of companies and business groups in Turkey have
announced a boycott of Italian goods over the freeing of Ocalan.
	   Under the Italian court's orders, Ocalan must stay in Rome until
Dec. 23 to give Germany time to decide whether it wants to
extradite him on its own warrant on terrorism charges.
	   ``We arrested Ocalan on the basis of a German magistrate's
arrest warrant,'' D'Alema. ``The German government has 40 days to
decide.''

Jewish settlers take over historic railroad station

	   SEBASTIA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settler youths raised Israeli
flags over a long-abandoned but highly symbolic railroad station
Sunday in the heart of the West Bank and demanded government
permission to establish a religious seminary and museum there.
	   The 30 settlers, mostly high school students from a nearby
settlement, said they were acting in defiance of the latest
land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians under which Israel
withdrew from 2 percent of the West Bank Friday.
	   ``We build and continue to build ... in spite of agreements ...
as soon as the land is ours,'' said Rivka Bond one of the settlers.
	   After the group put up flags on the derelict building and began
to clean it up, an army officer served them with a military order
declaring the station a closed military area to be evacuated.
	   One of the settlers, a lawyer, read the order and said it was
illegal. The officer withdrew to consult with his superiors, but
the army sealed off the area anyhow to prevent the arrival of more
settlers.
	   The group strung lights on the building and put out tables of
food. Police spokesman Ofer Sivan said the settlers voluntarily
dispersed but that it was unclear if they had plans to return soon.
	   The Jewish settlement movement was born in Sebastia 23 years ago
when young religious Israeli nationalists first occupied the
railway station in defiance of the then-Labor government, which was
opposed to settling in densely populated, predominantly Palestinian
areas.
	   However the squatters were openly supported by the National
Religious Party, a junior partner in the coalition government at
the time. Although the settlers were eventually evicted from the
station, the government allowed the establishment of Kedoumim, the
first Jewish settlement in the northern West Bank, and it was soon
followed by others.
	   Today, some 150,000 Jews live in 144 Jewish settlements
throughout the West Bank, land which the Palestinians want for a
future independent state for the 1.6 million Arabs living there as
well.
	   Since the current Israeli government signed a peace deal with
the Palestinians in Washington last month, Jewish settlers have
increased their activities, taking over hilltops and expanding
existing settlements with government backing. Two trailer homes and
tents were set-up on a hilltop near the settlement of Bat Ayin
Sunday. Settlers laid a sewage pipe and said they would develop the
hilltop.
	   Settlers were staunch supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu until he signed the latest deal. Now, they say they will
run a candidate against Netanyahu in the next elections.
	   Under the accord, Israel will continue to withdraw from a total
of 13 percent of the West Bank in a deal which will leave some 18
settlements isolated and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled
territory.
	   Settler leaders Sunday rejected as ``too little,'' a list of
security measures proposed for those settlements by the defense
ministry including surveillance equipment and electric fences.
	   In a letter to the army, the settlers demanded armored buses,
machine guns, tear gas, search-lights, closed-circuit television, a
helicopter landing pad at each settlement, immediate completion of
bypass roads around Palestinian cities and a long list of other
facilities and devices.
	   To finance the building of the bypass roads and relocation of
Israeli army camps, Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman left for
Washington Sunday to request American aid. A U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Israel was expected to ask
for dlrs. 1.2 billion.
	   In another development, the Israeli army Sunday destroyed a
house near the West Bank city of Hebron where two Islamic militant
leaders hid before Israeli soldiers gunned them down in September.
	   The two fugitives, Adel and Imad Awadallah, were wanted by
Israel for alleged involvement in Hamas attacks which killed at
least five Israelis.
	   And at least 10 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails went on
hunger strikes Sunday to protest Israel's refusal to include them
in a mass prisoner release.
	   Under the latest peace accord, Israel is to release 750
Palestinian prisoners. However Palestinian leaders were angry when
they learned that most of the first 250 set free Friday were common
criminals and not Palestinians jailed for activities against
Israel, as they had wanted.
	   Netanyahu told his Cabinet Sunday that the next 500 prisoners to
be released would be criminals who had not committed murders,
Israel Television said.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said that most of the
security prisoners Israel was prepared to hand over had already
been released.
	   Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accused
Netanyahu of violating the agreement which he said specifically
called for the release of so-called political prisoners.
	   But Larry Schwartz, spokesman for the U.S. embassy said he was
``not aware of any violation of the Wye agreement.''
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials are expected to discuss the
prisoner issue later this week.

Albania referendum on draft Constitution calm as opposition boycott
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh comments from OSCE, opposition leader
disputing referendum, latest turnout results. Results expected
Monday at 1700 GMT. Daan correct in 14th graf, spokesman correct

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Turnout was modest but peaceful Sunday
when Albanians voted on a controversial referendum intended to give
the country its first post-communist constitution.
	   Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor
suburb of the capital, Tirana, said the draft constitution would
help boost prosperity in Europe's poorest nation.
	   Albania's powerful opposition Democratic Party urged its
supporters to boycott the vote and said the apparently low turnout
reflected the government's feeble support.
	   About 46 per cent of nearly two million eligible voters had cast
their ballots by 5 p.m. (1600 GMT). The country's 4,700 polling
stations closed two hours later, but final results weren't expected
until late Monday.
	   ``The whole referendum was pretty quiet, even though everybody
kept saying that bad things would happen,'' said Andrea Angeli,
spokesman for an observer mission from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Violence has marred past voting in Albania, mostly between
opposing factions squaring off outside polling booths. But the
boycott kept most opposition supporters away, while snow closed
four roads in northern Albania and slowed or halted voting in some
areas.
	   The draft constitution, written with advice from Western legal
experts, would outline basic civil, human and democratic rights in
a Balkan nation that shed Europe's most isolated communist
dictatorship in 1991.
	   It would give Albanians the legal right to change their religion
and identify themselves as members of an ethnic minority. It would
also define property rights and allow the government to expropriate
land in the national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian.'' They
predict that many people will turn away from Islam, Albania's
dominant religion, to avoid discrimination if they leave to work in
richer, non-Muslim neighboring nations like Greece.
	   Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, the chief opposition
politician who played a key role in anti-government unrest earlier
this year, said no more than 31 percent of eligible voters cast
ballots.
	   ``The Albanians turned down the proposal of the most corrupted
government in Europe,'' he said in a press conference an hour after
polls closed. Berisha is a former president who was forced to
resign after months of anarchy last year.
	   Western officials see the boycott as an attempt to force the
government into calling early elections.
	   The government, fearing low voter turnout, recently scrapped a
law requiring a turnout of more than 50 percent to validate a
referendum. Any number of voters would now be sufficient, and the
draft was seen as almost certain to pass.
	   Other than an unusually heavy police presence, the streets of
Tirana showed no signs of tension. Residents perused street
vendors' wares and sipped coffee on sidewalk tables.
	   Voters who spoke to reporters at polling booths said they
supported the draft constitution.
	   ``I voted yes because we at least have to be optimistic,'' said
Hasan Malolli, 56, a teacher who voted in a Tirana suburb. ``Hope
is the only thing that we can really do.''

	   EL EJIDO, Spain (AP) _ Up to 2,000 immigrants, mostly from North
Africa, marched through this southeastern Spanish town Sunday to
demand better living and working conditions as well as an
investigation into the death of a Moroccan worker last week.
	   With banners bearing slogans reading ``Dignity'', the march was
attended by workers from the fruit and vegetable farms of the
surrounding province of Almeria, one of Spain's most productive
agricultural regions.
	   The demonstration was called by the Association of Moroccan
Workers in Spain which has threatened to stage strikes unless there
are developments in the case concerning the killing of Abdelkhak El
Ammary who was found shot to death on the town's outskirts last
Sunday.
	   Police said initial investigations indicate the killing may have
been a settling of accounts between immigrants but the workers'
group believe it may been a case of racism.
	   Spain has an estimated 300,000 immigrants, many of whom have no
work or residency permits.
	   Each year dozens of people enter the country illegally from
North Africa. Many seek work in Spain while others continue on to
France and other European countries.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Dariush Foruhar, an opposition figure and
former labor minister, has been stabbed to death along with his
wife at their Tehran home, relatives said Sunday.
	   It was not clear who killed Foruhar and his wife or what their
motive may have been, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Sunday. It said police were investigating the deaths.
	   Relatives and neighbors who gathered in front of Foruhar's home
in central Tehran said the two were killed Saturday and their
bodies discovered Sunday.
	   The Iranian news agency had reported that the two were killed
Sunday.
	   Foruhar was the leader of the People's Party of Iran, a small
opposition group in Iran that is tolerated by the government.
	   He served as minister of labor and social affairs in the
provisional government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the monarchy.

Frenchman shocks field to win men's slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new results. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Pierrick Bourgeat of France, mastering a
course badly rutted by snow and warming temperatures, skied from
14th place to a stunning victory Sunday in a men's World Cup
slalom.
	   Bourgeat, whose best previous performance was a second last
year, made up over two seconds on the field in the afternoon run,
thanks in large part to his skill at maneuvering through ruts that
tossed around his competition like rag dolls.
	   A second run of 51.19 seconds, although not the fastest of the
afternoon, was 1.5 or more seconds ahead of anyone else who skied
late in the session.
	   Bourgeat completed two runs in 1 minute, 43.34 seconds, a
healthy .44 seconds faster than Norway's Olympic champion,
Hans-Petter Buraas, who led the Frenchman by 1.67 seconds after a
Sunday morning session that took place during a snowstorm.
	   Although blue skies reappeared for the second run, an army of
course workers was unable to sweep away the snow cover, and the
racers soon turned that loose snow into huge ruts, particularly on
the gates midway down the steep portion of the Clementine layout.
	   Austria's Christian Mayer, who would claim third in 1:44.02, had
just finished when the five heavy hitters from the first run, four
Norwegians and a Slovenian, lined up to try their luck.
	   Each charged from the gate and handled the top gates well, but
each then was jostled from gate to gate midway down the steeps.
Slovenia's Jure Kosir, second in the morning, almost came to a halt
after crashing into one of the ruts, a collision that helped drop
him to 12th.
	   Buraas came closest to mastering the mid-steep minefield,
although he couldn't approach Burgeat's time. Kjetil Andre Aamodt,
a close fifth in the morning, fell to a tie for ninth and teammate
Ole Kristian Furuseth slipped from fourth to 16th.
	   First-run leader Finn Christian Jagge, who enjoyed a 1.89-second
bulge over Bourgeat after the first run, slipped back to a tie for
fourth with Germany's Markus Eberle in 1:44.06, losing an amazing
2.61 seconds to the Frenchman.
	   It was the first French slalom victory since a 1996 triumph by
Sebastian Amiez, who settled for sixth on Sunday. Rounding out the
top 10 were Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, Canada's Thomas Grandi
and, tied for ninth, Aamodt and Frenchman Francois Simond.

three wins

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Argentinian Jose Meolans beat
Brazilian Gustavo Borges Sunday to win the 50 meters freestyle
event at a short-course World Cup meet here.
	   Meolans' victory, in a time of 22.32 seconds, meant he swapped
places on the podium with Borges, who defeated him in the 100
meters freestyle race a day earlier.
	   Top Brazilian swimmer Fernando Scherer finished fifth and blamed
his poor performance on fitness. ``I have had a couple of weeks off
and am not in top form,'' he said.
	   Brazilian Luiz Lima took first place in the men's 1500
freestyle, setting a new South American record with a time of 14
minutes, 57.87 seconds.
	   Britain's Susan Rolph, who won both the 100 meter freestyle and
100 meter individual medley Sunday, earned her second and third
gold medals at the weekend meet.
	   Meanwhile, Germany's Jens Kruppa had the same tally of gold
medals in the men's events after winning the 100 meters
breaststroke Sunday in 1 minute, 1.23 seconds.
	   ``It went excellently and was a good test for the Olympics,''
Kruppa said afterward.
	   Australians Robert Van der Sant and Ian Thorpe won three and two
races respectively over two days. Thorpe won the 200 meters
freestyle in 1 minute, 46.26 seconds on Sunday.
	   Throughout the meet, Australia collected 10 gold medals, Germany
was second with nine and Brazil had five.

Clinton mixes with front-line troops to make point to North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Leads throughout to RECAST. Clinton scheduled to arrive in
Guam at 0315 GMT, first remarks scheduled for 0350 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea (AP) _ From muddy tanks and troops at
an Army outpost to an Air Force U-2 spy plane hangar, U.S.
President Bill Clinton tried to spotlight American military might
Sunday across the Demilitarized Zone from a still-hostile North
Korea.
	   ``North Korea must maintain its freeze on _ and move ahead to
dismantle _ its nuclear weapons program,'' Clinton declared to
hundreds of troops and their families huddled in freezing cold
outside a hangar that houses U-2s of the ``Black Cat'' 5th
Reconnaissance Squadron.
	   Later the president was flying to Guam, the Pacific island U.S.
territory that hosts Andersen Air Force Base, a staging base for
American warplanes that would be used in a war in Asia. From Guam,
Clinton was returning to Washington on Monday after a five-day Asia
tour.
	   Clinton's brief Guam stop included a visit to the War in the
Pacific National Park on Asan Bay. At the end of World War II, the
U.S. government had control of more than 65 percent of the island's
212 square miles (550 square kilometers), and now has about 33
percent, including the sprawling Andersen Air Force Base and
several Navy posts. It is under local pressure to give up even
more. About 6,900 U.S. military men and women are stationed on
Guam.
	   At Osan on Sunday, Clinton demanded that North Korea _ whose
forces have been arrayed against U.S. and South Korean troops along
the Demilitarized Zone for more than four decades _ also stop
developing and exporting chemical weapons and ballistic missiles.
	   ``Until it fully commits itself to a constructive role on this
peninsula,'' Clinton said, ``we must remain ready. And thanks to
you, we will,'' he told the troops, assembled from the ranks of the
37,000-strong U.S. forces stationed in South Korea.
	   Clinton used his weekend in South Korea to focus mainly on the
security threat to the South from the communist North, whose
military is large but limited by an economy that is in shambles.
Clinton last visited U.S. troops in South Korea in 1993, shortly
after he took office.
	   ``In the five years since I last met with our troops along the
DMZ, we have seen some hopeful signs,'' Clinton said at Osan, home
of the 51st Fighter Wing and 7th Air Force headquarters. Behind him
sat two A-10 Warthog ground-attack planes and one F-16 fighter.
	   The North has engaged in preliminary talks on a peace treaty to
replace the so-called temporary armistice that brought the 1950-53
Korean War to an end, Clinton noted. And U.S. and North Korean
military officers have held talks aimed at preventing problems
along the DMZ.
	   Earlier Sunday, Clinton and his national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, flew by helicopter north of Seoul to the Korean Training
Center where units of the American Army's 2nd Infantry Division
train between the rocky mountain ridges about 10 miles (15
kilometers) from the DMZ.
	   Clinton reviewed a row of U.S. and Korean armored vehicles,
including M-1 battle tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, and
shared a lunch of Meals-Ready-to-East _ the packaged, high-caloric
food that sustains soldiers in the field _ with troops in a heated
hut.
	   Setting a light mood, Clinton announced to a crowd of troops
that it was Sgt. Maj. Charles Thomas's 45th birthday, and he led
them in singing ``Happy Birthday'' to Thomas. Thomas said later,
``I really appreciate him doing it. It definitely caught me off
guard.''
	   The troops crowded around their commander-in-chief, shook hands,
posed for pictures with him and followed him with video cameras.

Steinbrenner reportedly set to sell Yankees

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more details; ADDS byline. &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Steinbrenner reportedly has reached an
agreement in principle to sell the New York Yankees to Cablevision
Systems Corp. for dlrs 550 million to dlrs 600 million.
	   As part of the sale, Steinbrenner would remain in charge of
day-to-day operations of the team.
	   NBC Sports said the deal was agreed to on Thursday and called
for Steinbrenner to turn over full ownership of the team to the
cable network for dlrs 600 million.
	   The Daily News reported the sale would be completed after Jan. 1
for tax reasons and said it called for Cablevision to buy 70
percent of the team for dlrs 550 million.
	   Cablevision president James Dolan, whose father is chairman of
the company, said Sunday he would not comment on ``rumors or
speculation.'' He said Cablevision ``maintains an active interest
in the future of our relationship with Mr. Steinbrenner and the
Yankees.''
	   Howard Rubenstein, who handles public relations for
Steinbrenner, confirmed the Yankees' owner had been talking with
Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan but said there was nothing to
announce.
	   Arthur Richman, a senior adviser to Steinbrenner, said of the
reported sale: ``We've been hearing this for weeks. He's never told
us.''
	   If the deal goes through at either of the reported prices, it
would be a record for a baseball team and the second-highest price
ever paid for a sports franchise behind the pending dlrs 1 billion
sale of the English soccer team Manchester United to Rupert
Murdoch.
	   Earlier this year, Murdoch paid dlrs 311 million for the Los
Angeles Dodgers and Alfred Lerner paid dlrs 530 million last month
for the rights to a National Football League expansion team in
Cleveland.
	   Charles Dolan and his brother, Larry, were finalists for the NFL
team with a bid of dlrs 500 million. Earlier, Charles Dolan became
a major player in sports with the purchase of Madison Square Garden
and that arena's two pro U.S. teams, the National Basketball
Association's New York Knicks and the National Hockey League's New
York Rangers.
	   Part of that purchase included Madison Square Garden Network,
which holds broadcast rights to the Yankees in a 12-year, dlrs 486
million deal that expires in two years. By purchasing the team,
Cablevision assures itself of retaining those rights, a major asset
for the network.
	   Cablevision, the country's sixth largest cable company, also
owns Radio City Music Hall, a chain of New York City home appliance
stores and the Broadway show ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.''
	   Talks have gone on for some time between the Yankees and
Cablevision and Steinbrenner reported on them to his limited
partners during two days of meetings in Cleveland last week.
	   Steinbrenner, 68, led a group that paid dlrs 10 million to
purchase the Yankees from CBS in 1973. He has seen the value of the
team zoom, particularly with two World Series championships in the
last three years and a record 125 victories last season.

Motorcyclist dies from injuries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A 27-year-old motorcyclist injured
during the second Classic Adelaide Rally on Saturday died in
hospital early Monday, police said.
	   The man, whose name was not released, is the second person to be
killed during the rally in as many years. Last year, former Formula
One Grand Prix chairman Ian Cocks was killed while competing in the
inaugural event.
	   Cocks died when his Porsche crashed during a competitive section
in the Adelaide Hills and burst into flames. His daughter, who was
navigating at the time, was rescued from the wreckage.
	   In Saturday's crash, the motorcyclist collided with a rare 1956
XKSS Jaguar being driven by English auctioneer Robert Brooks in the
International Parade Group section of the rally.
	   Police impounded the million-dollar car, which is on loan from a
Dutch museum, while the incident is being investigated.
	   The four-day rally was won by South Australians Andrew Cavalli
and Michael Dale in a Ford Escort RS-1600. (djp)

Winner to have heart condition re-checked
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Howell to see doctor over heart condition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian PGA golf champion David
Howell will see a medical specialist when he gets back to England
in an effort to diagnose a heart condition.
	   The 23-year-old Howell's heart started racing at times during
the final round of the tournament at the New South Wales course
Sunday and he said it could only partially be attributed to the
stress of chasing his first win as a professional.
	   At the 16th hole Howell was leading by seven shots and cruising
to victory when he surprised spectators by getting friend and
caddie Jason Hempleman to put his hand on his chest.
	   ``I was saying `feel how fast that is going','' said Howell,
with a laugh following his seven-shot win over Australia's Terry
Price and Trinidad's Stephen Ames.
	   ``I've had this for a couple of years, my heart races and it's
not just under pressure or stress, it happens quite often.
	   ``I did find it happened quite a lot today so obviously I was
feeling the stress a bit.''
	   Howell said the condition was not a major concern and an
examination by a hospital doctor before he came to Australia had
found nothing amiss.
	   ``But I am going to get it checked out when I get home because I
can't put up with that every time I am doing well in a
tournament.''
	   Howell was under no great attack Sunday as he converted his
six-stroke overnight lead to victory at 13-under-par 275, shooting
a methodical closing 68 with two birdies on each nine and not one
dropped shot.
	   The closest anyone got was when Price birdied the fifth hole to
move within five strokes but Howell was seven clear at the turn and
two more quick birdies had it sewn up.
	   Price sank a seven-foot putt for birdie at the last for a 69
which lifted him into a tie with Ames who made par on the hole and
shot 68.
	   ``Really the whole of the back nine I knew I was totally in
control if I kept my head so it was a nice way to score my first
win,'' said Howell.
	   Price acknowledged the chasers had failed to apply pressure on
the Englishman.
	   ``I was disappointed with the fact that I let it (putting
problems) get to me,'' said Price, who was a runnerup in 1994.
	   ``I played nicely in the first 12 holes but nothing was
happening and I got frustrated and let it creep into my long
game.'' (djp)

Batistuta scores again; Fiorentina leads Roma, Juve, Milan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milan beating Lazio in late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's league-high 11th goal of the
season spurred Fiorentina to a 3-1 win over injury-riddled
Internazionale of Milan on Sunday that put his club back alone atop
the Serie A standings.
	   The Argentine striker drove a low, 20-meter (yard) free kick
through the defensive wall in the 16th minute to put Fiorentina
ahead 2-1 after an early barrage of goals.
	   The victory improved Fiorentina's record to 7-0-3 for 21 points,
three more than a trio of clubs tied for second: AS Roma, AC Milan,
and two-time defending champion Juventus of Turin, which played a
drab 0-0 draw with lowly Empoli.
	   ``It was ugly,'' admitted Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, whose
club was shut out for a second straight game. ``We didn't play well
and failed to create any scoring chances.''
	   AC Milan beat Lazio of Rome 1-0 Sunday night on Brazilian
substitute Leonardo's goal in the second minute of injury time.
Roma, meanwhile, rallied for a 1-1 draw with Bari on Saturday that
temporarily put the capital's club into a first place tie with
Fiorentina.
	   At Florence, Inter played without hurt strikers Ronaldo and
Nicola Ventola and winger Francesco Moriero, plus saw veteran
Roberto Baggio leave after 68 somewhat effective minutes.
	   But Baggio, making just his second start of the season because
of knee tendon problems, was brought down in the penalty area by
'keeper Francesco Toldo three minutes into the game. Youri
Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup champions, connected on
the spot kick _ his third in two games _ to put the visitors ahead.
	   Fiorentina tied the score within two minutes, as defender
Pasquale Padalino slammed in a loose ball when Inter failed to
clear following a corner kick.
	   After Batistuta, on pace to break the record of 33 goals in a
season, gave Fiorentina the lead, German defender Jorg Heinrich
fixed the final score in the 75th with his first goal in Italy, off
a perfect assist from Brazil's Edmundo.
	   Heinrich's goal came four minutes after Inter nearly tied the
score when captain Giuseppe Bergomi's shot hit the post.
	   ``My team was balanced and intelligent. We fully deserved this
victory,'' said Fiorentina coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who led Inter
to its last league title, in 1989. ``If we keep playing like this,
we can fight for the title.''
	   Inter coach Luigi Simoni's job status must again be in doubt now
that his team _ touted by many as a title favorite _ sits tied for
sixth place with a mediocre 4-3-3 record. Inter last lost at
Florence in 1987.
	   In addition to the injury problems, Inter has to fix a weak
defense. Only one of the league's 18 clubs has given up more goals
than the 17 Inter has allowed.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Udinese edged Piacenza 1-0 to snap a six-game
winless streak, Salernitana beat last-place Venezia 1-0, and
Argentine striker Ariel Ortega missed a penalty kick as Sampdoria
of Genoa settled for a 0-0 draw with Vicenza.
	   On Saturday, Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon's goal with 13
minutes left gave Cagliari a 1-0 upset over AC Parma, and Bologna
and Perugia drew 1-1.
 &UR; Milan 1, Lazio 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Leonardo slotted in Liberian striker George Weah's
pass with a left-footed shot from the top of the penalty area to
drop Lazio (3-4-3) into ninth place. Before Leonardo connected,
Milan (5-3-2) had wasted a slew of chances, including when Maurizio
Ganz hit the crossbar in the 15th minute.
 &UR; Juventus 0, Empoli 0 &QC;

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Pierrick Bourgeat of France, mastering a
course badly rutted by snow and warming temperatures, skied from
14th place to a stunning victory Sunday in a men's World Cup
slalom.
	   Bourgeat, whose best previous performance was a second last
year, made up over two seconds on the field in the afternoon run,
thanks in large part to his skill at maneuvering through ruts that
tossed around his competition like rag dolls.
	   A second run of 51.19 seconds, although not the fastest of the
afternoon, was 1.5 or more seconds ahead of anyone else who skied
late in the session.
	   Bourgeat completed two runs in 1 minute, 43.34 seconds, a
healthy .44 seconds faster than Norway's Olympic champion,
Hans-Petter Buraas, who led the Frenchman by 1.67 seconds after a
Sunday morning session that took place during a snowstorm.
	   Although blue skies reappeared for the second run, an army of
course workers was unable to sweep away the snow cover, and the
racers soon turned that loose snow into huge ruts, particularly on
the gates midway down the steep portion of the Clementine layout.
	   Austria's Christian Mayer, who would claim third in 1:44.02, had
just finished when the five heavy hitters from the first run, four
Norwegians and a Slovenian, lined up to try their luck.
	   Each charged from the gate and handled the top gates well, but
each then was jostled from gate to gate midway down the steeps.
Slovenia's Jure Kosir, second in the morning, almost came to a halt
after crashing into one of the ruts, a collision that helped drop
him to 12th.
	   Buraas came closest to mastering the mid-steep minefield,
although he couldn't approach Burgeat's time. Kjetil Andre Aamodt,
a close fifth in the morning, fell to a tie for ninth and teammate
Ole Kristian Furuseth slipped from fourth to 16th.
	   First-run leader Finn Christian Jagge, who enjoyed a 1.89-second
bulge over Bourgeat after the first run, slipped back to a tie for
fourth with Germany's Markus Eberle in 1:44.06, losing an amazing
2.61 seconds to the Frenchman.
	   It was the first French slalom victory since a 1996 triumph by
Sebastian Amiez, who settled for sixth on Sunday. Rounding out the
top 10 were Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, Canada's Thomas Grandi
and, tied for ninth, Aamodt and Frenchman Francois Simond.

Hingis wins Chase Championships

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Beating the player who seized her No. 1 ranking,
Martina Hingis ended a six-month dry spell Sunday by capturing the
Chase Championships.
	   With her mobility and court savvy in full display, Hingis
negated the power of Lindsay Davenport and won the season-ending
tournament 7-5, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
	   It was Hingis' first victory in this dlrs 2 million event and
her first tournament title since the Italian Open in May.
	   Davenport, the world's No. 1 player, ended an outstanding year
on a down note, losing the final match of the season for the second
straight time. She lost the Championships final to Gabriela
Sabatini in 1994.
	   This was supposed to be Davenport's time, especially after she
beat a resurgent Steffi Graf in Saturday's semifinals. Instead, it
was the 17-year-old from Switzerland who walked away with the
trophy, named on Sunday for Billie Jean King. Hingis also collected
dlrs 500,000.
	   For 80 weeks, Hingis was ranked No. 1, until Davenport moved
into the top spot after beating the teen-ager in the U.S. Open
final two months ago. On Sunday, Hingis gave notice this fight for
No. 1 will carry over to next year.
	   For the most part, Hingis matched Davenport stroke for stroke in
a power game and test of wills. But Hingis used drop shots to
exploit Davenport's lack of foot speed and agility. She also would
occasionally sneak to the net for volleys.
	   Davenport usually had only one card to play _ hit harder. And
while she repeatedly had break points, she rarely cashed them in,
converting only four of 16.
	   Hingis did only slightly better. But that's all it really took
to win the elite 16-player tournament.
	   Hingis, who won the Australian Open in January, became the only
woman this year to capture two of the sport's top five titles.

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Pierrick Bourgeat of France, mastering a

14th place to a stunning victory Sunday in a men's World Cup
slalom.
	   Bourgeat, whose best previous performance was a second last

thanks in large part to his skill at maneuvering through ruts that
tossed around his competition like rag dolls.
	   ``I don't like these conditions, but I still skied very hard,''
said Bourgeat, who was so overcome by his victory that he kept
forgetting words in the English language that he usually speaks
well. ``On my second run, I decided I must take chances.
	   ``It's great, it's wonderful, it's magnificent!''
	   A second run of 51.19 seconds, although not the fastest of the
afternoon, was 1.5 or more seconds ahead of anyone else who skied

	   Austria's Christian Mayer, who would claim third in 1:44.02,
said he ``didn't ski my best race, but this is a very tough course
under these conditions. I'm very excited about this weekend because
I'm skiing very well.''
	   Mayer, second in Friday's giant slalom, parlayed his two-podium
weekend into the lead in the World Cup overall standings. He has
190 points to 180 for teammate Stefan Eberharter, who doesn't ski
slalom.
	   Mayer had just finished when the five heavy hitters from the
first run, four Norwegians and a Slovenian, lined up to try their

Government to increase security measures around the Temple Mount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Concerned that it could be targeted by Jewish
and Christian extremists, a government committee alotted dlrs 12
million to upgrade security for the Temple Mount, home to Islam's
third holiest shrine, Israel radio reported.
	   The additional money would pay for the deployment of some 400
policemen and security devices such as closed circuit cameras and
sensor pads that would help protect the Al Aqsa and Dome of the
Rock mosques on the site, the report said.
	   The Temple Mount sits above Judaism's holiest site, the Western
Wall and where Jews believed the Second Temple was located before
it was destroyed in AD 70. The area in the walled Old City of
Jeruslem captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, is
considered the most sensitive spot in the Mideast conflict.
	   An assault on the site would likely trigger violence and upset
chances for a continuation of the peace process.

Jewish settlers take over historic railroad station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with settlers dispersing voluntarily, details on
release of Palestinian prisoners. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SEBASTIA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish youths raised Israeli flags
Sunday over the railroad station where the settlement movement was
born, and demanded government permission to establish a religious
seminary and museum at the abandoned building.
	   The 30 settlers, mostly high school students, said they were
acting in defiance of the latest land-for-peace agreement with the
Palestinians, under which Israel withdrew from 2 percent of the
West Bank on Friday.
	   ``We build and continue to build ... in spite of agreements ...
as soon as the land is ours,'' said Rivka Bond, one of the
settlers.
	   After the group put up flags and began to clean up the derelict
building, an army officer served them with an order declaring the
station a closed military area to be evacuated.
	   One of the settlers, a lawyer, said the order was illegal, but
the army sealed off the area to prevent the arrival of more
settlers.
	   Police spokesman Ofer Sivan said the settlers dispersed
voluntarily but it was unclear if they had plans to return soon.
	   The Jewish settlement movement was born in Sebastia 23 years ago
when young religious Israeli nationalists occupied the station in
defiance of the then-Labor government, which was opposed to
settling in densely populated, predominantly Palestinian areas.
	   Although the settlers were eventually evicted, the government
allowed the establishment of Kedoumim, the first Jewish settlement
in the northern West Bank, and it was soon followed by others.
	   About 150,000 Jews now live in 144 Jewish settlements throughout
the West Bank, where the Palestinians want to declare independence
for the 1.6 million Arabs living there.
	   Since the Israeli government signed a new peace deal with the
Palestinians last month, Jewish settlers have increased their
activities, taking over hilltops and expanding existing settlements
with government backing. Settlers put up trailer homes and tents
Sunday on a hilltop near the settlement of Bat Ayin, and said they
would develop the area.
	   Under the new accord, Israel will withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank, which will leave 18 Jewish settlements isolated and
surrounded by Palestinian-controlled territory. The Palestinians
already control about one-quarter of the territory.
	   Settler leaders rejected as ``too little,'' a list of security
measures including surveillance equipment and electric fences that
the defense ministry proposed for those settlements.
	   In a letter to the army published Sunday, settlers demanded
armored buses, machine guns, tear gas, a helicopter landing pad at
each settlement, immediate completion of bypass roads around
Palestinian cities and a long list of other facilities and devices.
	   Seeking U.S. aid to pay for the bypass roads and the relocation
of Israeli army camps, Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman left for
Washington on Sunday. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Israel was expected to ask for dlrs 1.2 billion.
	   In another development, the Israeli army Sunday destroyed a
house near the West Bank city of Hebron where two Islamic militant
leaders hid before Israeli soldiers gunned them down in September.
The two men, Adel and Imad Awadallah, had been wanted to Hamas
attacks that killed at least five Israelis.
	   And at least 10 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails went on
hunger strikes Sunday to protest Israel's refusal to include them
in a mass prisoner release.
	   Under the latest peace accord, Israel is to release 750
Palestinian prisoners. However Palestinian leaders were angry when
they learned that most of the first 250 set free Friday were common
criminals and not Palestinians jailed for activities against
Israel.
	   Netanyahu told his Cabinet Sunday that the next 500 prisoners to
be released would be criminals who had not committed murders,
Israel Television said.
	   Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accused
Netanyahu of violating the agreement, which he said specifically
called for the release of so-called political prisoners.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said he was not aware of
any violations of the peace accord.
	   Israeli and Palestinian officials are expected to discuss the
prisoner issue later this week.

Socialist finance ministers prepare euro-zone cooperation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lafontaine comments; TRIMS &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gathered Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The ministers released a document entitled ``The New European
Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new
ascendancy in the EU to make growth and job-creation the top
economic priority.
	   Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15
nations, including the four largest - Germany, France, Italy and
Britain.
	   ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together an open,
competitive and successful economy with a just and human society,''
the document says.
	   ``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment
society, a society in which there are job opportunities for all
citizens.''
	   The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be
staying out of the euro project for now.
	   Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the
meeting said the arrival of the euro heralded ``a new phase'' that
obliged nations to cooperate on areas such as taxation, prices and
wage policy. Sunday's meeting over dinner focused on taxes, said
Lafontaine.
	   The socialist ministers met on the eve of the regular monthly
meeting of all 15 EU nations, the first for Lafontaine whose Social
Democratic Party won elections in September.
	   In their 11-page ``policy agenda'' the socialists support public
spending on infrastructure and services and call for ``a social
contract ... which gives to all citizens a stake in the development
of the European economy.''
	   However the document also insists tight budgets are essential to
underpin the euro's stability. It lists ``a commitment to monetary
stability (and) sustained fiscal discipline'' as priorities.
	   The socialists call on the new European Central Bank to take
account of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its
starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc.
	   But Lafontaine the socialists were not seeking to undermine on
the bank's independence. ``We want a dialogue. In a democratic
society, such a proposal for a dialogue is no threat for the ECB's
independence,'' he told reporters after the meeting.
	   EU ministers will be able to repeat their recent calls for lower
rates Monday when they are joined by Wim Duisenberg, the central
bank's president.
	   Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy
differences persist among socialists governments over labor market
rules, taxes and public spending.
	   Lafontaine has found scant support for his call for exchange
rate targets to limit fluctuations between the euro and other major
world currencies. ``It won't be very soon that we'll have fixed
relations between the currency blocs,'' Edlinger said.
	   Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when ministers
debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to the
Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder
more of the burden.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of Turks angered by Italy's
release of a Kurdish rebel leader rallied in front of the Italian
Embassy on Sunday, part of a day of strident protests that had
Turks burning Italian-made clothes and setting fire to a Fiat.
	   Children stood waving the Turkish flag in the capital as scores
of trucks drove past blaring their horns and bearing banners that
declared: ``An end to trade with Italy.''
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Sunday that economic
relations with Italy would be reviewed and that Turkey would not
accept Italian offers for military contracts.
	   Two Italian companies were seen as front-runners for dlrs 10
million worth of defense contracts.
	   Hundreds of companies and business groups have announced a
boycott of Italian goods, seeking to punish Italy for its refusal
to extradite to Turkey rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who came to
Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum.
	   On Friday, a Rome court rejected a Turkish arrest warrant for
Ocalan, freeing him. The court cited Italian law forbidding
extradition of suspects to countries where they might face the
death penalty.
	   Sezgin said Ankara also would complain of Italy's attitude to
NATO, the military alliance to which both countries belong. Turkey
also planned to appeal the court's decision on Monday, the Anatolia
news agency said.
	   Turkey considers Ocalan the most ruthless of terrorists. Rebels
of his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have fought for Kurdish
autonomy since 1984; the conflict has killed close to 37,000
people.
	   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema insisted Sunday that Italy
condemned PKK terrorism but that its position was consistent with
Italian and international laws.
	   Italy favors a ``peaceful solution'' of the conflict between
Turkey and Kurdish rebels, he told reporters in Geneva. But ``this
solution requires the recognition of the Kurdish people's rights.''
	   Kurds are not recognized as an official minority in Turkey,
which does not grant them education and broadcasting rights.
	   ``We are not angry at the Italian people, but we are very angry
at the Italian prime minister,'' said Nesrim Tureli, one of the
thousands chanting before the embassy.
	   Demonstrations took place throughout Turkey, with protesters
burning Italian clothes and puppets of Ocalan, as well as an
Italian Fiat in the western town of Izmit.
	   Although the week of protests has largely been peaceful, Turkish
politicians have called for calm, fearing the rallies may turn
violent.
	   Signaling that Turkey would not tolerate any display of support
for the rebels, police have detained more than 3,000 members of the
pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party since Ocalan's arrest,
according to the party. Most have since been released; their leader
was arrested and charged with being a member of the PKK.
	   The Germany-based Kurdish news agency reported Sunday that a
member of the party was beaten to death Thursday in police custody.
Officials denied the allegations, which could not be independently
verified.
	   Under the court's orders, Ocalan must stay in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany time to decide whether it wants to extradite him on
its own, 1990 warrant on terrorism charges. Although Germany said
previously it has no plans to ask for Ocalan, a German federal
prosecutor issued a new warrant for Ocalan on Saturday.
	   Italy's ANSA news service quoted Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
as saying he now expected a German extradition request.
	   Meanwhile, a reported 35,000 troops were deployed in a
large-scale military operation in the southeastern province of
Tunceli against some 500 against PKK rebels, according to the Zaman
daily.

U.S. first lady winds up tour focusing on health in Haiti

	   PIGNON, Haiti (AP)_ Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
U.S.-supported hospitals in Haiti Sunday, one of the few
encouraging signs in a country rescued by the United States from
dictatorship but not from poverty.
	   Mrs. Clinton was winding up a tour of hurricane-ravaged Central
American and Caribbean countries where she promised more disaster
relief. She was to return home later Sunday.
	   In Haiti, she announced the United States would add another dlrs
2.1 million to a dlrs 12 million storm relief package.
	   But she focused her visit on health care in Haiti, the poorest
country in the Western Hemisphere.
	   Mrs. Clinton toured the Bienfaisance Hospital in Pignon, a small
northern farming town of 20,000 people, and complimented the
facilities more than 500 midwives for saving mothers' lives.
	   ``What you're doing is very important,'' she said. In Pignon,
only 190 of every 100,000 mothers die in childbirth, much lower
than the national rate of 456 per 100,000. The United States gives
the program dlrs 700,000 a year.
	   Also enthusiastic about the program was farmer Dereus Marcellus,
who was among more than 100 residents who greeted Mrs. Clinton, who
had arrived in Haiti on Saturday.
	   Marcellus, 33, said his wife died several years ago while giving
birth to their seventh child, who also died. ``The hospital was
going to teach us family planning. It was too late,'' he said.
	   ``His case is typical. That's why we need to move medical
education out of the capital and into the countryside,'' said Dr.
Arthur Fournier, professor of family medicine at the University of
Miami School of Medicine, which will provide technical assistance
to a new medical education program.
	   The dlrs 1 million pilot phase, with Bienfaisance Hospital as
its center, will be also financed by a Soros foundation of Soros.
	   Forty percent of Haiti's 8 million people have no access to
health care and 75 percent have no access to family planning
services.
	   One child in eight does not live to the age of 5, the highest
rate in the hemisphere. One in three is chronically malnourished.
	   Critics strongly objected when President Clinton sent 20,000
U.S. troops to Haiti in 1994 to end a military dictatorship and
halt a flood of boat people into Florida.
	   Four years later, hopes that the U.S. intervention would bring a
better life to the poverty-ridden nation have dimmed. The
government has been nearly paralyzed by a power struggle that some
fear could bring a return to dictatorship. Most foreign aid has
been held up because of the 18-month political stalemate and
foreign investors shun the country.

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Pierrick Bourgeat of France, mastering a
course badly rutted by snow and warming temperatures, skied from
14th place to a stunning victory in a men's World Cup slalom on
Sunday.
	   Bourgeat, whose best previous performance was a second last
year, made up over two seconds on the field in the afternoon run,
thanks in large part to his skill at maneuvering through ruts that
tossed his competition like rag dolls.
	   ``I don't like these conditions, but I still skied very hard,''
said Bourgeat, who was so overcome by his victory he kept
forgetting words in English, a language he speaks well. ``On my
second run, I decided I must take chances.
	   ``It's great, it's wonderful, it's magnificent!''
	   It was the first French slalom victory since a 1996 triumph by
Sebastian Amiez, who settled for sixth on Sunday.
	   Bourgeat had a second run of 51.19 seconds. Although not the
fastest of the afternoon, it was 1.5 or more seconds ahead of
anyone else who skied late in the session.
	   Bourgeat completed two runs in 1 minute, 43.34 seconds, a
healthy .44 seconds faster than Norway's Olympic champion,
Hans-Petter Buraas, who led the Frenchman by 1.67 seconds after a
morning session run during a snowstorm.
	   Although blue skies reappeared for the second run, an army of
course workers was unable to sweep away the snow cover, and the
racers soon built that loose snow into huge ruts, particularly on
the gates midway down the steep portion of the Clementine layout.
	   Austria's Christian Mayer, who would claim third in 1:44.02,
said he didn't ski his best.
	   ``But this is a very tough course under these conditions,'' he
said. ``I'm very excited about this weekend because I'm skiing very
well.''
	   Mayer, second in Friday's giant slalom, parlayed his two-podium
weekend into the lead in the World Cup overall standings. He has
190 points to 180 for teammate Stefan Eberharter, who doesn't ski
slalom.
	   Mayer had just finished when the five heavy hitters from the
first run, four Norwegians and a Slovenian, lined up to try their
luck.
	   Each charged from the gate and handled the top gates well, but
each was jostled from gate to gate midway down the steeps.
Slovenia's Jure Kosir, second in the morning, almost came to a halt
after crashing into one of the ruts, a collision that helped drop
him to 12th.
	   Buraas came closest to mastering the mid-steep minefield,
although he couldn't approach Burgeat's time. Kjetil Andre Aamodt,
a close fifth in the morning, dropped to a tie for ninth and
teammate Ole Kristian Furuseth went from fourth to 16th.
	   ``I had trouble with some of the bumps but I felt better at the
bottom,'' said Buraas, who has gone back to his natural brown hair
color after sporting a fright-wig red dye job for the Olympics.
``I'm glad to still be in the top three.''
	   First-run leader Finn Christian Jagge, who enjoyed a 1.89-second
lead over Bourgeat after the first run, slipped back to a tie for
fourth with Germany's Markus Eberle in 1:44.06, losing an amazing
2.61 seconds to the Frenchman.
	   Rounding out the top 10 were Austria's Thomas Stangassinger,
Canada's Thomas Grandi and, tied for ninth, Aamodt and Frenchman
Francois Simond.

Government to increase security measures around the Temple Mount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government has allotted dlrs 12
million to upgrade security at the Temple Mount, fearing the site
could be targeted by Jewish or Christian extremists, Israel radio
reported.
	   The Temple Mount is the third-holiest site in the Islamic
religion, home to the Al Aqsa and Dome of the rock mosques. The
additional money for pay for some 400 policemen and security
devices such as closed circuit cameras and sensor pads.
	   The Temple Mount sits above Judaism's holiest site, the Western
Wall, and is where Jews believed the Second Temple was located
before it was destroyed in 70 AD.
	   The area, located in the walled Old City of Jerusalem, is
considered the most sensitive spot in the Mideast conflict and near
the site of the crucifixion of Christ.
	   An assault on the site would likely trigger violence and upset
chances for a continuation of the peace process.

U.S. drug agent killed in Colombia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with authorities saying bystander shot, agent shot in
back. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed
early Sunday in an entertainment district of Bogota after an
argument in a bar, authorities said.
	   Frank Arnold Moreno, 37, was shot once in the back in the city's
``Zona Rosa,'' or Pink Zone, at about 1 a.m. outside the El Divino
bar, U.S. and Colombian officials said. A bystander was also shot
and wounded in the neck, they said, adding that police were
pursuing a suspect.
	   Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about a year, was not with
any other Drug Enforcement Administration agents at the time and
was slain after what one U.S. Embassy official called ``a bar
brawl.''
	   ``I don't think it had anything to do with drugs,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I understand he
was walking away and then boom, boom.''
	   Moreno was shot from behind and the 9mm bullet entered his torso
at kidney level, a senior Colombian police official said on
condition of anonymity. Two witnesses took Moreno to a Bogota
hospital, where he was declared dead.
	   It was not immediately known whether Moreno was carrying a gun,
who shot the bystander or how many shots were fired, the police
official said, adding that Moreno had initiated the quarrel. He did
not disclose the wounded man's identity or condition.
	   An embassy official said Moreno and the gunman had been told to
leave the bar just before the shooting, which occurred in Bogota's
most active nightlife area, an upscale neighborhood or restaurants,
bars and discotheques that is crowded with people well after
midnight on weekends.
	   Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, was recently married and had
previously been assigned to Oklahoma City, officials said, adding
that his wife lived with him in Bogota.
	   Authorities would not say whether the killing was directly
related to a drug investigation; Colombian drug traffickers, who
have been trying to keep a low profile after the 1995 arrests of
the Cali cartel's top leaders, know that murdering a U.S. drug
agent would likely trigger a feverish investigative backlash.
	   U.S. officials said they did not think a DEA agent had ever been
killed in Colombia before, although two were shot and wounded in
1982.
	   The DEA has an estimated 50 agents in Colombia, the world's
leading producer and exporter of cocaine. Some 80 percent of the
cocaine and a growing amount of the heroin sold on U.S. streets
comes from Colombia.
	   Colombia has one of the world's highest murder rates, with about
27,000 murders a year, the vast majority unrelated to the country's
civil conflict and drug trafficking.

Marion Jones, Haile Gebrselassie win IAAF awards

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix coding &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Marion Jones, who became the second
fastest woman ever in the 100 and 200 meters, and Haile
Gebrselassie, who set four world records, were named Sunday as the
IAAF athletes of the year.
	   The American sprinter, who picked up the award for the second
year in a row, dominated the 100 meters, 200 meters and long jump
and was an overwhelming choice for the women's prize.
	   While vote totals were not released, Jones' closest competitors
were believed to be French sprinter Christine Arron, the European
champion at 100 and 200, and Irish distance runner Sonia
O'Sullivan.
	   The men's contest was much closer, with Gebrselassie edging
Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who broke the 1,500-meter record.
	   The awards were presented at the International Amateur Athletic
Federation's annual gala in Monaco.
	   ``I've had a wonderful season and this just tops it off,'' said
Jones, who became the first woman in 50 years to win the 100, 200
and long jump at the USA Championships.
	   The former University of North Carolina basketball star compiled
an overall winning streak of 37 events that was snapped only when
Heike Dreschler beat her in the long jump at the World Cup in
Johannesburg, South Africa.
	   Jones clocked 10.90 seconds or better in 20 races in the 100 and
ran the fourth-fastest time ever _ 10.65 _ at the World Cup. The
only woman in history to run faster is the late Florence Griffith
Joyner, who holds the world record of 10.49.
	   Jones also ran the third fastest 200 meters in history, clocking
21.62 in Johannesburg. Only Griffith Joyner has run faster,
including the world record of 21.34.
	   Jones also won the women's overall IAAF Grand Prix title and was
one of three athletes (along with Gebrselassie and El Guerrouj) to
share the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot for going undefeated
in her event.
	   Jones, who got married on Oct. 3 to U.S. shot putter C.J.
Hunter, said she is skipping the entire indoor season _ including
the world indoor championships in Japan _ to concentrate on winning
four gold medals (100, 200, long jump and relay) at next year's
World Championships in Seville.
	   Jones is targetting five gold medals (100, 200, long jump and
two relays) at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   Gebrselassie, meanwhile, continued to establish himself as one
of the greatest distance runners in history as he went undefeated
in 1998 from 1,500 to 10,000 meters.
	   The diminutive Ethiopian set world indoor records at 2,000 and
3,000 meters, and smashed the outdoor records at 5,000 and 10,000 .
He also posted the year's fastest times in the 3,000.
	   ``This has been the best year of my career,'' he said. ``I've
dreamed of this athlete-of-the-year award for a long time.''
	   Gebrselassie said he thought he should have won the award in
1995 when he was edged out by British triple jumper Jonathan
Edwards.
	   Gebrselassie said he plans to run the 10,000 at the World
Championships in Seville, but he wouldn't rule out doubling in the
5,000. He said he will also concentrate on breaking Kenyan Daniel
Komen's world record in the 3,000.
	   The IAAF festivities also included a lifetime achievement award
for American heptathlete and long jumper Jackie Joyner Kersee, who
retired this year after an 18-year career that included six Olymic
medals and four world championship gold medals.
	   There were also tributes to Griffith Joyner, who died in
September at the age of 38 after suffering a seizure. Her husband,
Al Joyner, and daughter, Mary, attended the gala.

	   EL EJIDO, Spain (AP) _ Up to 2,000 immigrants, mostly from North
Africa, marched through this southeastern Spanish town Sunday to
demand better living and working conditions as well as an
investigation into the death of a Moroccan worker last week.
	   With banners bearing slogans reading ``Dignity,'' the march was
attended by workers from the fruit and vegetable farms of the
surrounding province of Almeria, one of Spain's most productive
agricultural regions.
	   The demonstration was called by the Association of Moroccan
Workers in Spain, which has threatened to stage strikes unless
there are developments in the case concerning the shooting death of
Abdelkhak El Ammary on the town's outskirts on Nov. 15.
	   Police said initial investigations indicate the killing may have
been a settling of accounts between immigrants, but the workers'
group believe it may been a case of racism.
	   Spain has an estimated 300,000 immigrants, many of whom have no
work or residency permits.
	   Each year dozens of people enter the country illegally from
North Africa. Many seek work in Spain while others continue on to
France and other European countries.

Socialist finance ministers prepare euro-zone cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with German minister saying socialists are not trying
to undermine bank's authority. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Finance ministers from the European
Union's 11 left-leaning governments gathered Sunday to prepare for
intensified economic policy coordination after the launch of the
euro as the EU's shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The ministers released a document entitled ``The New European
Way,'' which outlines how the socialists plan to use their new
power in the EU to make growth and job-creation its top economic
priority.
	   Left-of-center governments now run all but four of the EU's 15
nations, including the four largest: Germany, France, Italy and
Britain.
	   ``Our task is to find a way of marrying together an open,
competitive and successful economy with a just and human society,''
the document says.
	   ``Central is the objective of reconstructing a full-employment
society, a society in which there are job opportunities for all
citizens.''
	   The drive for closer cooperation is spearheaded by Germany's new
finance minister Oskar Lafontaine and his French counterpart
Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown has lined up behind them, although Britain will be
staying out of the euro project for now.
	   Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the
meeting, said the arrival of the euro heralded ``a new phase'' that
obliged nations to cooperate on areas such as taxation, prices and
wage policy.
	   ``We must have coordination if European economic policy is to
bring results,'' Edlinger told a news conference ahead of the
meeting.
	   The socialist ministers met over dinner at a Brussels hotel on
the eve of the regular monthly meeting of all 15 EU nations, the
first for Lafontaine who took office after his Social Democratic
Party won elections in September.
	   In their 11-page ``policy agenda,'' the socialist ministers
supported public spending on infrastructure and public services and
call for ``a social contract ... which gives to all citizens a
stake in the development of the European economy.''
	   However the document also insists tight budgets are essential to
underpin the euro's stability.
	   The socialists called on the new European Central Bank to take
account of ``growth and employment'' as well as inflation when its
starts setting interest rates for the euro bloc.
	   But Lafontaine the socialists were not seeking to undermine on
the bank's independence. ``We want a dialogue. In a democratic
society, such a proposal for a dialogue is no threat for the ECB's
independence,'' he said after the meeting.
	   Despite the commitment to pool economic ideas, policy
differences persist among socialists governments over labor market
rules, taxes and public spending.
	   Socialist unity could be put to the test Monday, when ministers
debate the EU budget. Germany insists it pays too much to the
Union's coffers and wants a reluctant France and Italy to shoulder
more of the burden.

Chiapas rebels use peace talks as political pulpit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Although little
serious negotion has taken place at peace talks between leftist
rebels and congressional mediators, the rebels are using the
meeting as an opportunity to attract international attention.
	   The rebels agreed to begin talks Friday for the first time in
nearly two years, apparently in hopes of refocusing attention on
their cause.
	   The government has steadily reduced the rebel's area of
influence in the last year by increasing army patrols in the
southern state of Chiapas, dismantling maverick town councils set
up by rebel supporters, and limiting the number of foreign
observers and supporters allowed to visit the rebels' strongholds.
	   Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos did not attend the
weekend talks, which have been marred by petty complaints and
quarrels. But he issued a rare public statement Sunday calling for
grassroots struggle against the government's economic policy.
	   ``It is a question of survival for the country,'' Marcos wrote
in a statement dated November 1998 ``from somewhere in the
mountains of southeastern Mexico.''
	   The congressional mediation commission agreed to a final
negotiating session Sunday, after the 29 delegates of the largely
Indian rebel movement promised to discuss substantive issues.
	   The talks were supposed to center on a proposed law guaranteeing
Indian rights, but the rebels had limited Friday's session to
complaints about accommodations and security at the meeting in San
Cristobal, a Chiapas city 460 miles (735 kms) southeast of Mexico
City.
	   The congressmen got so fed up with rebel complaints Saturday
that they offered to stop the talks and escort the delegates back
to their remote villages in eastern Chiapas.

Finland's Hannu Manninen wins World Cup Nordic combined event 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROVANIEMI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's Hannu Manninen won the
season-opening World Cup Nordic combined event Sunday.
	   Manninen, the leader after Saturday's jumping phase of the
competition, started 2 minutes, 27 seconds ahead of Norway's Bjarte
Engen Vik and 2:39 ahead of American Todd Lodwick in Sunday's
15-kilometer cross-country race. Nordic combined scoring translates
jump points into a time deficit to determine the starting positions
for the next day's race.
	   Manninen ranked only 11th in the cross-country race but his big
start margin gave him plenty of cushion and he won by a combined
2:21.5. Vike was second, 1:11 ahead of Lodwick.
	   Lodwick, a three-time Nordic combined winner, got his ninth
career podium finish.
	   Jumping was the key for Lodwick, who earned 229.5 jump points
after some lackluster efforts during training.
	   The podium placing for last year's fourth-place finisher in the
overall standings ``sends a message to the other guys that I'm
serious.''
	   Alexei Fadeev of Russia placed fourth, the same position he held
after the jumps. The biggest move was made by Norway's Trond Einar
Elden, who was only 31st on the jump hill. He was fastest in the
15K in 35.32.9 to climb into fifth in the final scoring.
	   Tim Tetreault, like Lodwick a resident of Steamboat Springs,
Colo., was 46th in the 50-skier field in jumping and stayed in that
position after placing 35th in the cross-country race. He was
9:44.2 behind the winner.

Eltingh, Haarhuis go out on top
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis
closed out their successful run as the top doubles team Sunday by
beating Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor 6-4, 6-2, 7-5 for the
Phoenix ATP World Doubles championship.
	   Eltingh is retiring from tennis after the tournament. The
28-year-old became a father this year and wants to stay close to
his family in The Netherlands.
	   He leaves the game as the No. 1 player on the ATP Tour
individual doubles ranking, 873 points ahead of his partner. Knee
problems in 1997 forced him to retire from singles play in 1997.
	   Moments after the match, Eltingh said he has no desire to
return.
	   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``How can I make `goodbye' better than
it was this year.''
	   The Dutchmen needed less than two hours to beat Knowles, of the
Bahamas, and Nestor, of Canada. The win capped a 5-0 record at the
tournament, where they won 11 of 12 sets and were broken just three
times. It also extended their dominance over Knowles and Nestor at
9-1.
	   They did not face a break point in either the semifinals or the
championship. They broke Knowles' service game once in the first
and third set and twice in the second set.
	   The few times they were down on serve, Eltingh and Haarhuis
consistently pulled themselves out of trouble behind Haarhuis'
accurate serves and Eltingh's athletic volleys at the net.
Haarhuis, 32, had five of the team's nine aces.
	   Eltingh showed his range of talents in the fourth game of the
second set. Down 2-1, Eltingh scored with a deeply angled ace.
Later he countered a sharply hit return by leaping high for a kill
and then closed out the game with a soft backhand drop shot that
caught his opponents standing deep.
	   Almost fittingly, he served out for match point. Up 40-0, the
pair lost the next two points but closed out their high-flying run
when Nestor sent a baseline volley long.
	   Eltingh and Haarhuis finished the year with a 46-4 record, the
best percentage on the ATP Tour this season. They won nine titles
in 13 events. They picked up dlrs 258,500 in Hartford and have
earned more than dlrs 6 million as a doubles team in their seven
years together.
	   Since 1991, they have won 39 titles, including this year at
Wimbledon. With the win at Wimbledon, they became the first pair to
win all four Grand Slam titles as a team.
	   ``It's glorious to end it this way,'' said Haarhuis, who
admitted he is said to see his partner and friend leave.
	   ``I'd like to play another seven years with him,'' Haarhuis
said. ``There's so many things we're not going to share anymore _ a
victory, a dinner or a joke.''
	   ``Or a loss,'' Eltingh interjected.
	   ``I don't remember too many of those,'' said Haarhuis.

Key witness to Buenos Aires bombing to testify in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A key witness in the bombing of a
Jewish community center in Buenos Aires will testify before a
Brazilian federal judge this week, reports said.
	   Wilson dos Santos, a Brazilian citizen, is believed to have
information about the 1992 bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos
Aires, which killed 86 people. Dos Santos, who is under police
protection, was tracked down in Brazil last week.
	   Dos Santos originally testified that he alerted Argentine
officials four months before the bombing that the attack was in the
works. He said they did not take him seriously. He reportedly said
knew about the plans through an Iranian girlfriend with links to a
terrorist group.
	   But he later retracted his statements, prompting an Argentine
court to charge him with giving false testimony.
	   Dos Santos is prepared to answer a Brazilian judge's questions
about the case, according to Saturday's O Jornal Do Brasil
newspaper. It was unclear exactly when he would be testifying.

One Nation adviser stands by cannibal remark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A key advisor to Pauline Hanson's
right-wing One Nation party said Monday he is standing by his claim
that Australian Aboriginals were cannibals.
	   Faced with threats of legal action, One Nation political advisor
David Oldfield said he welcomed moves by Aboriginal activist
Charlie Perkins to take the matter to the Australian Human Rights
Commission.
	   On Saturday, Oldfield, outside a polling station to support One
Nation candidate Kate Taylor in the election for the federal seat
of Newcastle, north of Sydney, said: ``They (Aborigines) have been
killing and eating each other for 40,000 years.''
	   He made the comment as an aside to Ms. Taylor as she and another
party's supporter argued about One Nation's opposition to special
benefits for Aborigines.
	   The comment was recorded by television cameras.
	   On Monday, Oldfield told the Channel Nine television network he
was not disappointed the comment had become the pinpoint of the
election.
	   ``I think it will more and more expose to the Australian people
the lies that have been shoved down their throats for years in this
way of trying to create benefits for the Aboriginal people,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   PIGNON, Haiti (AP)_ Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
U.S.-supported hospitals in Haiti Sunday, one of the few
encouraging signs in a country rescued by the United States from
dictatorship but not from poverty.
	   Mrs. Clinton was winding up a tour of hurricane-ravaged Central
American and Caribbean countries where she promised more disaster
relief. She left for home later Sunday.
	   In Haiti, she announced the United States would add another dlrs
2.1 million to a dlrs 12 million storm relief package.
	   But she focused her visit on health care in Haiti, the poorest
country in the Western Hemisphere.
	   Mrs. Clinton toured the Bienfaisance Hospital in Pignon, a small
northern farming town of 20,000 people, and complimented the
facilities more than 500 midwives for saving mothers' lives.
	   ``What you're doing is very important,'' she said. In Pignon,
only 190 of every 100,000 mothers die in childbirth, much lower
than the national rate of 456 per 100,000. The United States gives
the program dlrs 700,000 a year.
	   Also enthusiastic about the program was farmer Dereus Marcellus,
who was among more than 100 residents who greeted Mrs. Clinton.
	   Marcellus, 33, said his wife died several years ago while giving
birth to their seventh child, who also died. ``The hospital was
going to teach us family planning. It was too late,'' he said.
	   ``His case is typical. That's why we need to move medical
education out of the capital and into the countryside,'' said Dr.
Arthur Fournier, professor of family medicine at the University of
Miami School of Medicine, which will provide technical assistance
to a new medical education program.
	   The dlrs 1 million pilot phase, with Bienfaisance Hospital as
its center, will be also financed by a foundation of George Soros.

Vikings show Green Bay why they're the NFC Central's top team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ The Minnesota Vikings demonstrated in beating
Green Bay 28-14 Sunday why they are the NFC Central's top team and
the Green Bay Packers almost certainly will have to win a wild-card
berth to make the playoffs.
	   The win left the Vikings (10-1) three games ahead of Green Bay
(7-4) in the NFC Central with five games left. Had they lost, they
would have been just a game ahead facing a trip to Dallas for a
Thanksgiving Day game.
	   Jimmy Hitchcock's 58-yard interception return and Gary
Anderson's field goal after Tony Williams' recovery of Brett
Favre's fumble gave Minnesota a quick 10-0 lead.
	   Randy Moss, meanwhile, might have salted away offensive rookie
of the year honors with eight catches for 153 yards, including a
49-yard TD catch with 3:17 left that clinched the game. Randall
Cunningham was 20-of-30 for 264 yards and two touchdowns.
 &UR; Cardinals 45, Redskins 42 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Jake Plummer's third touchdown of the
game, a 1-yard sneak on fourth down with 3:49 to play, prevented
Arizona's second-half collapse from a 31-0 lead against Washington.
	   The touchdown gave Arizona a 45-35 lead, but the Redskins made
it close when Trent Green drove through Tommy Bennett's tackle to
score on a 2-yard bootleg with 1:46 remaining. It was the sixth
straight possession in which the Redskins scored.
	   The victory kept the Cardinals (6-5), who have played four
nail-biters in a row, firmly in the race for their first playoff
appearance since 1982. Washington (2-9) clinched its fourth losing
season of the last six years.
	   Plummer completed 17 of 28 passes for 251 yards and scored three
times and threw for two others.
	   Green completed 30 of 49 passes for 382 yards and a career-high
four touchdowns. Michael Westbrook had 10 receptions for 135 yards
and three touchdowns.
 &UR; Falcons 20, Bears 13 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the Falcons rallied from a 10-point deficit in the
second half as Chris Chandler threw a pair of touchdown passes
against Chicago, giving Atlanta a fourth straight victory.
	   But Chandler suffered a sprained right knee and ankle with 6:29
remaining. The Falcons (9-2) finished with 44-year-old Steve DeBerg
at quarterback.
	   Over the past two seasons, the Falcons are 14-4 when Chandler
plays an entire game. They are 2-7 otherwise, including a 28-3 loss
to the New York Jets with DeBerg as the starter _ their worst
defeat this season.
	   Before he was injured, Chandler brought the Falcons back from a
13-3 deficit with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Terance Mathis with
1:45 left in the third period and an 11-yarder to Todd Kinchen with
9:32 remaining.
 &UR; Cowboys 30, Seahawks 22 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, Troy Aikman threw two touchdown passes and
Chris Warren scored against his old Seattle teammates as Dallas
rolled to its fourth consecutive victory, most since the Super Bowl
season of 1995.
	   Aikman, disappointed the Cowboys (8-3) haven't gained much
national respect in their first season under coach Chan Gailey, hit
28 of 42 passes for 296 yards.
	   Aikman's 18-yard touchdown pass to Billy Davis and Warren's
1-yard run in the fourth quarter were too much for the Seahawks
(5-6) to overcome.
 &UR; Steelers 30, Jaguars 15 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Dewayne Washington returned two interceptions for
touchdowns of 52 and 78 yards as Pittsburgh won a game it couldn't
afford to lose.
	   Washington stepped in front of Keenan McCardell for his 52-yard
return on the Jaguars' second possession, then added his fifth
career TD return with 34 seconds left and Mark Brunell frantically
trying to drive Jacksonville for the tying score.
	   Jacksonville led the NFL with a plus-10 turnover ratio until
Brunell, who had thrown only six interceptions,
uncharacteristically threw three _ two in the final minute.
	   The Steelers (7-4) rebounded from two losses to Tennessee in
three weeks to beat the division-leading Jaguars (8-3) for the
fourth year in a row and close to within a game of the lead.
 &UR; Lions 28, Bucs 25 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Ron Rivers, giving Barry Sanders a breather
after a sideline-to-sideline burst loosened up the defense, broke a
36-yard touchdown run that helped hold off Tampa Bay.
	   The Bucs (4-7) drove into position for a possible tying or
game-winning score in the closing minutes. But Trent Dilfer threw
behind a wide-open receiver inside the Lions 5 and Ron Rice
intercepted in the end zone.
	   Detroit (4-7) also intercepted another pass that glanced off the
hands of tight end Patrick Hape to set up Tommy Vardell's 1-yard TD
run for a 28-17 lead.
 &UR; Bills 34, Colts 11 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, Antowain Smith rushed for 107 yards
and two touchdowns and Doug Flutie completed 20 of 28 passes for
230 yards and two touchdowns, both of them in Buffalo's 24-point
second quarter.
	   The Bills took a 24-3 halftime lead after trailing 3-0 going
into the second quarter.
	   Andre Reed caught six passes for 108 yards and a 67-yard
touchdown for Buffalo (7-4), which remained in second place in the
AFC East. A New England win over Miami on Monday would give the
Bills a share of first.
 &UR; Giants 20, Eagles 0 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, New York snapped a three-game
losing streak, beating Philadelphia behind a touchdown run by Gary
Brown and Phillippi Sparks' two interceptions.
	   Kent Graham also threw a late touchdown pass in his first start
this season, and Brad Daluiso kicked two field goal as the Giants
(4-7) recorded their first shutout since 1990.
	   The shutout was also the third against the Eagles (2-9) this
season, the most since 1942. It also stretched the Eagles' winless
streak on the road to 15 games (0-14-1), a run that is now almost
certain to end Ray Rhodes' tenure as coach.

<TEXT>
	   READING, England (AP) _ Kate Winslet, star of the Oscar-winning
movie ``Titanic,'' was married Sunday to assistant film director
Jim Threapleton in a quiet ceremony at her family's local church.
	   About 150 guests, including actress Emma Thompson and actor Greg
Wise, attended the afternoon wedding at All Saints' Church in
Reading, southern England.
	   After the half-hour service the 23-year-old actress, in a white
Edwardian-style gown, posed briefly for photographs with her new
husband, 25, who wore a suit with a dark frock coat.
	   ``The whole thing was tremendously relaxed and happy. It was a
big success story today,'' said the Rev. John Mortiboys, who
conducted the service.
	   ``They were trying to keep everything as secret as possible
because you can imagine what it is like in the glare of the
publicity all of the time,'' he said.
	   The reception, held about 10 miles (16 km) away at a 17th
century pub, included a simple meal featuring ``bangers and mash,''
or sausaages and mashed potatoes, a traditional hearty dish.
	   The newlyweds came outside briefly to talk to reporters.
	   ``It was quite amazing,'' said the bride. ``It was the most
amazing day of our lives.''
	   Asked by reporters what had been the highlight of her day, she
said: ``Exchanging of the vows. I think it was an incredible
feeling.''
	   A four-piece Irish fiddle band could be heard playing the tune
from the ``Titanic'' scene where Ms. Winslet's character dances a
jig.
	   Pub proprietor Paul Clerehugh said it was a ``very informal''
occasion.

Husband and daughter lead tributes to Griffith Joyner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ The husband and eight-year-old
daughter of Florence Griffith Joyner led the world of track field
Sunday in paying tribute to the late American sprint star.
	   Two months after Griffith Joyner died at the age of 38, husband
Al Joyner and daughter Mary Ruth Joyner accepted a special award at
the annual gala of the International Amateur Athletic Federation.
	   A brief documentary of FloJo's life and career, including
interviews with her and footage of her gold medal-winning
performances in the 100 and 200 meters at the 1988 Seoul Olympics,
was broadcast at the ceremony.
	   Then Joyner walked on stage hand-in-hand with his daughter, who
was clutching a big teddy bear.
	   Struggling to keep his composure, Joyner said, ``The one thing
that made Florence so great was her class. She was a world-class
person, a world-class mother and, most of all, a world-class
friend.
	   ``I hope people don't just remember the records she set. It was
the love she had for the sport and the athletes. Her motto was, `I
believe in the impossible because nobody else does.'''
	   Among those in the audience were Griffith Joyner's former coach,
Bob Kersee, and Kersee's wife, Jackie Joyner Kersee.
	   It was the most poignant moment on a night when Marion Jones _
the second fastest sprinter in history behind Griffith Joyner _ and
Ethiopian distance runner Haile Gebrselassie were honored as
athletes of the year, and Joyner Kersee received a lifetime
achievement award.
	   Griffith Joyner, who still holds the world records in the 100
and 200, died at her home in California on Sept. 21. Coroner's
experts said she suffered a seizure in her sleep _ probably
triggered by a brain lesion _ and suffocated.
	   Earlier Sunday, Joyner told reporters he was distressed at the
allegations _ especially widespread in the European media _ that
his wife's death could be linked to long-term effects of
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Joyner said it took an autopsy, which found the cause of death
was not associated with steroids or any other drugs, to prove that
his wife's exploits on the track were clean.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with name of wounded bystander, ADD that Moreno was
with a Colombian friend, body being flown back to the United
States. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. drug agent was shot and killed
early Sunday in an entertainment district of Bogota after an
argument in a bar, authorities said.
	   Frank Arnold Moreno, 37, was shot once in the back in the city's
``Zona Rosa,'' or Pink Zone, at about 1 a.m. outside the El Divino
bar, U.S. and Colombian officials said. A bystander was also shot
and wounded in the neck, they said, adding that police had various
witnesses and were pursuing a suspect.
	   Moreno, who had been in Colombia for about a year, had gone to
the bar with a male Colombian friend, police said, and was slain
after what one U.S. Embassy official called ``a bar brawl.''
	   ``I don't think it had anything to do with drugs,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I understand he
was walking away and then boom, boom.''
	   The Drug Enforcement Administration agent was shot from behind
and the 9mm bullet entered his torso at kidney level, a senior
Colombian police official said on condition of anonymity. Witnesses
took Moreno to a Bogota hospital, where he was declared dead.
	   It was not immediately known whether Moreno was carrying a gun,
who shot the bystander or how many shots were fired by the
assailant, the police official said. He identified the wounded man
as Hugo Alberto Espinosa, 20, who was outside the bar with friends
and not involved in the argument.
	   Authorities said Moreno, his friend and the gunman had been told
to leave the bar because of a heated argument. The shooting
occurred in Bogota's most active nightlife area, an upscale
neighborhood or restaurants, bars and discotheques that is crowded
with people well after midnight on weekends.
	   Moreno, of Edinburg, Texas, was recently married and had
previously been assigned to Oklahoma City, officials said, adding
that his wife lived with him in Bogota. Police said the body was
being flown to the United States on Sunday night.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and South Africa are expected to sign
agreements fostering closer trade relations during a visit by Vice
President Thabo Mbeki that began Sunday.
	   Mbeki, who is expected to succeed President Nelson Mandela when
elections are held next year, was scheduled to hold negotiations
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and meet with various
political and religious leaders, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   He also is scheduled to deliver a speech at Peoples' Friendship
University. The school was a magnet for African students during the
Soviet era, when it served the government's policy of promoting
communism in Africa. Since the Soviet collapse, it has fallen on
hard times.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister on Sunday accused
U.N. arms inspectors of ``a savage campaign ... of disinformation''
in their quest for more documents about the country's banned
weapons. The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said Iraq has
already handed over millions of papers to monitors and claimed that
no more files exist. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said some
documents in question are long lost and accused chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler of trying to create a pretext to continue
sanctions or allow the United States and Britain to attack. The
documents have emerged as a new flashpoint in the dispute between
Iraq and the United Nations since Baghdad reversed its ban on
weapons inspections and allowed monitors to return last week.
(IRAQ)
	   SEBASTIA, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish youths raised Israeli flags
Sunday over the railroad station where the settlement movement was
born, and demanded government permission to establish a religious
seminary and museum at the abandoned building. The 30 settlers,
mostly high school students, said they were acting in defiance of
the latest land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians, under
which Israel withdrew from 2 percent of the West Bank on Friday.
The Israeli army declared the site off limits, and the settlers
later evacuated the area. It was unclear whether they would return.
The Jewish settlement movement was born in Sebastia 23 years ago
when young religious Israeli nationalists occupied the station in
defiance of the then-Labor government. Shortly after, the
government allowed settlements to be established.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Turnout was modest but peaceful Sunday
when Albanians voted on a controversial referendum intended to give
the country its first post-communist constitution. Prime Minister
Pandeli Majko, who voted near his home in a poor suburb of the
capital, Tirana, said the draft constitution would help boost
prosperity in Europe's poorest nation. But Albania's powerful
opposition Democratic Party urged its supporters to boycott the
vote and said the apparently low turnout reflected the government's
feeble support. Because of the opposition boycott, the measure was
expected to pass. Results were expected Monday afternoon.
(ALBANIA-REFERENDUM)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of Turks angered by Italy's
release of a Kurdish rebel leader rallied in front of the Italian
Embassy on Sunday, part of a day of strident protests that had
Turks burning Italian-made clothes and setting fire to a Fiat.
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Sunday that economic relations
with Italy would be reviewed and that Turkey would not accept
Italian offers for military contracts. Two Italian companies were
seen as front-runners for dlrs 10 million worth of defense
contracts. Hundreds of companies and business groups have announced
a boycott of Italian goods, seeking to punish Italy for its refusal
to extradite to Turkey rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who came to
Rome on Nov. 12 seeking asylum. (TURKEY-ITALY-KURDS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Outrage is mounting over the killing of a popular
female lawmaker. It seemed clear Sunday that despite Russia's high
violence rate, the killing of Galina Starovoitova was not going to
be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might turn out to
be a watershed event in Russian politics. Starovoitova, a leader of
the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party and often mentioned as
a possible presidential candidate, was walking up the stairs of her
apartment building in St. Petersburg with a young aide Friday
evening. A team of assailants _ police believe it was a man and a
woman _ appeared behind them and opened fire. The aide, 27-year-old
Ruslan Linkov, was critically wounded, but managed to telephone a
news agency reporter before losing consciousness. Police have
recovered two guns, and are hoping that Linkov can provide a
description of the killers. He had regained consciousness but still
could not speak Sunday. (RUSSIA-SLAIN LAWMAKER)

	   READING, England (AP) _ Kate Winslet, star of the Oscar-winning
movie ``Titanic,'' was married Sunday to assistant film director
Jim Threapleton in a quiet ceremony at her family's local church.
	   About 150 guests, including actress Emma Thompson and actor Greg
Wise, attended the afternoon wedding at All Saints' Church in
Reading, southern England.
	   After the half-hour service the 23-year-old actress, in a white
Edwardian-style gown, posed briefly for photographs with her new
husband, 25, who wore a suit with a dark frock coat.
	   ``The whole thing was tremendously relaxed and happy. It was a
big success story today,'' said the Rev. John Mortiboys, who
conducted the service.
	   ``They were trying to keep everything as secret as possible
because you can imagine what it is like in the glare of the
publicity all of the time,'' he said.
	   The reception, held about 10 miles (16 km) away at a 17th
century pub, included a simple meal featuring ``bangers and mash,''
or sausages and mashed potatoes, a traditional hearty dish.
	   The newlyweds came outside briefly to talk to reporters.
	   ``It was quite amazing,'' said the bride. ``It was the most
amazing day of our lives.''
	   Asked by reporters what had been the highlight of her day, she
said: ``Exchanging of the vows. I think it was an incredible
feeling.''
	   A four-piece Irish fiddle band could be heard playing the tune
from the ``Titanic'' scene where Ms. Winslet's character dances a
jig.
	    &UR; ___
	   LONDON (AP ) _ Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall have split again,
British tabloid reports agreed Sunday.
	   But the tabs divided over whether the trouble this time stems
from an old problem _ the Rolling Stones singer's other women _ or
a new one: his anger over their 14-year-old daughter, Elizabeth,
following in her mother's footsteps on the catwalk.
	   The Mail on Sunday said Jagger stormed out of the family's
London mansion and went to his chateau in France's Loire Valley
after accusing his 42-year-old wife of seeking to revive publicity
for herself by modeling with Elizabeth.
	   The News of the World, however, carried a shadowy picture that
it said showed Jagger, 54, on Wednesday night leaving the Paris
apartment of an old flame, model Carla Bruni.
	   Enraged, Texan-born Ms. Hall, a former top model, flew to New
York, taking the couple's youngest child, 11-month-old Gabriel, and
she plans to seek a divorce settlement through lawyers in the
United States, according to the reports.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The late Princess Diana once
asked heart transplant pioneer Dr. Christiaan Barnard to help her
and her then-sweetheart _ a leading British-based heart surgeon _
move to South Africa, the Sunday Times reported.
	   In October 1996, Diana told Barnard about her love for Hasnat
Khan, and asked Barnard to help Khan find a job in Cape Town,
Barnard told the newspaper. Cape Town is Barnard's home town and
where Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, also maintains a
residence.
	   Diana died less than a year later _ in a car crash on Aug. 31,
1997 _ along with Dodi Fayed, her boyfriend at the time.
	   ``There was no doubt in my mind that she was very much in love
with Khan and would have married him if he had agreed,'' Barnard
said.
	   The relationship foundered, Barnard said, because Khan ``could
not handle the publicity of living with Diana.''
	   On June 29, 1997, a London-based tabloid, the Sunday Mirror,
reported Diana and Khan had agreed to marry after a secret
friendship. The newspaper also said Diana had flown to Pakistan to
win the approval of Khan's mother and grandmother.
	   On the day the article appeared, Diana denied she was engaged to
Khan.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MONTGOMERY, Alabama (AP) _ Alabama State University presented
Bill Cosby with an old-style leather football helmet, bringing back
some jarring memories for the comedian.
	   ``I played with a helmet like this, and my father said I haven't
been right since,'' Cosby joked.
	   Cosby's nearly sold-out show on the ASU campus Friday raised
$150,000, some of which will go towards a scholarship in memory of
Cosby's son Ennis, who was murdered last year.
	   Cosby visited ASU at the invitation of head football coach Ron
Dickerson, who previously coached at Temple, Cosby's alma mater.
	   ``I liked Ron because I wanted him to get the team to stop
cursing,'' Cosby said. ``By the third season, Ron was cursing.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A year after his death, INXS star
Michael Hutchence was remembered Sunday by 250 fans and family at a
chapel in the Sydney suburb of North Ryde.
	   Hutchence's brother Rhett paid tribute, a friend read a poem,
and a solo saxophonist played.
	   After the 40-minute service, Hutchence's father, Kel Hutchence,
unveiled a memorial on the grounds of the Northern Suburbs Memorial
Gardens and Crematorium to mark the life of the singer who
committed suicide in a Sydney hotel room last Nov. 22 at the age of
37.
	   ``He was a good and loving man and an excellent musician,'' his
father said.
	   At the peak of his and the Australian band INXS's musical
success, their 1987 album ``Kick'' sold more than five million
copies worldwide.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The long-delayed theme park that will
showcase the life and work of reggae legend Bob Marley will open in
February in Orlando, Florida, the singer's widow announced Sunday.
	   Rita Marley said the Universal Studios project will open Feb. 6,
Marley's birthday.
	   ``It's beautiful, the exact replica of the Bob Marley Museum. A
grand opening is planned,'' she said.
	   The park is modeled after Marley's former Kingston home, now a
museum that attracts thousands of visitors.
	   Universal Studios first announced plans for the park in 1996.
Construction began in September that year but work was stalled by
disagreements.
	   Marley introduced reggae to the music scene in the 1970s, and
won international recognition for Jamaica. He died of cancer in
1981, at age 36.

Union balking at change to free agency signing rules
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ NBA players will never accept a major change in
free agency signing rules that the owners are insisting upon,
according to an attorney for the players' union.
	   The proposed rule would force teams who sign another team's free
agent to give up the right to re-sign their own players under the
Larry Bird exception.
	   For example, if the Phoenix Suns signed Scottie Pippen, they
would forfeit the right to exceed the salary cap to re-sign Antonio
McDyess, Hot Rod Williams, Dennis Scott, George McCloud, Clifford
Robinson and Rex Chapman.
	   Or in the case of the Detroit Pistons, if they signed free
agents Christian Laettner or Matt Geiger, they would lose the right
to go over the cap to re-sign Jerry Stackhouse.
	   ``It's a deal-killer that has been buried in their proposal for
a long time, and they know we'd never do a deal that included it,''
Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the union, said
Sunday. ``They said it's something they really wanted, but it's a
false issue. We'll never accept it and we're not making any
concessions not to accept it.''
	   The proposed change to the so-called ``timing rules'' was
adamantly opposed by many of the 120 or so players who took part in
a union conference call over the weekend. It is one of many
significant issues that remain unresolved in collective bargaining
talks.
	   Spokesmen for the league and union said they did not know if
talks would resume Monday, but both sides expected a resumption by
Wednesday at the latest.
	   Progress was made in a nearly 10-hour session Friday. Owners
moved off their demand for a 50-50 split, and players dropped their
insistence upon 60 percent.
	   The exact new numbers weren't immediately clear because
different sources described different figures. But it was clear
that the owners were somewhere around 52.5 percent and the players
were near 58 percent.
	   The percentage number is crucial because if it were exceeded, an
escrow tax would be collected from players' paychecks and some or
all of the money would be distributed to the owners.
	   Both sides say they want to curtail spending so that the escrow
tax would not be triggered, but the owners believe salary growth
will continue to outpace revenue growth unless major changes,
including the timing rules, are made to the old system.
	   The union claims its other concessions _ a longer rookie scale,
a slowing of cap growth, a luxury tax _ will slow the growth of
salaries enough to avoid implementing the escrow tax.

Iraq says it has no new documents for U.N. inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's foreign minister accused U.N. arms
inspectors of ``a savage campaign ... of disinformation'' in their
quest for more documents about the country's banned weapons.
	   The minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said Sunday Iraq has
already handed over millions of papers to monitors and claimed that
no more files exist.
	   ``Anything relevant to the work of disarmament, we had already
handed over,'' he said, adding that Iraq has given 2,188,020 pages
of documents to U.N. Special Commission and International Atomic
Energy Agency monitors since weapons inspections began in 1991.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said some documents in question
are long lost and accused chief weapons inspector Richard Butler of
trying to create a pretext to continue sanctions or allow the
United States and Britain to attack.
	   Aziz told reporters that ``Butler has asked for a series of
alleged documents ... that do not exist.''
	   ``It is quite provocative if you want to dig in the whole
archives of the government of Iraq, which might take decades,'' he
said.
	   U.S. National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said the
Iraqi comments were ``insufficient'' and called for Iraqi
cooperation.
	   ``If we conclude Iraq does not intend to live up to its
commitments and UNSCOM can't do it's job, we remain prepared'' to
carry out the military attack President Clinton canceled last week,
he said in a telephone interview from South Korea, where the
president is concluding his trip to Asia.
	   The documents have emerged as a new flashpoint in the dispute
between Iraq and the United Nations since Baghdad reversed its ban
on weapons inspections and allowed monitors to return last week.
	   The decision averted military action, but forces remain in the
Persian Gulf.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
Sunday his country would answer by Monday the Security Council's
questions about the disputed documents.
	   In an interview with ABC television, Hamdoon noted that Iraq
faces the problem of trying ``to prove the negative, to prove that
something is not existent. I think it's almost impossible.''
	   Aziz accused Butler of trying to block a comprehensive review
that the U.N. Security Council has pledged to undertake once
inspectors declare that Baghdad is in full compliance with their
demands.
	   ``He's either creating a superficial pretext to justify the
American aggressions or he is trying to confuse and undermine the
comprehensive review,'' Aziz said.
	   Among the documents that Butler is seeking is an air force
inventory that U.N. inspectors saw last summer but were not allowed
to take.
	   Al-Sahhaf said this issue had been addressed in a letter to
Butler by Riyadh al-Qaisi, the deputy foreign minister. The
official Iraqi News Agency carried the text of the letter Sunday.
	   Al-Sahhaf added that, ``We are witnessing again a savage
campaign ... of disinformation.''
	   He said that if Butler ``is a fair man, he should be
satisfied.''
	   In the letter, al-Qaisi acknowledged for the first time that the
air force log sought by Butler contains an inventory of chemical
weapons the Iraqi army used from 1983-1988.
	   He told Butler that Iraq will only show his inspectors ``the
relevant parts'' of the document, and that this had to be done in
the presence of U.N. envoy Prakash Shah.
	   Al-Qaisi said Butler was asking for diaries of high-ranking
Iraqi army officers. He said the papers were either destroyed or
had already been given to inspectors and were no longer in Iraq's
possession.
	   The weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction before U.N. Security Council sanctions
on the country can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
the free export of oil and have devastated Iraq's economy. Iraq
insists it has met the Security Council's requirements, but the
inspectors charge it is still hiding information about its weapons
program.
	   Iraq had cut off all dealings with the inspectors in two stages
in August and October, but it rescinded both decisions on Nov. 14,
barely averting military strikes.
	   Despite mounting tension, the inspectors have been visiting
suspected sites with no obstruction from Iraqi authorities.
	   They made their first surprise visit to a suspected arms-making
facility Saturday.
	   The Iraqi News Agency quoted Iraqi officials as saying that
missile, chemical and biological teams were at work on Sunday.
	   The directorate said that two weapons teams that monitor imports
visited border posts with Syria and Jordan. It gave no other
details.

Brazil President faces pressure to fire minister over privatization
</HEADLINE>
scandal &QL; 
 &UR; BY ALEX DUFF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Pressure is growing for President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso to fire his communications minister for
his role in a scandal over the privatization of a
telecommunications company.
	   Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros apparently tried to ensure a
consortium of friends won control of one of 12 telecommunications
companies sold for dlrs 19 billion in July.
	   The scandal has threatened the government's efforts to pass a
dlrs 24 billion austerity package through Congress and encourage
investor confidence in Brazil's ailing economy.
	   The controversy broke out Nov.9 when transcripts of Barros'
telephone conversations with colleagues were published in Brazil's
media. Police are probing who tapped his phoneline.
	   In new excerpts published Sunday, Barros appeared to be pushing
for a victory for the Opportunity-Telecom Italia group before the
privatization auction. The group was unsuccessful.
	   Barros has said he simply tried to ensure a competitive auction.
Rallying to his own defence Sunday, he said civil servants should
be ``less bureaucratic and more aggressive'' in the O Folha De Sao
Paulo daily.
	   Although the president has publicly backed Barros, the scandal
has refused to die down.
	   Leading Rio newspaper O Globo on Saturday published a front page
editorial calling for Barros to resign.
	   And the newsweekly Veja ran a headline in Sunday's edition
describing Barros as ``A Man Above The Law,'' criticizing him for
not yet stepping down.
	   Barros faced nearly five hours of questioning in Congress on
Thursday but failed to satisfy some government-allied politicians
with his answers.
	   ``I say this to you (Barros) from the bottom of my heart. If I
was you, I would resign. If I was you, I would make a grand gesture
and help the President,'' Sen. Pedro Simon, a government ally, told
the minister in front of Congress.
	   Cardoso was expected to meet with Barros on Monday and make a
long-awaited decision on the minister's fate.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A key witness in the bombing of a
Jewish community center in Buenos Aires will testify before a
Brazilian federal judge this week, reports said.
	   Wilson dos Santos, a Brazilian citizen, is believed to have
information about the 1992 bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos
Aires, which killed 86 people. Dos Santos, who is under police
protection, was tracked down in Brazil last week.
	   Dos Santos originally testified that he alerted Argentine
officials four months before the bombing that the attack was in the
works. He said they did not take him seriously. He reportedly said
knew about the plans through an Iranian girlfriend with links to a
terrorist group.
	   But he later retracted his statements, prompting an Argentine
court to charge him with giving false testimony.
	   Dos Santos is prepared to answer a Brazilian judge's questions
about the case, according to Saturday's O Jornal Do Brasil
newspaper. It was unclear exactly when he would be testifying.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A building in Rio city centre
collapsed Sunday, killing two small children, firefighters said.
	   Fire crews managed to pull free two brothers, ages 3 and 5, from
the rubble, said firefighter Luiz de Oliveira Braga. But after six
hours, two children from another family, a sister and brother ages
1 and 3, were found dead.
	   The building, which dated back to the beginning of the century,
was in bad condition and collapsed completely, said Braga. It was
home to three families.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Angry officials in the Gulf coast state of
Veracruz say four bottle-nosed dolphins were illegally captured
near the town of Tamiahua and secretly airlifted to a marine park.
	   Tamiahua Mayor Sergio Rivera Perez said he has filed theft
charges against officials from the marine park in Cancun, 1,100
kilometers (700 miles) to the east.
	   Authorities say the mammals were caught in an unauthorized area
just off the Tamiahua coast. Julio Cesar Cordero, the town's
environmental director, said permits allow the capture of dolphins
only two miles (3 kms) out to sea.
	   He also said the animals had been held in a metal containment
pen, rathern than the required nylon structure.
	   Cordero also said regulations require dolphins to be held for an
eight to 20 day acclimation period in the pen, a condition that was
apparently violated.
	   Authorities said they will ask that the dolphins be returned to
the sea near Tamiahua.
	   ___
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ A gunfight between residents of two
villages engaged in a 50-year-old feud over land rights left two
men dead and several others injured, police reported Sunday.
	   The two neighboring villages, San Mateo and Santiago Amoltepec,
are located in a remote, roadless area of southern Oaxaca state
about 220 miles (350 kms) southeast of Mexico City.
	   The deaths occurred Saturday in what appears to have been an
attack by villagers from San Mateo against residents of Santiago
Amoltepec, according to state police.
	   Residents of the two villages, who have clashed frequently in
the past, have built trenches and foxholes around a mountain that
divides the two communities to defend against attacks.
	   The injured were taken by helicopter to the state capital for
treatment. No information was immediately available on the number
of injured or their condition.

Davies overcomes putter for first LPGA win in 20 months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Laura Davies overcame a poor putting game and
some shaky nerves with her length Sunday, making birdies on the
final two par-5s to end the worst slump of her career by winning
the LPGA Tour Championship.
	   Davies, talking to her putter in disgust after each missed putt,
still managed a final round 3-under 69 to win the season-ending
tournament by four strokes over a trio of golfers.
	   ``This is a magnificent moment. You start doubting if you're
ever going to win again,'' said Davies, who hadn't won on the LPGA
Tour in 20 months.
	   Davies reached both par-5s on the back nine in two shots and
2-putted both of them for the birdies that helped pad her final
winning margin. She had the tournament wrapped up when she finally
sunk a 6-footer (2-meter) shot for birdie on the last hole, then
raised her arms in triumph.
	   Davies, who earned dlrs 215,000 to boost her season total to
dlrs 517,547, finished at 11-under, four ahead of Pat Hurst, Karrie
Webb and Brandie Burton. Kelly Robbins and Juli Inkster finished
another shot back.
	   It was the first American win since March 1997 for Davies, who
once reigned as the top women's player in the world but who
struggled to even get into the elite field of top 30 money winners
in the dlrs 1 million tournament.
	   But it did not come without some anxious moments, as Davies
again and again missed short putts on the Desert Inn Country Club
course that could have put the tournament out of reach early.
	   ``This is as hard as I ever fought for a victory,'' she said.
``It was unbelievable. I've never been so nervous.''
	   In the end, however, Davies won the tournament the same way she
led it from the start _ by sheer length off the tee that allowed
her to hit irons to most of the par-5 holes and make two-putt
birdies.
	   She capped it off with a birdie on the final par-5, the 15th,
when she hit a 284-yard (256-meter) drive and followed it with a
7-iron to 10 feet (3 meters). What would have been her fourth eagle
of the tournament became a birdie instead when the putt just fell
below the hole.
	   ``That was probably the best two shots I can remember hitting
under tournament pressure in a long while,'' Davies said.
	   Davies, who began the tournament by making three eagles and five
birdies on the par-5s in the first two rounds, led wire-to-wire for
her 15th LPGA win.
	   Her lead, though, had shrunk to a single shot over Pat Hurst at
the turn, and she almost hit her second shot into the water
bordering the green on the par-5 10th hole.
	   From the fringe, though, Davies 2-putted the hole for birdie,
then added a birdie after missing a 10-footer (3 meters) on No. 15
for eagle to get to 10-under for the tournament.
	   Hurst, who started the day three shots back, made an early move
with three birdies on the front nine to pull to within one stroke.
But then it was her turn to grimace as she lipped out short birdie
putts on Nos. 10, 14 and 15.
	   ``It seemed like there were three or four putts that all lipped
out,'' said Hurst, who lost in a playoff in Las Vegas last year to
Annika Sorenstam. ``There's nothing you can do if the putts don't
fall.''

Swissair defends of entertainment system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to add possible public inquiry in Canada &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair has defended an in-flight
entertainment system that it removed from planes following the
crash of Flight 111 off Nova Scotia in September.
	   Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video system,
linked to a power supply routed through the cockpit, after Canadian
investigators detected signs of heat damage on wiring and other
debris from the cockpit of the MD-11.
	   The crew reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the
plane bound from New York to Geneva crashed in the sea September 2,
killing all 229 people on board. The cause of the crash has yet to
be determined.
	   ``It's the leading product, customers liked it, and its
installation was correctly certified,'' CEO Jeffrey Katz was quoted
Sunday as saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung. ``As far as
we know now, we did everything correctly.''
	   Swissair is the only customer for the system, manufactured by
Phoenix-based Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.
	   Katz declined to comment on lawsuits filed against the airline.
	   ``The important thing is for us to be certain'' of the cause,
Katz said. ``That's the only way we can prevent this tragedy
recurring. Only then will we worry about the legal questions.''
	   Swissair spokesman Jean-Claude Donzel said Swissair is in
contact with lawyers in the United States, Switzerland and France
over possible settlements.
	   Meanwhile, the head of the Canadian Transport Safety Board said
it might hold a short public inquiry into the Swissair crash.
	   It would be the first such probe for the board since its
creation in 1990.
	   ``Because of the magnitude of the accident, (a public inquiry)
could be proposed,'' said board chairman Benoit Bouchard.

German raises proposal for scrapping existing records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ A German official has re-launched a
proposal to scrap track and field world records and start afresh in
2000 to dispel concerns that existing records were tainted by drug
use.
	   Helmut Digel, head of the German athletic federation and council
member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, discussed
the idea at the IAAF meetings in Monaco this week.
	   No official action was taken, but the proposal _ floated earlier
this year to mixed responses _ continues to provoke discussion and
debate among track and field officials.
	   The proposal has so far failed to win the endorsement of
powerful IAAF president Primo Nebiolo, who has described it as
impractical.
	   Digel and others advocate throwing out world records in some
events _ including events such as shot put, discus and javelin and
women's sprints _ and starting from scratch in 2000.
	   Some records date back to the 1980s when organized doping
programs thrived in East Germany and other countries.
	   With court cases in Germany exposing further evidence of
systematic doping, pressure is growing for the world of sport to
redress the balance.
	   The national Olympic committees of the United States and Britain
recently filed petitions asking the IOC to award gold medals to
their swimmers who finished second behind East Germans.
	   Similar requests for medal adjustments in track and field may
not be far behind.

Brazilian president faces pressure to fire minister over

privatization scandal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Cardoso and minister meeting
late Sunday. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Pressure is growing for President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso to fire his communications minister for
his role in a scandal over the privatization of a
telecommunications company.
	   Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros apparently tried to ensure a
consortium of friends won control of one of 12 telecommunications
companies sold for dlrs 19 billion in July.
	   The scandal has threatened the government's efforts to pass a
dlrs 24 billion austerity package through Congress and encourage
investor confidence in Brazil's ailing economy.
	   Cardoso and Barros met late Sunday, apparently to discuss the
senior minister's future, the radio station CBN reported.
	   The controversy broke out Nov.9 when transcripts of Barros'
telephone conversations with colleagues were published in Brazil's
media. Police are probing who tapped his phoneline.
	   In new excerpts published Sunday, Barros appeared to be pushing
for a victory for the Opportunity-Telecom Italia group before the
privatization auction. The group was unsuccessful.
	   Barros has said he simply tried to ensure a competitive auction.
Rallying to his own defence Sunday, he said civil servants should
be ``less bureaucratic and more aggressive'' in the O Folha De Sao
Paulo daily.
	   Although the president has publicly backed Barros, the scandal
has refused to die down.
	   Leading Rio newspaper O Globo on Saturday published a front page
editorial calling for Barros to resign.
	   And the newsweekly Veja ran a headline in Sunday's edition
describing Barros as ``A Man Above The Law,'' criticizing him for
not yet stepping down.
	   Barros faced nearly five hours of questioning in Congress on
Thursday but failed to satisfy some government-allied politicians
with his answers.
	   ``I say this to you (Barros) from the bottom of my heart. If I
was you, I would resign. If I was you, I would make a grand gesture
and help the President,'' Sen. Pedro Simon, a government ally, told
the minister in front of Congress.

Indonesian elections will be just the start: Downer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said Monday that Indonesia will need more than its planned general
election next May to secure successful reform of its government.
	   On Sunday, riots in Jakarta killed six. Last week, as many as 17
people were killed in clashes between anti-government students and
police and soldiers during a government assembly on political
reforms.
	   Downer said the election promises to be the most free and fair
that Indonesia has seen since 1955.
	   ``But while the election will be a vital step, it is not the
sole pre-condition for the development of a system where governance
is more effective and transparent,'' Downer said.
	   ``The strengthening of other institutions of state are also
important.''
	   Downer said many commentators had long recognized a need for
judges in Indonesia to be better trained.
	   ``A strong and accountable parliament and strong governmental
institutions must, in the long run, rest on a robust civil
society,'' Downer said.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A state-sponsored motto for Turkey's
75th birthday is ``feel the republic.''
	   But there are very different ways it can be felt across a vast
nation struggling with an often incompatible and volatile mix of
European aspirations and Islamic traditions.
	   The military and other backers of Turkey's Western-oriented
system basked in ceremonies on the Oct. 29 anniversary of the
modern Turkish state. They see Turkey's destiny linked irrevocably
with Europe.
	   Others, such as Istanbul's ousted mayor, have felt something
else from the republic: the sting of going against the principles
of modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who felt
secularism was the only way to keep the nation united.
	   Straying from the pro-Western and nationalist line _ whether for
Muslim values or backing Kurdish separatists _ can be a dangerous
proposition.
	   Rights groups have accused Turkish authorities of torture and
other abuses against those who challenge the status quo. Kurdish
and pro-Islamic political groups are under constant pressure. Any
whiff of Islamic fundamentalism brings a threat of military
intervention.
	   Istanbul's former mayor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, learned
first-hand that even words can be considered weapons by the state.
Erdogan, a rising star in the growing pro-Islamic political
movement, recited a two-line poem to his backers last year:
``Minarets are our bayonets, domes are helmets; mosques our
barracks, believers our soldiers.''
	   As a result, he was banned from politics for life and is
preparing to serve a 10-month jail sentence. His crime, according
to judges: inciting hatred based on religious differences.
	   Erdogan's party, Welfare, was outlawed earlier this year for
allegedly intending to wage a violent campaign to turn Turkey into
an Islamic regime. It is trying to rebuild under a new name.
	   To many Western-looking Turks, Erdogan's real guilt was snubbing
the secular legacy of Ataturk, whose stern gaze radiates down on
the 60 million Turks from portraits everywhere from government
offices to McDonald's.
	   ``You cannot be for the Turkish revolution and be against
Ataturk,'' said Sina Aksin, a political history professor at Ankara
University.
	   In the lionized lore of modern Turkey, Ataturk is the creator.
He is credited with building a new Europe-looking nation from the
fragments of the fallen Ottoman empire.
	   That meant railways, roads, a strong army, a devotion to secular
principles at any cost and a strident nationalism _ even a new
capital, Ankara. At the same time, Ataturk crusaded against almost
everything oriental, from the fez to Arabic script.
	   But many Turks today feel his dream _ now known as Kemalism _
has become mired and misdirected.
	   The very things that Ataturk admired may now be cultivating many
of the problems that keep it from the next big step: entry into the
European Union.
	   The EU worries about the military's strong influence in
political affairs. Harsh tactics against Kurdish separatists and
others have led to widespread accusations of serious human rights
abuses and censorship.
	   Ataturk's ideal has also been corrupted by rapid population
growth and ill-suited economic policies.
	   Cities like Istanbul are teeming with poor laborers from rural
areas, many often working in sweatshops. Most are jammed into
crumbling high-rises or shantytowns that serve as cauldrons for
social unrest _ and the core of support for Islamic-oriented
movements.
	   Despite a spike in support for Islamic parties, few
Western-looking Turks see religion as a defining force in their
lives.
	   Turkey is essentially a hybrid nation, experts contend. It may
boast about its modernization and dedication to democracy, but it
retains some of the Ottoman and authoritarian ways of doing things.
	   ``Things have changed a lot and the Turkish establishment has
not been able to adapt the original framework in the changing
times. The so-called secularist attitude is no longer an asset, but
is certainly a liability because it breaks social peace,'' said
writer Asaf Savas Akad of Istanbul's Bilgi University.
	   Ataturk's reality was far different from today's.
	   It was one where the Ottoman empire had shrunk to one-fifth of
its size and was in danger of being dismembered by covetous
neighbors. Islamic leaders were also fighting for control.
	   That's why many Turks credit Ataturk's iron-fist approach,
forced assimilation campaigns and near-dictatorial policies with
saving the nation.
	   In the meantime, the West generally overlooked Turkey's
problems, especially during the Cold War. Its strategic location on
Europe's southeastern flank won Turkey membership in NATO as a key
ally against the Soviet bloc.
	   ``All of a sudden with the end of the Cold War, the end of the
communist threat, the whole international scene changed, and the
fact that Turkey is not a member of the club of the free world, but
only an ally of the club, has become very apparent,'' Akad said.
	   Any significant change in the Turkish system would likely
require curbing the military, which considers itself the protector
of Kemalism.
	   ``The military overplays its hand as the guardian of the secular
state,'' said Terence Taylor, assistant director of London's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.

	   But the military is Turkey's most powerful institution _ and one
that many Turks feel is necessary to protect against Islamic
revolutionaries, urban terrorist groups and Kurdish separatists.
	   In 1984, Kurdish insurgents began an armed struggle to set up an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey that has so far cost
more than 37,000 lives.
	   Thousands of Kurds, hundreds of journalists and more than a
dozen politicians have been jailed after being accused of
criticizing the state and sympathizing with the Kurds.
	   Parties such as Welfare or Kurdish blocs, which don't conform to
Kemalist principles like secularism, are removed from power and
banned.
	   The generals' anxieties about threats to the Kemalist system has
led to three military coups in the past 40 years. In 1960, the
military ousted Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and sent him to the
gallows.
	   After the 1980 coup, the military rewrote the constitution to
make itself the guarantor of what it considered a secular
democratic state.
	   Last year it used those constitutional powers to carry out a
``soft coup'' and force the Welfare party from power.
	   Tansu Ciller, a former prime minister who formed an ill-fated
governing alliance with the Islamic party, says the army needs to
be reined in.
	   ``Despite the fact that the military is trusted by the people
more than any other institution, nonetheless we have come to the
point where I don't think the people want the military making
social and political decisions on a daily basis,'' she said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Ottoman officers taught Mustafa Kemal the
art of war. Later, he used his battlefield fury to bring down the
dying empire and fashion a new nation.
	   A merchant's son, Kemal was born in 1881 in what is now the
northern Greek city of Salonica. At the time, Salonica was a
thriving multiethnic port and a hub for the Balkan nationalist
currents that would help topple the Ottoman Empire.
	   Kemal was at first given a religious Islamic education, but he
rejected its narrowness. He persuaded his family to send him to
military school. In 1902, he graduated from the War College in
Constantinople, the city now known as Istanbul.
	   He learned French and became enamored with its revolution after
joining the Young Turk movement, mostly made up of army cadets and
young officers. In 1908, they forced Sultan Abdul Hamit to curb his
autocratic rule, enacted a constitution and convened a chamber of
deputies.
	   World War I dealt the final blow to the Ottoman Empire.
	   Kemal, a successful commander famed for frustrating the British
landing at Gallipoli in 1915, used the popularity gained in battle
to lead a war of independence.
	   By 1922, Kemal set out to dismantle what remained of the
defeated Ottoman system, whose sultan had also ruled as caliph, the
spiritual leader of all Muslims in the empire.
	   For Kemal, ``Islam represented the downfall of the Turkish
people,'' said Secil Akgun, professor of republican history at
Ankara's Middle Eastern Technical University.
	   Kemal abolished the sultanate and replaced it with a secular
republic on Oct. 29, 1923.
	   The Gregorian calendar was adopted, religious orders were banned
and Islamic-based laws were replaced with European codes. Turkey
adopted the Latin alphabet and the metric system and gave women the
right to vote and be elected.
	   Those who spoke against reform were dealt with harshly. Some
1,500 people were hanged for preaching against the changes.
	   Kemal also ordered Turks for the first time to use a family
name. For him, parliament chose ``Ataturk'' _ Father Turk.
	   He died on Nov. 10, 1938, of cirrhosis of the liver.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Producers of a television documentary about Monica
Lewinsky announced that a book about her will be published on the
Internet a few hours before the documentary is broadcast Monday.
	   The book, ``Monica Lewinsky: Behind the Myth,'' will be
available on the Internet for a fee. The documentary of the same
title will be broadcast by A and E Networks, the cable channel, on
Monday evening.
	   Author Simon Caulkin said his book is based on information from
several sources including Lewinsky's former lawyer, another White
House intern, a Washington journalist who dated Lewinsky, and her
closest friend.
	   Last week, British publisher Michael O'Mara, announced that
Lewinsky had signed a deal with Princess Diana's biographer, Andrew
Morton, for a tell-all book about her affair with President
Clinton.
	   Morton's book, to be called ``Monica's Story,'' will be
published in the United States by St. Martin's Press of New York,
and is expected to be in stores by the summer.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Modern Turkey grew out of the ashes of the
Ottoman Empire. Seventy-five years later, the region is still
smoldering with rivalries, suspicions and military bluster.
	   ``It's one of the world's roughest neighborhoods,'' said
Terrence Taylor, assistant director of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London.
	   As the area's largest and most powerful country, Turkey finds
itself surrounded by states fearful that Turks have not fully put
to rest their empire-building ambitions.
	   Turkish leaders, in turn, firmly believe some of their neighbors
want to see Turkey destabilized.
	   All the neighbors _ Greece and Bulgaria to the west; Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran to the east; Iraq and Syria to the
south _ have had serious problems with Turkey at one time or
another. Some have nearly gone to war with what they consider a
regional bully.
	   ``Turkey is one of the few nations which is surrounded by its
enemies and who is far apart from its friends,'' said Behic
Gurcihan, at the Istanbul-based National Strategical Studies
Institute.
	   The recent faceoff with Syria, which Turkey accuses of harboring
militant Turkish Kurds who have been fighting for a state since
1984, illustrated Turkey's readiness to mobilize its army at any
hint its security is threatened.
	   Some 5,000 Turkish soldier occupy part of northern Iraq to guard
against Kurds using that area as a staging ground for attacks.
	   Islamic fundamentalism next door in Iran also worries the
Turkish military, which considers itself the protector of Turkey's
secular system.
	   Turkey, in turn, draws criticism from many nations in the Middle
East because of its growing military and economic ties with Israel.
	   Turkey has gone to the brink of war with Greece three times in
the past 24 years over disputes in the Aegean Sea and Cyprus.
	   Tensions are high now over plans by Greek Cypriots to deploy
Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles in their part of the island.
Turkey, which has 30,000 soldiers in the Turkish Cypriot portion,
has threatened to stop the missiles. Greece is committed to
defending the Greek Cypriots.
	   Greeks and Turks already fought two wars this century _ in
1912-13 and 1921, when Greece sought to liberate what it considered
Greek territory in Asia Minor. Millions of Greeks and hundreds of
thousands of Turks became refugees.

Lebanese freed by Israel struggle to rebuild broken lives

<TEXT>
	   TIBNINE, Lebanon (AP) _ Kayed Bandar is free _ physically _ but
he remains captive to the forbidding memories of a decade in an
Israeli jail.
	   Surgery awaits him for old battle wounds. Then he must sort out
his life and find work. All this before he can plan a wedding with
the fiancee who waited 10 years for his release.
	   Many of his troubles are shared by 54 other Lebanese who were
arrested for fighting Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and
were released in June as part of a swap for the remains of an
Israeli soldier.
	   The ex-prisoners, some held for as long as 13 years, live with a
haunting past and face an uncertain future. Many do not have the
money and skills to reintegrate in the Lebanon of today.
	   ``I don't want to say I offered (the resistance) enough, but I
think it's time I looked after myself,'' said Bandar, 31, a
communist guerrilla captured by Israel troops during a battle in
the south.
	   ``I left (my fiancee) for 10 years. Now, more than anything, I
want to look after her needs and ambitions,'' he added, speaking at
his father's home in the southern town of Tibnine across from
Israeli army lines.
	   But that must wait.
	   Bandar needs surgery first to remove shrapnel from his
disfigured right arm and thigh. He was badly wounded in the battle
in which he was captured. Taken to Israel, he was sentenced to 20
years in prison as a guerrilla and served half that time. Israeli
authorities confirmed his sentence and release.
	   Ibtissam Najdi, Bandar's fiancee who is now 32, said a few
months of waiting for him to regain his health are nothing compared
to her years of agonizing.
	   ``When you are a believer and when you have faith, it gets
easier,'' the Shiite Muslim woman said.
	   Bandar and the others have to catch up after years of isolation
and adapt to the dizzying changes Lebanon has undergone since the
1980s.
	   ``The country was in a state of civil war when I was arrested.
Now Lebanon is being reconstructed, and I can barely recognize some
areas, especially in Beirut,'' Bandar said, referring to the
gigantic projects changing the capital's face.
	   Bandar said he also must learn again to make day-to-day
decisions after years of bullying and psychological torture by his
captors at Israel's Ashkelon Prison.
	   ``They take away your sense of identity, your mind. ... They
don't let you think for yourself,'' he said.
	   Israel's supreme court has approved ``moderate'' physical
pressure in interrogating prisoners about what Israel considers
terrorist threats. Israel's Shin Bet security agency has said it
deprives prisoners of sleep, covers their heads with hoods and
blasts them with loud music.
	   Stories of pain and torture are repeated by almost every
prisoner, especially those jailed in the Khiam detention camp in
southern Lebanon run by the South Lebanon Army, a Lebanese militia
allied with Israel.
	   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights advocate,
has been issuing reports alleging torture at the Khiam camp since
soon after it opened in 1985 when Israel set up its occupation zone
in Lebanon to deter attacks on towns in northern Israel.
	   Israel denies responsibility for Khiam, saying it is run by the
South Lebanon Army. But Amnesty says Israeli forces oversee militia
interrogators trying to extract information from prisoners about
guerrilla groups.
	   Dozens of prisoners are still held at Khiam and in Israel.
Amnesty says many have never been tried and are simply ``bargaining
chips'' to gain the release of missing Israeli soldiers. Recently,
Amnesty said 11 detainees had died in Khiam, ``some of them after
torture, others because of lack of medical treatment.''
	   Among those freed from Khiam last June, Ali Hazimeh was held for
13 years and Lafi Masri for nine years. Neither was ever charged or
tried.
	   Hazimeh, 39, said he faces months of physical therapy for
backache caused by beatings, including pounding with nail-studded
sticks.
	   Masri, 44, is getting therapy for backache and was told he may
need back and ear surgery. He said he was hung by his hands for
hours, beaten with sticks, prodded with electric shocks and had hot
and then ice cold water poured on his naked body.
	   ``At one point I was totally disabled and had to be carried when
moved around,'' said Masri, who added he now takes six kinds of
medication daily and suffers chronic fatigue and ulcers.
	   The thin, gray-haired Masri feels anguish, too, over the long
separation from his family. His son was 4 and his daughter 3 when
he was seized.
	   ``I feel I have failed them as a father, being away for so
long,'' he said in Beirut as his 13-year-old daughter, Mariam,
fidgeted beside him.
	   Hazimeh also must get reacquainted with his wife and five
children, the youngest of whom was 7 months when the young father,
then 26, was picked up for questioning and disappeared into Khiam.
	   ``My daughters are shy around me. There is no closeness or
intimacy,'' Hazimeh said at his home in the village of Hariss near
Tibnine.
	   ``We're starting from zero.''

Israeli and Palestinians seek total of dlrs 1.6 billion in aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians are both asking the
United States to dig deep in its pockets to help them strengthen
their claims in the West Bank, at a price that may exceed dlrs 1.6
billion.
	   Israeli officials have hinted that the pace of a West Bank
pullback, part of the U.S.-brokered peace accord reached last
month, may depend in part on receiving the money that President
Bill Clinton promised to sweeten the agreement.
	   Israel is expected to ask for dlrs 1.2 billion, officials said.
Its finance minister, Yaakov Neeman, left for Washington, D.C., on
Sunday to request aid to fortify Jewish settlements and build roads
that bypass Palestinian towns _ controversial items that U.S.
officials may resist.
	   Palestinians are lobbying for dlrs 400 million to dlrs 500
million to build a road network that will knit their scattered
villages and towns together and pave the way for statehood. But
they oppose the use of U.S. aid to make Jewish settlers more secure
and Israel's confiscation of land to build the roads.
	   For the United States, the requests pose a dilemma of rising
expectations and conflicting political aims.
	   Moshe Fogel, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government, said the purpose of the aid was to
``minimize potential friction'' after the next pullback _ which
will leave a dozen Israeli settlements surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled lands.
	   ``That would include the construction of additional bypass
roads, but it would also mean installing the type of protective and
security devices that would improve the local settlements' ability
to deal with potential threats,'' Fogel said.
	   Jewish settlers published a letter Sunday calling on the Israeli
government to provide armored buses for schoolchildren, build
lookout posts along key roads, construct helicopter landing pads in
all settlements and issue military equipment for settlements,
including machine guns, tear gas and rubber-coated bullets.
	   Palestinian officials said the United States should not sanction
the confiscation of land or help the settlers sink deeper roots
into war-captured land the Palestinians want for a future state.
	   ``We hope that the Americans will take into consideration that
the money they give is not going to reinforce the Israeli and
Jewish presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,'' said Mohammed
Ishtayeh, head of the Palestinian agency that channels foreign aid
to projects. Continuing the ``colonial presence'' was a ``dangerous
scenario,'' he said.
	   Ishtayeh said the Palestinian need for aid was ``huge'' and he
hoped the Americans could pick up the tab for the new program. He
said dlrs 300 million was needed to build 150 miles (240
kilometers) of road linking villages and towns, and up to dlrs 200
million was necessary to repair main highway arteries between
cities.
	   Until now, the United States has provided Israel with dlrs 3
billion a year in total aid but negotiated a reduction of the dlrs
1.2 billion a year in economic aid over the next decade. U.S. aid
to the Palestinians averages about dlrs 70 million annually.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath was expected to
discuss the aid package with U.S. officials before presenting the
Palestinian case to a 50-nation meeting in Washington of
international donors who having been funding Yasser Arafat's
self-rule government.
	   Ishtayeh said the Palestinians would seek dlrs 5 billion from
the donor community, noting that the dlrs 450 million in annual aid
they receive had been overtaken in recent years by Israeli-imposed
closures that cost their economy dlrs 800 million last year alone.
	   ``This will be financing an independent state, and we hope
donors will help with strategic projects like highways, a seaport,
a national electricity grid and a water network,'' he said.
	   Before attending the donors' meeting on Nov. 30, Israeli Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to discuss aid and arrangements for final status
talks, an Israeli official said. Sharon also is expected to meet
with leading members of Congress to explain Israel's request.
	   In Israel, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the U.S. administration would not look favorably on requests
that included money for Jewish settlements.

Turkish premier guarantees safety of Juventus players

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has guaranteed
the safety of players of Juventus of Turin, who fear they may be
attacked during an upcoming match in Turkey because of the
country's political tensions with Italy.
	   The Italians are scheduled to play a Champions League match
against Galatasaray on Wednesday in Istanbul. But some Juventus
players have said they fear for their lives by coming to Turkey,
where thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past
week to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for
trial as a terrorist.
	   The governing body of European soccer, UEFA, was scheduled to
announce Monday when and where the game would be played.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday. ``We are also considering to ban
demonstrations in Istanbul until the match.''
	   Yilmaz said that each fan would be searched by police before
entering the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against
possible provocations.
	   ``A minor incident could harm our cause,'' Yilmaz said. ``Don't
throw even one coin into the court. You can hang banners or shout
slogans.''
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives. Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying Italian
law does not allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus' general manager Luciano Moggi of Juventus said safety
is a big concern. The team announced Friday that no fans will
travel with the club to Istanbul.
	   ``We players could decide not to go to Istanbul,'' Juventus
captain Angelo Di Livio said in Italy. ``We really don't want to
risk our lives. ... We still hope that UEFA will move the game to a
neutral site.''
	   But Senes Erzik, a senior Turkish official of the UEFA, said
there would be no changes unless extraordinary developments took
place in Turkey before the match.
	   Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim ruled out the possibility of the
match's postponement and said that he was trying to keep his
players away from the tension.
	   ``Italian team will come here and this match will be played,''
Terim told private Show television. ``We are itching to defeat
Juventus and reach 10 points.''
	   He said sports and politics should not be mixed up.
	   ``We are gentilemen. Let's show our customary hospitality,''
Terim said.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. Underdog Galatasaray tops the
group B with seven points.
	   ``Ali Sami Yen will be a hell for them,'' Terim said expecting
huge support from Galatasaray fans.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The No. 1 ranking was out of reach _ that
belonged to Lindsay Davenport. But for Martina Hingis, who had not
won a tournament in six months, these were the highest kinds of
stakes.
	   ``I was playing for my pride,'' she said.
	   Beating the player who seized her No. 1 ranking, Hingis ended
her long dry spell Sunday by capturing the Chase Championships.
	   With her mobility and court savvy in full display, Hingis
negated Davenport's power game and won the season-ending tournament
7-5, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
	   It was Hingis' first victory in this dlrs 2 million event and
her first tournament title since the Italian Open in May.
	   Davenport, the world's No. 1 player, ended an outstanding year
on a down note, losing the final match of the season for the second
time. She lost the Championships final to Gabriela Sabatini in
1994.
	   This was supposed to be Davenport's time, especially after she
beat a resurgent Steffi Graf in Saturday's semifinals. Instead, it
was the 17-year-old from Switzerland who walked away with the
trophy, named on Sunday for Billie Jean King. Hingis also collected
dlrs 500,000.
	   For 80 weeks, Hingis was ranked No. 1, until Davenport moved
into the top spot after beating the teen-ager in the U.S. Open
final two months ago. On Sunday, Hingis gave notice this fight for
No. 1 will carry over to next year.
	   ``It feels great,'' Hingis said. ``To play in the Garden was a
big success for me. I will try to get back the No. 1 ranking next
year.''
	   For the most part, Hingis matched Davenport stroke for stroke in
a power game and test of wills. But Hingis used drop shots to
exploit Davenport's lack of foot speed and agility. She also would
occasionally sneak to the net for winning volleys.
	   Davenport usually had only one card to play _ hit harder. And
while she repeatedly had break points, she converted only four of
16.
	   Hingis did only slightly better. But that's all it really took
to win the elite 16-player tournament.
	   ``I don't think I played the smartest match today tactically,''
Davenport admitted.
	   Hingis, who won the Australian Open in January, became the only
woman this year to capture two of the sport's top five titles.
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario captured the French Open, Jana Novotna won
Wimbledon and Davenport took the U.S. Open.
	   ``It would have been nice to win today, but that's OK, I've had
a great year,'' Davenport said.
	   The two traded service breaks in the fourth and fifth games of
the match. Then came two marathon games that tested the mettle of
both.
	   Hingis fought through five deuces, staving off three break
points, to hold serve and take a 4-3 lead.
	   In the next game, Davenport and Hingis battled to seven deuces
before Davenport finally held to 4-4. The 10-minute game was the
longest of the match.
	   Trailing 5-6, Davenport served to send the first set to a
tiebreak. But she quickly fell behind love-40 before winning the
next three games to pull to deuce. Not to be denied, Hingis
captured the next two points to close out the break and the first
set.
	   ``You just try to win the first set, otherwise it is hard,''
Hingis said. ``I think of men playing, they say the second set is
very important, but in women's I think it is very important to win
the first set.''
	   The next break of serve came in the final game of the second
set. Davenport fought gamely before losing the 16-point game.
Hingis now was just one set away from victory.
	   After two trips to the final, Davenport finally won a set. She
lost in straight sets to Sabatini in the only women's match that is
contested over a best-of-5 sets.
	   It was only a speed bump on Hingis' trip to her fifth tournament
win of the year.
	   She broke Davenport in the fourth and sixth games to race to a
5-1 lead. After Hingis lost her serve at 30, she broke right back
from deuce to close out the 2-hour, 23-minute battle.
	   ``I tried my best today but it just wasn't enough,'' said
Davenport. ``She played great tennis and really deserved to win
today.''
	   Davenport didn't walk away from the Garden without a title. She
teamed with Natasha Zvereva of Belarus on Saturday to win the
doubles, defeating Alexandra Fusai and Nathalie Tauziat of France
6-7 (6-8), 7-5, 6-3..
	   The doubles winners share dlrs 200,000, with the losers earning
dlrs 100,000.
	   Davenport won six tournaments this year as she became the first
American-born woman to end the year ranked No. 1 since Chris Evert
in 1981. And with the dlrs 250,000 she earned for her appearance in
the singles final, Davenport pocketed dlrs 350,000 for the week.

Vikings show Green Bay why they're the NFC Central's top team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps to add late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ The Minnesota Vikings demonstrated in beating
Green Bay 28-14 Sunday why they are the NFC Central's top team. The
Green Bay Packers, last year's conference champion, almost
certainly will have to win a wild-card berth to make the playoffs.
	   The win left the Vikings (10-1) three games ahead of Green Bay
(7-4) in the NFC Central with five games left. Had they lost, they
would have been just a game ahead facing a trip to Dallas on
Thursday.
	   Jimmy Hitchcock's 58-yard interception return and Gary
Anderson's field goal after Tony Williams' recovery of Brett
Favre's fumble gave Minnesota a quick 10-0 lead.
	   Randy Moss, meanwhile, might have clinched offensive rookie of
the year honors with eight catches for 153 yards, including a
49-yard TD catch with 3:17 left that clinched the game. Randall
Cunningham was 20-of-30 for 264 yards and two touchdowns.
 &UR; Cardinals 45, Redskins 42 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Jake Plummer's third touchdown of the
game, a 1-yard sneak on fourth down with 3:49 to play, prevented
Arizona's second-half collapse from a 31-0 lead against Washington.
	   The touchdown gave Arizona a 45-35 lead, but the Redskins made
it close when Trent Green drove through Tommy Bennett's tackle to
score on a 2-yard bootleg with 1:46 remaining. It was the sixth
straight possession in which the Redskins scored.
	   The victory kept the Cardinals (6-5), who have played four
nail-biters in a row, firmly in the race for their first playoff
appearance since 1982. Washington (2-9) clinched its fourth losing
season of the last six years.
 &UR; Falcons 20, Bears 13 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, the Falcons rallied from a 10-point deficit in the
second half as Chris Chandler threw a pair of touchdown passes
against Chicago, giving Atlanta a fourth straight victory.
	   But Chandler suffered a sprained right knee and ankle with 6:29
remaining. The Falcons (9-2) finished with 44-year-old Steve DeBerg
at quarterback.
 &UR; Cowboys 30, Seahawks 22 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, Troy Aikman threw two touchdown passes and
Chris Warren scored against his old Seattle teammates as Dallas
rolled to its fourth consecutive victory, most since the Super Bowl
season of 1995.
	   Aikman, disappointed the Cowboys (8-3) haven't gained much
national respect in their first season under coach Chan Gailey, hit
28 of 42 passes for 296 yards.
	   The Seahawks dropped to 5-6.
 &UR; Steelers 30, Jaguars 15 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Dewayne Washington returned two interceptions for
touchdowns of 52 and 78 yards as Pittsburgh won a game it couldn't
afford to lose.
	   Washington stepped in front of Keenan McCardell for his 52-yard
return on the Jaguars' second possession, then added his fifth
career TD return with 34 seconds left and Mark Brunell frantically
trying to drive Jacksonville for the tying score.
	   The Steelers (7-4) rebounded from two losses to Tennessee in
three weeks to beat the division-leading Jaguars (8-3) for the
fourth year in a row and close to within a game of the lead.
 &UR; Lions 28, Bucs 25 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Ron Rivers, giving Barry Sanders a breather,
broke a 36-yard touchdown run that helped hold off Tampa Bay.
	   The Bucs (4-7) drove into position for a possible tying or
game-winning score in the closing minutes. But Trent Dilfer threw
behind a wide-open receiver inside the Lions 5 and Ron Rice
intercepted in the end zone.
	   Detroit (4-7) also intercepted another pass that glanced off the
hands of tight end Patrick Hape to set up Tommy Vardell's 1-yard TD
run for a 28-17 lead.
 &UR; Bills 34, Colts 11 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, Antowain Smith rushed for 107 yards
and two touchdowns and Doug Flutie completed 20 of 28 passes for
230 yards and two touchdowns, both of them in Buffalo's 24-point
second quarter.
	   The Bills took a 24-3 halftime lead after trailing 3-0 going
into the second quarter.
	   Andre Reed caught six passes for 108 yards and a 67-yard
touchdown for Buffalo (7-4), which remained in second place in the
AFC East. A New England win over Miami on Monday would give the
Bills a share of first.
 &UR; Giants 20, Eagles 0 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, New York snapped a three-game
losing streak, beating Philadelphia behind a touchdown run by Gary
Brown and Phillippi Sparks' two interceptions.
	   Kent Graham also threw a late touchdown pass in his first start
this season, and Brad Daluiso kicked two field goal as the Giants
(4-7) recorded their first shutout since 1990.
	   The shutout was also the third against the Eagles (2-9) this
season, the most since 1942. It also stretched the Eagles' winless
streak on the road to 15 games (0-14-1), a run that is now almost
certain to end Ray Rhodes' tenure as coach.

 &UR; Broncos 40, Raiders 14 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Denver, John Elway went over 50,000 yards passing for his
career, and the Broncos kept alive its hopes of a perfect season by
defeating Oakland.
	   Elway, sidelined most of the previous two games with a rib
injury, completed 17 of 25 passes for 197 yards and three
touchdowns, raising his career passing total to 50,167 yards,
joining Dan Marino as the only quarterbacks to pass the milestone.
	   Terrell Davis ran for 162 yards on 31 carries and scored once,
and the Broncos intercepted three fourth-quarter passes and
converted all into touchdowns.
	   The Broncos, becoming only the 10th team in NFL history to go
11-0 and aiming to match the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only teams
to go undefeated wire-to-wire, scored the last 23 points of the
game.
 &UR; Jets 24, Oilers 3 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Vinny Testaverde threw for 237 yards
and two touchdowns as the New York Jets bounced back from last
week's last-minute loss to Indianapolis by beating Tennessee.
	   The Jets (7-4) led 23-10 at halftime last week before losing to
the Colts, but they never let the Oilers (6-5) get going after
coming out of halftime tied 3-3.
	   Testaverde took New York downfield on its first two possessions
of the second half. He capped each with touchdown tosses, the first
a 3-yarder to Keyshawn Johnson and the second a 2-yarder to Keith
Byars.
	   Curtis Martin, who rushed for 123 yards, capped the scoring with
a 31-yard run.
 &UR; Ravens 20, Bengals 13 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Priest Holmes, who rushed for 173 yards against
Cincinnati in his first NFL start, piled up 227 more for Baltimore.
	   The Ravens (4-8) swept the Bengals (2-9) for the first time in
their three-year history and dashed Cincinnati's hopes that a
change in quarterbacks from Neil O'Donnell to Paul Justin could
salvage the end of its season.
 &UR; Chargers 38, Chiefs 37 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, two pass interference penalties against James
Hasty set up Charlie Jones' one-handed grab of Craig Whelihan's
1-yard touchdown pass with nine seconds left, giving the host
Chargers the victory over Kansas City.
	   Trailing 37-31 and out of timeouts, the Chargers started the
final drive at their 37 with 51 seconds left. Hasty clipped the
heels of rookie Mikhael Ricks on a long pass play, moving the ball
from the 50 to the 13. After Whelihan threw three incompletions,
Hasty committed another penalty on the 6-foot-5 Ricks in the end
zone, this one on fourth down.
	   Whelihan's TD pass was behind Jones, but he reached back with
his left hand and pulled in the ball to tie the score at 37-37.
John Carney's PAT dropped the Chiefs (4-7) to their sixth straight
loss.
	   The Chargers (5-6) won their second straight since Whelihan was
promoted to starting quarterback over struggling rookie Ryan Leaf.
 &UR; Panthers 24, Rams 20 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Carolina forced a huge Rams turnover to win for
the second time this season.
	   The Panthers (2-9) were on the verge of squandering a 17-point
lead when Roman Phifer intercepted a pass from Steve Beuerlein and
steamed toward the end zone for the apparent game-winning score.
But Mark Carrier stripped Phifer of the ball at the 5, and Carolina
center Frank Garcia covered the ball in the end zone for a
touchback with 2:41 to go.
	   The Rams (3-8) lost for the 10th time in 11 games at home as
well as losing quarterback Tony Banks to a sprained right ankle.

Frenchman shocks field to win men's slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to ADD quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Pierrick Bourgeat will probably wake up
with a sore dialing finger. But it's not every day you get to call
home to France and share a first World Cup victory with family and
friends.
	   The 22-year-old Bourgeat didn't figure to be spending so much
time chatting on the phone after Saturday's first run of a men's
slalom. Blinded by a snowstorm and stunned when he hit himself in
the chin with a ski pole, he staggered to a 14th-place finish.
	   Visibility returned for the afternoon run and, despite huge ruts
at some of the gates, Bourgeat took full advantage.
	   ``It's the perfect kind of conditions for me, when I have to
fight,'' Bourgeat said. ``In conditions like these, I have to ski
my best.''
	   Bourgeat, whose best previous performance was a second last
year, made up over two seconds on the field in the afternoon run,
thanks in large part to his skill at maneuvering through ruts that
tossed his competition like rag dolls.
	   ``I don't like these conditions, but I still skied very hard,''
said Bourgeat, who was so overcome by his victory he kept
forgetting words in English, a language he speaks well. ``On my
second run, I decided I must take chances.
	   ``It's great, it's wonderful, it's magnificent!''
	   It was the first French slalom victory since a 1996 triumph by
Sebastian Amiez, who settled for sixth on Sunday.
	   Bourgeat had a second run of 51.19 seconds. Although not the
fastest of the afternoon, it was 1 1/2 or more seconds ahead of
anyone else who skied late in the session.
	   ``I was really motivated for the second run. I didn't think I
could win; I was aiming at a top-8 result,'' he said.
	   Bourgeat completed two runs in 1 minute, 43.34 seconds, a
healthy .44 seconds faster than Norway's Olympic champion,
Hans-Petter Buraas, who led the Frenchman by 1.67 seconds after a
morning session run during a snowstorm.
	   Although blue skies reappeared for the second run, an army of
course workers was unable to sweep away the snow cover, and the
racers soon built that loose snow into huge ruts, particularly on
the gates midway down the steep portion of the Clementine layout.
	   Austria's Christian Mayer, who would claim third in 1:44.02,
said he didn't ski his best.
	   ``But this is a very tough course under these conditions,'' he
said. ``I'm very excited about this weekend because I'm skiing very
well.''
	   Mayer, second in Friday's giant slalom, parlayed his two-podium
weekend into the lead in the World Cup overall standings. He has
190 points to 180 for teammate Stefan Eberharter, who doesn't ski
slalom.
	   Mayer had just finished when the five heavy hitters from the
first run, four Norwegians and a Slovenian, lined up to try their
luck.
	   Each charged from the gate, each handled the top gates well, but
each was jostled from gate to gate midway down the steeps.
Slovenia's Jure Kosir, second in the morning, almost came to a halt
after crashing into one of the ruts, a collision that helped drop
him to 12th.
	   Buraas came closest to mastering the mid-steep minefield,
although he couldn't approach Burgeat's time. Kjetil Andre Aamodt,
a close fifth in the morning, dropped to a tie for ninth and
teammate Ole Kristian Furuseth went from fourth to 16th.
	   ``I had trouble with some of the bumps but I felt better at the
bottom,'' said Buraas, who has gone back to his natural brown hair
color after sporting a fright-wig red dye job for the Olympics.
``I'm glad to still be in the top three.
	   First-run leader Finn Christian Jagge, who enjoyed a 1.89-second
lead over Bourgeat after the first run, slipped back to a tie for
fourth with Germany's Markus Eberle in 1:44.06, losing an amazing
2.61 seconds to the Frenchman.
	   Rounding out the top 10 were Austria's Thomas Stangassinger,
Canada's Thomas Grandi and, tied for ninth, Aamodt and Frenchman
Francois Simond.

	   GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) _ Bobby Holik had a goal and an
assist and the New Jersey Devils took over first place in the North
American National Hockey League's Atlantic Division with a 5-2
victory over the slumping Carolina Hurricanes on Sunday.
	   Randy McKay, Jay Pandolfo, Denis Pederson and Scott Stevens
added goals for the Devils, who won for the 10th time in 14 games
and moved one point ahead of Pittsburgh.
	   Nelson Emerson and Ray Sheppard scored for Carolina, which was
playing its seventh game in 12 days. The Hurricanes fell two games
below .500 for the first time this season but managed to hang onto
their Southeast Division lead.

	   In Sunrise, Florida, Keith Jones scored 26 seconds into overtime
and John Vanbiesbrouck made 25 saves in his return to South Florida
as the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Florida Panthers.
	   Eric Lindros assisted on both Philadelphia goals, stealing the
puck from Robert Svehla behind the net for the game-winner. Lindros
sent the puck in front to Jones, who fired past Kirk McLean for his
fifth goal.
	   John LeClair scored his 12th as the Flyers won their fourth
straight game. Ed Jovanovski scored Florida's goal.
	   It was the first game back to Florida for Vanbiesbrouck since
the goaltender left the Panthers to sign as a free agent with the
Flyers over the summer.

Norwegian champion's hair is normal, but performance isn't

	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Hans-Petter Buraas has allowed his hair
to return to its natural color, and it appears he'll soon be known
less for his hairstyle and more for what he can do on the slopes.
	   The flamboyant, handsome 23-year-old Norwegian gained
international notoriety with his orange-red hair at the Nagano
Olympics. The dye job drew almost as much attention as his gold
medal-winning performance in the slalom.
	   On Sunday, a brown-haired Buraas finished second in a World Cup
slalom race with a time of 1:43.76, just .42 seconds behind winner
Pierrick Bourgeat of France.
	   ``It is exciting to ski so well this early in the World Cup
season,'' Buraas said. ``I hope I can continue, and I would like to
win sometime in the next few races.''
	   Though he aspires to be a top downhiller someday, Buraas is
perhaps the fastest-rising star on the slalom circuit. He is also
one of a new generation of skilled technical skiers who have
re-invigorated slalom's old guard.
	   ``I'm having too much fun skiing,'' said 33-year-old Austrian
champion Thomas Stangassinger, who finished seventh in Park City.
The discipline's oldest skier retired briefly last summer but
couldn't stay away from the competition.
	   ``It's exciting with the development of new materials and skiing
with the younger guys. That's my motivation for the season.''
	   Buraas had seven finishes in the top six during last year's
World Cup slaloms, and he finished the year ranked third in the
discipline.
	   In his spare time, the charismatic young star enjoys fly fishing
(he is featured in a new Rossignol ad wearing hip waders and
proudly displaying his catch), snowboarding and fast cars.
	   With his surprising gold at Nagano, which he won by a commanding
1.33 seconds, Buraas brought glory to himself and to Norway, whose
ski federation hovered on the brink of bankruptcy only a few years
ago.
	   ``He brought in some new blood, a new way of thinking,'' said
32-year-old Norwegian veteran Finn-Christian Jagge, who led the
first run on Sunday but finished in a disappointing tie for fourth.
``We've been the same team for 10, 15 years, and you kind of fall
into one way of thinking.''
	   Taking advantage of early start times which allowed their
athletes to ski the course before snowfall increased and visibility
decreased, Norway placed four skiers in the top five in the morning
run. But after a disappointing afternoon, the four Norwegians were
spread through the top 13.
	   Buraas says it's unrealistic to expect Norway to dominate in
slalom.
	   ``You'd have to ask Austria what it's like to dominate,'' Buraas
said. ``We just try to ski well and earn a lot of (World Cup)
points.''
	   Buraas has big plans for the remaining season. With all his
success in the last few years, He has yet to win a World Cup race.
	   ``I hope to get the same results in slalom the rest of the
season, and I need better results in giant slalom,'' he said.
Buraas failed to qualify for a second run in last month's GS in
Solden, Austria.
	   ``I will just keep working hard and enjoying myself,'' he said.

Many Christian schools closed after ethnic and religious rioting

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Many Christian schools were closed
Monday following deadly rioting in which mobs of Muslim youths set
fire to churches and attacked Christians.
	   Security was heavy in north Jakarta, where soldiers patrolled
past churches that were ransacked in ethnic and religious violence
on Sunday that killed six people. There were no reports of unrest
Monday morning.
	   The weekend violence came amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as inflation
and unemployment rates soar.
	   Adding to the tension, President B.J. Habibie is at the center
of student protests over his plans to change Indonesia's political
system, which opponents say fall short of introducing true
democracy. Students planned rallies later Monday.
	   The Sunday riots broke out a little more than a week after
deadly clashes between students and security personnel also
triggered rioting. As many as 17 people died during the earlier
clashes. The last died Sunday at a hospital.
	   Dozens were reported injured in the new clashes between the
Muslim majority and Christians originally from the eastern city of
Ambon.
	   Troops desperate to restore order fired shots and volleys of
tear gas to break up rock-throwing crowds that officials said had
burned four churches and ransacked seven others.
	   Muslim residents said they retaliated after the Ambonese threw
rocks at a mosque and smashed windows.
	   The Indonesian Red Cross recovered five bodies of Ambonese who
had been slashed with knives and broken bottles. It was not known
where the sixth victim was from.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However,
religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy.

Japan's Sanyo Securities to begin bankruptcy procedures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanyo Securities Co. has decided to formally file
for bankruptcy after the failure of its restructuring efforts, a
Japanese newspaper reported Monday.
	   The medium-size Japanese brokerage house had applied for court
protection from creditors last November as it sought to rebuild its
operations under a corporation rehabilitation law.
	   But in June, the company said it would halt business because it
had been unable to shore up its finances through restructuring or
find a buyer to take it over.
	   Lawyers handling Sanyo's assets will meet officials from the
Tokyo District Court, where the company had filed for protection,
and the government's financial watchdog agency to discuss how to
handle customer accounts, the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun
reported.
	   Currently, Sanyo is negotiating with Osaka-based NCS Securities
on a possible transfer of 15 billion yen (dlrs 125 million) in
40,000 customer accounts, Asahi said.
	   The bankruptcy procedure will begin either with Sanyo's
voluntary declaration of bankruptcy or the court's cancelation of
protection for the company, Asahi said.
	   As of the end of Japan's fiscal year in March, Sanyo's
liabilities exceeded its assets by some 105.8 billion yen (dlrs 880
million), largely as a result of bad loans held by affiliated
companies, he said.
	   Sanyo expanded its operations aggressively in the late 1980s,
but was hit hard by the collapse of a bubble in Japanese stock and
real estate prices at the outset of this decade.
	   About 1,100 of its more than 2,000 workers have already left the
second-tier brokerage.

McGrath skittles out England with 6-85
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Glenn McGrath continued his dominance
of English batsmen with a six-wicket haul as Australia secured a
first-innings lead in the first Ashes cricket test at the Gabba
Monday.
	   McGrath, who took 36 wickets in Australia's 3-2 success in the
1997 Ashes series, grabbed 6-85 as England, resuming on 299 for
four, was bowled out for 375 at lunch on the fourth day.
	   In two separate spells, McGrath made a mockery of the England
lower order, claiming 4-19 in 62 balls on the fourth morning, three
of them in six balls.
	   Australia, which scored 485 in its first innings thanks to
centuries by Steve Waugh and Ian Healy, has a 110-run first-innings
lead.
	   England lost its last six wickets for 60 runs.
	   After losing his overnight partner to McGrath in the 10th over
of the morning, Mark Ramprakash batted stubbornly for four hours to
remain unbeaten on 69.
	   In McGrath's first spell of the day, Graham Thorpe, who had
helped Ramprakash add 75 runs for the fifth wicket, hooked a catch
to Justin Langer at square leg after scoring 77 runs.
	   In the next Dominic Cork miscued a bouncer to mid on and England
had slumped to 319 for six.
	   Between McGrath's wicket-taking spells, Ramprakash and Robert
Croft (23) managed to squeeze in a 41-run stand for the seventh
wicket when the lanky fast bowler had gone for a well-earned rest.
	   McGrath's first spell was 2-19 in nine overs.
	   Michael Kasprowicz provided the breakthrough bowling Croft, and
McGrath returned to mop up the tail.
	   McGrath's 11th five-wicket haul in his 41st test helped him
extend his tally against England to 48 wickets (average 21.17) in
nine tests.
	   Kasprowicz finished with 2-82.

Slow start on Antarctic Skitrek
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Despite achieving less than half
their planned rate of progress, three adventurers traveling to the
South Pole on skis remain determined to complete the journey.
	   New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Everest conqueror Sir Edmund
Hillary, and Australians Jon Muir and Eric Philips left New
Zealand's Scott Base in Antarctica on Nov. 4 to ski the 3,000
kilometers (1,875 miles) to the South Pole and back.
	   The journey re-creates that of British polar explorer Robert
Falcon Scott, who died with his companions returning to the base in
1912.
	   Skitrek spokesman Marc Spendlove said Monday the adventurers
covered an average of only 13 kilometers (eight miles) a day in the
first 19 days of the planned 100-day trek.
	   They had so far covered about 250 kilometers (155 miles),
instead of the planned 530 kilometers (330 miles).
	   But the men were confident of making up the time and to do the
trek in 100 days ``come hell or high water.''
	   ``They're really dedicated to doing it and they've been focused
on it for such a long time,'' Spendlove said.
	   The trio would give up only if someone's life was in danger, on
what has been billed as the longest unsupported polar skitrek this
century.
	   ``They've had incredible headwinds, which has slowed them, and
they've been towing sleds of 180 kilograms (396 pounds) each,''
Spendlove added.
	   Despite being behind schedule, the men remain confident of
reaching the South Pole by Christmas Day and trekking back to Scott
Base by Feb. 7 _ the cutoff date for having to be back before the
Antarctic weather turns nasty.
	   Head winds meant the men so far had been unable to use their
quadrifoil kites, which were able to pull them along on their skis,
with their sleds behind them.
	   ``As soon as the wind changes direction they'll be able to get
on to the kites and it will really speed their time up,'' he said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Olympics Minister Michael Knight said
Monday he will contact all Sydney 2000 organizing committee board
members to try to end damaging divisions among them.
	   Prominent board member Rod McGeogh, who helped galvanize the bid
that brought the Games to Sydney, has highlighted the split between
board members recently by claiming he is the victim of a political
vendetta.
	   On Sunday, Prime Minister John Howard criticized the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, urging board members to
stop their squabbling in order to protect Australia's reputation.
	   His call follows a report in the Sunday Telegraph that Sydney
Games bid organizer McGeoch was considering quitting the board
because of attempts to discredit him.
	   Knight, who is also SOCOG president, said he would be talking to
all 15 board members on Monday urging them to ``take a deep breath,
calm down and get back to working together.''
	   ``The board will be one big happy family very quickly,'' he
said.
	   But Knight had some veiled criticism for McGeogh, saying ``it's
unhelpful when board members are attacking each other in the public
arena.''
	   Knight said the International Olympic Committee had not
contacted him over the political bickering. (djp)

Asia is front line against global TB epidemic, WHO boss warns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Global efforts to control a
tuberculosis emergency risk failing unless the disease _ the top
infectious killer of adults _ is contained in Asia, the World
Health Organization warned Monday.
	   Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO director general, urged governments,
donors and international organizations to bring political will to
bear in a new, global anti-TB initiative to stop the spread of the
disease and prevent more deadly forms from developing.
	   ``Our ability to control TB pivots on Asia _ now the epicenter
of the world,'' said Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway.
``If we cannot control TB in Asia, we will never stop TB
globally.''
	   Brundtland's appeal came in videotaped remarks prepared for the
opening of a four-day Global Congress on Lung Disease, bringing
together 1,500 lung disease experts from 90 countries. It is the
largest such meeting held in Asia in a decade.
	   The WHO fears that the Asian economic crisis could lower living
standards and increase the spread of communicable diseases, while
state health programs face funding cuts.
	   Six Asian countries _ Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia,
Pakistan and the Philippines _ account for 4.5 million of the 8
million new cases of tuberculosis illness a year, the WHO
estimates.
	   Globally, nearly 3 million of those who become sick with
tuberculosis die, making it the worst infectious disease killer
among people older than five. Childhood vaccinations for
tuberculosis wear off in adulthood. There is no adult vaccine.
	   Though tuberculosis is curable, normal treatment is a six-month
program of taking medicine daily. Many people, especially the poor,
stop after a month or so, once they start feeling better.
	   That can leave the strongest TB bacilli still in the lungs,
resistant to drugs and ready to infect new people. This
multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis _ MDR-TB to specialists _ costs
100 times more to treat and usually proves fatal.
	   The evolution of drug-resistant tuberculosis is converging with
the spread of AIDS, which destroys the immune system that normally
prevents tuberculosis infection from developing into illness.
	   The WHO estimates a window of opportunity exists over the next
decade to prevent a tuberculosis explosion.
	   In a report released Monday, the WHO said the best hope of
curing patients and preventing the spread of drug-resistant
tuberculosis is to get sick people to finish their treatment.
	   The most workable way is called DOTS, or Directly Observed
Treatment, Short-course. It means getting someone to physically
observe a TB patient take his medication every day _ volunteers,
health workers, a work supervisor _ and monitor their progress
until they are cured.
	   The WHO says that more than 100 countries are using DOTS. In the
half of China where the system has been introduced, the cure rate
for tuberculosis has risen to 95 percent.
	   Though the system is labor intensive, the World Bank has judged
it cost-effective when the costs of drug-resistant TB treatment,
lost wages and other factors are taken into account.
	   In many countries, tuberculosis is an invisible problem since it
usually affects the poorest people. The affluent are able to afford
medication through the six-month period of treatment.
	   But with the drug-resistant strains, that could change _ the
treatment costs 100 times as much.

Rare turtle shells burned at Miss World pageant to stop poaching

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Conservationists are hoping an unusual combination
of beauty pageant and bonfire will help raise awareness about the
plight of the critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle.
	   They have convinced the island nation of the Seychelles, host of
the annual Miss World beauty pageant, to torch its stockpile of
confiscated shells Monday and dump others back into the sea _ with
several of the Miss World contestants looking on.
	   ``The Seychelles realize that live sea turtles are a better
source of revenue to the country than dead ones,'' said U.S. sea
turtle biologist Jeanne Mortimer, who has studied hawksbills for 25
years and advises the Seychelles government.
	   The bonfire, reminiscent of the ceremonial burning of elephant
ivory in Kenya several years ago, will be videotaped for broadcast
during the Nov. 26 pageant, which is televised in 100 countries to
an estimated audience of one billion viewers.
	   The 2.5 tons of shells _ commonly referred to as ``tortoise
shells'' _ are worth dlrs 115,000 on the illegal market. The
stockpile accounts for about 3,000 turtles, and is equal to 20
percent of the world's population.
	   Despite an international trade ban in the shells since 1975,
fishermen in the Indian Ocean archipelago have hunted the hawksbill
to near-extinction. Their activities were banned locally four years
ago.
	   In 1997, the government also banned the use of shark-fishing
nets because they catch turtles, too.
	   Not all conservationists agree with the plan.
	   They argue that a legal shell trade, if strictly regulated,
could help the hawksbill recover and provide locals with a reliable
living.
	   ``Burning hawksbill turtle shells has far more to do with public
relations than any real attempt to help turtle populations,'' said
Michael De Alessi, director of the Center for Private Conservation,
a market-oriented conservation think-tank in Washington, D.C.
	   ``The answer is not to try to destroy the value of the shells,''
he said. ``It is to allow institutions that will only profit by
conserving the species.''
	   The hawksbill, native to the reefs of shallow, warm coastlines
throughout the world, is listed by the World Wildlife Fund as the
seventh-most endangered species on the planet, behind the black
rhino, tiger, giant panda and other more widely-known animals.
	   But humans have long found them irresistible.
	   For the past century, artisans have crafted its richly mottled
orange head scales into jewelry, hair pins, eyeglasses frames,
cigarette cases and other ornaments.
	   Merchants call it ``tortoise shell,'' but nearly all of it is
hawksbill.
	   The hawksbill population has plummeted by 80 percent and
continues to decline, according to the Center for Marine
Conservation in Washington, D.C.
	   Sixty countries have tallied nesting sites on their beaches, but
there remains only five sites scattered around the world with 1,000
or more turtles.
	   A recent study in the Solomon Islands showed that 90 percent of
female hawksbills there were first-time nesters. Given that turtles
typically live more than 40 years, the researchers concluded that
most of females manage to lay only one clutch of eggs before they
are captured or their beaches are bulldozed for development.
	   In 1997, at the U.N. Convention on Trade in Endangered Species
held in Harare, Zimbabwe, Cuba lost a request to reopen the
hawksbill trade in both confiscated shell stockpiles and fresh wild
shells.
	   Japan would have been the biggest market for the shells, and it
lobbied for the Cuban proposal. From 1970 until 1992, Japan
imported 754 tons of raw shell, equal to 712,000 adult hawksbills.
It has its own stockpile of at least 188 tons.
	   Supporters of the Cuban proposal said there is insufficient data
to justify the trade ban or the hawksbill's listing as a critically
endangered species. They cited the same argument that
conservationists use in protecting the turtle: it is highly
migratory, making exact population estimates and behavioral studies
very difficult.
	   The argument outraged turtle conservationists.
	   ``The only controversy is that being created by those who wish
to resume international trade,'' said Anne Meylan of the Florida
Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg. ``It's an obfuscating
tactic, and is appalling in its transparency.''

Death toll rises to 91 in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The death toll from the most recent bout
of serious flooding in central Vietnam has risen to 91, local
officials said Monday, and the figure was expected to rise as more
reports come in.
	   The floods were affecting several hundred thousand people in one
of Vietnam's poorest regions. No damage estimate was available, but
it was believed to be in the tens of millions of dollars.
	   Downpours of up to 1.185 meters (nearly four feet) Thursday
through Sunday submerged large swaths of land. Some rain was
reported Monday in parts of the affected area, and water levels
there were still rising.
	   Floods and storm control committees from eight central provinces
said said 24 people had died in Danang province, 14 in Quang Nam,
16 in Thua Thien Hue, 11 in Quang Ngai, nine in Binh Dinh, eight in
Phu Yen, six in Khanh Hoa and three in Daklak.
	   The committees said they have provided 1 million dong (dlrs 70)
each for families who lost loved ones to bury them.
	   The Quang Nam floods and storms control committee about 200,000
families live in areas that now are submerged in that province
alone. Local authorities are providing food to them.
	   Danang city officials are giving instant noodles to about 50,000
people in one district and said it may take many days for the
water, which is 2-3 meters (six to 10 feet) deep in some places, to
recede.
	   A government delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung is touring the affected areas.
	   Dung was quoted as saying property can be lost but that local
governments must not allow more deaths.
	   Two previous floods in the region in the last month killed 69
people and caused damage estimated at dlrs 22 million. Until
mid-August, the region was suffering from its worst drought in at
least half a century.

Iraqi opposition groups to meet with British officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Lead expected after briefing scheduled at 1430 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ While Iraqi opposition groups share the goal of
toppling Saddam Hussein, they also are deeply divided along ethnic,
religious and political lines.
	   Sharing the goal of ousting the Iraqi leader, British officials
have invited more than a dozen Iraqi dissident groups for a meeting
Monday to settle their differences.
	   The meeting with Derek Fatchett, a minister at the Foreign
Office, was to be the first of what officials expect to be a series
of briefings.
	   The United States and Britain have recently pledged publicly to
help opposition groups in their efforts to overthrow Saddam and
install a democratic government in Iraq.
	   The United States announced last week that it had held talks
with Ahmed Chalabi, head of the London-based opposition group, the
Iraqi National Congress. The U.S. Congress has also approved a dlrs
97 million aid package to offer support to Iraqi dissidents.
	   British officials said they would not be offering large amounts
of cash or military aid, but instead would focus on finding common
ground among the groups.
	   London is one of the main centers for Iraqi exile and opposition
groups.
	   At various times, the dissidents have succeeded in bringing
together Shiite Muslim groups, former ruling party officials and
Kurdish guerrillas who sought autonomy in northern Iraq, but the
movement continues to be hampered by internal divisions.
	   Still, the opposition groups maintain they are a key source of
information on Saddam's government and critical to any rebellion
against Saddam.
	   The Iraqi National Accord, a dissident group based in London,
provided British authorities with a detailed list last week of
Saddam's international spy network, according to The Sunday
Telegraph.
	   The document, compiled by Saddam's private secretary, named all
the members of Iraqi intelligence service who are posing as
diplomats, the newspaper said. The opposition group claimed to have
released it to the West before the document was even on Saddam's
desk.
	   ``Information like this is priceless in the battle to end
Saddam's tyranny,'' Dr. Ayad Alawi, who heads the opposition group,
told the newspaper. ``It shows that often we know more about what
is going on inside Iraq than Saddam. And the more we know, the more
damage we can do to him.''
	   Alawi also told The Sunday Telegraph that it is important
opposition groups know they have the West's support.
	   ``There is no point in the West urging Iraqis to overthrow
Saddam if it is not prepared to help. The first step towards
getting rid of Saddam is to persuade the Iraqi people that hey have
friends and supporters outside who can help them succeed,'' he told
the newspaper.
	   The Foreign Office has stressed, however, that the prime
objective on both sides of the Atlantic is to get Saddam to comply
with U.N. resolutions and stick to agreements he made last week to
avert the immediate threat of airstrikes.

Seven killed in China fireworks factory blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in
central China's Henan province killed seven women workers aged 16
to 22, an official newspaper said Monday.
	   The November 16 blast destroyed six workshops at the Xuliu
Firecracker Factory in Xuchang city, about 700 kilometers (434
miles) south of Beijing, the Beijing Morning Post reported. A
bicycle caught in the blast was picked up and carried 50 meters
(165 feet), the newspaper said.
	   The seven women workers were killed on the spot, the report
said. The factory was not officially approved, and police have
detained one of its supervisors, the newspaper said.

	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ Jonathan Kaye of Phoenix shot a
par-72 at the La Quinta Dunes Course to hold the lead in the PGA
Tour final qualifying tournament for the third consecutive day.
	   Kaye enters Monday's sixth and final round at 19-under 351, one
shot ahead of four players for the coveted top qualifying spot and
the dlrs 50,000 top prize.
	   Geoffery Sisk and Deane Pappas, a pair of veterans from the
second-tier Nike Tour, shot 65 and 66 respectively Sunday to tie
for second at 18 under.
	   Two-time PGA Tour winner Rick Fehr and England's Greg Chalmers
are also at 18 under entering the final round at the Weiskopf
Course at PGA West.
	   Kaye and the other leaders struggled to get under par at the
Dunes Course despite a fifth day of near-perfect conditions. Kaye's
round was derailed with a double-bogey 6 on the par-4 17th, which
he played as his eighth hole.
	   Sisk, 38th on the Nike Tour money list this year, bogeyed the
17th and had two other bogeys. But he capped his round with an
eagle-3 on the ninth hole. His 65 tied for the best round of the
day with Bo Van Pelt of Stillwater, Okla.
	   The top 35 players in the field earn PGA Tour exemptions for
1999, while the next 50 players earn full exemptions to the
developmental Nike Tour. The rest of the 169-player field earns
conditional exempt status for the Nike Tour.
	   Three tour veterans, Bobby Wadkins, R.W. Eaks and Gene Sauers,
withdrew during Sunday's fifth round with various injuries.

Singapore launches controversial futures contract despite Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's bid to eclipse its financial
competitors in Asia took a step forward Monday when its monetary
exchange launched a controversial futures contract based on stocks
nearly identical to Hong Kong's benchmark index.
	   The Morgan Stanley Capital International Hong Kong Stock Index
Futures contract was relisted on the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange, or SIMEX, after a one year break despite
vehement opposition from Hong Kong's stock exchange.
	   Officials from the Hong Kong bourse have said that the futures
contract _ based on an index that is practically the same as the
Hang Seng Index _ may be used by speculators to renew attacks on
the Chinese territory's stock market.
	   Futures allow investors to protect themselves against price
changes by requiring those who hold the contract to buy or sell a
security, currency or commodity at a predetermined price during a
stipulated period.
	   The Hong Kong stock exchange has warned information providers
not to give SIMEX or Morgan Stanley Capital International the
real-time price data required to compile the rival index, and has
cast doubts on the ability of Singapore's exchange to properly
regulate the Hong Kong-linked futures.
	   But Morgan Stanley has effectively foiled Hong Kong's efforts to
block the market data by releasing the formula for the rival index
on its web site, allowing anyone with the real-time information to
calculate the MSCI Hong Kong Stock Index themselves.
	   Singapore's decision to relaunch a contract that enjoyed only
marginal business during five years of previous trading is seen as
part of a move to outdo its principal competitor in the region and
catapult the city-state into Asia's premier financial center.
	   While Hong Kong has recently intervened to prop up its stock
market, raising investor fears that it has cashed in its
laissez-faire approach for more control, Singapore has been busy
liberalizing its markets and easing previously rigid regulations.
	   Singapore officials have argued that the futures contract isn't
aimed at stealing business away from Hong Kong, and have reassured
their counterparts that Singapore's regulations will prevent
speculators from attacking the Hong Kong stock market.
	   ``Exchanges that adopt an enlightened approach to competition
find that there is a bigger pie to share,'' said SIMEX president
Ang Swee Tian earlier this month.
	   Discussions between the exchanges failed to resolve the issue,
however. It took a meeting between Hong Kong chief executive Tung
Chee-hwa and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong last week to
soothe fears.
	   The two leaders agreed to get their regulation authorities to
cooperate more closely so that speculators would not take advantage
of what is called ``regulatory arbitrage,'' or differences in
trading regulations.
	   Hong Kong traders and analysts greeted the Monday futures launch
with calm, arguing that Hong Kong stock exchange officials were
over-reacting to the potential speculatory threat and increased
competition.
	   ``I totally think it's a storm in a teacup,'' Simon Pritchard,
regional strategist with Hong Kong-listed hedge fund Regent Pacific
Group, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   ``This SIMEX thing may not come to much. One shouldn't assume
that it will be the 'be-all-and-end-all.' Not all of their
instruments in Singapore are successful,'' said Howard Gorges, a
director at South China Securities in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tennessee is anything but rocky at the top.
	   With a 59-21 victory over Kentucky, the Volunteers easily held
their No. 1 ranking Sunday in The Associated Press' Top 25 college
football poll.
	   Tennessee (10-0), with 42 first-place votes and 1,715 points,
increased its slim lead of a week ago over No. 2 Kansas State.
	   The Kansas State Wildcats (11-0), who got past Missouri 31-25 on
Saturday, had 24 first-place votes and 1,685 points from the 70
sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel.
	   Last week, Tennessee led the Wildcats by eight first-place votes
and 10 points. This week, the lead is up to 18 first-place votes
and 30 points.
	   UCLA (10-0), 34-17 winners over Southern California, remained
No. 3 with four first-place votes and 1,628 points.
	   Florida State (11-1) moved up a spot to No. 4 after its 23-12
win over Florida (9-2), which fell four spots to No. 8 from a week
ago.
	   Ohio State (10-1), with a 31-16 win over Michigan, moved up two
places to No. 5, followed by No. 6 Texas A-and-M, No. 7 Arizona,
No. 8 Florida, No. 9 Notre Dame and No. 10 Wisconsin.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five are Kansas
State, Tennessee, UCLA, Florida State and Ohio State.
	   Tulane (10-0), the only other team with a perfect record, was
No. 11 in the AP poll, followed by No. 12 Georgia, No. 13 Arkansas,
No. 14 Nebraska, No. 15 Michigan, No. 16 Virginia, No. 17 Georgia
Tech, No. 18 Air Force, No. 19 Miami and No. 20 Virginia Tech.
	   Arkansas dropped four places after its second straight loss,
22-21 to Mississippi State, while the Wolverines also dropped four
spots with the loss to Ohio State. Miami, a 38-10 winner over
Pittsburgh last Thursday night, improved three places.
	   Syracuse, which beat Temple 38-7, was No. 21, followed by No. 22
Oregon, No. 23 Penn State, No. 24 Missouri and No. 25 Mississippi
State.
	   The Ducks, who lost 44-41 to Oregon State in two overtimes, and
the Nittany Lions, 24-3 losers to Wisconsin, each fell seven spots
from last week, while Missouri dropped five spots with its loss to
K-State.

Clinton Visits Guam after Cheering Troops in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS Clinton remarks.
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAGATNA, Guam (AP) _ After spotlighting American military might
in South Korea, President Bill Clinton flew here Monday to pay
respects to the thousands of Americans killed in liberating this
Pacific island from a harsh occupation in World War II.
	   He opened his visit with remarks to leaders of Guam, other U.S.
territorial jurisdictions in the Pacific and other islands.
	   Clinton said U.S. ties with the islands ``have enabled us to
work together to preserve peace, to foster economic development
across more than a million square miles of the Pacific. It is a
relationship the United States takes very seriously.''
	   Guam's sunny, hot weather was a sharp contrast to the
bone-chilling cold Sunday in South Korea where Clinton visited
armored troops at an Army outpost near the Demilitarized Zone and
spoke at an Air Force U-2 spy plane hangar. His visit demonstrated
U.S. military solidarity with Seoul against a still-hostile North
Korea.
	   ``North Korea must maintain its freeze on _ and move ahead to
dismantle _ its nuclear weapons program,'' Clinton declared to
hundreds of troops and their families huddled in sub-freezing cold
outside a hangar that houses U-2s of the ``Black Cat'' 5th
Reconnaissance Squadron.
	   On his way back to Washington, Clinton stopped in Guam, the
Pacific island U.S. territory that hosts Andersen Air Force Base, a
staging base for American warplanes that would be used in a war in
Asia. From Guam, Clinton was returning to Washington after a
five-day Asia tour.
	   Clinton's Guam visit included a stop at the War in the Pacific
National Park on Asan Bay. Guam was seized by Japan in concert with
the attack on Pearl Harbor and the people were subjected to a harsh
occupation.

Trial of jailed Malaysian politician Anwar resumes
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The politically charged corruption
trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim resumed Monday
amid a national outcry against foreigners accused of supporting
him.
	   The Malaysian government had recessed Anwar's trial so it would
not interfere with last week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit of 21 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   The weeklong pause, however, only intensified the global
spotlight focused on the Southeast Asian country and the
government's treatment of the former No. 2 leader.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, sitting in for President Bill
Clinton at the APEC summit, expressed support for Anwar's
anti-government reform movement.
	   Gore's words _ in which he praised ``the brave people of
Malaysia'' for their reform movement _ only served to enrage the
government and spark a nationwide outpouring of support for Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his firing by
Mahathir sparked massive anti-government protests. The current
trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried on
another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   The 51-year-old sacked deputy denies the charges, calling them
part of political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor,
Mahathir.
	   On Monday, the prosecution called its seventh witness, Mazlam
Mohamed Zin. The assistant commissioner of police testified that he
was instructed to force two key witnesses to retract allegations of
sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   There appeared to be an effort Monday to keep Anwar at a greater
distance from the public. His dock was pushed closer to his
lawyers, making it more difficult for him to communicate with his
family and the media.
	   Anti-riot police once again surrounded the red-brick courthouse
in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   On Saturday night, police arrested at least four Anwar
supporters, including opposition leader Tian Chua, a human rights
activist who heads up an opposition coalition founded after Anwar's
arrest.
	   Anwar's case sparked international outrage when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was
blindfolded by police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   During the APEC summit, top-ranking officials from Australia,
Canada and the United States, as well as Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, angered the government by meeting privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to express concern over her husband's
case.
	   The government has accused Gore of meddling in its domestic
affairs by expressing support for the political reform movement
started by Anwar.
	   U.S. Ambassador John Malott was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
on Monday.
	   ``We reiterated Malaysia's position that Gore's speech was an
incitement of lawlessness and not simply a call of democracy as
claimed,'' John Tenewi Nuek, undersecretary for the Americas, told
the national news agency Bernama.
	   Gore's remarks have triggered a nationalistic fervor. A hot line
was hooked up over the weekend for callers to register anti-U.S.
sentiments.
	   An effigy of Gore was burned at a gathering of several hundred
people carrying anti-American placards in the northern state of
Perlis on Sunday.
	   Radio blurbs urge people to pick up their free Malaysian
mini-flags at Malay-owned companies. Many cars and taxis have
