Philippine bad loans rise to 7.6 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Non-performing loans in the
Philippine banking sector rose to 7.6 percent of total loans as of
March 31, the central bank said Tuesday.
	   The central bank's treasury director, Amando Tetangco, said the
rise from 5 percent at the end of 1997 wasn't surprising given the
impact of the region's financial crisis. He called the level
manageable.
	   The central bank has forecast that the ratio of non-performing
loans will rise to about 8 percent by the end of the year.
	   He said those banks that are experiencing financial difficulties
are smaller institutions.
	   Central bank officials earlier Tuesday denied a report in a
local newspaper saying that monetary authorities have put 17
allegedly ailing banks on a watch list.
	   ``We have no such list,'' central bank deputy governor Alberto
Reyes told a radio station.
	   The report came a day after the central bank announced the
closure of a small Manila thrift bank, Commonwealth Savings and
Loan Bank, which was placed in receivership.
	   The central bank has said two other small banks _ Richmond Bank
and Fortune Savings and Loan Association _ have problems, but are
preparing rehabilitation programs.
	   Reyes said the country's larger banks are well capitalized and
in sound financial health.
	   Tetangco said the regional currency crisis has prompted the
central bank to set up a special monitoring team to scrutinize
various aspects of the banking system in addition to existing
oversight in areas such as foreign exchange and bank deposit
movements.
	   ``But there is no watch list of banks,'' he reiterated.

Dozens feared dead in movie theater fire in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dozens of people are feared dead after
fire swept through a crowded movie theater and shopping center in
Palembang on the island of Sumatra, police said Tuesday.
	   Fire broke out in the Megahira shopping center, which contained
the cinema, on Monday night while hundreds were inside watching a
film. Dozens more were lined up to buy movie tickets and others
were in an adjacent amusement center.
	   Police said the exact number of victims was unknown. The fire
was still smoldering Tuesday morning, hampering the rescue efforts.
	   Only two bodies had been recovered so far, police said.
	   The cause of the blaze has not been established.
	   The newspaper Republika said most of those who died had been on
the top three floors of the five-story shopping center.
	   It said only nine people were known to have escaped the flames.
They reached safety by climbing down ropes of a window washing
platform on the outside of the building.
	   Three of the nine fell to the ground and were hospitalized with
serious injuries.
	   The newspaper said those who escaped claimed ``many people'' had
been trapped inside after panic broke out.
	   ``On the stairs we trampled over each other to get out,''
Republika quoted one survivor, identified by the single name of
Zukar, as saying.
	   The fire follows several shopping mall blazes that killed
hundreds of people during riots in the capital Jakarta last month.
	   Police say the Jakarta fires had been deliberately lit and most
of the dead had been looters.

More than 47 million rats killed this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More than 47 million rats have been killed
in Vietnam this year in a campaign to keep the voracious rodents
from destroying the rice crop, a government official said Tuesday.
	   Dam Quoc Tru, deputy director of the Agriculture Ministry's
Plants Protection Department, said rats have damaged nearly 230,000
hectares (568,000 acres) of paddy fields with more than 12,000
hectares (30,000 acres) seriously damaged.
	   Tru said there was no immediate financial estimate of the damage
for the first five months of 1998, but last year rats damaged
375,000 hectares (926,000 acres) of paddy fields and rice worth
dlrs 6 million.
	   Tru said the damage caused by rats increased dramatically over
the past three years due to the shrinking population of traditional
predators, cats and snakes, which are being served at restaurants
or are sold to China for traditional medicine.
	   Earlier this year, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai ordered
restaurants serving cat meat to close and banned the export of cats
and snakes.
	   In rural areas home to 80 percent of Vietnam's 76 million
people, local governments have launched a campaign urging villagers
to kill rats. In some places, one rat tail fetches a reward of 500
dong (4 cents).
	   Tru said in some provinces, villagers were given 30,000 dong
(dlrs 2.30) per family to raise cats.
	   However, the anti-rat fight has taken a toll. Reports have
emerged of people being killed by stepping on electric traps and of
children dying from eating cakes or candies laced with rat poison.
	   Last year, some 55 million rats were killed by trapping, hunting
or poisoning.

Russian ship escapes while in custody
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Maritime police said Tuesday they were
searching for a Russian ship which broke court-ordered custody and
ran away with two South Korean guards held captive.
	   Chavshov Alexay, 36, the Russian owner of the 683-ton
refrigerator ship Tibiya, was arrested at Kimhae airport late
Monday as he tried to slip out of South Korea, police said.
	   Alexay was accused of instructing his vessel's 18-man crew to
flee after talks broke down on how to pay dlrs 1.5 million he owed
to a South Korean ship repairing company.
	   When the ship docked at Pusan port on the southeast coast on
April 7 for repair, the South Korean company filed suit with a
local court, seeking payment of dlrs 1.5 million incurred for
earlier repair work.
	   The Pusan civil court accepted the suit and ordered the ship
impounded pending auction.
	   Court-hired private guards were posted on the ship on three-day
shifts to enforce the court order. But when new guards sailed out
early Monday for a shift change, the Russian vessel was gone,
police said.
	   The Foreign Ministry said it has asked the Russian government to
help search for the runaway ship.

Abubakar, career serviceman, assumes power in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Nigeria-Abacha, Nigeria-Abacha-Reax &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A career serviceman, Abdulsalam Abubakar
became Nigeria's ninth military ruler since the country gained
independence from British colonial rule in 1960.
	   Promoted from major general to the full rank of general during a
Monday ceremony to appoint him Nigeria's new head of state,
Abubakar, 55, joined the national political scene in 1993 as the
late Gen. Sani Abacha's chief of staff.
	   Born June 13, 1942, in the town of Minna near the capital,
Abuja, Abubakar was sent off to secondary school from 1957 to 1962
in the nearby town of Bida.
	   Growing up during the heady buildup toward independence from
British rule in 1960, Abubakar later graduated from secondary
school and went on to study at the Kaduna Technical Institute
before joining the air force.
	   In the mid-1970s, he switched services and joined the army,
which sent him to the United States for formal training. Details of
his U.S. training weren't immediately known.
	   In 1981, Abubakar was appointed commander of a Nigerian
contingent attached to a U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
	   Rising through the ranks, he became a senior officer in the army
during the late 1980s, finally drawing Abacha's attention in 1993.
	   Abubakar is married and has two sons and three daughters.

Dissident: Abacha's death `incredible opportunity' for Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   Lagos, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's death
Monday is an ``incredible opportunity'' for the West African nation
to return to democracy, a leading dissident in exile said _ a hope
echoed by Western powers.
	   Playwright Wole Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in
literature and an outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria
in 1994. Abacha's military regime charged him with treason, a crime
punishable by death.
	   Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem, where he was lecturing at
Hebrew University, Soyinka called Abacha's death ``an opportunity
for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity for the Nigerian
military, and an opportunity for the international community.''
	   In a predawn ceremony Tuesday, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakara, a
major general in the army and defense chief of staff, was sworn in
as Abacha's successor.
	   Even while Abacha was still in power, Nigerians were struggling
to restore democracy, Soyinka said.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   The United States, Britain and New Zealand urged a quick
transition to democracy in Nigeria, a former British colony.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S. government
``acknowledges the death'' of Abacha, and is interested in seeing
his successor embark upon democratic rule.
	   ``There have been freely and democratically elected figures
throughout Africa that were formerly involved in the military,''
McCurry said. ``Our hope, among others, would be, at this moment of
transition, that an accountable civilian government ... will emerge
from what has been a very horrific episode in which basic
fundamental rights have been suspended.''
	   The 53-nation Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies
suspended Nigeria after it executed playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight other dissidents in 1995.
	   Nigerian Chief Emeka Anyaoku, head of the Commonwealth, told BBC
TV: ``The Commonwealth would hope and would expect that the
Nigerians will decide to go back to the way of democracy and in so
doing will gain re-admission to the Commonwealth.''
	   The international community should now press for elections in
Nigeria this year, said New Zealand's foreign minister, Don
McKinnon.
	   ``Nigeria was one of the leaders in democracy in Africa back in
the 1960s and there's no reason why they can't return to it. But
it's very much up to (those there) to do something about it,'' he
said.
	   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who had met with Abacha to
persuade him to relinquish power peacefully, said he hoped ``that
the new head of state will move toward a democratic transition of
government in a timely manner.''
	   Nigeria's next leader could hardly be any worse than Abacha,
Saro-Wiwa's son said in Britain.
	   ``In Nigeria, the thinking has always been that every successive
dictator is worse than the previous one, so one hopes that we don't
get another dictator because he will have quite a record to better
Abacha's appalling record,'' said Ken Wiwa.
	   Soyinka urged the military to release all political prisoners,
including Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of Nigeria's aborted
1993 presidential elections, and name Abiola head of a transitional
national unity government.
	   ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's a democratic
option,'' he said. ``And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting.''
	   Until that happens, the international community should increase
pressure and sanctions on the military government, Soyinka said.
	   ``They have an incredible opportunity to bow out gracefully,''
Soyinka said of the military. ``Let us pray that they take it.''

ATLANTA: Darrin Winston (2-2).
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Rangers 3, Rockies 1 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Denver, Domingo Cedeno homered and drove in all three Texas
runs, and Aaron Sele became the majors' second nine-game winner.
	   Sele (9-3) went eight innings, limiting Colorado to five hits
and a first-inning run, to join Atlanta's Greg Maddux with nine
victories. He struck out six and walked four.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 17th save in 18
chances. The Rangers have won seven of their last 10, while the
Rockies have lost four straight.
 &UR; Marlins 4, Blue Jays 3, 17 innings &QC; 
	   In Miami, Todd Zeile singled home the winning run to cap a
bizarre 17th inning, and the Florida Marlins snapped an 11-game
losing streak.
	   Toronto appeared to take a 4-3 lead in the 17th when Felipe
Crespo scored from first on a two-out double by Carlos Delgado. But
the Marlins argued that Crespo had missed third base, and plate
umpire Tom Hallion upheld the appeal and ruled him out, ending the
inning.
	   Television replays showed that Crespo appeared to touch the
inside of third base on his way to the plate.
	   The game was the longest in the Marlins' six-year history, and
matched the longest in Toronto's 22-year history.
 &UR; Padres 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Joey Hamilton allowed two runs in eight innings to
break his career-worst six-game losing streak.
	   The Padres broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning by scoring two
runs on two singles, two walks, a sacrifice fly by Ken Caminiti and
Wally Joyner's bases-loaded RBI groundout.
	   It was enough to give Hamilton (4-7) his first victory since May
2.
 &UR; Athletics 7, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Blake Stein, making just his sixth big-league
start, allowed five hits and struck out 10 in 8 1-3 innings as
Oakland beat the Dodgers.
	   Stein (2-3) gave way to reliever Billy Taylor after giving up a
two-run homer to Eric Karros in the ninth.
	   Jason Giambi hit a three-run homer in the seventh off Ramon
Martinez (7-3) to put Oakland up 7-1.
 &UR; Giants 4, Mariners 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Danny Darwin kept the majors' best home
run-hitting team in the yard and Rich Aurilia homered in his first
at-bat against Randy Johnson as the Giants won their 10th straight.
	   It is San Francisco's longest winning streak since an 11-game
run in 1991. Seattle lost for the eighth time in nine interleague
games at NL parks.
	   The 42-year-old Darwin (6-3) allowed three runs in 6 1-3 innings
against the slumping Mariners, who fell to a season-low nine-games
below .500 (27-36). Johnson (5-5) allowed four runs and six hits in
seven innings. He struck out 10 and walked three.
 &UR; Padres 4, Reds 2
	   In San Diego, Joey Hamilton allowed two runs in eight innings to
break his career-worst six-game losing streak as the Padres beat
the Cincinnati Reds 4-2.
	   The Padres broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning by scoring two
runs off Scott Sullivan (1-3) on two singles, two walks, a
sacrifice fly by Ken Caminiti and Wally Joyner's bases-loaded RBI
groundout.
	   It was enough to give Hamilton (4-7) his first win since May 2.
He allowed seven hits, three walks and struck out five. Trevor
Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 17th save.

Singapore alerting doctors to watch for viral infection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore announced Tuesday that it is alerting
medical practitioners in the health conscious city-state to watch
out for possible cases of a virus that has infected thousands of
children in Taiwan.
	   A joint statement from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of
Environment said that Singapore's ``surveillance system has shown
no unusual occurrence'' of the viral infection here, but that the
two ministries were continuing to monitor the situation closely.
	   The enterovirus 71 epidemic in Taiwan has been blamed for
afflicting about 7,500 children, of whom 29 have died.
	   Usually spread by physical contact, the virus breaks down
immunity and can leave infants susceptible to encephalitis,
meningitis, and acute inflammation of the heart muscle. Early
symptoms are similar to the flu, including fever, headache and
vomiting.
	   The two Singapore ministries said that the epidemic appears to
be confined to Taiwan, and that there was no need for travel
restrictions between the two countries.
	   But the statement added that ``people travelling to Taiwan are
advised to take simple precautions such as avoiding crowded places,
observing a high standard of personal hygiene and avoiding sharing
personal items that are likely to be contaminated.''

Commonwealth's Nigeria contact man urges new elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps to CORRECT reference to Saro-Wiwa in 3rd graf.

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The death of Nigerian military
ruler Gen. Sani Abacha provides an opportunity for the troubled
country to return to democracy, Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said
Tuesday.
	   McKinnon, who is vice-chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group on Nigeria (CMAG), said the international community
should now press for ``free and democratic'' elections in Nigeria
in October.
	   CMAG was set up to monitor Nigeria after it executed nine
activists, including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, while Commonwealth heads
of government were meeting in New Zealand in 1995.
	   Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth
leaders had promised to take punitive action if free elections were
not held in Nigeria by October this year.
	   McKinnon told National Radio there had been reports for some
time that Abacha was ailing, but they had been dismissed as
exaggerated.
	   ``Well, it's happened and that will throw everything into
disarray, but I guess it does give the Nigerians a real opportunity
to move towards some kind of a democratic regime if given a
chance,'' he said.
	   ``Nigeria was one of the leaders in democracy in Africa back in
the 1960s and there's no reason why they can't return to it _ but
it's very much up to (those there) to do something about it.''
	   ``There are a lot of pretty good-thinking people in Nigeria, and
I just hope they take this opportunity to press their claims for a
return to democracy,'' McKinnon said.
	   The international community could do its bit, however, by
maintaining pressure on Nigeria to hold elections this year, he
said.

Philippine Airlines holds emergency board meeting to discuss
</HEADLINE>
pilots' strike

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cash-strapped Philippine Airlines
called an emergency board meeting Tuesday to decide its response to
a crippling 4-day-old strike by most of its pilots.
	   ``They are discussing the fate of our airline,'' a PAL official
said.
	   The strike by the 625 members of the pilots' union has forced
the cancellation of most of the airline's domestic and
international flights.
	   Only 25 management pilots _ senior pilots who train other pilots
_ are flying a limited number of flights, said PAL senior vice
president Avelino Zapanta.
	   When those pilots tire, the airline will have to halt its
operations, he said.
	   The strike has scared off a prospective buyer, Northwest
Airlines, which was in negotiations to purchase a portion of the
financially troubled company, Zapanta said.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of ordering
pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   The policy threatens ``the very survival our profession and our
security of tenure,'' union spokesman Capt. Florendo Umali said.
	   The airline earlier announced plans to slash its work force, cut
expenses by as much as 40 percent, and reduce flights to overcome
its financial crisis.
	   PAL says the strike is causing daily losses of 150 million to
200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1 million) in lost
revenue, pushing it ``closer to the brink of insolvency.''
	   It fired all the striking pilots on Sunday, calling their action
illegal, except for a handful who had complied with an airline
order to return to work.
	   The pilots have refused to accept a separate government order to
return to work, and Zapanta said the airline would not follow a
government order to accept them back.
	   PAL said Monday it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in
the last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous year.
	   Labor Secretary Cresenciano Trajano called a meeting Monday to
try to resolve the strike but the talks broke down after the two
union representatives said they had no decision-making authority.
	   PAL tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion modernization program in 1996, ordering 36 new
aircraft. But Asia's currency crisis sharply reduced passenger
numbers and bloated the airline's debt in local currency terms,
forcing it to delay many of the orders.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government from 1941 until it was partly sold in 1992.

Japanese bank denies rumor over breaking off ties with Swiss Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., a major
Japanese credit bank, denied a rumor Tuesday that it would dissolve
its tie-up with Swiss Bank Corp.
	   ``This is completely false, and there is no truth in it,'' the
Japanese bank said in a statement.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank's share prices moved sharply lower on the
rumor, falling by 14 percent from Monday's finish to 155 yen (dlrs
1.10) per share at the end of Tuesday's morning session on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank Vice President Masami Suda told a news
conference that the bank had asked the Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities watchdog, to
investigate the rumor.
	   Last year, Long-Term Credit Bank and Swiss Bank agreed to form a
strategic alliance to take advantage of Japan's ``Big Bang''
financial deregulation effort.
	   In the statement, Long-Term Credit Bank said that the securities
joint venture created by the alliance, LTCB Warburg Securities
Ltd., had already started operations, and said other joint
operations _ private banking and investment trusts _ will soon be
launched.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ With Ethiopia threatening to attack
Eritrea again unless its neighbor withdraws from disputed
territory, the U.S. government made plans to evacuate Americans,
Germans, Egyptians and some Ethiopians on Tuesday.
	   The American planes would carry at least another 120 of U.S.
citizens.
	   The Eritrean government on Monday called for direct talks
between the two Horn of Africa countries in the presence of
high-level mediators ``to ensure a speedy resolution of the
crisis.''
	   President Isaias Afwerki's spokesman said Ethiopia had
effectively declared war on Eritrea and was using the threat of
renewed air strikes to blockade air and seaports.
	   ``They won't compromise,'' Yemane Gebremeskel said. ``These are
not the actions of a nation that wants peace.''
	   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi accused
the Eritreans of ``a pattern of prevarication, a pattern of trying
to draw out the process and consolidate their hold on our
territory.
	   ``If that's the case _ and it appears to be the case _ then the
opportunities for resolving this problem peacefully could be fast
disappearing,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Eritrea claims its forces are within internationally recognized
borders drawn by Italy in the late 19th century. Eritrea, an
Italian colony from 1885 to 1941, was annexed in 1962 by Ethiopia,
against whom it later fought a 30-year war for independence.
	   With per-capita annual incomes of less than dlrs 300 a year,
Ethiopia and Eritrea are among the world's poorest countries.
	   Isaias indicated pride was an obstacle to resolving the
conflict, underscoring diplomats' concerns that the alliance
between Isaias' Eritrean People's Liberation Front and Meles'
Tigray People's Liberation Front to end 17 years of military rule
in Ethiopia in 1991 has soured.
	   ``We might be more concerned about pride, integrity, respect and
all that kind of thing _ trust, confidence. When you lose that it
becomes a big problem for us in this region _ it's not always money
and resources,'' Isaias said late Monday.
	   ``If we can find a lasting, sustainable solution, then we will
have to think of reversing the process, building confidence again
and trying to work together but it will take time and it will take
a lot of effort, in my opinion,'' he said.

Floods kill 16 in northwestern Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Floods caused by heavy rains have killed at
least 16 people in northwestern Iran over the past month, the
Iranian news agency reported.
	   The floods, which hit some 10 towns in the East Azerbaijan
province, also damaged homes and farmlands, the agency said late
Monday. It gave no other details.
	   In April, 81 people were killed by floods in the southwestern
provinces of Khuzestan and Charmahal-va-Bakhtiyari.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 150,000 Indonesians and
foreigners fled the country during a six-day period when riots
broke out last month, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The riots lead to the downfall of ex-President Suharto. Many of
those who fled were frightened ethnic Chinese who were targeted as
scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Almost 1,200 people died in the violence, the worst to hit the
capital Jakarta and other cities in decades.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper quoted Director General of
Immigration Pranowo as saying 70,837 Indonesian citizens and 81,526
foreigners left between May 14 and May 20 from airports and
seaports on the islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra.
	   The paper said many foreign airlines provided extra services to
cope with the exodus. Several multinational companies and foreign
governments arranged evacuation charter flights.
	   Violence erupted after four students were shot dead by security
forces at an anti-government rally at Jakarta's Trisakti University
on May 12.
	   It stopped after ex-president Suharto resigned on May 21, ending
a 32-year authoritarian grip on power.
	   Pranowo said 51,160 people returned in subsequent days,
including 27,616 Indonesians and 23,544 foreigners.
	   He did not say how many had returned to date.
	   Many observers fear the violence could flare again unless
rampant inflation and soaring unemployment are brought under
control.
	   Many Chinese business people have reportedly moved assets
offshore and have kept their families overseas as a precaution.
	   Justice Minister Muladi expressed concern that Indonesians of
Chinese descent were singled out by rioting mobs.
	   The ethnic Chinese community makes up only about 4 percent of
Indonesia's 202 million people, but dominates commerce and
industry. Many are Christians or Buddhists in what is the world's
most populous Muslim nation.
	   As such they have been blamed by some for the rising prices and
mass unemployment that have come with Asia's financial meltdown.
	   Muladi said hundreds of Chinese people had complained that
identity documents such as passports and citizenship papers were
burned or destroyed in the riots, in which 1,188 people are known
to have died.
	   Muladi said the documents would be replaced. He warned
bureaucrats not to take advantage of the situation by trying to
extort bribes from people needing new documents.
	   Over the weekend, President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto,
called on Indonesians to end discrimination against the Chinese
minority.
	   Although many Chinese families have lived in Indonesia for
generations, some indigenous people, referred to as ``pribumi'' or
``sons of the soil,'' still regard them as outsiders.

Vietnam launches military knowledge course for top civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has launched a military classroom
course for senior civilian officials to ensure they can respond to
a crisis quickly, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The communist party newspaper Nhan Dan said that 48 senior
provincial party and government officials took part in the first
course starting Monday at the Military Academy.
	   The participants will learn Vietnamese military history, the
party's position on military and security affairs, the building of
the armed forces, provincial defense systems and a combination of
military and economic tasks.
	   Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu said officials should have
knowledge not only about social and economic affairs, but also
military and security issues.
	   Phieu said maintaining political stability is essential for
Vietnam and the country is ready to spoil any attempt to violate
its sovereignty or sabotage the communist regime.

Three die in Taiwan floods

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ While much of Asia withers under a
devastating drought, torrential rains in Taiwan have lead to the
deaths of three people.
	   Up to 353 millimeters (14.12 inches) of rain have fallen in
parts of the island over the past two days, overfilling rivers and
reservoirs, the Central Weather Bureau reported. In the island's
mountainous center, rain washed rocks and mud down creeks, knocking
out at least one bridge.
	   In Pingtung county at Taiwan's southern tip, two men drowned
Monday when flood waters swept their pickup truck off the road and
into a drainage ditch. Another man also was killed Monday in
Kaohsiung county when his car aquaplaned into a road divider.
	   Damage to crops has been estimated at 640 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 18 million), with Yunlin county, 175 kilometers (108
miles) south of Taipei, the hardest hit. Agriculture authorities
have offered farmers subsidies of 6,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
242) per hectare (acre) for emergency replanting.
	   The rains preceding the summer typhoon season have been the
hardest in recent years, catching officials and flood control
systems off guard. The sogginess contrasts strongly with parched
conditions in Southeast Asia brought on by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
	   Dozens of villages were stranded Tuesday by flood waters that
were two stories high. Supplies were brought in by boat and
helicopter.
	   Waters also inundated the construction site for the island's
second major high technology industrial park in Tainan county.
	   Forecasters said they expect the weather to dry up gradually
over the week.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A bronze mural of Philippine hero
Andres Bonifacio being erected in Manila's filthy Divisoria market
provides the only hint that the area is actually a hallowed
historic site.
	   Squalid shops stand today where Bonifacio and other nationalists
founded in 1892 the Katipunan, a secret society that led a revolt
to liberate the Philippines from 333 years of Spanish colonial
rule.
	   In place of the house where the Katipunan was born stands a
building owned by a Chinese merchant. Officials built a wall with
the mural in front of the building to memorialize the site, drawing
the owner's ire.
	   Decades of neglect have ruined many such historical landmarks,
compounding the woes of officials preparing for the country's June
12 centennial of its declaration of independence from Spain.
	   ``It's a disgrace,'' National Centennial Commission chairman
Salvador Laurel said of the destruction of many historical sites.
	   Other shrines or markers have been buried under garbage,
destroyed by vandals, thieves or termites, or encircled by
shantytowns. Historic buildings were turned into malls, warehouses,
even a noodle house.
	   The government, helped by private companies, is spending 3.5
billion pesos (dlrs 92 million) on celebrations that will include a
trade and historical exposition at the Clark Special Economic Zone,
a former U.S. air base in Pampanga province.
	   One-third of the money is being used to renovate 16 historic
shrines and construct historical markers and monuments along the
``freedom trail,'' areas where Filipinos put up resistance against
Spain.
	   President Fidel Ramos, who helped revive the nation's economy
after years of stagnancy, calls the centennial the ``main event''
of his six years in power.
	   Dignitaries from 24 countries have been invited, and Filipinos
working abroad are being urged to head home for the party, which
includes a beauty pageant, a native sports festival, musicals and
plays, a grand parade, and a centennial ball.
	   But many doubt whether multitudes will attend.
	   For one, the government has failed to aggressively promote the
fiesta abroad, said Arnaldo Bayag of the Philippine Travel Agencies
Association, a group of more than 400 tour companies. Asia's
financial crisis will also have a negative effect.
	   While Laurel hoped the centennial would unify traditionally
fractious Filipinos, squabbles have threatened to pull officials
further apart.
	   A major contractor had a widely publicized spat with Laurel that
ended with its withdrawal from the project at the former air base,
delaying construction of a 148-acre (60-hectare) historical theme
park by at least four months.
	   A major event _ a grand parade along a seaside boulevard in
Manila _ has triggered the resignations of some centennial
commission officials because Laurel chose to focus on events in
1898 and downplay subsequent history, officials said.
	   The U.S. and Japanese occupations of the Philippines and the
1986 ``people power'' revolt that ousted strongman Ferdinand Marcos
will receive little prominence. The number of floats was cut to
about 40 from more than 100, shutting out many groups, an official
said.
	   Laurel said a very long parade would bore people and be
prohibitively expensive.
	   Even the date is the subject of dispute, with some saying 1898
should not be celebrated as the country's centennial.
	   Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, a former mayor who became the republic's
first president, declared Philippine independence from Spain on
June 12, 1898, at a house in Cavite province, south of Manila.
	   Before the Philippines could gain independence, however, the
United States acquired it after defeating Spain in the 1898
Spanish-American War. It brutally suppressed the independence
movement.
	   At least the celebration may arouse the interest of many
Filipinos with low historical awareness, said Samuel Tan, chairman
of the National Historical Institute. There will be a new national
archive, a new museum, spruced up shrines and about 100 new
monuments, many depicting lesser-known heroes.
	   The celebration also has revived such historical debates as the
proper shade of blue in the national flag and provided a chance to
correct errors in history books written from a foreign perspective,
he said.

30 people injured when police and protesters clash in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 30 people were injured when
police and strikers clashed during a street march in the second
city of Surabaya, police said Tuesday.
	   Violence erupted when a line of riot police halted a
10-kilometer (six-mile) long march by striking factory workers
Monday, setting off a spate of stone-throwing in Indonesia's
biggest protest since the new president eased restrictions on
labor.
	   At least five police and three protesters were hospitalized as a
result of violence during the march in Surabaya, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Police estimated Monday's crowd at 10,000. However, the Jakarta
Post newspaper said about 25,000 took part.
	   Feeling the effects of Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30
years, the workers went on strike a week ago to demand higher
salaries.
	   The economic crisis triggered student protests and deadly riots
last month, forcing the autocratic President Suharto to resign last
month after 32 years in power.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, relaxed Indonesia's tight
restrictions on labor unions last week and signed an International
Labor Organization accord on respect for workers' rights.
	   He has also promised elections and freed some political
prisoners jailed by Suharto's regime.
	   Meanwhile, all 46 members of the provincial legislature of the
tourist island of Bali have promised to resign after thousands of
protesters accused them of corruption and collusion.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Floods caused by heavy rains have killed at
least 16 people in northwestern Iran over the past month, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   The floods, which hit some 10 towns in the East Azerbaijan
province, also damaged homes and farmlands, the agency said late
Monday. It gave no other details.
	   In April, 81 people were killed by floods in the southwestern

Japan's Hitachi to shift DRAM production to Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Hitachi is shifting
much of its production of dynamic random access memory chips, or
DRAM, from its plants in Germany and Japan to Singapore, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   A Hitachi spokesman in Tokyo said that ultimately more than half
of the company's output of 64-megabit DRAM chips could come from
Singapore, according to The Business Times.
	   No timetable for the completed shift was given.
	   Hitachi is one of the world's largest producers of DRAM chips, a
key component in personal computers and a bellwether for the global
electronics industry.
	   The Singapore plant, Hitachi Nippon Steel Semiconductor
Singapore, currently accounts for about 10 percent of total DRAM
chip production.
	   Hitachi said the plan is to consolidate its DRAM output from
various German, Japanese, and Singapore fabrication plants to two
bases.
	   Hitachi's Naka plant in Japan will produce mostly
future-generation 256-megabit DRAM chips, while the Singapore plant
will concentrate on the more commonly-used 64-megabit DRAMs, the
spokesman told the newspaper.
	   The move comes as the price of DRAMs continues to drop.
	   Samsung Electronics Co., the world's biggest computer memory
chip maker, said Monday it will temporarily stop production next
week because of plunging prices.

Dollar touches new 7-year high, Tokyo stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon currency and bond
prices; ADDS trader comment in 6th graf

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar touched a new seven-year high
against the yen Tuesday in Tokyo before receding ahead of a key
meeting of the G-7 major industrialized nations. Tokyo stocks
finished sharply higher.
	   The dollar bought 140.79 yen at mid-afternoon, up 0.23 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and above its New York level overnight of
140.71 yen. During Tokyo trading, the dollar rose as high as 141.11
yen, a level not seen since June 1991.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 235.46 points, or 1.52 percent, to close at 15,530.17. On
Monday, the average shed 28.72 points, or 0.19 percent.
	   The dollar slipped back below the 141-yen level amid speculation
deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven largest economies
meeting later Tuesday in Paris may announce a joint effort to prop
up the Japanese currency.
	   A growing number of officials from the G-7 have expressed
concern over the declining yen. On Monday, German central bank
chief Hans Tietmeyer said he hopes ``the yen won't depreciate
excessively.''
	   ``Judging from Tietmeyer's remark, we can't completely rule out
the possibility of a surprise announcement from the G-7 that
expresses, for instance, concerted efforts to defend the yen,''
said Ryuichi Takami, a senior currency trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the main cause of the yen's recent weakness _ Japan's
ailing domestic economy _ remains unchanged. On Tuesday, a Japanese
government report warned that key sectors of the economy such as
employment and production would likely worsen in June.
	   And with no economic turnaround in sight, Japan's central bank
has been forced to take steps that have the effect of undermining
the yen even further.
	   To reinflate the economy, the Bank of Japan has kept interest
rates at a historic low. But that's forced investors to sell yen to
shift funds overseas in search of better returns.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stock prices rose amid optimism the
strengthening dollar will boost profits at the country's vaunted
exporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.32 points, or 0.86 percent, to 1,208.68.
The TOPIX closed down 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, the day before.
	   For every yen the dollar gains in value, Toyota Motor Corp. sees
its revenues jump 10 billion yen (dlrs 71 million) and Sony Corp.
earns an additional 6 billion yen (dlrs 43 million), Japan's NHK
television said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.200 percent from Monday's close of 1.145
percent, driving its price down to 112.04 yen from Monday's 112.46
yen.

Dozens feared dead in movie theater fire in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dozens of people are feared dead after
fire swept through a crowded movie theater and shopping center in
Palembang on the island of Sumatra, police said Tuesday.
	   Fire broke out in the Megahira shopping center, which contained
the cinema, on Monday night while hundreds were inside watching a
film. Dozens more were lined up to buy movie tickets and others
were in an adjacent amusement center.
	   Police said the exact number of victims was unknown. The fire
was still smoldering Tuesday morning, hampering the rescue efforts.
	   Only two bodies had been recovered so far, police said.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Sardjo Sadjat said 19 people were
injured, 14 of them hospitalized.
	   ``Dozens are believed trapped there, but we have not known what
exactly happened, because no one is able to enter the building so
far,'' he said.
	   The cause of fire, reported to have started on the second floor,
was still not known, Sadjat said.
	   He said the cinema was made up of three theaters, each with a
capacity of about 40.
	   ``I think no one can survive,'' said Djaieni, a fire department
official.
	   The newspaper Republika said most of those who died had been on
the top three floors of the five-story shopping center.
	   It said only nine people were known to have escaped the flames.
They reached safety by climbing down ropes of a window washing
platform on the outside of the building.
	   Three of the nine fell to the ground and were hospitalized with
serious injuries.
	   The newspaper said those who escaped claimed ``many people'' had
been trapped inside after panic broke out.
	   ``On the stairs we trampled over each other to get out,''
Republika quoted one survivor, identified by the single name of
Zukar, as saying.
	   The fire follows several shopping mall blazes that killed
hundreds of people during riots in the capital Jakarta last month.
	   Police say the Jakarta fires had been deliberately lit and most
of the dead had been looters.

Myanmar police seize 1 million amphetamine pills, arrest three
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Police have arrested three people and
seized more than 1 million amphetamine tablets that were apparently
being smuggled to Thailand, official newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Amphetamine production has soared in recent years in the
notorious Golden Triangle region where the borders of Myanmar, Laos
and Thailand converge. The area has long been one of the world's
principal sources of opium and its derivative, heroin.
	   Police reportedly stopped a car carrying the tablets in secret
compartments at a checkpoint near the northeastern town of
Kengtung. The car was heading for Tachilek, on the Thai border.
	   The three men in the car were being detained pending trial, the
newspapers said. Drug trafficking carries the death penalty.

Immigrants avoiding beefed-up patrols to cross Mexican border

<TEXT>
	   CALEXICO, California (AP) _ When federal agents beefed up
patrols near San Diego, they figured fewer illegal immigrants would
cross through the wind-swept mountains or the sweltering desert to
the east.
	   But it hasn't worked out that way.
	   Undocumented immigrants are now crossing from Mexico into
southeast California's sprawling desert and irrigated farmland _
and they're doing it in record numbers, sometimes fatally.
	   Many immigrants climb over a flimsy chain-link fence and dash
through vast fields where everything from watermelon to carrots is
grown.
	   Sometimes groups of five or six young men dive face-first into
thigh-high wheat plants to try to hide from the U.S. Border Patrol.
Others end up in the swift All-American Canal, where more than a
dozen illegal border crossers have died this year.
	   When Operation Gatekeeper was introduced nearly four years ago,
San Diego had long been the preferred crossing spot of the
2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) U.S.-Mexico border. The policy has
increased the number of Border Patrol agents around San Diego to
2,300 from 800 in October 1994.
	   The effect could be seen on a recent night in Calexico, a town
of about 25,000 across the border from the Baja California state
capital of Mexicali. Border Patrol agents detained a record 522
people during one eight-hour shift.
	   ``We're apprehending in two days as much as we were apprehending
in a month two or three years ago,'' said Tom Wacker, chief patrol
agent of the El Centro sector, which encompasses the irrigated
Imperial Valley and surrounding desert.
	   In response, 87 Border Patrol agents have been added to the
region since October to boost its ranks to 299, and 25 more agents
are expected to arrive in July. Another 140 agents from other
sectors were sent to temporarily work the 72-mile (115-kilometer)
line that separates Imperial County from Mexico.
	   El Centro agents detained more than 115,000 illegal immigrants
in the first six months of fiscal year 1998. That makes it the
second-busiest crossing point in the country, behind Tucson,
Arizona. They predict 240,000 arrests for the year, compared with
146,000 last year.
	   For its part, San Diego has seen a 17-year low of about 284,000
detentions last fiscal year. That compares with about 531,000
arrests in 1993, before Operation Gatekeeper started. San Diego
dropped from 43 percent of apprehensions nationwide to 20 percent.
	   As the illegal immigrants move east, the government's resources
are heading in that direction, too. Imperial County agents are
getting more high-tech equipment, including five infrared night
scopes to add to the five they already have.
	   On a recent night, agent Matt Shultz sat in his truck and used a
joystick to manipulate a night scope mounted on the truck's roof.
All the while, he kept his eyes glued on a TV monitor in the front
seat. Seeing movement on the screen, he described the migrants'
location to fellow agent Tony McAuliffe.
	   McAuliffe, flashlight in hand, walked briskly through knee-high
alfalfa looking for the group. He aimed his flashlight in all
directions and eventually found the men lying down in the field.
With hardly a word uttered, they got up, brushed themselves off and
climbed into a Border Patrol van.
	   The scene is repeated over and over. But it's not always so
peaceful.
	   The All-American Canal runs for about 35 miles (55 kilometers)
along the border from Yuma, Arizona, to west of Calexico. In
Calexico, there are bridges on which to cross. On the outskirts,
the only options are crossing small, electricity-producing dams,
protected by fences, or getting in the water.
	   Twenty-one illegal crossers have drowned so far this year, most
of them in the All-American Canal. A few died in the heavily
polluted New River.
	   Twenty-two more died this year in San Diego County, most of them
from exposure in the cold mountains east of the city. And summer,
which means 120-degree Fahrenheit (49-degree Celsius) afternoons in
the desert, has yet to come.
	   Immigrant rights activists have denounced Gatekeeper as immoral
because it puts migrants in harm's way.
	   ``What it has done more than anything is to move the migrant
stream out of the public eye and into the mountains and the
deserts,'' says Claudia Smith, head of California Legal Rural
Assistance. ``Yes, it has deterred some, but by and large, it has
just provoked migrants to take bigger and bigger risks to get
across undetected.''

Pizza delivery killer sentenced to mental institution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A pizza delivery man, who stabbed a
customer to death under the belief he was controlled by aliens, was
sentenced Tuesday to an indefinite stay in a mental hospital.
	   Robuen Barrioquito Diaz, 21, of Punchbowl, a Sydney suburb, had
pleaded innocent to murdering Edwina Leonora Powell, 20, on
September 17, 1996, and maliciously wounding her neighbor, Kenneth
Alan Breward.
	   New South Wales state Supreme Court judge Graham Barr found Diaz
innocent on the grounds that he did not know that what he was doing
was wrong.
	   ``This is a truly tragic case in which a gentle young man
without any criminal tendencies, affected by an illness over which
he had no control, attacked three innocent people and killed one of
them,'' Barr said.
	   Barr, who heard the trial without a jury, said three
psychiatrists who examined Diaz found that he suffered a psychotic
illness that began in about mid-1996.
	   During the trial the court heard that Diaz had told a nurse a
television set talked to him and told him a device had been planted
in his head so he could be controlled by alien forces.
	   Diaz told his mother he had been abducted by aliens, an
occurrence he said he discovered when his watch lost an hour, and
that aliens told him to write on a wall.
	   The judge said Diaz had written in blood on the wall of Powell's
unit after killing her.
	   The judge said that at various times before the killing, Diaz
had intended to jump off cliffs to his death, had been stopped from
throwing himself under a train and had been interrupted when trying
to hang himself.
	   Barr said Diaz will remain in a mental hospital indefinitely.
The state Mental Health Review Tribunal would review Diaz's case
regularly and make recommendations to the government about his
progress and possible future release.

Investors suffer as Hong Kong's property market turns sour

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Young, ambitious and well-paid, Elizabeth Chung
was set to become another shining success story in this haven of
unbridled capitalism. But real estate _ traditionally Hong Kong's
king of investments _ has messed up her life.
	   Chung was only following conventional, middle-class wisdom here
when she invested heavily in property last year. However, her
timing was terrible. The 28-year-old is now saddled with mountains
of debt on apartments whose value is plummeting. The bills eat up
nine-tenths of her income.
	   Asia's economic crisis combined with a government drive to
increase the housing supply has turned the market for property _
which accounts for one in ten jobs and roughly a third of Hong
Kong's economy _ upside down. As the property market sinks, so does
the entire economy.
	   Some purchasers face losing their down payments _ in some cases,
their life savings _ because they cannot get mortgages. Chung sees
no way out for herself. She and her fiance Gary Cheng even have
postponed a fairy-tale wedding.
	   ``Worse comes to worst, I'll file for bankruptcy,'' Chung said.
``I'm glad we didn't get married, because I don't want to drag
(Gary) into this sorry mess.''
	   In many ways, it's hard to feel sorry for Chung, who makes
100,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12,820) a month as a business
manager. Even in this prosperous, and costly, society, that's a
lot.
	   Buildable land is at a premium in small, mountainous Hong Kong.
For decades, the government has released it slowly, keeping demand
high and prices rising.
	   Many middle-class people saw property as such a solid investment
that they were willing to skimp on other expenses to take on large
mortgages. Others jumped in when optimism over the handover to
Chinese rule last July 1 sent prices soaring.
	   Chung scaped together 2.17 million Hong Kong dollars (dlrs
280,000) for down payments on four apartments. Three in Hong Kong
were valued at 10 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.29
million), one in the neighboring Portuguese territory Macau
somewhat less. She emptied her savings; borrowed from her mother,
brother and fiance. Besides the mortgages, she borrowed part of the
down payments, too.
	   She figured she and Gary would live in one apartment. As
property value and rents increased, the others would provide a
stable income.
	   Other buyers, including a group that protested recently in Hong
Kong, face losing their down payments. Because property values have
dropped so much, cautious banks won't lend enough money to cover
the balance of the purchase price.
	   ``I always thought you can't go wrong with property,'' Chung
said. ``The Chinese have always bought houses and fields with their
spare money.''
	   But not everyone in Hong Kong is prosperous, and the government
is also one of the world's largest public housing landlords.
	   In a bid for popular support, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
promised to provide 85,000 new apartments every year for 10 years.
He also started selling public housing apartments for about a tenth
of their value to turn tenants into homeowners.
	   Such policies alone could have taken some steam out of the
housing market. But no one counted on Asia's financial crisis.
Although Hong Kong rode it out initially, the economy shrank by 2
percent in the first three months of the year, and even Tung's
housing construction plans look increasingly fragile.
	   Unemployment is at a 14-year high. The stock market has fallen
dramatically. Interest rates are high to protect the currency.
Property prices have fallen about 40 percent and major developers
have slashed prices to stimulate demand. Meanwhile, rental prices
are dropping and potential buyers are biding their time.
	   ``Why buy when rents are getting cheaper and cheaper?'' asked
economist Ho Lok Sang.
	   ``The market's dead,'' said Wilson Cheung, owner of a small real
estate agency in the upscale Midlevels area. ``No one's buying, and
we only get an occasional customer who wants to rent.''
	   Tung said recently that property prices are now about the right
level. That is more bad news for Chung, whose apartments lost 35
percent of their value.
	   Her tenants are threatening to move out if she doesn't slash the
rent. Besides the mortgages, she still owes about 400,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 51,000) just on the down payments.
	   Almost every dollar she makes goes to the banks, and the only
thing she can do is plod along the same dismal course.
	   ``I was just too ambitious,'' she said. ``Too inexperienced.''

South Korean officials to contact northern counterpart for 2002

World Cup

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean soccer officials said
Tuesday they have obtained government approval to discuss sharing
some matches of the 2002 World Cup finals with rival North Korea.
	   South Korea and Japan will co-host the games, but South Korea
hopes to share some of its 32 matches with North Korea to promote
peace on the peninsula.
	   Officials at the Korea Football Association said they will send
a letter to North Korea soon to arrange a meeting on the
match-sharing idea or even forming a unified Korean team for the
competition.
	   They also said the contact, if held, could take up the issue of
promoting regular sports exchanges between the two sides.
	   South Korean soccer officials needed government approval for the
move. The two Koreas are technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   A high-ranking North Korean soccer official in Paris said in a
published interview Tuesday that the communist country could
consider sharing World Cup matches if such a proposal is made.
	   ``We are not in a stage to discuss details yet, but in
principle, it is very desirable to form a single team and for North
Korea to hold some games,'' Choi Pyong Joo, vice president of North
Korea's soccer association said in an interview with South Korea's
Sports Seoul newspaper.
	   Choi was in Paris attending various functions of FIFA, soccer's
world governing body, ahead of the 1998 World Cup finals.
	   In the early 1990s, the two Koreas formed single soccer and
table tennis teams for international tournaments.

Hamas: Sheik Yassin to return within days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder and
spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, will return to
Gaza within days, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas spokesman, told The Associated Press that
Yassin _ who has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim countries
raising millions of dollars and drumming up support for Hamas _
will ``most likely'' come back to Gaza on Saturday.
	   Israel's security establishment and political leaders have been
debating for weeks whether the sheik would pose a greater danger
from outside or inside Gaza. Israel, which controls Gaza's borders,
could keep Yassin out if it wished.
	   But by Tuesday, Israeli leaders appeared to be leaning toward
allowing him back into Gaza, in part because keeping him out could
set off an explosion of violence by backers of Hamas.
	   ``The choice is not between what is good and better, but between
what is bad and worse,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel, and its military wing has
killed more than 100 Israelis in scores of attacks in recent years.
	   The group's popularity in the Palestinian lands, especially
Gaza, is seen as a growing threat to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin's fiery comments on his tour, such as his description of
suicide attacks as ``holy missions,'' have been widely reported in
Israel.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall to buy the
freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt on another Hamas leader.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu's inner security Cabinet debated the Yassin
question, but did not reach any decision. Politicians and security
figures have been airing sharply conflicting views, though.
	   Carmi Gillon, former head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency,
strongly urged that Yassin be kept out of Gaza. He told Israel TV
on Monday that Yassin ``is a threat to Israel, a threat to peace
and a threat to our only Palestinian partner,'' Arafat.
	   However, Israeli President Ezer Weizman said Monday he would
support Yassin's return because it would enable both Israel and the
Palestinian Authority to keep an eye on him. ``It's better for him
to sit in Gaza close to us,'' Weizman said.
	   Israeli lawmaker Haggai Merom suggested Yassin be allowed to
return to Gaza _ but should be kept there once he does.
	   ``We should have been left him in jail because he was quiet
then,'' Merom said on Israel television. ``Now he is running
abroad, raising millions of dollars for Hamas and appearing as a
legitimate alternative to Yasser Arafat.''

Report: Head of government statistics agency arrested for rigging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the government's statistics service
was arrested Tuesday on charges of helping tax-dodgers and selling
confidential data, according to news reports.
	   Yuri Yurkov, head of the State Statistics Committee, was
arrested along with an unspecified number of senior workers in
charge of data processing, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies
reported.
	   They were charged with ``systematic distortion of statistical
data on big companies which allowed them to evade taxes,'' the
reports quoted government officials as saying.
	   Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia with many big companies
and businessmen not paying. Government efforts to boost the economy
have been hobbled by a lack of revenues because of tax evasion.
	   Spokesmen for the government headquarters, Prosecutor General's
office and the Federal Security Service declined to comment on the
reports.
	   The reports said Yurkov and his alleged accomplices were accused
of manipulating economic data to hide the real output of companies
and reduce their tax liability and with selling classified
information about rival companies' performance.
	   Yurkov, who has served as the statistics agency chief since
1993, would be one of the highest-ranking Russian officials
arrested for alleged wrongdoing in recent years.

Rebels claim to have repulsed attack, at least 56 dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Guerrillas fighting for an ethnic
homeland in Sri Lanka said they fought off a government attack in
the north, and at least 56 fighters from both sides were killed
Tuesday in the seven-hour battle.
	   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, in a statement faxed to
news agencies in the Indian capital from their London headquarters,
said government forces retreated, leaving behind the bodies of 30
of their soldiers, after encountering heavy rebel resistance at
Kilinochchi, 275 kilometers (170 miles) north of the Sri Lankan
capital of Colombo.
	   The Tigers said they lost 26 fighters.
	   Kilinochchi was also the scene of heavy fighting last Thursday,
with government forces attacking it and nearby Mankulam in a
two-pronged effort to capture the region's main highway from
guerrilla control.
	   In Sri Lanka, the defense ministry said Tuesday that government
troops destroyed a rebel fortification near Mankulam and advanced
north. The ministry statement made no mention of casualties.
	   The government has been battling since May 1997 to capture the
highway connecting the Jaffna Peninsula with the rest of Sri Lanka.
The army captured the 1,000-square-kilometer (400-square-mile)
peninsula in 1996 from the Tamil rebels, who had run the area like
a mini-state for five years.
	   Because the government does not control the highway, Jaffna's
half million people rely on air and sea deliveries of food and
other supplies.
	   So far, the troops have captured about two-thirds of the
highway, with another 27 kilometers (17 miles) to go. The military
admits having lost nearly 1,000 soldiers and claims to have killed
3,200 guerrillas in the highway campaign. The rebels have not given
their total casualty figures.
	   No independent assessment of the battle situation was possible
as the government bars journalists from visiting the war theater on
their own. The government also has imposed censorship on reports
about the fighting emanating from Sri Lanka.
	   The rebels want a separate homeland carved from this island off
India's southeastern tip, accusing the Sinhalese majority of
oppressing the Tamil minority. The war began in 1983 and has so far
claimed 52,000 lives.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With poetry, pipes and the haunting strains of
``Let it Be,'' former Beatle Paul McCartney has paid homage to his
wife Linda, who died from breast cancer in April at the age of 56.
	   ``After she died I was thinking of her and I thought of her like
a diamond,'' an emotional McCartney told mourners on Monday. ``A
big orange diamond. And if you look at all the facets of the
diamond, as with every facet you looked at, she was greater.''
	   He told the 700 guests at a private memorial service in the
historic church of St. Martins-in-the-Fields that he still cannot
believe his wife of nearly 30 years is dead. ``But I have to
because it's true.''
	   Mourners sang ``Let it Be'' in tribute to the many talents of
the former Linda Eastman of Scarsdale, New York: photographer,
vegetarian, animal rights campaigner, musician, wife and mother.
	   McCartney penned the hit as a tribute to his mother, who also
died of breast cancer when he was 14.
	   ``It was amazing, it was a beautiful hymn,'' comedian Tracey
Ullman said after the service. Celebrity guests included the other
surviving Beatles, Ringo Starr and George Harrison, as well as
Sting, Elton John and film producer David Puttnam.
	   In adjoining Trafalgar Square, animal rights activists set up a
giant pair of angel's wings for condolence messages and hung
banners proclaiming ``Linda: The Animals' Angel'' in several
languages.
	   Vegetarian children laid flowers beside a large photograph of
Mrs. McCartney cuddling a tiny chick.
	   Hundreds of people waited for up to seven hours in the rain and
wind to pay tribute to Mrs. McCartney and a cheer rose when
McCartney, 55, arrived at the church with Heather, 36, his wife's
daughter by her first marriage, and the couple's three children _
Mary, 27, Stella, 26, and James, 21.
	   He winked and flashed the peace sign before going inside the
18th century church, which was illuminated with candles and swathed
in white roses and lilies of the valley, Mrs. McCartney's favorite
flowers.
	   The Brodsky Quartet played eight songs McCartney wrote for his
wife, including ``The Lovely Linda'' and ``Calico Skies'' and a
single piper played ``Mull of Kintyre,'' a hit for McCartney's band
Wings.
	   Actress Joanna Lumley and photographer David Bailey read poems
and ``The Who'' guitarist Pete Townshend and writer Carla Lane gave
tributes.
	   In his own eulogy, McCartney recalled his wife as a great lover.
``We had a lot of fun making those babies,'' he said.
	   McCartney revealed that when he went to pick up his knighthood
from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace last year, Linda was
too ill to attend. But that morning, she presented him with a
silver watch inscribed, ``To Paul, my knight in shining armor.''
	   ``Through our kids, our beautiful kids, her spirit lives on,''
he said.
	   The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals brought in supporters from many countries, including the
United States, Germany, France and Italy.
	   ``Instead of demonstrating, as we usually do, this is a chance
for us to get together to celebrate someone who was kind to
animals,'' said Dan Mathews, the group's campaign director in the
United States.
	   Activists distributed leaflets condemning animal experiments and
the export from Britain of live animals. ``Viva St. Linda'' read
the legend on one poster. A woman carried a sheep's mask attached
to a poster with the words, ``Love, Compassion. Linda McCartney
1942-1998.''
	   The McCartneys announced in December 1995 that Mrs. McCartney
had breast cancer. In March, the cancer was found to have spread to
her liver and she died at the family's ranch in Arizona on April
19. Her ashes were scattered on the family farm in Sussex county
south of London.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis
began a 400-kilometer (250-mile) protest Tuesday on foot and by car
to underscore their opposition to a peace accord they say gives
away too much to southeastern hill tribes.
	   The ``long march'' protest is seen as a test of strength for
former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's strength. Zia has campaigned
against the government of Sheikh Hasina since she lost power in
elections two years ago. In recent years, Bangladesh has been
plagued by almost daily strikes and political protests that often
erupt into violence.
	   Fearing unrest, drivers kept buses, trucks and private cars off
the roads in the capital of Dhaka and the southern city of
Chittagong. Across the country, some 50,000 police and paramilitary
troops have been put on alert, The Nation daily reported.
	   Hasina struck a peace accord in December 1997 giving autonomy to
tribes in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and ending two decades of
guerrilla war by Chakma separatists. The fighting over an area rich
in timber and minerals left more than 20,000 people dead.
	   Hasina has ``left the Chittagong Hill Tracts to the
terrorists,'' Zia said at a kickoff rally for the march in a Dhaka
sports stadium.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Zia's supporters chanted
anti-government slogans as they set off, with Zia accusing the
government of trying to block the march.
	   The government tried to disrupt the march by urging gas stations
to close, opposition activists said. Police detained at least 100
opposition activists under local laws that give authorities the
right to hold people without charge.
	   Police searched buses, trains and river boat ferries and pulled
out people they believed were planning to join the march, the
opposition said.
	   Although Hasina has promised to let the protesters reach their
destination, her supporters set up road blocks along its route,
witnesses said. It was unclear if they were acting on their own.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Twenty-three Chinese dissidents sent an open
letter Tuesday to presidents Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton urging
them to make human rights an important topic at the upcoming
China-U.S. summit.
	   The democracy activists wrote that China's ruling Communist
Party has disregarded the meaning of human rights and rudely
treated appeals for better rights protection since coming to power
in 1949.
	   Observance of human rights has deteriorated further since March,
the letter said, citing cases of dissidents around the country who
recently have been detained or sent to labor camps without trial.
	   The two presidents, who will meet in Beijing in late June,
should discuss how China can enforce the protection of basic rights
called for in two U.N. treaties, the letter said.
	   China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, but has not yet ratified it. It has announced it
plans to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
	   ``Only when the rights of all people are respected and the
dignity of all people is protected can a country have booming
development and the whole world have peace and prosperity,'' the
letter said.
	   The activists also asked the presidents to discuss efforts by Xu
Wenli and Qin Yongmin to establish a human rights monitoring group
in China. Authorities have confiscated office equipment and have
refused to allow the group to register as a legal entity, the
letter said.
	   It added that police are preventing Xu from leaving his home.
	   Xu and Qin, longtime activists, were among the 23 who signed the
letter.

Saint-Laurent turns over women's ready to wear to U.S. designer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fashion giant Yves Saint Laurent has named American
designer Alber Elbaz, 38, to be the artistic director of his
women's ready to wear collection.
	   Elbaz will present his first ready-to-wear clothes for Yves
Saint Laurent during the 1999 fall collections, said a communique
issued Monday.
	   It was the first time Saint Laurent has named an artistic
director for one of his lines. The legendary French designer will
continue to create his haute couture clothes.
	   Many of the top fashion lines in Paris are now being designed by
foreigners, and Elbaz's nomination could put him in line to take
over should Saint Laurent, 62, step down some day.
	   In 1996, Elbaz, took over as the new creator for luxury
ready-to-wear for Guy Laroche. Until then, he had designed for
Geoffrey Beene for seven years.
	   His first collection in 1997 for Guy Laroche was a hit.
	   Born in Morocco, Elbaz is a graduate of Israel's prestigious
Shenkar College School of Fashion in Tel Aviv.

Indonesia asks other governments to drop tourist travel warnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia asked other governments
Tuesday to drop official warnings against tourists visiting
Indonesia in the wake of riots last month.
	   ``There is no reason to restrict tourists from visiting
Indonesia now. There is nothing to worry about,'' said Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas.
	   Alatas said neighboring Australia, a major source of foreign
tourists, had revoked an earlier tourist warning.
	   However, other countries, such as the United States and Japan,
were maintaining their warnings.
	   On June 4, the U.S. Department of State issued an advisory
warning U.S. citizens against non-essential travel to Indonesia.
	   Recently the Indonesian government said foreign tourist arrivals
had dropped dramatically following the riots, in which 1,188 people
were killed and thousands of buildings were burned or ransacked.
	   Violence erupted after four students were shot dead by security
forces at an anti-government rally at Jakarta's Trisakti University
on May 12.
	   It stopped after ex-president Suharto resigned on May 21, ending
a 32-year authoritarian grip on power.
	   Indonesia is battling its worst economic crisis in decades and
some fear violence could return unless rampant inflation and
soaring unemployment are controlled.

Police scold two newspapers for publishing obscene material
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Accusing Japan's ribald tabloids of going too far,
police have issued warnings to two newspapers for publishing
pornographic color photos, police said Tuesday.
	   The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said it has questioned
the tabloid Nikkan Gendai and sports daily Tokyo Sports separately
on suspicion of illegally selling obscene material.
	   The police said, however, that the papers would not be charged
with any crime this time since the publishers pledged _ in writing
_ not to release such photographs again.
	   The warnings, made separately in recent months, were the first
in decades in which police took exception to material published in
Japan's often risque daily tabloids, said a police official in
charge of public safety.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two
photos _ which displayed genitals _ went beyond the socially
accepted limits of nudity. He refused to describe on what criteria
the judgment was made.
	   Though a ban on photographs of pubic hair is widely flaunted,
publications for the most part refrain from clearly showing
genitals. Police periodically crack down on pornographers who break
the law too brazenly.
	   On March 9, Tokyo Sports published a photo downloaded from the
Internet showing female genitalia that _ according to police _ was
insufficiently blurred out.
	   On May 9, Nikkan Gendai printed a color photo of a couple having
sexual intercourse, with their genitals only slightly blurred.
	   In both cases, police warnings shortly after the photos
appeared.
	   The two newspapers, which often feature color centerfolds, sexy
stories and pornography ads, submitted a statement pledging that
they would not publish similar photographs again.
	   ``But we will not stop publishing sex-related materials,'' said
Yasuo Sakurai, chief editor of Tokyo Sports. ``Sex is a universal
interest of human beings, and we believe many readers like to read
what we publish.''
	   Nikkan Gendai's chief editor Shuji Uragami was quoted by the
major newspaper Asahi as saying that pornography is only part of
general news it covers ``to meet readers' demand.''
	   There are growing calls from women's and human rights' groups
for tighter restrictions on widespread pornography as a way of
curbing sexism and protecting children from the sex business.
	   ``Such materials treat women as a sex toy,'' said Kazue
Takahashi, director of New Japan Women's Association. ``They
violate human rights of women.''
	   Still, pornography is widely accepted in Japan. Men have no
qualms about purusing centerfolds and obscene comics while riding
subways. Every video shop is well-stocked with porn tapes, which
are openly displayed.

Russia, Japan to hold naval exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Japan will hold naval exercises for the
first time in the Pacific Ocean next month as part of efforts to
improve relations between the two forces, the Interfax news agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Two Russian warships and two helicopters will take part in
exercises with two Japanese destroyers, a training ship and five
aircraft, the report said. The exercise, to be held 400 kms (250
miles) east of the Russian port of Vladivostok, will simulate
searching for a ship in distress.
	   Five decades after World War II, the two nations have yet to
sign a treaty, mainly because of a territorial dispute over four
tiny islands in the southern Kuril chain that Soviet troops seized
from Japan in the closing days of the war.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a rare show of unity, nearly 30
volunteer and consumer organizations, opposition parties and the
country's largest trade union on Tuesday demanded more civil
liberties and free speech.
	   Protesting the cancellations of public meetings in recent weeks,
the groups accused Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's government of
violating basic human rights.
	   ``People must be free to express, discuss, engage in dialogue
and release their frustrations and tensions,'' said a one-page
declaration by the group.
	   Last week, the police banned a consumer rights group from
organizing a meeting to discuss the severe water rationing in the
capital, where nearly 2 million people have suffered dry faucets
for three months.
	   The previous Sunday, more than 50 police officers in riot gear
broke up a gathering organized by the the nation's main opposition
group, the Democratic Action Party.
	   The party's leader, Lim Kit Siang and his son, Lim Guan Eng,
both opposition members of Parliament, were to speak at that
meeting about the younger Lim's 18-month prison sentence for
printing a pamphlet that criticized the government.
	   Another party meeting was also subsequently broken up and the
permit revoked.
	   ``There is clearly a clampdown on public meetings,'' Lim told a
news conference Tuesday. ``We can eat, but we can't talk.''
	   While Lim demanded a meeting of opposition leaders with Mahathir
to seek explanations for the police actions, one consumer group
said it was planning to sue local authorities for failing to
provide water to residents.
	   ``We will show that it is a crisis of negligence,'' said A.
Jayseelan, director of the Selangor and Federal Territory Consumer
Association.
	   Stepping out of political neutrality, the Malaysian Trades Union
Congress _ which claims a half-million members _ said it was
plunging into an alliance with the opposition parties and civil
liberties groups.
	   The rumblings of political discontent come amid Malaysia's worst
economic crisis since the mid-1980s. The government recently
announced that the economy had shrunk by 1.8 percent in the first
three months of 1998.

Ethiopia attacks border town, Eritrea urges talks

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia delivered on its threat to
attack Eritrea again unless it withdrew from disputed territory,
launching a ground strike Tuesday against a border town.
	   With hostilities between the two Horn of Africa neighbors
escalating, the U.S. government prepared to evacuate at least
another 120 of its citizens, along with Germans, Egyptians and some
Ethiopians.
	   At dawn, the Ethiopians army launched a fresh attack with tanks
and artillery on Eritrean positions in a bid to recapture the town
of Zala Ambessa, 105 kilometers (65 miles) southeast of Asmara, the
Eritrean government said. Eritrea captured the town in a battle
June 2-4.
	   The Eritrean government on Monday called for direct talks
between the two Horn of Africa countries in the presence of
high-level mediators ``so as to ensure a speedy resolution of the
crisis.''
	   President Isaias Afwerki's spokesman said Ethiopia had
effectively declared war on Eritrea and was using the threat of
renewed air strikes to blockade air and seaports.
	   ``They won't compromise,'' Yemane Gebremeskel said. ``These are
not the actions of a nation that wants peace.''
	   Eritrea claims its forces are within internationally recognized
borders drawn by Italy in the late 19th century. Eritrea, an
Italian colony from 1885 to 1941, was annexed in 1962 by Ethiopia,
against whom it later fought a 30-year war for independence.
	   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi accused
the Eritreans of ``a pattern of prevarication, a pattern of trying
to draw out the process and consolidate their hold on our
territory.
	   ``If that's the case _ and it appears to be the case _ then the
opportunities for resolving this problem peacefully could be fast
disappearing,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Isaias indicated pride was an obstacle to resolving the
conflict, underscoring diplomats' concerns that the alliance
between Isaias' Eritrean People's Liberation Front and Meles'
Tigray People's Liberation Front to end 17 years of military rule
in Ethiopia in 1991 has soured.
	   ``We might be more concerned about pride, integrity, respect and
all that kind of thing _ trust, confidence. When you lose that it
becomes a big problem for us in this region _ it's not always money
and resources,'' Afwerki told The Associated Press late Monday.

Report: Russian missiles already on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian air defense missiles have been delivered
to Cyprus despite vows by Turkey to stop the weapons reaching the
island, a newspaper reported on Tuesday.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry refused to confirm or deny the
report by the respected Segodnya daily.
	   While declining to comment on whether the S-300 missiles were
already on Cyprus, ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin
reiterated the long-held Russian argument that the missiles would
threaten no one.
	   ``We have been giving repeated explanations that the missiles
are a defensive weapon,'' Nesterushkin said in a telephone
interview. ``The presence of weapons on the island is the outcome
of the unsettled conflict between the Turkish and Greek population
on the island.''
	   Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms trading monopoly denied that the
delivery had taken place and said the missiles will be sent to
Cyprus in mid-August as earlier planned, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The S-300, capable of shooting down aircraft and missiles, is a
Russian equivalent of the U.S. Patriot missiles which gained fame
during the Gulf War.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the missiles'
deployment.
	   Greece has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military conflict between
two NATO allies.
	   Turkey maintains some 30,000 troops on Cyprus since it invaded
the island in 1974, following a failed coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Cyprus has said it is ready to cancel the dlrs 200 million
missile deal if there is substantial progress toward the
reunification of the island and if Turkey accepts its proposal for
demilitarization.
	   The latest attempt to restart talks to reunify the Mediterranean
island by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed earlier last month.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks ended sharply higher Tuesday as a
stronger dollar stoked optimism about earnings at Japan's
exporters. The U.S. currency gave up some gains after reaching a
new seven-year against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 235.46 points, or 1.52
percent, to close at 15,530.17. On Monday, the average shed 28.72
points, or 0.19 percent.
	   On Tokyo's foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 140.36 yen
at late afternoon, down 0.20 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and
below its New York level overnight of 140.71 yen. During Tokyo
trading, the dollar rose as high as 141.11 yen, a level not seen
since June 1991.
	   Exporters such as Sony Corp., Canon Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp.
led the benchmark average higher. A stronger dollar is good news
for these companies because it boosts the yen value of dollar-based
profits and allows them to cut prices overseas.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. was the most actively
traded stock Tuesday. It plunged 77 percent as a rumor spread its
tie-up with Swiss Bank had come undone _ and then bounced right
back when the bank denied the speculation.
	   Trading was sparse, with an estimated 314 million shares
changing hands on the first section. Gaining issues outnumbered
decliners 6-to-5.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.32 points, or 0.86 percent, to 1,208.68.
The TOPIX closed down 3.58 points, or 0.30 percent, the day before.
	   On the currency market, the dollar surrendered early gains amid
speculation deputy finance ministers from the Group of Seven
largest economies meeting later Tuesday in Paris may announce a
joint effort to prop up the Japanese currency.
	   A growing number of officials from the G-7 have expressed
concern over the declining yen. On Monday, German central bank
chief Hans Tietmeyer said he hopes ``the yen won't depreciate
excessively.''
	   ``Judging from Tietmeyer's remark, we can't completely rule out
the possibility of a surprise announcement from the G-7 that
expresses, for instance, concerted efforts to defend the yen,''
said Ryuichi Takami, a senior currency trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   Still, the main cause of the yen's recent weakness _ Japan's
ailing domestic economy _ remains unchanged. On Tuesday, a Japanese
government report warned that key sectors of the economy such as
employment and production would likely worsen in June.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.210 percent from Monday's close of 1.145
percent, driving its price down to 111.96 yen from 112.46 yen.

Yeltsin, Kohl meet on Russia's financial troubles, Kosovo

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
ministers met with German officials Tuesday on how to prevent
escalating violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   The talks also focused on Russia's market collapse last month
following an oil-price drop. But Yeltsin and other Russian
officials have insisted publicly that they are not looking for any
new aid or funding.
	   The two-day talks, the first in a series of periodic
German-Russian consultations agreed to by Yeltsin and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl last year, also focused on nuclear tests in Pakistan
and India and on whether to jointly build a military transport
plane.
	   ``New problems keep emerging which need to be solved quickly and
energetically, and the both of us, Helmut and I, will solve these
problems this way,'' Yeltsin said after arriving Monday evening.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he would try to get Russia to
back the European Union's decision Monday to punish Serbia with
economic sanctions for its attacks on its separatist region of
Kosovo.
	   But asked whether Russia would support the ban on investment in
Serbia and a freeze of its foreign assets, Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said Monday night: ``No, I don't think so.''
	   Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembski said Russia and other
European nations need to address the Kosovo conflict ``as a team''
to prevent other nations from being drawn into the conflict.
	   German government spokesman Otto Hauser said Germany would
provide no direct aid to Russia. But Germany left open the
possibility of participating in a loan package put together by the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Stanley Fischer, an IMF official based in Washington, said in
Washington that the organization didn't see any immediate reason to
boost an existing dlrs 9.2 billion credit arrangement with Russia.
	   Yeltsin and Kohl made no statements after meeting late Monday,
but were to hold a news conference later Tuesday following a
meeting with their ministers.
	   Ministers of finance, economics, foreign affairs, defense and
atomic energy met separately with their counterparts Tuesday
morning on a broad range of security and trade issues. Yeltsin also
met with opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Shortly after arriving in Bonn, Russian and German ministers
signed two agreements dealing with cooperation in the nuclear power
industry.
	   Cooperation in the defense industry also was on the agenda.
Ukraine has been trying to enlist Germany, Russia and France to
help build a new Ukrainian version of the Antonov An-70 aircraft.
	   Since the fall of communism, Germany has become Russia's most
important trade partner outside the former Soviet Union, and a key
source of aid and credit.
	   Kohl and Yeltsin agreed to periodic consultations during an
April 1997 meeting in Baden-Baden, when Kohl helped negotiate
Russia's acquiescence to the eastward expansion of the NATO
military alliance.

Vatican's former No. 2 official dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican's
former No. 2 official whose cautious diplomacy helped the church
survive in Eastern Europe during Cold War years, died Tuesday at
83.
	   The Vatican said Casaroli died in a Rome hospital but did not
give a cause of death. News reports said he had been hospitalized
since last week with heart problems.
	   The Italian cardinal served as secretary of state of the Vatican
from 1979 until 1990.
	   When Casaroli retired, Pope John Paul II expressed his gratitude
to the tailor's son from Piacenza in northern Italy and said it was
``providential'' to have worked with him during such ``historic
times.''
	   That was a reference to the changes that brought the church
renewed freedoms in Europe after 40 years of Communist rule in the
former Soviet bloc.

Report: Newspaper editor killed

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The body of a newspaper editor was found in the
southern republic of Kalmykia after she went to a meeting with
people who said they had important documents, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   Citing local police, the report said Larisa Yudina disappeared
Sunday after leaving her home in Elista, capital of the Kalmyk
Republic in south Russia.
	   Her body, bearing signs of a violent attack, was found in a pond
in Elista, the report said. Police declined to confirm or deny
reports that Yudina had been stabbed, it said.
	   Yudina was also co-chairman of the local branch of Yabloko, the
country's main liberal political party.

	   The Polish-born pope and some other churchmen were said to have
had differences with Casaroli's cautious approach to diplomacy,
preferring a more uncompromising stance.
	   But John Paul promoted Casaroli to secretary of state less than
a year after becoming pontiff.
	   Casaroli was considered as consummate diplomat and an extremely
loyal official. He and the pope clearly had reconciled any
differences as the years went on.
	   In the Vatican hierarchy, the secretary of state is the most
important post under the pope, a position equivalent to premier.
	   Casaroli was considered an architect of the Vatican's diplomacy
that aimed to gain at least some freedom for the Roman Catholic
Church after open persecution by Communist nations.
	   The policy toward Eastern Europe, known as the Vatican's
Ostpolitik, was the inspiration of Pope John XXIII after the hard
line taken by Pope Pius XII during the years of Stalinist
repression.
	   Pope Paul VI, who took over in 1963, implemented the policy,
working closely with Casaroli, sending the prelate on frequent
missions to Communist capitals.
	   Casaroli was given credit for the tough language on human rights
and religious liberty in the 1975 Helsinki accords.
	   Beyond the diplomatic field, Casaroli kept the Vatican running
smoothly after the pope was wounded by a Turkish gunman in 1981.

Netanyahu may be leaning toward referendum on troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled
Tuesday that he might support a nationwide referendum on a pending
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank, saying public input was
important on such a crucial question.
	   ``It is obligatory, above all, that there be broad public
support so the rifts in the nation will heal and we have domestic
peace, not just external peace,'' Netanyahu said in an interview
with Israel Radio.
	   But the prime minister added he was not yet committed to the
referendum route.
	   A show of public support for the withdrawal could help Netanyahu
weather the political storm that authorizing it would bring.
Right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down
his government if he goes ahead with a pullback.
	   After much wrangling and delay, Israel's Cabinet is expected to
vote by the end of the week on a U.S. initiative to pull back from
13 percent of the West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war.
	   According to Israeli media reports, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Israel on Monday to quickly overcome internal disputes on the
pullback and move ahead to so-called final-status talks with the
Palestinians, in which thorny issues including Jerusalem's future
are to be decided.
	   The reports said Clinton made the remarks during an unexpected
encounter with Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   Netanyahu says security considerations, not internal disputes,
are holding up a vote.
	   ``My considerations are over what is the best agreement from the
point of view of security, settlement and the national interest,''
he told Israel radio. ``And of course that there will be
reciprocity _ that the Palestinians will fulfill their
commitments.''
	   The Palestinians, who currently have full control over 3 percent
of the West Bank and partial control over another 24 percent, have
accepted the American initiative.
	   Under the American plan _ which has been widely reported but
never formally unveiled _ a second Israeli redeployment would take
place in three stages over 12 weeks. It would bring full and
partial Palestinian control over the West Bank to 40 percent.
	   Peace talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for more
than 15 months. They stalled after groundbreaking on a Jewish
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want the city's eastern sector as their future
capital, but Israel claims jurisdiction over all Jerusalem.
	   Bitter disputes have broken out in recent weeks over Jewish
settlers' moves into Arab parts of town, which Palestinians view as
land grabs in advance of any settlement of Jerusalem's status.
	   Before dawn on Monday, Jewish settlers took over five apartments
in two buildings in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan, setting off
angry confrontations with residents.

Parliament approves privatization of banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a further move to step up Egypt's
privatization program, Parliament has approved a government bill
that allows the sale of shares in state-owned banks, newspapers
reported Tuesday.
	   The 500-member People's Assembly voted on the bill in a general
session Monday that was marred by heated discussions by opposition
deputies who accused the government of succumbing to pressures from
the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the economic daily Alam Al-Yawm quoted Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzoury, who presented the bill to Parliament, as saying the
government will continue to control banking operations through the
Central Bank although it will not be a major shareholder.
	   Under the new law, which has to be endorsed by President Hosni
Mubarak, the government will sell unlimited shares in four major
commercial banks and several other development banks it now owns.
	   The law also stipulates that private investors will be limited
to 10 per cent shares each, apparently to prevent monopoly on large
shares by both local and foreign investors.
	   The head of the Parliament's economic committee Abdullah Tayel
said the move is expected to improve efficiency of the banking
sector and bring more investment to the Egyptian economy.
	   But Khalid Moheidin, leader of the opposition socialist
Progressive Unionist Party, told Parliament that the privatization
of the banks will put the Egyptian economy under foreign control.
He and other opposition members voted against the bill.
	   Parliament endorsed another bill which allows the sale of shares
in state-owned insurance companies.
	   Banking and other sectors were nationalized after Gamal Abdel
Nasser's 1952 army coup. The state began to loosen control in 1991
when President Hosni Mubarak began his economic reforms.
	   Since then, Egypt's gross domestic product has grown from 2
percent to more than 5 percent. Inflation has fallen from 20
percent to under 4 percent and foreign currency reserves have risen
to about dlrs 20 billion.
	   The country's major economic newspaper, Al-Ahram Al-Iqtisadi,
reported last month that Egyptian banks in February registered
assets totaling 205 trillion pounds (dlrs 60 billion).
	   The four main state banks which will be privatized are the
National Bank of Egypt, the Bank of Alexandria, Banque du Caire and
Banque Misr.

Communist move to impeach Yeltsin face hurdles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist-backed impeachment motion against
President Boris Yeltsin hit a snag on Tuesday when lawnmakers
failed to agree on setting up a panel to draw up formal charges.
	   The parliament's lower house, the State Duma, must create a
commission made up of representatives of all factions to prepare an
indictment. The Duma will then have to vote by a two-thirds
majority to launch impeachment proceedings.
	   When the Communists called for the commission's creation
Tuesday, the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction said it
didn't want to take part, bringing the move to a grinding halt.
	   Previous impeachment motions against Yeltsin have all fizzled
without reaching the floor mostly because Russia's Constitution
gives the president the upper hand in confrontations with
parliament.
	   Even if the Duma finally votes to start the impeachment
proceedings, the motion will then go to the upper chamber
consisting of regional officials many of whom are loyal to Yeltsin.
The charges will also have to win confirmation from both
Constitutional and Supreme courts _ a highly unlikely development.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of a range
of transgressions, including instigating the Soviet collapse,
launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the country's
economy which led to a population decrease.

World Cup: Soccer team boycotts Romanian media
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIOREL URMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) _ The national soccer team is refusing all
interviews with Romanian media in France for the World Cup,
following news reports of the goalkeeper's bad behavior during a
warmup game against Paraguay last week.
	   ``The players said they will talk only to foreign reporters,''
coach Anghel Iordanescu told a news conference Monday night,
attended by foreign and Romanian reporters.
	   Asked if he could intervene with the players to change their
mind, Iordanescu said, ``I can't do anything if they don't want to
talk to Romanian journalists. Perhaps FIFA can do something.''
	   He said he hoped that the situation will change in the next
couple of days.
	   Afterwards, the players met only with foreign reporters, while
ignoring their compatriots. Frustrated Romanian reporters, whose
dailies and magazines paid up to dlrs 10,000 each for their
accreditation, transportation and living costs, looked upset.
	   The scandal followed a row about obscene gestures by goalkeeper
Bogdan Stelea during the game against Paraguay, a World Cup
qualifier, last week in Bucharest. Romania struggled to defeat the
South Americans 3-2 on a penalty kick.
	   Stelea conceded an easy goal from Paraguay's Roberto Acuna in
the 64th minute, angering Romanian fans. The goalkeeper later
defused another Paraguayan attack, earning applause from
spectators. But Stelea then pulled down his shorts to expose part
of his backside and made a vulgar gesture at the crowd.
	   Romanian media headlined the incident. ``Stelea _ Be Ashamed,''
said one report.
	   Teammates defended Stelea. ``We are deeply grieved by some
dailies and TV stations' attitude regarding us,'' the players said
in a statement released after the game.
	   The statement said the team wants to keep calm during the
tournament, without distractions from Romanian media comments.
	   ``Because of you, the public is cursing us,'' star player
Gheorghe Hagi told journalists before their departure for France.

Hong Kong repatriates more than 100 Vietnamese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Another group of 154 Vietnamese was deported
back to their Communist homeland Tuesday, two weeks after the Hong
Kong government closed the last remaining camp for such
asylum-seekers.
	   This brought to 12,758 the number of Vietnamese deported under
the government's forced repatriation policy that was introduced in
1991.
	   Last month, the government shut down the High Island Detention
Center, the last remaining camp for the Vietnamese.
	   The territory still harbors about 2,500 Vietnamese
asylum-seekers. More than 1,100 of them have been granted refugee
status and are awaiting resettlement. The rest are in jail and will
be deported.
	   In January, six months after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule,
the government abolished its 23-year-old policy of offering
temporary asylum to the Vietnamese.
	   Vietnamese who arrive illegally now are simply held in detention
until arrangements can be made to send them back.
	   Since communist North Vietnam defeated the U.S.-backed South in
1975, ending the Vietnam war, nearly 223,000 Vietnamese have passed
through Hong Kong, most of them arriving penniless by boat.
	   The government said just 178 Vietnamese arrived in the first
five months of this year, compared to 1,024 over the same period
last year.

Vatican's former No. 2 official dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES prvs; ADDS pope praying, cardinal's body to be taken
to Vatican church, details on illness, BYLINE &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican's
former No. 2 official whose cautious diplomacy helped the church
survive in Eastern Europe during Cold War years, died Tuesday at
83.
	   The Vatican said Casaroli died in a Rome hospital but did not
give a cause of death. A brief statement from the hospital said the
cardinal was hospitalized on Thursday and died of heart problems.
	   The Italian cardinal served as secretary of state of the Vatican
from 1979 until 1990.
	   When Casaroli retired, Pope John Paul II expressed his gratitude
to the tailor's son from Piacenza in northern Italy and said it was
``providential'' to have worked with him during such ``historic
times.''
	   That was a reference to the changes that brought the church
renewed freedoms in Europe after 40 years of Communist rule in the
former Soviet bloc.
	   The pope was reported to have immediately started praying after
news of the death.
	   The Polish-born pope and some other churchmen were said to have
had differences with Casaroli's cautious approach to diplomacy,
preferring a more uncompromising stance.
	   But John Paul promoted Casaroli to secretary of state less than
a year after becoming pontiff.
	   Casaroli was considered as consummate diplomat and an extremely
loyal official. He and the pope clearly had reconciled any
differences as the years went on.
	   In the Vatican hierarchy, the secretary of state is the most
important post under the pope, a position equivalent to premier.
	   Casaroli was considered an architect of the Vatican's diplomacy
that aimed to gain at least some freedom for the Roman Catholic
Church after open persecution by Communist nations.
	   The policy toward Eastern Europe, known as the Vatican's
Ostpolitik, was the inspiration of Pope John XXIII after the hard
line taken by Pope Pius XII during the years of Stalinist
repression.
	   Pope Paul VI, who took over in 1963, implemented the policy,
working closely with Casaroli, sending the prelate on frequent
missions to Communist capitals.
	   Casaroli was given credit for the tough language on human rights
and religious liberty in the 1975 Helsinki accords.
	   Beyond the diplomatic field, Casaroli kept the Vatican running
smoothly after the pope was wounded by a Turkish gunman in 1981.
	   The cardinal's body was to be taken to a small church, St.
Stephan's, in Vatican City, the hospital said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the government's statistics service
was arrested Tuesday on charges of helping tax-dodgers and selling
confidential data, officials said. Investigators found over dlrs 1
million in cash at his apartment.
	   Yuri Yurkov, head of the State Statistics Committee, was
arrested along with an unspecified number of senior workers in
charge of data processing, said government spokesman Alexei Volin.
	   They were charged with ``systematic distortion of statistical
data on big companies which allowed them to evade taxes,'' Volin
said.
	   Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia with many big companies
and businessmen not paying. Government efforts to boost the economy
have been hobbled by a lack of revenues because of tax evasion.
	   Yurkov and his alleged accomplices were accused of manipulating
economic data to hide the real output of companies and reduce their
tax liability and with selling classified information about rival
companies' performance.
	   Yurkov, who has served as the statistics agency chief since
1993, would be one of the highest-ranking Russian officials
arrested for alleged wrongdoing in recent years.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Housing construction, employment and import figures
have worsened over the past month, but consumer spending shows
signs of a recovery, according to a closely watched government
report Tuesday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency assessed the overall economy as
``stagnant,'' unchanged in June from its report in May.
	   But the report slightly upgraded its view of personal
consumption because of hopes that spending will accelerate from
next month.
	   ``Consumption trends are showing signs of recovery,'' the
carefully worded report said. It added, however, that spending
remains weak due to poor employment conditions and other factors.
	   It also said housing construction and import statistics
worsened.
	   Japan's unemployment rate has steadily worsened, climbing to an
all-time high of 4.1 percent in April, its highest level in more
than four decades.
	   Japan's economy has been sluggish for most of the decade,
despite numerous government attempts to revive it via fiscal
stimulus and tax cuts.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Japanese electronics giant Hitachi is shifting
much of its production of dynamic random access memory chips, or
DRAM, from its plants in Germany and Japan to Singapore, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   A Hitachi spokesman in Tokyo said that ultimately more than half
of the company's output of 64-megabit DRAM chips could come from
Singapore, according to The Business Times.
	   No timetable for the completed shift was given.
	   Hitachi is one of the world's largest producers of DRAM chips, a
key component in personal computers and a bellwether for the global
electronics industry.
	   The Singapore plant, Hitachi Nippon Steel Semiconductor
Singapore, currently accounts for about 10 percent of total DRAM
chip production.
	   Hitachi said the plan is to consolidate its DRAM output from
various German, Japanese, and Singapore fabrication plants to two
bases.
	   Hitachi's Naka plant in Japan will produce mostly
future-generation 256-megabit DRAM chips, while the Singapore plant
will concentrate on the more commonly-used 64-megabit DRAMs, the
spokesman told the newspaper.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., a major
Japanese credit bank, denied a rumor Tuesday that it would dissolve
its tie-up with Swiss Bank Corp.
	   ``This is completely false, and there is no truth in it,'' the
Japanese bank said in a statement.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank's share prices moved sharply lower on the
rumor, falling by 14 percent from Monday's finish to 155 yen (dlrs
1.10) per share at the end of Tuesday's morning session on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank Vice President Masami Suda told a news
conference that the bank had asked the Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities watchdog, to
investigate the rumor.
	   Last year, Long-Term Credit Bank and Swiss Bank agreed to form a
strategic alliance to take advantage of Japan's ``Big Bang''
financial deregulation effort.
	   In the statement, Long-Term Credit Bank said that the securities
joint venture created by the alliance, LTCB Warburg Securities
Ltd., had already started operations, and said other joint
operations _ private banking and investment trusts _ will soon be
launched.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Non-performing loans in the
Philippine banking sector rose to 7.6 percent of total loans as of
March 31, the central bank said Tuesday.
	   The central bank's treasury director, Amando Tetangco, said the
rise from 5 percent at the end of 1997 wasn't surprising given the
impact of the region's financial crisis. He called the level
manageable.
	   The central bank has forecast that the ratio of non-performing
loans will rise to about 8 percent by the end of the year.
	   He said those banks that are experiencing financial difficulties
are smaller institutions.
	   Central bank officials earlier Tuesday denied a report in a
local newspaper saying that monetary authorities have put 17
allegedly ailing banks on a watch list.
	   ``We have no such list,'' central bank deputy governor Alberto
Reyes told a radio station.
	   The report came a day after the central bank announced the
closure of a small Manila thrift bank, Commonwealth Savings and
Loan Bank, which was placed in receivership.
	   The central bank has said two other small banks _ Richmond Bank
and Fortune Savings and Loan Association _ have problems, but are
preparing rehabilitation programs.
	   Reyes said the country's larger banks are well capitalized and
in sound financial health.
	   Tetangco said the regional currency crisis has prompted the
central bank to set up a special monitoring team to scrutinize
various aspects of the banking system in addition to existing
oversight in areas such as foreign exchange and bank deposit
movements.
	   ``But there is no watch list of banks,'' he reiterated.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In another sign of deflation in the Japanese
economy, Japan's central bank said Tuesday wholesales prices fell
1.7 percent in May from the same month last year.
	   That follows a 2.7-percent drop by the Bank of Japan's monthly
index of wholesale prices in April.
	   In breaking down this month's figure, the bank said prices of
goods produced domestically fell 2.3 percent from last year.
	   Meanwhile, the effects of a weakening yen made themselves felt
on the price of imports. The Bank of Japan said import prices rose
1.2 percent as a stronger dollar boosted the cost of oil and other
imports.
	   Deflation can be devastating because falling prices mean
companies don't earn enough to pay for production, throwing the
economy into a vicious cycle of factory shutdowns, declining
consumption and still lower prices.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The long-awaited departure of the El
Nino weather pattern will boost Australia's winter crops, including
wheat, the government's chief commodity forecaster said Tuesday.
	   But widespread rain in April and early May was too late to stop
the summer crop production forecast for the 12 months to June 1998
being cut to 3.9 million (metric) tons from about 4.1 million tons,
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said
in its June crop report.
	   However, Australian wheat production was forecast to increase to
19.3 million tons in the 12 months to June 30, 1999, up four
percent on the previous year and exceeding the bureau's earlier
18.4 million ton forecast.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's death
Monday is an ``incredible opportunity'' for the West African nation
to return to democracy, a leading dissident in exile said _ a hope
echoed by Western powers.
	   Playwright Wole Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in
literature and an outspoken opponent of military rule, fled Nigeria
in 1994. Abacha's military regime charged him with treason, a crime
punishable by death.
	   Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem, where he was lecturing,
Soyinka called Abacha's death ``an opportunity for Nigerian civic
society, an opportunity for the Nigerian military, and an
opportunity for the international community.''
	   In a predawn ceremony Tuesday, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakara, who
was defense chief of staff, was sworn in as Abacha's successor.
	   Even while Abacha was still in power, Nigerians were struggling
to restore democracy, Soyinka said.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   The United States, Britain and the Commonwealth of Britain and
its former colonies urged a quick transition to democracy in
Nigeria, a former British colony.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S. government
``acknowledges the death'' of Abacha, and is interested in seeing
his successor embark upon democratic rule.
	   ``There have been freely and democratically elected figures
throughout Africa that were formerly involved in the military,''
McCurry said. ``Our hope, among others, would be, at this moment of
transition, that an accountable civilian government ... will emerge
from what has been a very horrific episode in which basic
fundamental rights have been suspended.''
	   The 53-nation Commonwealth suspended Nigeria after it executed
playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other dissidents in 1995.
	   Nigerian Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the
Commonwealth, told BBC TV: ``The Commonwealth would hope and would
expect that the Nigerians will decide to go back to the way of
democracy and in so doing will gain re-admission to the
Commonwealth.''
	   The international community should now press for elections in
Nigeria this year, said New Zealand's foreign minister, Don
McKinnon, who is also vice-chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group on Nigeria.
	   ``Nigeria was one of the leaders in democracy in Africa back in
the 1960s and there's no reason why they can't return to it. But
it's very much up to (those there) to do something about it,'' he
said.
	   In New York, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Annan praised the contribution made by Nigeria under Abacha to
ending the civil war in nearby Liberia and to restoring the
democratically elected government of Sierra Leone.
	   South Africa also paid tribute to Abacha's role in returning
democracy to Sierra Leone. Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo
expressed the government's condolences to Abacha's family and to
Nigeria.
	   ``It is our hope that the good relations that exist between our
two countries will persist and that the path to democracy in
Nigeria will be pursued to its full conclusion,'' read a statement
issued from the Organization of African Unity summit in Burkina
Faso.
	   Nigeria's next leader could hardly be any worse than Abacha,
Saro-Wiwa's son said in Britain.
	   ``In Nigeria, the thinking has always been that every successive
dictator is worse than the previous one, so one hopes that we don't
get another dictator because he will have quite a record to better
Abacha's appalling record,'' said Ken Wiwa.
	   Soyinka urged the military to release all political prisoners,
including Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of Nigeria's aborted
1993 presidential elections, and name Abiola head of a transitional
national unity government.
	   ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's a democratic
option,'' he said. ``And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting.''
	   Until that happens, the international community should increase
pressure and sanctions on the military government, Soyinka said.
	   ``They have an incredible opportunity to bow out gracefully,''
Soyinka said of the military. ``Let us pray that they take it.''

German unemployment rate drops for May
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Germany's unemployment crisis eased in
May, with 223,400 more people working than in the previous month,
the Federal Labor Office said Tuesday.
	   A total 4.2 million people remained jobless _ or 10.9 percent of
the work force compared to 11.1 percent in April. It was the first
time since 1996 that the rate has sunk below 11 percent.
	   Compared to May 1997, 58,300 more people had jobs, making it the
first time in almost three years that unemployment has improved on
the year.
	   Unemployment is the key issue in national elections Sept. 27,
and thousands of people have been protesting joblessness in recent
months.
	   Last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl revealed the unemployment
figures early, saying the main goal of his political platform was
``to give people who want to work the chance to work.''

Iran could have missile capable of hitting Israel within year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Within a year, Iran will have a missile capable
of reaching Israel _ unless Russian aid for the Iranian nuclear
program stops, an Israeli defense source said Tuesday.
	   Western experts believe that Iran is making strenuous efforts to
develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of
delivering them.
	   At a recent high-level meeting, Israeli defense officials warned
that a prototype for Iran's Shihad-3 missile, with a range of 1,300
kilometers (1,625 miles), will be ready for launching in about a
year if Russia continues to supply missile technology to Teheran,
the source said.
	   ``Without Russian knowhow, the Shihad-3 will never take off,''
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   According to Western estimates it will take Iran about five
years to acquire or devcelop nuclear warheads.
	   During a visit to Israel in October 1997, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov denied that Russia was supplying Iran
with weapons or military technology, but this assertion was
received with skepticism in Israel and the United States.
	   Israeli media reports have said Russia is helping Iran develop
missile navigational and delivery systems as well as the knowhow to
produce nuclear warheads, and that thousands of Russian scientists
and technicians were involved in various Iranian military projects.
	   In the past three months, Russia has begun cutting back its aid
to Iran, in response to the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.
Congress, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.
	   ``The Russians were shocked by the sanctions imposed by the
Congress,'' Netanyahu told the parliamentary foreign affairs and
defense committee. ``There is a change on the ground. It's not
enough, but this time it's genuine.''
	   Congress voted May 22 by an overwhelming majority to impose
sanctions on governments or companies supplying ballistic-missile
technology to Iran. In the Senate the vote was 90-4 in favor. The
sanctions would range from denial of U.S. aid to denial of arms
licenses.
	   Officials of Iran's Islamic regime regularly declare their
ambition to destroy Israel.
	   Israeli foreign ministry Director General Eitan Bentsur arrived
in Moscow Monday night for talks with Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Viktor Posovalyuk.
	   High on their agenda was the issue of Russian aid for the
Iranian missile program, said an Israeli official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

Study condemns China, Colombia for union repression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Colombia and China were singled out for criticism
over abuses of labor union rights in a report published Tuesday to
coincide with a U.N. labor conference.
	   Worldwide, 299 activists were murdered last year, the 142-page
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions report said.
	   Highlighting 156 killings of union leaders and members in
Colombia, the report complained that ``the violence was rarely if
ever investigated.''
	   Although paramilitary organizations were mostly to blame,
``union activists continue to be stigmatized as enemies of the
state,'' it said.
	   It said hundreds of unionists had to leave their homes because
of death threats.
	   Deregulation of Colombian labor laws has made it ``impossible in
practice for many workers to belong to unions and to be covered by
collective agreements,'' the report claimed.
	   In China, ``the unions in foreign-owned and joint venture
companies are largely symbolic,'' according to the Brussels-based
ICFTU, the world's biggest umbrella organization of labor unions.
	   Such unions are controlled either by the Communist Party or
plant management, its report said.
	   The report also criticized U.S. labor law for ``double standards
with respect to the rights of employers and of workers,'' claiming
that at least one in 10 activists campaigning to form a union is
illegally fired.
	   This year's International Labor Organization conference is
working on a declaration committing countries to work toward
collective bargaining and the elimination of forced labor.
	   It is also considering a new world convention aimed at
abolishing the most extreme forms of child labor.
	   In an address to delegates, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera
warned of the dangers of competitiveness and productivity becoming
the only focus of increasingly liberal markets.
	   Newly freed Indonesian labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan promised
support for other repressed activists.
	   ``Do not be afraid. Persevere,'' he told an ICFTU gathering.

Police round up smugglers

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Police of the Muslim-Croat
federation have arrested three persons, smashing up what they say
was a ring of drug and car smugglers operating between the two
Bosnian substates and Italy, a police statement said Tuesday.
	   On June 4, federal police stopped a Mercedes-Benz car with
Croatian license plates near the southern town of Stolac. More than
four kilograms (nearly 9 pounds) of heroin were confiscated and
three people in the car, all residents of Zagreb, the Croat
capital, were arrested, it said.
	   Federal police cooperated with Croatian police and Interpol to
track down and destroy the ring of smugglers, the statement said,
adding the action was continuing.
	   With border porous and officials corrupt, Bosnia frequently has
been a conduit used by international smugglers during and after the
1992-95 war for smuggling guns, drugs and stolen cars.

Rocks thrown during student protest in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with new protests
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs threw rocks and smashed the
windows of several banks at the end of student protest against
local government corruption Tuesday, witnesses said.
	   Police said there were no reports of injuries or arrests in
Tegal, a coastal town about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   Sri Wulandari, a Tegal resident, said more than 100 students
demonstrated in the streets against corruption and collusion in the
local government.
	   Stores closed there doors after other groups joined the protests
and began throwing rocks.
	   ``Stores were shut because some were afraid a riot might
start,'' she said.
	   The failure of many banks has resulted from the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   In Jakarta about a dozen protesters demonstrated peacefully
outside the U.S. embassy, demanding Washington speed up a 43 dlrs
billion IMF bailout plan by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Protests have been held almost daily outside the embassy since
last week.
	   Also in Jakarta, about 200 supporters of opposition figure
Megawati Sukarnoputri marched about five kilometers (3 miles) from
Justice Ministry to the offices of Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   They demanded that they take control of a building.
	   Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's first president, Suharto,
was ousted as party leader by rivals in 1996. She maintains the act
was illegal and was sponsored by the government of former President
Suharto after she called for democratic reform.
	   Suharto stepped down last month following riots and protests
triggered by rising prices and mass unemployment.
	   In a third protest in the capital, about 100 students
demonstrated outside the parliament demanding the government speed
up reform.
	   About 30 people were injured when police and strikers clashed
during a street march in the second city of Surabaya, police said
Tuesday.
	   Violence erupted when a line of riot police halted a
10-kilometer (six-mile) long march by striking factory workers
Monday, setting off a spate of stone-throwing in Indonesia's
biggest protest since the new president eased restrictions on
labor.
	   At least five police and three protesters were hospitalized as a
result of violence during the march in Surabaya, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Police estimated Monday's crowd at 10,000. However, the Jakarta
Post newspaper said about 25,000 took part.
	   Feeling the effects of Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30
years, the workers went on strike a week ago to demand higher
salaries.
	   Meanwhile, all 46 members of the provincial legislature of the
tourist island of Bali have promised to resign after thousands of
protesters accused them of corruption and collusion.

Parliament approves privatization of banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 205 trillion to 205 billion in 11th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a further move to step up Egypt's
privatization program, Parliament has approved a government bill
that allows the sale of shares in state-owned banks, newspapers
reported Tuesday.
	   The 500-member People's Assembly voted on the bill in a general
session Monday that was marred by heated discussions by opposition
deputies who accused the government of succumbing to pressures from
the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the economic daily Alam Al-Yawm quoted Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzoury, who presented the bill to Parliament, as saying the
government will continue to control banking operations through the
Central Bank although it will not be a major shareholder.
	   Under the new law, which has to be endorsed by President Hosni
Mubarak, the government will sell unlimited shares in four major
commercial banks and several other development banks it now owns.
	   The law also stipulates that private investors will be limited
to 10 per cent shares each, apparently to prevent monopoly on large
shares by both local and foreign investors.
	   The head of the Parliament's economic committee Abdullah Tayel
said the move is expected to improve efficiency of the banking
sector and bring more investment to the Egyptian economy.
	   But Khalid Moheidin, leader of the opposition socialist
Progressive Unionist Party, told Parliament that the privatization
of the banks will put the Egyptian economy under foreign control.
He and other opposition members voted against the bill.
	   Parliament endorsed another bill which allows the sale of shares
in state-owned insurance companies.
	   Banking and other sectors were nationalized after Gamal Abdel
Nasser's 1952 army coup. The state began to loosen control in 1991
when President Hosni Mubarak began his economic reforms.
	   Since then, Egypt's gross domestic product has grown from 2
percent to more than 5 percent. Inflation has fallen from 20
percent to under 4 percent and foreign currency reserves have risen
to about dlrs 20 billion.
	   The country's major economic newspaper, Al-Ahram Al-Iqtisadi,
reported last month that Egyptian banks in February registered
assets totaling 205 billion pounds (dlrs 60 billion).
	   The four main state banks which will be privatized are the
National Bank of Egypt, the Bank of Alexandria, Banque du Caire and
Banque Misr.

Thailand offers bonds to bail out rescue fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will issue 50 billion baht
(dlrs 1.2 billion) in one-year bonds this week to help replenish
the country's bank rescue fund, a senior ministry official said
Tuesday.
	   The bonds will be issued via the central bank to Thai financial
institutions and will carry a coupon rate of 12.5 percent, said
Kamol Juntima, ministry comptroller-general.
	   They are the first installment of a planned 500 billion baht
(dlrs 12 billion) domestic bond offering to help refinance the
debts of the Financial Institutions Development Fund.
	   The fund is an arm of the Bank of Thailand responsible for
bailing out troubled financial institutions reeling under bad debts
and the Asian currency crisis.

Netanyahu may be leaning toward referendum on troop withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled
Tuesday that he might support a nationwide referendum on a pending
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank, saying public input was
important on such a crucial question.
	   ``It is obligatory, above all, that there be broad public
support so the rifts in the nation will heal and we have domestic
peace, not just external peace,'' Netanyahu said in an interview
with Israel Radio.
	   But the prime minister added he was not yet committed to the
referendum route.
	   A show of public support for the withdrawal could help Netanyahu
weather the political storm that authorizing it would bring.
Right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down
his government if he goes ahead with a pullback.
	   After much wrangling and delay, Israel's Cabinet is expected to
vote by the end of the week on a U.S. initiative to pull back from
13 percent of the West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war.
	   According to Israeli media reports, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Israel on Monday to quickly overcome internal disputes on the
pullback and move ahead to so-called final-status talks with the
Palestinians, in which thorny issues including Jerusalem's future
are to be decided.
	   The reports said Clinton made the remarks during an unexpected
encounter with Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   Netanyahu says security considerations, not internal disputes,
are holding up a vote.
	   ``My considerations are over what is the best agreement from the
point of view of security, settlement and the national interest,''
he told Israel radio. ``And of course that there will be
reciprocity _ that the Palestinians will fulfill their
commitments.''
	   The Palestinians, who currently have full control over 3 percent
of the West Bank and partial control over another 24 percent, have
accepted the American initiative.
	   Under the American plan _ which has been widely reported but
never formally unveiled _ a second Israeli redeployment would take
place in three stages over 12 weeks. It would bring full and
partial Palestinian control over the West Bank to 40 percent.
	   Peace talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for more
than 15 months. They stalled after groundbreaking on a Jewish
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want the city's eastern sector as their future
capital, but Israel claims jurisdiction over all Jerusalem.
	   Bitter disputes have broken out in recent weeks over Jewish
settlers' moves into Arab parts of town, which Palestinians view as
land grabs in advance of any settlement of Jerusalem's status.
	   Before dawn on Monday, Jewish settlers took over five apartments
in two buildings in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan, setting off
angry confrontations with residents.

Politicians step up pressure on government to stimulate shrinking
</HEADLINE>
economy
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Pressure mounted on the government Tuesday to
stimulate Hong Kong's troubled economy, with some legislators
threatening to stop cooperating with the authorities if it turns
down their economic proposals.
	   The warning came ahead of Financial Secretary Donald Tsang's
scheduled meeting later Tuesday with political party leaders.
	   ``We would withhold cooperation with the government to force
them to the negotiation table,'' said Lee Cheuk-yan of the populist
Frontier goup.
	   ``We want to send the government a message that there will be a
constitutional crisis if it ignore our demands,'' he added.
	   Impatient with the government, seven political parties from
across the political spectrum agreed at a rare summit last week on
a six-measure stimulus package, which includes cuts in taxes and
government fees and a refund of prepaid taxes to boost consumer
spending spending.
	   They also demanded that the govenment push forward
infrastructure plans and expand social services to create jobs,
review the interest rate system, and give support to medium and
small enterprises, the backbone of Hong Kong's economy.
	   The government's own job creation and economic stimulus packages
announced in recent weeks are generally seen as inadequate.
	   Joined by seven other independent legislators, the seven-party
coalition formed an overwhelming majority in the 60-seat
legislature that was elected last month.
	   This is the first meaningful political opposition Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa has faced since he came to power after Hong
Kong's handover to Chinese rule last July.
	   A handpicked legislature Beijing installed after the handover
was dominated by generally cooperative, conservative government
supporters.
	   Analysts have said the record voter turnout at the May 24
legislative election was a show of public dissatisfaction with the
government over the economic downturn.
	   Although Hong Kong has weathered the region's economic turmoil
better than most other Asian countries, slumping property prices,
dwindling tourist arrivals and high interest rates have pushed the
territory into the first economic contraction in 13 years.
	   The economy shrank by 2 percent in the first quarter this year,
and umemployment is at a 14-year high of 3.9 percent.
	   The weakening yen also is putting more pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar's fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar.
	   Allen Lee, chairman of the business-oriented Liberal Party and
leader of the political coalition, said the government needed to do
``more than just sitting there, doing nothing.''
	   ``What we don't want is a Japanese situation,'' he told the
government-owned Radio Hong Kong. ``Ten years ago, the Japanese
government thinks ... the market will correct itself. They think
the government does not need to do anything. Look at what's
happening 10 years later today?''

Air France pilots' strike on collision course with World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with criticism of pilots, strike in 9th day, bus
strike, changes byline

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Criticism of striking French pilots mounted Tuesday
as their walkout entered its ninth day, and Air France arranged to
transport soccer teams on special flights for the World Cup.
	   No new talks have been planned between Air France management and
the pilots, who are increasingly seen as the spoilers of French
efforts to stage the World Cup.
	   Air France is the official carrier of the World Cup, which opens
Wednesday, and the airline has arranged 110 special flights to
transport the teams to their destinations throughout the
tournament.
	   The strike did not appear to be wrecking the party atmosphere in
the French capital on the eve of the World Cup.
	   Preparations for parades in Paris later Tuesday were in full
gear. The Champs-Elysees was decorated with the flags of competing
nations, and hotels strung up banners.
	   In the skies, only one in four Air France planes were expected
to fly Tuesday.
	   Overseas, the strike appeared to have had little affect on fans
trying to get to France for the World Cup.
	   Kazuyoshi Sakamaki, a spokesman for the Narita International
Airport Authority, which manages Tokyo's main international
airport, said the strike had caused no problems or confusion.
	   Japan Travel Bureau, a major travel agency, said that so far it
hasn't received any complaints or requests for reservations on
other airlines from passengers holding tickets on Air France.
	   The main pilots' union offered Sunday to work for free to fly
World Cup ticket holders to the 10 game sites, but on Tuesday said
Air France had rejected the proposal.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta called an extraordinary
board meeting for Wednesday or Thursday, amid French media reports
of a major change in strategy.
	   No new negotiations have been set since an all-night session
ended Saturday morning, and bitterness appeared to gradually
replace the initial embarrassment caused by the strike.
	   Trade union leaders joined politicians in accusing the pilots of
being selfish.
	   Alain Deleu, president of the French Confederation of Christian
Workers, said Tuesday on Radio Monte Carlo that ``nobody can
understand'' how the pilots' grievances could ``be allowed to
disrupt the welcome of foreigners for a world event.''
	   French President Jacques Chirac said he hoped for a speedy
resolution, but said it would not impact the country's reception of
visitors.
	   The pilots are protesting (500 million francs) dlrs 83 million
in salary cuts Air France says are needed to modernize the airline
that was saved from bankruptcy in 1993. It has since reported
profits for 1996 and 1997.
	   Air France has offered to compensate the pilots by giving them
stock in exchange for the pay cuts.

China evacuates nationals, calls on Ethiopia, Eritrea to talk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As Ethiopia attacked Eritrea in a war over
disputed territory Tuesday, China said it evacuated Chinese
citizens from the Horn of Africa nations.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said some embassy staff
and representatives of Chinese businesses were evacuated to ensure
their safety.
	   He did not say how many people departed and by what means but he
added that China's embassies were still open.
	   Noting China's ``friendly'' relations with both countries, Zhu
said, ``We sincerely hope the dispute can be resolved peacefully
through negotiations.''
	   Once a close ally of Ethiopia's longtime military ruler Mengistu
Haile Mariam, China moved to maintain the ties after he was ousted
in 1991 and swiftly opened relations with Eritrea when it declared
independence from Ethiopia in 1992.

 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Defeated party brings veteran leader out of retirement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Hoping to reclaim some of its former
power, the St. Lucia United Workers Party announced Monday it is
bringing former Prime Minister John Compton out of retirement to
lead the party again.
	   The 72-year-old Compton, who was prime minister for 29 years
until he retired in 1996, was elected unopposed Sunday night, the
party announced Monday.
	   Compton was nominated in April by party leaders worried by
increasing divisions in the party and a huge defeat in May 1997
elections. The rival Labor Party won all but one of the 17
legislative seats.
	   Compton had said he would accept the job only if the vote was
unchallenged. His successor as prime minister, Vaughn Lewis, had
been running against Compton for the party leadership but withdrew
his candidacy Sunday.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Poll says residents split on statehood
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Ricans are deeply split on
whether to become the 51st state, despite a relentless lobby by
their pro-statehood governor, a poll published Monday showed.
	   The poll in The San Juan Star daily showed statehood supported
by 40.9 percent, while 40.2 percent favored retaining the unusual
``commonwealth'' status worked out in 1952.
	   Under commonwealth, Puerto Rico's 3.8 million residents are U.S.

 &UR; JAMAICA: Indian doctor falls to death at hospital
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A medical intern from India fell four
stories to his death at Kingston Public Hospital Monday morning,
police said. They suspect it may have been a suicide.
	   Jasti K. Saigal, 29, had finished his morning rounds when
security staff and nurses saw him fall from a roof near the
interns' quarters at the hospital.
	   He was rushed to the hospital's emergency room, but doctors were
unable to save him, said Trevor McCartney, the hospital's chief
medical officer.
	   Saigal was from Andhra Pradesh, a province in southeastern
India, and had recently joined the hospital staff, McCartney said.
	   His roommate, Rao Srinvias, said Saigal had been ``quite
anxious'' Monday morning and said he missed India. He had asked
Srinvias to pick up some antidepressant pills for him.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Probe into lottery scandal bogs down
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A months-old probe into
a dlrs 6.5 million scandal at the Dominican National Lottery has
bogged down, and some vendors say their sales have yet to recover.
	   When the scandal broke in September, several people were
arrested, including top officials in the government of former
President Joaquin Balaguer. All have been released since, however.
	   Prosecutors say the investigation is continuing.
	   Now Dominican officials want a Haitian citizen, Frederick
Mazourca, who was convicted of defrauding the lottery of dlrs
460,000, only to escape and later appear on television to claim a
``mafia'' ran the state-sponsored game.
	   Authorities say Mazourca, who allegedly acted with officials at
the lottery to rig numbers, fled last year to Miami.
 &UR; UNITED NATIONS: Caribbean, Latin American leaders blame drug
consumers
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite President Clinton's appeal to
avoid ``finger-pointing,'' leaders of the world's drug-producing
nations showed no hesitation Monday in blaming consumers for the
global narcotics problem.
	   Their message: if rich countries such as the United States want
our help in fighting against drugs, show us the money.
	   ``The illicit drug trade is demand-driven,'' the prime minister
of the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis told the
opening session of the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
	   ``How can we truly expect small, poor countries such as mine to
defeat the wealthy drug lords if the rich countries, with their
wealth of resources, are unsuccessful in limiting the demand,''
said the prime minister, Denzil Douglas.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Retired lottery official wins lottery
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Nobody knows the
daunting odds of winning the lottery better than Luis Didiez, who
for years administered the official lottery in the Netherlands
Antilles.
	   But a few weeks after retiring and moving to the Dominican
Republic, Didiez bought a ticket anyway _ and struck it rich.
	   On Monday, he claimed his 22 million pesos (dlrs 1.5 million)
win from Saturday's draw in Santo Domingo.
	   The winner said he earned about dlrs 2,000 a month as head of
the lottery in Curacao.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Dominican president sees no change in peso rate
	   NEW YORK (AP) - There will be no devaluation of the Dominican
Republic's official peso rate to bring it more in line with weaker
market rates, says President Leonel Fernandez.
	   ``There are no technical reasons for this movement in the
currency. Perhaps, the electoral period has an impact and (since)
the elections things will stabilize again,'' Fernandez said Sunday
in New York, on a visit for a U.N. drug conference.
	   He said the Dominican economy is ``booming, especially in
construction, tourism and free-trade zones ... All our
macroeconomic indicators are very stable.''
	   The Dominican economy grew 8.3 percent last year and is expected
to grow by more than 7 percent this year, he said.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Dominican leader stumps in New York
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dominican presidential elections are in
2000. But hours after reaching New York for a U.N. drug meeting,
President Leonel Fernandez was stumping in the Dominican stronghold
in northern Manhattan.
	   Extolling ``Companero Leonel'' in ritualistic political
speeches, the expatriate faithful of Fernandez's Dominican
Liberation Party on Sunday packed a middle-school auditorium,
festooned in the party purple and yellow in the city where he spent
much of his childhood.
	   Dominicans, who number 1 million to 2 million in the United
States, can't even vote abroad. But Fernandez, a minority president
struggling to press through economic reforms, takes his support
where he finds it.
	   In a bizarre twist, his party lost its bid for a badly needed
congressional majority in May 16 elections after a charismatic
opponent, Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, died days before, producing a
sweeping sympathy vote for his party.

Belgian steel maker in alliance talks with Thyssen Krupp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Shares in the Belgian steelmaker
Cockerill Sambre SA rose sharply in early trading Tuesday following
reports that Germany's Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG was considering a
takeover.
	   Newspapers in Germany and Belgium reported Thyssen Krupp was
mulling a takeover bid for Cockerill, whose main shareholder is the
government of Belgium's southern Wallonia region.
	   Cockerill spokesman Christophe Weerts confirmed talks had taken
place on a possible alliance with Thyssen Krupp, Europe's largest
steel producer. But he declined to say whether Cockerill would
accept a takeover bid.
	   Weerts said Cockerill, which has been seeking a partner for
years, had also held alliance talks with other steelmakers.
	   Other companies that have been considered potential partners of
Cockerill are Arbed SA of Luxembourg, Usinor SA of France,
Hoogovens NV of the Netherlands and British Steel PLC.
	   Cockerill shares rose by 8.3 percent to 236 francs (dlrs 7.19)
on the takeover speculation early Tuesday.
	   A spokesman for Thyssen Krupp was reported in the Brussels
financial daily L'Echo saying the company is considering making a
takeover offer for the Belgian steelmaker within the next few
weeks.
	   ``It is up to Thyssen to present its conclusions and make its
proposal to the Walloon government,'' Weerts said. Asked whether
Cockerill would accept a takeover by Thyssen Krupp, he said
Cockerill is interested mainly in an ``alliance'' with another
steel company.
	   Thyssen Krupp Stahl as formed last year when the German
industrial giants Thyssen AG, and Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp merged
their steel operations. In 1994, Cockerill took over the huge
Eko-Stahl steelworks in eastern Germany.
	   The Walloon government said in March it would dilute its 78.77
percent stake to a blocking minority or around 25 percent if
Cockerill were to ally itself with another steel producer.

Murdered nurse's brother donates most money from convicted nurses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The brother of an Australian nurse
murdered in Saudi Arabia donated on Tuesday U.S. dlrs 620,000
(Australian dollars 1.035 million) of the money he received to
waive the death penalty for her accused killers.
	   Frank Gilford handed over a check to the Adelaide Women's and
Children's Hospital to help pay for a new day surgery unit which
will be named in memory of his murdered sister, Yvonne Gilford.
	   Gilford received U.S. dlrs 1 million (Australian dollars 1.7
million) compensation for waiving his right to call for the death
penalty for British nurse Deborah Parry, who was convicted by a
Saudi court of the murder.
	   Yvonne Gifford was killed at a hospital in Saudi Arabia in
December 1996.
	   Gilford will keep about U.S. dlrs 30,000 (Australian dollars
50,000) of the payout, about U.S. dlrs 5,400 (Australian dollars
9,000) will go to his mother and the rest will pay legal fees.
	   ``As a nurse, Yvonne cared for people,'' Gilford said at the
presentation ceremony. ``She would be pleased, as I am, that some
good has come from her terrible murder.''
	   He said he hoped the donation towards the unit would help many
people to live comfortably.
	   Gilford's lawyer Michael Abbott said Gilford's only wish during
the 18-months murder trial had been to see the establishment of a
memorial to his sister.
	   A second British nurse, Lucille McLauchlan, was convicted of
being an accessory to the murder and was sentenced to eight years
jail and 500 lashes.
	   Parry and McLauchlan were released last month after the Saudi
King Fahd commuted their sentences to the 17 months already served
in prison.

Peace with the Khmer Rouge filled with bloody ironies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos PHN101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANLONG VENG, Cambodia (AP) _ His makeshift limb, a piece of
metal capped with a scrap of car tire, thuds as he walks through an
abandoned schoolhouse in this former Khmer Rouge stronghold.
	   Each step reminds Teng Sokun _ who lost his left leg in 1989 to
a land mine _ of the heavy price he and other guerrillas had to pay
for decades of civil war against Cambodian governments before they
made peace earlier this year.
	   Looking over the landscape from the third floor, Teng Sokun
said: ``The land is fertile, there's plenty of water. I hope now
people like me can focus on farming instead of fighting.''
	   Integrating former Khmer Rouge like Teng Sokun into society
poses a challenge to the government: It is trying to bring peace by
letting members of a movement that killed as many as 2 million
people start new lives.
	   The Khmer Rouge proved over the past 30 years to be one of the
world's toughest guerrilla forces, surviving in the jungles to wage
war even after their genocidal regime was overthrown by a military
invasion from Vietnam in 1979.
	   But since 1996, Khmer Rouge bastions have fallen one by one
under government control as thousands of veterans like Teng Sokun
grew fed up with war and defected to the Phnom Penh government.
	   In March, the last stronghold of Anlong Veng, near the northern
border with Thailand, came under government control when guerrillas
mutinied against hard-line members loyal to Ta Mok, the tough and
wily successor to the notorious Pol Pot.
	   As a rebel force, the Khmer Rouge is now believed near
extinction, with Ta Mok and an estimated few hundred loyalists
pressed against the Thai border.
	   In Anlong Veng, thousands of guerrillas and their families
officially joined the government Friday, changing out of
Maoist-style garb into royal army uniforms. A day later, they were
registering to vote in upcoming elections.
	   In exchange, they were promised help to develop the area _ home
to about 15,000 former fighters and their families _ and build
schools, roads, pagodas and markets.
	   Now, they have nothing.
	   The hospital can provide rudimentary amputations to land mine
victims, but the seriously ill are sent to the provincial capital
of Siem Reap. The local school is closed. Most houses are empty.
There is no electricity and no market.
	   Anlong Veng's new chieftain, Yim Phanna, a former Khmer Rouge
division commander, said that after years of isolation from the
rest of the world, the former guerrillas need international
assistance.
	   Many are land mine victims. Their best years behind them, they
still hope to build a future for their families through
agricultural development and small-scale trade.
	   That would be a departure from the past, when trade and profit
were considered heresies punishable by death.
	   Before, youngsters spent season after season making poisoned
bamboo spikes to use against government soldiers and education to
make model revolutionaries.
	   Lesson number one: Cambodia is beset by historic foe Vietnam and
Hun Sen, the country's chief leader for the past 13 years, is the
puppet of Hanoi.
	   Now, the guerrillas are accepting Hun Sen's leadership. But no
one has bothered to take down a sign in the schoolyard calling him
a ``mass criminal.''
	   The irony runs both ways. Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official
who escaped to Vietnam in 1977 to escape bloody purges, has built
his career by declaring them his number-one enemy.
	   But unable to defeat them, he has now had to embrace them in the
name of national reconciliation.
	   As result, killers are likely to get away with mass murder, no
matter how many calls are issued for international tribunals to
press charges of crimes against humanity.
	   One is Ke Pauk, who played a major part in the purges Hun Sen
escaped. He strolls freely through Anlong Veng or kills time in a
hammock with little fear of punishment.
	   Ke Pauk brushes off allegations that he is responsible for the
killings of more than 100,000 people. He knows Hun Sen can't touch
people like him if he wants to end the war.
	   The death of Pol Pot of a reported heart attack April 15 gives
killers like Ke Pauk a scapegoat for their crimes.
	   ``This is a Pol Pot issue, it has nothing to do with me,'' says
Ke Pauk, who has even received a post in the government army. ``I
never did anything directly.''

Officials: more than dlrs 25 billion smuggled out of Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than dlrs 25 billion have been smuggled out
of Russia illegally since the Soviet collapse, security officials
said Tuesday.
	   Most of the money has gone to bank accounts in Switzerland,
Cyprus, Britain and Israel, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Russian security services that are investigating capital
flight.
	   Between dlrs 25 billion and dlrs 27 billion have been smuggled
by companies and individuals, usually to evade taxes, Interfax
reported.
	   Investigators said they have leads on dlrs 5 billion of the
money and are trying to track it down, it said.

Ukrainian villager faces trial for failing to report treasure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A Ukrainian villager is facing trial for
finding a treasure of ancient coins and failing to report it to the
authorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Ukrainian law says buried treasure belongs to the state, and
anyone finding it can only hope to receive 25 percent of the value
as estimated by the authorities.
	   But the villager in the eastern settlement of Krivoposevki
decided that he had other uses for a jug filled with 18th century
silver coins from the reign of Russian Empress Catherine the Great,
the daily Dyen said.
	   The villager, whose name was not released, found the 29 silver
rubles last month and sold them for 10 hryvna (dlrs 5) each to
other villagers. However, police soon found the man and he is
facing a possible fine.

Study condemns China, Colombia for union repression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Colombia and China were singled out for criticism
over abuses of labor union rights in a report published Tuesday to
coincide with a U.N. labor conference.
	   Worldwide, 299 activists were killed last year, according to the
142-page report of the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions, the world's biggest umbrella organization of labor unions.
	   Highlighting 156 killings of union leaders and members in
Colombia, the report complained that ``the violence was rarely if
ever investigated'' in the South American nation.
	   Although paramilitary organizations were mostly to blame for the
violence in Colombia, ``union activists continue to be stigmatized
as enemies of the state,'' it said.
	   It said hundreds of unionists had to leave their homes because
of death threats.
	   Deregulation of Colombian labor laws has made it ``impossible in
practice for many workers to belong to unions and to be covered by
collective agreements,'' the report claimed.
	   In China, ``the unions in foreign-owned and joint venture
companies are largely symbolic,'' according to the Brussels-based
confederation.
	   Such unions in China are controlled either by the Communist
Party or plant management, the report said.
	   The group also criticized U.S. labor law for ``double standards
with respect to the rights of employers and of workers,'' claiming
that at least one in 10 activists campaigning to form a union is
illegally fired.
	   This year's International Labor Organization conference is aimed
at getting countries to commit to work toward collective bargaining
and eliminating forced labor.
	   It is also considering a new world convention aimed at
abolishing the most extreme forms of child labor.
	   In an address to delegates, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera
warned of the dangers of competitiveness and productivity becoming
the only focus of increasingly liberal markets.
	   Newly freed Indonesian labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan promised
support for other repressed activists.
	   ``Do not be afraid. Persevere,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador and other envoys were
refusing Tuesday to budge after the Belarusian government said they
had to leave their residences to allow repairs and renovations.
	   The Foreign Ministry expressed regret for the ``inconvenience,''
but said 22 ambassadors would have to leave their homes in the
diplomatic complex on the outskirts of the capital, Minsk, for long
overdue repairs.
	   A long statement said the homes built just after the World War
II were in very poor condition, the water supply was no longer safe
and the sewage system was polluting the environment.
	   Diplomatic missions had been offered apartments in downtown
Minsk to accommodate staff while those willing to build their own
residences would be offered plots, the ministry said late Monday.
	   The Belarusian government served notice in April that it wanted
to overhaul water and sewage pipes in the diplomatic complex.
Diplomats protested, saying they would prefer to make arrangements
to remain in the complex during the repairs.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard said at a news conference on
Monday that he and a number of other ambassadors are refusing to
vacate the complex, and appealed to President Alexander Lukashenko
to rescind the order.
	   But when he came home after the news conference accompanied by
camera crews and photographers willing to make footage of the
compound, they found a team of workers and a policeman trying to
weld shut the side gate.
	   A small American flag was lying on the ground. The workers left
when Speckhard protested.
	   ``To lock ambassadors into their residences and weld their door
shut is not becoming to the dignity of your country,'' Speckhard
told Belarusian reporters.
	   He called the incident the most serious violation of the Vienna
Convention on embassy operations since the end of the Cold War.
	   Speckhard said that he doesn't doubt that some repairs are
needed on the pipes leading to the complex, built to house the
Communist Party elite. But he insisted that the government must
reach agreements with the foreign missions and cannot simply evict
them.
	   Under international law, ambassadors' residences are considered
sovereign territory and governments have no right to enter without
permission or insist that diplomats leave.
	   Speckhard said the United States has had a lease on the
residence since 1992, the year after Belarus gained independence
with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and has spent dlrs 800,000
on repairs. The lease does not expire until 2001.
	   If the government forcibly evicts the ambassadors, it would be
the first violation of the Vienna Convention since Iranian
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, an embassy
spokeswoman said.
	   Russian foreign ministry on Tuesday also protested the planned
eviction of the Russian ambassador and other envoys and voiced
``deep concern'' over Belarusian officials' action.

Bomb explodes in office of French far right political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ An explosive device blew out the window
early Tuesday of the office of the far right National Front in the
southern French port of Marseille.
	   The attack took place just hours before the trial of three
National Front activists, who are accused of having killed a youth
from the Comoros Islands in 1995, is due to start in the nearby
town of Aix-en-Provence.
	   Ibrahim Ali, 17, was allegedly shot in the back by the National
Front activists while running for a bus with his friends. All three
of the accused claim to have been acting in self-defense, but
police did not find any arms or dangerous objects belonging to the
victim and his friends.
	   The National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, blames immigrants,
mainly from North Africa, for France's nearly 12 percent
unemployment rate. It has also been accused of anti-semitism.
	   President Jacques Chirac has branded the party, which tallied
around 15 percent at recent regional elections, ``racist and
xenophobic.''
	   Demonstrations in Ibrahim Ali's honor have taken place since
Saturday in Marseille, a city with a large community from the
Comoros, a former French territory in the Indian Ocean.
	   The detonation of the explosive device damaged the National
Front office. Two individuals, inside at the time, were slightly
injured by splinters of glass.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   An investigation is underway.

Bishops and Vatican try to stem exodus of Iraqi Christians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In black turbans and red sashes, Christian
bishops are trying to stem the flight of the faithful from Iraq.
But they face a tough task: one-third of Iraq's Christians have
left since 1990.
	   ``This immigration is stripping us of our best brains and the
most well-off among us,'' the Rev. Youssef Habbi, an Iraqi
historian, said.
	   Iraqi bishops opened a three-day meeting Monday, joined by a
Vatican envoy and Lebanese and Palestinian colleagues, to study the
rush of immigration since 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and
triggered the Gulf War.
	   They are expected to make recommendations Wednesday.
	   Many clergymen blame the U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after the
Iraqi invasion, for the flight of Christians, mostly young people.
The sanctions limit Iraq's oil exports and have devastated the
economy.
	   Habbi said the once-thriving Christian community _ whose roots
go back to the first century _ has been reduced from 750,000 to
500,000 in eight years.
	   About 80 percent of Iraqi Christians are Chaldaean Catholics,
although representatives of other denominations also attended the
meeting: Syriac Orthodox, Syriac Catholics, Armenian Catholics and
Armenian Orthodox.
	   Pope John Paul II's envoy, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, beseeched
Iraqi Christians to stay. The pontiff has criticized sanctions on
Iraq and has expressed a wish to visit the Iraqi city of Ur,
birthplace of Abraham.
	   But a 1994 plea from the pope that was read in churches did very
little to check the flow, Habbi said.
	   Several Christians complained that little was being done to
relieve their economic distress.
	   ``The pope lives in his mansions in the Vatican and knows very
little about our situation,'' said Jubrael Marouki, who is planning
to leave the country.
	   Another Christian, Daniel Auraha, had similar views.
	   ``The church is rich, but it has practically done nothing to
help us,'' he said.
	   Patriarch Rafael Bedaweed, head of the Iraqi church, admitted
efforts to check the immigration had failed.
	   ``They are not fleeing because of religious or ethnic
oppression. They want us to solve their economic problems,'' he
said. ``Simply, we are not able to do that.''
	   More than 30,000 Iraqi Christians are now stranded in
neighboring Jordan, waiting for visas to Western countries, which
are rarely granted, said Habbi. Some turn to professional smugglers
in frustration.
	   Others have illegally entered Sri Lanka, New Zealand and even
Iceland.
	   To get around dlrs 300 exit fees and laws banning professionals
from leaving, several thousand Christians recently sold belongings
and fled to the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq and on to Greece.
	   Stories abound of families perishing on Kurdistan's snow-capped
mountains.

Report: Head of government statistics agency arrested for rigging
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from tax enforcment chief &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the government's statistics service
was arrested Tuesday on charges of helping tax dodgers and selling
confidential data, officials said. Investigators said they found
over dlrs 1 million in cash at his apartment.
	   Yuri Yurkov, head of the State Statistics Committee, was
arrested along with an unspecified number of senior workers in
charge of data processing, government spokesman Alexei Volin said.
	   They were charged with ``systematic distortion of statistical
data on big companies which allowed them to evade taxes,'' Volin
said.
	   Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia with many big companies
and business executives not paying. Government efforts to boost the
economy have been hobbled by a lack of revenues because of tax
evasion.
	   The country's new tax enforcement chief, Boris Fyodorov, said he
had no information about Yurkov's arrest. At a news conference
Tuesday, Fyodorov pledged once again to enforce the law equally
against all tax dodgers.
	   ``I've been told to collect taxes.'' he said. Because he intends
to do so, he added, ``People are hysterical. It's like 1937, the
year of the Stalin purges.''
	   His first targets will be rich Russians and foreigners, Fyodorov
said. Noting that Western bankers in Russia have advised the
government on how to establish a tax system, he said, ``Our good
friends who help us collect taxes don't always pay themselves.''
	   Yurkov and his alleged accomplices were accused of manipulating
economic data to hide the real output of companies and reduce their
tax liability, and with selling classified information about rival
companies' performance.
	   Yurkov, who has served as the statistics agency chief since
1993, is one of the highest-ranking Russian officials to be
arrested in recent years.

Iran could have missile capable of hitting Israel within year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Within a year, Iran will have a missile capable
of reaching Israel _ unless Russian aid for the Iranian nuclear
program stops, an Israeli defense source said Tuesday.
	   Western experts believe that Iran is making strenuous efforts to
develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of
delivering them.
	   At a recent high-level meeting, Israeli defense officials warned
that a prototype for Iran's Shihad-3 missile, with a range of 1,300
kilometers (1,625 miles), will be ready for launching in about a
year if Russia continues to supply missile technology to Teheran,
the source said.
	   ``Without Russian knowhow, the Shihad-3 will never take off,''
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   According to Western estimates it will take Iran about five
years to acquire or devcelop nuclear warheads.
	   During a visit to Israel in October 1997, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov denied that Russia was supplying Iran
with weapons or military technology, but this assertion was
received with skepticism in Israel and the United States.
	   Israeli media reports have said Russia is helping Iran develop
missile navigational and delivery systems as well as the knowhow to
produce nuclear warheads, and that thousands of Russian scientists
and technicians were involved in various Iranian military projects.
	   In the past three months, Russia has begun cutting back its aid
to Iran, in response to the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.
Congress, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.
	   ``The Russians were shocked by the sanctions imposed by the
Congress,'' Netanyahu told the parliamentary foreign affairs and
defense committee. ``There is a change on the ground. It's not
enough, but this time it's genuine.''
	   Congress voted May 22 by an overwhelming majority to impose
sanctions on governments or companies supplying ballistic-missile
technology to Iran. In the Senate the vote was 90-4 in favor. The
sanctions would range from denial of U.S. aid to denial of arms
licenses.
	   Officials of Iran's Islamic regime regularly declare their
ambition to destroy Israel.
	   Israeli foreign ministry Director General Eitan Bentsur arrived
in Moscow Monday night for talks with Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Viktor Posovalyuk.
	   High on their agenda was the issue of Russian aid for the
Iranian missile program, said an Israeli official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A cyclone hit the coast of India's western
Gujarat state Tuesday, leaving three people dead when high winds
toppled a wall that fell on them.
	   Meteorologist Kamaljeet, speaking by telephone from Ahmedabad,
465 kilometers (290 miles) north of Bombay, said the storm quickly
moved 50 kilometers (30 miles) inland and was expected to weaken
soon. It first struck land at Porbunder, 450 kilometers (280 miles)
northwest of Bombay.
	   Gujarat state officials said the three deaths occurred in
Junagadh, a rural district near Porbunder.
	   Forecasters had earlier predicted the storm would pack wind
speeds of 120 kilometers (72 miles) per hour, but it did not gain
such strength. The storm, with winds up to 80 kilometers (50 miles)
per hour, is expected to move north, said Kamaljeet, who uses one
name only.
	   Indian officials had moved 5,000 people in small towns and
villages bordering the Arabian Sea to safety, state government
officials said.
	   Authorities asked fishermen not to venture out into the sea.
Heavy rains in the area snapped power lines and forced traffic off
the road, Press Trust of India said.

Swiss initiative calls for one auto-free Sunday per season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss voters are to be called on to
decide whether to ban cars from their country's roads on four
Sundays per year, the government said Tuesday.
	   The initiative ``for one car-free Sunday per season'' calls for
private motor vehicles to be banned from Switzerland's roads
between 4 a.m. and midnight on the days in question.
	   Public transport would continue to operate under the plan, which
would initially be introduced for a four-year trial period and then
resubmitted for approval by the people.
	   Under Switzerland's unique system of direct democracy, any
proposal that gathers 100,000 signatures is voted on in a national
referendum.
	   More than 110,000 people backed this initiative, the government
said. No date was given for the vote.
	   The Swiss go to the polls around three times a year to vote on
various national issues.
	   In the latest vote Sunday, Swiss voters firmly rejected a
proposal to impose tough restrictions on genetic engineering.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Labor officials ordered about 600
striking Philippine Airlines pilots to return to work Tuesday,
warning they would authorize the troubled airline to hire
replacements if the strike continues.
	   The pilots' union, however, refused the labor department's
attempts to formally deliver the back-to-work order and said it
would continue the walkout.
	   PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia said the airline agreed to
take the strikers back if they complied with the new Tuesday
deadline. On Sunday it had fired all the striking pilots, calling
their action illegal.
	   Garcia said the 4-day-old strike caused several potential
foreign buyers of the airline, including Northwest Airlines, to
break off talks and could force the airline to shut down.
	   ``Closing PAL is an option. If there are no pilots and
operations, what work can we do?'' Garcia said to reporters after
attending an emergency meeting of PAL's board of directors called
to discuss the strike.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of ordering
pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   The airline earlier announced plans to reduce staff, slash costs
and cut flights to survive a financial crisis.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing cancellations of most
international and domestic flights and affecting thousands of
passengers.
	   PAL says the strike is causing daily losses of 150 million to
200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1 million) in lost
revenue, pushing it ``closer to the brink of insolvency.''
	   President Fidel Ramos urged both sides to follow the labor
department's order and resume negotiations.
	   PAL said Monday it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in
the last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous year.
	   PAL tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion modernization program in 1996, ordering 36 new
aircraft. But Asia's currency crisis sharply reduced passenger
numbers and bloated the airline's debt in local currency terms,
forcing it to delay many of the orders.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government from 1941 until it was partly sold in 1992.

Police serve summons on official charged with corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ On the heels of his acquittal on
currency violations by an Australia court, a top Malaysian
politician was ordered Tuesday to appear in court to face new
corruption charges at home.
	   Former chief minister of the central state of Selangor, Muhammad
Muhammad Taib, was served the summons Tuesday after eluding police
Monday night, Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Agency said in a
statement.
	   Police had stood watch throughout the night at Muhammad's two
homes in the suburbs of the capital, according to the national news
agency Bernama.
	   Muhammad will be charged in a district court Wednesday for
failing to declare all his assets. If convicted, he could face one
year in jail and a 2,000 ringgit (dlrs 500) fine.
	   On Monday, Malaysia's Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah said
there was strong evidence against Muhammad after studying the
investigation by the Anti-Corruption Agency.
	   Muhammad, 52, was found innocent on May 29 by a court in
Brisbane, Australia, of charges of carrying more than a million
dollars in foreign currency in his hand luggage during a trip to
Australia in December 1996.
	   Muhammad said he had been unaware that he had to declare any
cash in excess of U.S. dlrs 3,100 (5,000 Australian dollars) while
traveling in the country.
	   At the time, Taib was chief minister of Selangor. He resigned
his post and has also taken leave from his position of vice
president of Malaysia's ruling United Malays National Organization
party.
	   During the trial, he revealed he had purchased a farm, houses
and several pieces of land valued in Australia and New Zealand
under the name of his wife, Asbi Rohani Asnan.
	   Since Muhammad's arrest, the opposition in Parliament has been
calling on Malaysia's prime minister to investigate the former
chief minister.
	   ``This is a test case as to whether there is a newfound
political will against corruption in Malaysia,'' said Lim Kit
Siang, the leader of the nation's main opposition group, the
Democratic Action Party.
	   On Sunday, the outspoken UMNO youth chief Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
told the government to put its house in order by eliminating
nepotism and corruption in the administration.
	   ``Practices of corruption, power abuse must be curbed,'' he
said.

South Africa sends condolences on Abacha's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa saluted the role
played by the late Nigerian Gen. Sani Abacha in supporting
democracy outside its own borders, but pointed out political
shortcomings at home in the West African country.
	   ``It is our hope that ... the path to democracy in Nigeria will
be pursued to its full conclusion,'' said a statement late Monday
from the Department of Foreign Affairs.
	   Abacha, 54, died Monday of a heart attack. He seized power in
Nigeria in 1993 after canceling presidential elections and
suspending the country's constitution.
	   The South African statement was issued from the Organization of
African Unity summit in Burkina Faso by Foreign Affairs Minister
Alfred Nzo, who expressed the government's condolences to Abacha's
family and nation.
	   ``The South African government, as indeed the rest of the
continent, pays tribute to the positive contribution which General
Abacha ... recently made towards the return of democracy in Sierra
Leone,'' the statement said.
	   The Nigerian-led west African intervention force, ECOMOG,
restored Sierra Leone president Tejan Kabbah to power in March
after he was ousted in a coup.
	   Relations between South Africa and Nigeria have been strained

Rocks thrown during student protest in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs threw rocks and smashed the
windows of banks and shops at the end of a student protest against
local government corruption Tuesday, witnesses said.
	   Police said there were no reports of injuries in Tegal, a
coastal town about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   One man was arrested.
	   Sri Wulandari, a Tegal resident, said more than 100 students
demonstrated in the streets against corruption and collusion in the
local government.
	   Stores closed their doors after other groups joined the protests
and began throwing rocks.
	   ``Stores were shut because some were afraid a riot might
start,'' she said.
	   The failure of many banks has resulted from the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Several shops, including those owned members of the Chinese and
Arabic minorities, were damaged.
	   In Jakarta about a dozen protesters demonstrated peacefully
outside the U.S. embassy, demanding Washington speed up a 43 dlrs
billion IMF bailout plan by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Protests have been held almost daily outside the embassy since
last week.
	   Also in Jakarta, about 200 supporters of opposition figure
Megawati Sukarnoputri marched about five kilometers (3 miles) from
the Justice Ministry to the offices of the opposition Indonesian
Democratic Party.
	   They demanded control over the building that serves as the
headquarters of the opposition party.
	   Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno,
was ousted as party leader by rivals in 1996. She maintains the act
was illegal and was sponsored by the government of former President
Suharto after she called for democratic reform.
	   Suharto stepped down last month following riots and protests
triggered by rising prices and mass unemployment.
	   In a third protest in the capital, about 100 students
demonstrated outside the parliament demanding the government speed
up reform.
	   About 30 people were injured when police and strikers clashed
during a street march in the second city of Surabaya, police said
Tuesday.
	   Violence erupted when a line of riot police halted a
10-kilometer (six-mile) long march by striking factory workers
Monday, setting off a spate of stone-throwing in Indonesia's
biggest protest since the new president eased restrictions on
labor.
	   At least five police and three protesters were hospitalized as a
result of violence during the march in Surabaya, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Police estimated Monday's crowd at 10,000. However, the Jakarta
Post newspaper said about 25,000 took part.
	   Feeling the effects of Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30
years, the workers went on strike a week ago to demand higher
salaries.
	   Meanwhile, all 46 members of the provincial legislature of the
tourist island of Bali have promised to resign after thousands of
protesters accused them of corruption and collusion.

Report: Australian casino may sue Malaysian lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An Australian casino is
threatening to sue a Malaysian lawmaker who has failed to settle a
three-year-old gambling debt of 4.8 million ringgit (dlrs 1.2
million), a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Private investigators representing the casino in Perth were
preparing to file the papers in a Malaysian court after they failed
to persuade the member of parliament to pay up, the Malay Mail
said.
	   The report did not give the name of the legislator or of the
casino.
	   The lawmaker was among eight Malaysians who may be sued by the
casino because they had not settled debts incurred since 1994, the
daily said.
	   More than 100 Malaysian gamblers ran up debts totaling 60
million ringgit (dlrs 15 million) over the last four years in 10
casinos in Australia, a popular destination for rich Malaysians,
the daily said.
	   There is just one holiday resort in Malaysia that boasts of a
casino.
	   In 1995, a Las Vegas casino sued a Malaysian businessman to
recover a dlrs 1.3 million gambling debt.

Chinese trade minister: impact of Asian crisis ``far from over''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi
Guangsheng, said Tuesday the impact of the Asian economic crisis is
``far from over,'' but insisted China would uphold the value of its
currency despite the regional turbulence.
	   ``The crisis does have inestimable implications for China that
have already resulted in a sharp decrease in exports to Southeast
Asia, Japan and South Korea,'' Shi told a China-European Union
trade seminar.
	   He said currency devaluations in Southeast Asian countries had
weakened China's export competitiveness, but stressed China would
not devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   He said China's policy of maintaining the yuan's value
``effectively prevented further deterioration of the Southeast
Asian economy.''
	   Shi said the Asian economic turmoil would not slow reforms to
open up China's economy. He said China will make ``all efforts'' to
achieve 8 percent economic growth this year, control inflation at
below 3 percent and hold the yuan steady.
	   ``We firmly believe the Asian crisis is only a transient
phenomenon and the affected countries will overcome the economic
hardships through efforts made by themselves and the region, and
with assistance from the world community,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A huge antigovernment protest was
stalled Tuesday on the outskirts of the Bangladeshi capital by a
road block of 100 trucks set up by supporters of Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina.
	   Some in the angry crowd of tens of thousands set fire to several
of the trucks that had been used to block the road, the protest
could not advance. Hasina had said she would let the march go ahead
_ it was not clear if she had ordered her supporters to put up the
barricade.
	   Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia was leading the ``long march''
protest, scheduled over two days, to underscore opposition to a
peace accord she says gives away too much to tribal people in the
country's southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts. The protesters were
headed mostly by car and truck 400 kilometers (250 miles) south to
the Chittagong region.
	   Zia has campaigned against the Hasina government since she lost
power in elections two years ago. In recent years, Bangladesh has
been plagued by almost daily strikes and political protests that
often erupt into violence.
	   Tuesday's standoff was potentially explosive, but there were no
immediate reports of violence beyond the burning of the trucks. It
was not clear how many government supporters were at the road
block, facing opponents shouting ``down with Sheikh Hasina!''
	   Protester Ashgar Ali, who owns a small business, said it could
take more than a day to clear the blockade. Many of the trucks had
deflated tires or no tires at all, and drivers of several trucks
had run away with the keys, he said.
	   Fearing unrest, drivers kept buses, trucks and private cars
stayed off the roads in the capital of Dhaka and the major southern
city of Chittagong. Across Bangladesh, some 50,000 police and
paramilitary troops have been put on alert, The Nation daily
reported.
	   Hasina reached a peace accord in December 1997, giving autonomy
to tribes in the Chittagong hills and ending two decades of
guerrilla war by Chakma separatists. The fighting over an area rich
in timber and minerals left more than 20,000 people dead.
	   Hasina has ``left the Chittagong Hill Tracts to the
terrorists,'' Zia said at a kickoff rally for the march in a Dhaka
sports stadium.
	   Zia's marchers had earlier been estimated at hundreds of
thousands, but it later became clear that it was closer to tens of
thousands

Chinese province dismisses 133 police for incompetence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Provincial authorities in southwestern Guizhou
province have dismissed 133 police officials for incompetence,
corruption and other misdeeds, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Among those fired by the end of May was a police officer who had
taken 3,000 yuan (dlrs 363) in bribes and cigarettes. He was
sentenced to two years in prison, the report said.
	   It said 92 other police who had violeted regulations would also
be dismissed.
	   Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security announced it would
organize expert teams to advise some 150,000 police involved in
criminal investigations on how to handle cases according to the
newly revised Criminal Law.
	   The amended law is intended to better protect the rights of
those accused of crimes by police and during the trial process.
Chinese officials acknowledge, however, that compliance with the
law is inconsistent.
	   The training is intended to improve the effectiveness of police
in cracking cases and in handling cases according to the law, the
newspaper China Daily reported.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Hand-picked to be the latest in a long
line of army rulers in Nigeria, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar is a
product of a military that rewards its own and honors unflagging
loyalty.
	   First as defense minister under military leader Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida and later chief of staff for the late Gen. Sani Abacha,
Abubakar, 55, emerges as first among equals in Nigeria's military
establishment.
	   A career serviceman, Abubakar became Nigeria's ninth military
ruler since independence from British colonial rule in 1960.
	   Even his first public words as head of state rang like a
military order.
	   ``All hands must be on deck to move this nation forward. I will
address the nation in due course,'' he said.
	   Promoted from major general to the full rank of general during a
predawn ceremony Tuesday, he was sworn in as head of state to
appoint him Nigeria's new head of state by chief justice Mohammed
Uwais.
	   Effectively the second ranking member of Nigeria's military
Provisional Ruling Council, Abubakar led the charge against the
former deputy leader Gen. Oladipyo Diya, who awaits his execution
after being found guilty in April of plotting a coup against
Abacha.
	   Abubakar oversaw the investigation into the alleged coup
charges.
	   Bespeckled and described as quiet, but friendly, he was often
pictured with Abacha, before the late leader's death of a heart
attack Monday.
	   Born June 13, 1942, in the town of Minna near the capital,
Abuja, and later sent off for schooling from 1957 to 1962 in the
nearby town of Bida.
	   Growing up during the heady buildup toward independence from
British rule in 1960, Abubakar later graduated from secondary
school and went on to study at the Kaduna Technical Institute
before joining the air force.
	   In the mid-1970s, he switched services and joined the army,
which sent him to the United States for formal training. Details of
his U.S. training weren't immediately known.
	   In 1981, Abubakar was appointed commander of a Nigerian
contingent attached to a U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon.
	   Through much of the 1980s, he served on routine domestic
military assignments until joining the Babangida's staff.
	   Abubakar is married and has two sons and three daughters.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A teenager became the first Singaporean to die
of malaria this year, while dengue fever, caused by a different
type of mosquito, also continues to rise, according to reports
Tuesday quoting the Environment Ministry.
	   The 15-year-old who died Saturday had contracted malaria while
visiting family members on the nearby Indonesian island of Batam.
	   One-third of the 27 malaria cases reported in Singapore from May
18 to June 7 were contracted in the Indonesian resort islands of
Batam or Bintan, according to statistics reported by The Straits
Times.
	   The total number of malaria cases this year has reached 147,
seven more than last year, and the teenager's death brought the
death toll to seven since last year. There were no deaths in
1995-96, the newspaper said.
	   Dengue fever cases continue to rise. The total reached 2,079 for
the first five months of this year, up from 1,285 in the same
period last year. Some types of dengue fever can be fatal.

 &UR; German unemployment rate drops for May &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's jobless rate sank to 10.9
percent in May, the first drop below 11 percent since 1996, the
Federal Labor Office said Tuesday.
	   A total 4.2 million people were still unemployed, but 223,400
more people had jobs in May than in April, when the unemployment
rate was 11.1 percent.
	   ``We can't ignore the fact that 4.2 million people in Germany
are still looking for work,'' Labor Office President Bernhard
Jagoda said. ``The positive jobless development in May doesn't
allow us to sit back. It's only a nice intermediate goal which we
achieved.''
	   Compared to May of last year, 58,300 more people had jobs,
making it the first time since 1995 that unemployment figures have
improved on the year.
	   But the labor office, in Nuremberg, attributed the May jobless
decline in part to a usual economic upturn in the spring. When
adjusted for seasonal factors, such as bad weather that hinders
construction work, only 60,000 more people had jobs.
	   The labor office also said Germany had reached a turnaround in
joblessness in the western states, where unemployment dropped to
9.1 percent in May from 9.5 percent in April.
	   Jagoda noted some improvement in the former East Germany, where
unemployment has been twice that of the west. The May rate was 18.1
percent compared to 19.4 percent in April, although eastern states
still struggle in their transition from communism to capitalism.
	   Unemployment protests were planned for Tuesday around the
country, but smaller numbers were expected than in recent months.
Since January, protesters have been rallying outside unemployment
offices on the day labor numbers are announced.
	   Joblessness is the key issue in national elections Sept. 27.
Last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl revealed the unemployment figures
early, saying the main goal of his political platform was ``to give
people who want to work the chance to work.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China wants to continue developing good relations
with Italy, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said Tuesday in talks
with visiting Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
	   Although the two countries have different problems, social
systems and cultural traditions, they have no major conflicts of
interest, Jiang said according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
	   ``We are moving toward a multi-polarized world, and Asia and
Europe are trying to establish a new partnership. So improved
Sino-Italian cooperation not only serves the two nations, it also
is in the interest of world peace, stability and development,''
Jiang said.
	   Many Italian companies have invested in China, and there is
great potential for further economic ties and trade between the two
countries, Jiang said.
	   Scalfaro invited Jiang to visit Italy, and Jiang accepted,
Xinhua said.
	   The two presidents attended a signing ceremony for a joint
statement and a cooperation agreement on science and technology.
	   Scalfaro arrived in Beijing Monday on a six-day state visit.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A 60-year-old man who flew into a rage
during a family gathering shot and killed his wife, daughter and
two neighbors before killing himself, police in the southwestern
city of Opole said Tuesday.
	   Five people, including the man's 18-year-old grandson, were in
critical condition.
	   Investigators were trying to determine a motive.
	   They said that the shooter, identified as Zbigniew Wolczuk,
started firing a Polish-made TT revolver out the window of his home
Monday evening, hitting five neighbors, then turned the gun on
family members inside.
	   Before shooting himself, the man killed also his dog.
	   Police said that the man was a hunter, and had a collection of
guns and rifles, including the TT revolver once commonly used by
police.

Chinese trade minister: impact of Asian crisis ``far from over''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ China's Foreign Trade Minister said
Tuesday the impact of the Asian economic crisis is ``far from
over,'' but insisted China would uphold the value of its currency
despite the regional turbulence.
	   ``The crisis does have inestimable implications for China that
have already resulted in a sharp decrease in exports to Southeast
Asia, Japan and South Korea,'' Shi Guangsheng told a China-European
Union trade seminar.
	   He said currency devaluations in Southeast Asian countries had
weakened China's export competitiveness, but stressed China would
not devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   He said China's policy of maintaining the yuan's value
``effectively prevented further deterioration of the Southeast
Asian economy.''
	   Shi said the Asian economic turmoil would not slow reforms to
open up China's economy. He said China will make ``all efforts'' to
achieve 8 percent economic growth this year, control inflation at
below 3 percent and hold the yuan steady.
	   ``We firmly believe the Asian crisis is only a transient
phenomenon and the affected countries will overcome the economic
hardships through efforts made by themselves and the region, and
with assistance from the world community,'' he added.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with REAX; funeral to be Friday in St. Peter's &QL; 
 &UR; By VICTOR SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican's
former No. 2 official whose cautious diplomacy helped the church
survive in Eastern Europe during Cold War years, died Tuesday at
83.
	   A Rome hospital said the cardinal was hospitalized on Thursday
and died of heart problems.
	   The Italian cardinal served as secretary of state of the Vatican
from 1979 until 1990.
	   When Casaroli retired, Pope John Paul II expressed his gratitude
to the tailor's son from Piacenza in northern Italy and said it was
``providential'' to have worked with him during such ``historic
times.''
	   That was a reference to the changes that brought the church
renewed freedoms in Europe after 40 years of Communist rule in the
former Soviet bloc.
	   John Paul prayed after news of the death.
	   The Polish-born pope and some other churchmen were said to have
had differences with Casaroli's cautious approach to diplomacy,
preferring a more uncompromising stance.
	   But John Paul promoted Casaroli to secretary of state less than
a year after becoming pontiff.
	   Casaroli was considered as consummate diplomat and an extremely
loyal official. He and the pope clearly had reconciled any
differences as the years went on.
	   ``He leaves an unmistakable imprint not only on the life of the
church, but in contemporary history,'' said Giulio Andreotti, a
former Christian Democrat premier and foreign minister whose tenure
concided with much of Casaroli's.
	   ``He had extraordinary intuition about the possibility of
dialogue even with his opponents in the certainty that in the end
the right approaches would have prevailed. Not everybody understood
him at the time,'' Andreotti added. In the Vatican hierarchy, the
secretary of state is the most important post under the pope, a
position equivalent to premier.
	   Casaroli was considered an architect of the Vatican's diplomacy
that aimed to gain at least some freedom for the Roman Catholic
Church after open persecution by Communist nations.
	   The policy toward Eastern Europe, known as the Vatican's
Ostpolitik, was the inspiration of Pope John XXIII after the hard
line taken by Pope Pius XII during the years of Stalinist
repression.
	   Pope Paul VI, who took over in 1963, implemented the policy,
working closely with Casaroli, sending the prelate on frequent
missions to Communist capitals.
	   Casaroli was given credit for the tough language on human rights
and religious liberty in the 1975 Helsinki accords.
	   Beyond the diplomatic field, Casaroli kept the Vatican running
smoothly after the pope was wounded by a Turkish gunman in 1981.
	   The Vatican office of secretary of state said Casaroli was
remembered ``with admiration and gratitude'' for his loyalty to
Christ and the Vatican.
	   The cardinal's body was to be taken to a small church, St.
Stephan's, in Vatican City. The funeral was scheduled for Friday in
St. Peter's Basilica.

Philippine peso strengthens; stocks dip on higher interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Late gains in the Japanese yen lifted
the Philippine peso and other Asian currencies higher against the
U.S. dollar Tuesday, dealers said.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, were pushed down by rising interest rates,
traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 39.470 pesos for the day, down from 39.649
pesos on Monday.
	   Dealers said the peso wasn't heavily affected in early trading
by the doll.
	   Commercial demand for dollars has been slack for several weeks
now. However, dealers say there is relatively heavy pent up demand
for the dollar at the 38.80-38.90 peso level.
	   In stock trading, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index
fell 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,924.49 after losing 27.17
points Monday.
	   Yields of treasury bills rose Monday because of higher inflation
in May. The bellwether 91-day treasury bill increased to 13.953
percent after falling to a 10-month low of 13.798 percent last
week. Increases in longer-term bills were higher.
	   Securities 2000 analyst Erwin Balita said the rise in the
treasury bill rate has renewed worries over the prospects of
property companies, and the possibility that banks may face more
loan collection problems.
	   Sun Hung Kai research head Raul Ruiz said if the increase in
treasury rates proves to be a trend it could spell problems for the
economy.
	   ``If the uptrend in interest rates resumes, borrowers will once
again face rising financing costs, stalling any recovery in
investments and the economy in general,'' Ruiz said.

Asian stock markets close mostly lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,
but share prices in Tokyo rose because of optimism that Japanese
exports would rise in the face of a falling yen.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 235.46 points, or
1.52 percent, to close at 15,530.17. On Monday, the average shed
28.72 points, or 0.19 percent.
	   Exporters such as Sony Corp., Canon Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp.
led the rise in the Nikkei index.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 140.36 yen,
down 0.20 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below its New York
level overnight of 140.71 yen. During Tokyo trading, the dollar
rose as high as 141.11 yen, a level not seen since June 1991.
	   The dollar surrendered early gains amid speculation deputy
finance ministers from the Group of Seven largest economies meeting
later Tuesday in Paris may announce a joint effort to prop up the
Japanese currency.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices slumped as torrential rains forced
trading to be suspended for the morning session on the stock
exchange.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 195.17 points, or 2.3 percent, to 8,391.46. On
Monday, the index had gained 17.16 points.
	   Brokers attributed the slump to worries about the weakening
Japanese currency, which investors feared could lead to a
devaluation of the Chinese yuan.
	   They said investors kept dumping red-chips, which are Hong
Kong-listed companies controlled by Chinese state-owned
enterprises.
	   Thai shares fell 1.3 percent to a new 11-year low amid growing
worries about the health of Thai financial institutions.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.12 points to 308.25
points, its lowest level since 1987.
	   Shares on the Taipei exchange also tumbled as the Taiwan dollar
fell to a new 11-year low of 34.715 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The Taiwan market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 135.64
points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,455.63.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on worries that the continued
depreciation of the Japanese yen may cause another financial crisis
in Asia. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 6.66 points, or
1.9 percent, to 339.22.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher on a
technical rebound following recent sharp losses. The Composite
Index, which tracks share prices of 100 key stocks, closed at
505.64 points, up 7.85 points, or 1.6 percent.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower on selling by foreign
investors, who were unimpressed by banking reforms announced late
Monday. The Straits Times Industrials Index fell 1 percent, or
11.36 points, to 1,117.21.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower for the eighth
consecutive session. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 6.26 points, or
0.2 percent, to 2,098.14.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed slightly lower, pushed down by
by an uptrend in interest rates. The Philippine Stock Exchange
index of 30 selected stocks fell 6.10 points, or 0.3 percent, to
1,924.49.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower, with overseas
investors thought to be hanging back in case the weakened local
currency becomes cheaper still. The All Ordinaries Index fell 18.9
points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,623.9.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed generally lower, but late buying in
state-owned companies pushed the key index into positive territory.
The Composite index rose 1.653 points to 411.072.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea claimed Tuesday that Ethiopia had
delivered on its threat to attack Eritrea again unless it withdrew
from disputed territory.
	   But an Ethiopian official said it was the Eritreans who struck
first at Ethiopian defensive lines south of the border town of Zala
Ambessa, 600 kilometers (372 miles) north of the Ethiopian capital,
Addis Ababa.
	   ``They came to attack in the morning, three times, regrouping
and attacking, regrouping and attacking,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yemane Kidane. He said the Eritreans suffered heavy
casualties.
	   With hostilities between the two Horn of Africa neighbors
escalating, the U.S. government prepared Tuesday to evacuate at
least another 120 of its citizens, along with Germans, Egyptians
and some Ethiopians.
	   Eritrea said the Ethiopians attacked Eritrean positions at dawn
with tanks and artillery in a bid to recapture Zala Ambessa, 105
kilometers (65 miles) southeast of Asmara. Eritrea took the town of
15,000 in a June 2-4 battle.
	   Eritrea on Monday called for direct talks in the presence of
high-level mediators ``so as to ensure a speedy resolution of the
crisis.''
	   President Isaias Afwerki's spokesman said Ethiopia had
effectively declared war on Eritrea and was using the threat of
renewed air strikes to blockade air and seaports.
	   Eritrea claims its forces are within internationally recognized
borders drawn by Italy in the late 19th century. Eritrea, an
Italian colony from 1885 to 1941, was annexed in 1962 by Ethiopia,
against whom it later fought a 30-year war for independence.
	   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi accused
the Eritreans of stalling to consolidate their positions inside
Ethiopia.
	   ``If that's the case _ and it appears to be the case _ then the
opportunities for resolving this problem peacefully could be fast
disappearing,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Eritrea's Isaias indicated pride was an obstacle to resolving
the conflict, underscoring diplomats' concerns that the alliance
between his Eritrean People's Liberation Front and Meles' Tigray
People's Liberation Front to end 17 years of military rule in
Ethiopia in 1991 has soured.
	   ``We might be more concerned about pride, integrity, respect and
all that kind of thing _ trust, confidence. When you lose that, it
becomes a big problem for us in this region _ it's not always money
and resources,'' Isaias told The Associated Press late Monday.
	   ``If we can find a lasting, sustainable solution, then we will
have to think of reversing the process, building confidence again
and trying to work together, but it will take time and it will take
a lot of effort, in my opinion,'' he said.
	   With per-capita annual incomes of less than dlrs 300 a year,
Ethiopia and Eritrea are among the world's poorest countries.
	   African leaders deplored the Horn of Africa conflict at an
Organization of African Unity summit Monday in the West African
nation of Burkina Faso.
	   An Italian envoy at the OAU meeting talked with the foreign
ministers of Ethiopia and Eritrea and asked for a halt to further
bombing raids.
	   ``There's reason to believe that this will be heeded,'' the
Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
	   The envoy, undersecretary of state for foreign affairs Rino
Serri, was expected to visit Asmara and Addis Ababa imminently, it
said.
	   The United States and Rwanda have crafted a four-point peace
proposal that would require Eritrea withdraw to positions it
occupied prior to May 6, when border skirmishes broke out. Ethiopia
has accepted the plan, but Eritrea says it needs more work.
	   Eritrea has vehemently denied Ethiopian charges that its attack
Friday on the Ethiopian town of Mekele provoked Ethiopian air
strikes on Asmara's military airport.
	   Eritrean Air Force Cmdr. Habtezion Hadgu said Ethiopia bombed
the Asmara airport first. ``This is tit for tat _ one to 100,
that's the exchange rate. They hit us, I hit them harder.''
	   Asmara-based diplomats confirmed the commander's version, saying
the airport attack occurred shortly after 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) Friday,
and 50 minutes later two Eritrean warplanes took off and headed
south.

Dozens feared dead in movie theater fire in Indonesia

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dozens of people are feared dead after
fire swept through a crowded movie theater and shopping center in
Palembang on the island of Sumatra, police said Tuesday.
	   Fire broke out in the Megahira shopping center, which contained
the cinema, on Monday night while hundreds were inside watching a
film. Dozens more were lined up to buy movie tickets and others
were in an adjacent amusement center.
	   Police said the exact number of victims was unknown. The fire
was still smoldering Tuesday morning, hampering the rescue efforts.
	   Sixteen bodies had been located in the ashes after one small
area of the building had been searched, police said.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Sardjo Sadjat said 19 people were
injured, 14 of them hospitalized.
	   ``Dozens are believed trapped there, but we have not known what
exactly happened, because no one is able to enter the building so
far,'' he said.
	   The cause of fire, reported to have started on the second floor,
was still not known, Sadjat said.
	   He said the cinema was made up of three theaters, each with a
capacity of about 40.
	   ``I think no one can survive,'' said Djaieni, a fire department
official.
	   The newspaper Republika said most of those who died had been on
the top three floors of the five-story shopping center.
	   It said only nine people were known to have escaped the flames.
They reached safety by climbing down ropes of a window washing
platform on the outside of the building.
	   Three of the nine fell to the ground and were hospitalized with
serious injuries.
	   The newspaper said those who escaped claimed ``many people'' had
been trapped inside after panic broke out.
	   ``On the stairs we trampled over each other to get out,''
Republika quoted one survivor, identified by the single name of
Zukar, as saying.
	   The fire follows several shopping mall blazes that killed
hundreds of people during riots in the capital Jakarta last month.
	   Police say the Jakarta fires had been deliberately lit and most
of the dead had been looters.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Within a year, Iran will have a missile capable

Indonesia prepared to grant special status to East Timor: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Tuesday he's prepared to grant special status within Indonesia to
the disputed territory of East Timor, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported.
	   Giving details of an interview with Habibie, the BBC said the
new Indonesian president also said he's ready to release 10
Timorese fighters jailed by Indonesia, which invaded the former
Portuguese colony.
	   But Habibie made clear that the releases would not include the
jailed East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao, the BBC reported.
	   Indonesia's regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has
committed violent acts in his fight against Indonesian rule in East
Timor. Gusmao is currently serving a 20-year prison term.
	   Other parts of Indonesia to enjoy special status include the
capital Jakarta, the deeply Muslim province of Aceh in north
Sumatra Island and the sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java.
	   The special status they enjoy gives their local government a few
privileges and powers ahead of other parts of the country.
	   Nevertheless, Habibie's comments appear to represent a softening
in policy toward East Timor following the resignation last month of
ex-Present Suharto.
	   Indonesian troops, under Suharto's orders, invaded the former
East Timor in 1975 after the Portuguese withdrew ending about 400
years of colonial rule.
	   In 1976 Suharto declared East Timor the 27th province of
Indonesia _ an act not recognized by the United Nations.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim to
sovereignty. It has been sponsoring talks between Indonesia and
Portugal over the territory's future, but with little progress.
	   Under Suharto, Indonesia steadfastly refused to consider the
granting any special status or any form of local autonomy to East
Timor.
	   Suharto quit office last month and was replaced by Habibie,
raising hopes of a possible change in policy.
	   Last week U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to Habibie
asking that Gusmao be released.
	   Other foreign leaders, including South African President Nelson
Mandela have done the same.
	   Habibie, sworn in on May 21, has already released four other
political prisoners and has signalled that more will be released
soon.
	   Earlier on Tuesday Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Suharto's departure from politics has provided an opportunity for
Portugal, East Timorese separatists and Indonesia to resolve
conflicts over the disputed territory.
	   ``I think now is a good time to resolve our disagreement under
the auspices of the United Nations secretary general who has taken
the initiative over the years,'' Alatas said after a meeting with
Habibie.
	   In the past, Alatas has accused Portugal and the East Timorese
separatists, led by Nobel peace prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta, of
being inflexible.

focusing on European security and Russia's recent financial crisis.
	   Schroeder told reporters Yeltsin emphasized that good
German-Russian relations must continue no matter who is elected to
lead Germany. Schroeder called for strengthening ties by expanding
contacts between entrepreneurs, cultural institutions and the two
nations' regions.
	   Schroeder has been leading Kohl in the polls ahead of the Sept.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen will
become the first Finnish government minister to take parental leave
for the birth of a child, officials said Tuesday.
	   The prime minister's office granted Lipponen six days father's
leave. His wife, Paivi Hertzberg, is due to give birth in several
months. The dates of Lipponen's leave were to be disclosed later.
	   During his leave, Lipponen will receive a paternity allowance
instead of his normal salary, as stipulated in the social security
act.
	   Lipponen, 56, married history teacher Hertzberg, 30, in January
after they lived together for more than a year.
	   Their wedding was the first by an incumbent prime minister since
Finland gained independence in 1917.
	   Finnish fathers are entitled to up to 18 days off from work
after a baby is born. Women are entitled to 105 paid days of
maternity leave.

Chairmen of four ethnic parties send letter to Myanmar government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The chairmen of four ethnic minority
political parties have asked the head of Myanmar's military
government to begin a dialogue with the opposition and convene a
parliament elected in 1990.
	   The call was made in a letter to Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the
ruling State Peace and Development Council, a copy of which was
received by The Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   It follows a resolution calling for the convening of parliament
passed nine days ago by Myanmar's main opposition party, the
National League for Democracy, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung
San Suu Kyi.
	   Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory in the 1990 election,
but the military never allowed those elected to parliament to meet
and take up their duties.
	   The largest party signing the letter to Than Shwe was the Shan
National League for Democracy. The other three parties represent
the Rakhine, Mon and Zomi ethnic groups.
	   Those three parties have officially been dissolved for reasons
that remain unclear, but their representatives elected in 1990
still claim status as members of parliament and regard themselves
as independents.

Rebels kill at least 60 students, abduct eight in western Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels killed at least 60 students and
abducted eight others in an attack at technical training school in
western Uganda, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The rebels from the Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked
Kicwamba Technical College early Monday, locked the students in
dormitories and then set the buildings ablaze, the independent
daily Monitor said.
	   The attack occurred near the district headquarters of Kabarole,
about 316 kilometers (195 miles) west of Kampala.
	   ``The rebels' goal was to abduct all the students to bolster
their manpower,'' Monitor said. ``When some of them tried to resist
the abduction, the rebels set their dormitories on fire.''
	   The daily New Vision said seven people from the training college
were hospitalized after the attack, but it did not say whether they
were all students.
	   The government-owned newspaper quoted military spokesman Maj.
Shaban Bantariza as saying the rebels outnumbered the 40 government
soldiers stationed near the college.
	   The ADF appears to have no known political agenda other than
wanting to oust President Yoweri Museveni, himself a former rebel
leader.
	   The group has its base in the foothills of the Rwanzori
Mountains that former the border between Uganda and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. They stage frequent attacks on Uganda's
western districts along the border. Some of the rebels are members
of former armies or groups defeated by Museveni's National
Resistance Movement in 1986.
	   The government is also fighting rebels from the West Nile Bank
Front in the northwest and from the Lord's Resistance Army in the
north.

China studying U.S. invitation to observe military exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is considering an invitation from the
United States to observe military exercises, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The United States has asked China to attend naval exercises in
Hawaii or mock air force operations in Alaska next month.
	   ``The two sides are still in discussion on this matter,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a routine media
briefing. He did not elaborate on the substance of the talks.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Palmer called the invitation part of
an effort to improve communication between the Chinese and U.S.
militaries and not part of the discussions to prepare for the late
June summit in Beijing between presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang
Zemin.
	   The exercises are part of a series the U.S. military
periodically conducts jointly with other Pacific Rim nations,
Palmer said. He did not know what other nations would be
participating but said China would only attend as observers.
	   At their last meeting in Washington in October, Clinton and
Jiang agreed to procedures to avoid accidents or conflicts between
the U.S. and Chinese navies.
	   Allegations that a Chinese military officer donated money to
Clinton's Democrats and that Beijing may have acquired sensitive
missile information by launching U.S. satellites have raised doubts
about the president's China policy among members of Congress and
marred the atmosphere ahead of the visit.
	   Some members of Congress have called on him to cancel the trip,
the first by a U.S. president in nine years. The House of
Representatives has sought to confine Clinton's dealings with China
by passing amendments that would ban future launches and restrict
technology transfer to China.
	   Although Trent Lott, leader of the Senate's Republican majority,
has not endorsed the restrictions, on Monday he called the Clinton
administration's explanations of possible satellite technology
transfers inadequate.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu reiterated Tuesday that China did
not acquire any sensitive technology through its low-cost,
11-year-old commercial satellite launching program.
	   ``Such cooperation (with foreign companies) is in conformity
with international practices of formal business conduct,'' Zhu
said. ``There's no such problem of acquisition of technology during
the launching of satellites.''

Cash shortage could force Russia to abandon Mir this fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may have to discard the Mir space station a
year ahead of schedule and send it crashing back to Earth this fall
unless the cash-strapped government comes up with more money,
officials said Tuesday.
	   ``We can't work with our bills unpaid,'' said Yuri Semyonov,
head of the state-run RKK Energia corporation, which built Mir and
has been running it since it was put in orbit in early 1986.
	   Semyonov said the government still owes Energia 440 million
rubles (dlrs 70 million) for station operations last year and
hasn't yet paid any bills this year, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The money shortage already threatens to stall the arrival of the
station's next crew, currently scheduled to blast off in August, he
said. If the trouble continues, space officials may decide to bring
down the station by the end of the year.
	   Russian space officials had planned to keep the 12-year-old Mir
flying until the end of 1999, after the first parts of the
international space station were placed in orbit.
	   Andrew Thomas, the last of seven American astronauts to live on
Mir, left the station on Monday. Following his departure, Russia
had hoped to earn more cash by hosting French and Slovak
astronauts, but that cooperation program is now in doubt, Semyonov
said.
	   Ironically, discarding Mir would cost more in the short run than
leaving it in orbit, the officials said. To control the station's
descent to Earth, Russia would have to launch several cargo ships
over a short period to dock with the station and direct it into
lower orbits.
	   ``Now we don't know what to do,'' Semyonov said.
	   According to an earlier plan, several Progress cargo ships,
docked one at a time, would fire their engines to gradually lower
the Mir's orbit from 400 kilometers (250 miles) now to 120
kilometers (75 miles), before it burns up in the atmosphere. A few
large fragments would be aimed to fall into the ocean.
	   If Mir's orbit isn't controlled, the 130-ton station will fall
back to Earth within two years on its own and pieces could land in
populated areas, space officials warned.
	   The government's cash shortage has also jeopardized Russia's
contribution to the new international space station and caused
several delays in the program already.
	   On Monday, Anatoly Kiselyov, director of the Khrunichev Company,
said the government has not paid the 1.3 billion rubles (dlrs 211
million) needed to prepare the critical service module for launch.
The service module contains the living quarters for the station's
crew.
	   The station's components are to be assembled in orbit and, if
everything goes as planned, the first American-led crew is expected
to board the station in July 1999, more than a year later than
originally planned.
	   The dlrs 21 billion space station is a joint project of Russia,
the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan.

Yugoslavia assails renewed Kosovo sanctions

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Belgrade criticizing sanctions, Bildt
comments on West's inaction; deletes outdated material, CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia on Tuesday denounced new
international sanctions over its offensive in Kosovo, where a
western strip of the separatist province has been turned into a war
zone of burned houses and deserted villages.
	   In a statement issued on the official Tanjug news agency,
Yugoslav officials called the imposition of sanctions a ``strange
and unreasonable decision.''
	   The comment came in response to decisions made by the European
Union and the United States within hours of each other on Monday,
banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets abroad.
	   Official Belgrade also was offended that the punishment is only
against Serbia. Its lone partner in the Yugoslav federation,
Montenegro, is exempted because of its pro-Western leadership.
	   ``This is the first case that EU has made a decision about a
sovereign state that applies to only one of its federal units,''
the Tanjug commentary said.
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, had welcomed the
new sanctions on Monday but said they were only a ``small step''
compared to the situation on the ground.
	   There were no immediate reports of new clashes Tuesday between
the Serbs and ethnic Albanian militants fighting for Kosovo's
independence from Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb forces on Monday attacked
seven southwestern villages near the Albanian border with artillery
and helicopter gunships. The Serbs, meanwhile, accused the Kosovo
Liberation Army of launching a new attack on Yugoslav army forces
near the border that killed one soldier and injured three.
	   The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased the
international outcry for Serbia to stop using its police and army
against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population. NATO is considering military intervention.
	   Carl Bildt, formerly the European Union's high representative in
Bosnia and still an influential figure regarding policy on former
Yugoslavia, harshly criticized Western officials in a commentary
published Tuesday for being indecisive and slow. He warned of a
``huge humanitarian and political disaster'' if swift actions
aren't taken.
	   He urged that troops be deployed to northern Albania to close
the border, that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Kosovo and threaten
air strikes against remaining Serb forces, and that the Kosovo
Liberation Army's sponsors in Europe and the United States be
pressured to get the KLA to halt military operations.
	   ``Kosovo is a testing ground,'' Bildt wrote in the Financial
Times of London. ``Here we will see if the lessons of the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia have been learned. So far, there are only faint
signs that this has been the case.''
	   More than 250 people are said to have died in Kosovo since March
1 in escalating clashes between government forces and the KLA.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Within a year, Iran will have a missile capable
of reaching Israel _ unless Russian aid for the Iranian nuclear
program stops, an Israeli defense source said Tuesday.
	   Western experts believe that Iran is making strenuous efforts to
develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of
delivering them.
	   At a recent high-level meeting, Israeli defense officials warned
that a prototype for Iran's Shihab-3 missile, with a range of 1,300
kilometers (1,625 miles), will be ready for launching in about a
year if Russia continues to supply missile technology to Teheran,
the source said.
	   ``Without Russian knowhow, the Shihab-3 will never take off,''
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Philippine car sales fall nearly 50 percent in first five months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines plunged nearly 50 percent in the first five months of
the year to 17,111 from the same period last year, an industry
association said Tuesday.
	   The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
attributed the sharp decline to higher prices resulting from the
peso's depreciation, larger down payment requirements, and stricter
financing rules.
	   The association said sales in May totaled only 2,951 cars, down
4 percent from April's 3,075 and 55 percent less than the 6,603
sold in the same month last year.
	   Honda Cars Philippines Inc., the local unit of the Japanese car
maker, led all other car assemblers, capturing nearly 26 percent of
the market.
	   Honda and other Japanese car makers _ Toyota, Mitsubishi and
Nissan _ together hold about 78 percent of the Philippine passenger
car market.

Albanian weapons depots: targets of looters and smugglers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian soldiers opened fire and threw
hand grenades against a group of unidentified men who tried to loot
two army depots in northern Albania on Sunday, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   In another incident, about 280 anti-tank missiles were stolen in
the town of Lezha, and police arrested two officers allegedly
involved in the robbery, local media reported Tuesday.
	   The armed clash started at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Sunday when a
group of unidentified men attacked the depots in the villages of
Gjegjan and Gojan, 75 kilometers (47 miles) north of the capital
Tirana in the Fushe-Arrez area.
	   ``We were informed about the attack, and we sent more troops to
the area,'' said Albert Mullai, spokesman for the Defense Ministry.
	   He said hand grenades were used to keep the attackers away from
the depots. No one was wounded and police were still searching for
those who attacked.
	   On Sunday, few hours after the attack, Prime Minister Fatos Nano
told his National Security Council he had reports of more planned
attacks on army depots.
	   Albanian officials are concerned that while ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo are demanding more weapons to resist the Serb offensive,
Albania's army depots again have become targets of looters and
smugglers.
	   They have warned the Albanians that the areas of 70 depots were
mined last year after a million guns were looted by angry
protesters who lost their savings in collapsed pyramid schemes.
	   ``Any attempt to attack those depots would threaten the life of
about 35,000 people'' said Nano.
	   Sources at the Defense Ministry said that the guards of the army
depots have been orders to shoot anyone who tries to break in.

Thai Defense Ministry struggling with huge foreign debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the Thai economy battered on all
fronts, the country's Defense Ministry is battling to pay off
millions of dollars in foreign debt for weapons purchases, a
ministry official said Tuesday.
	   The ministry owes between 4 billion and 5 billion baht (dlrs 95
million and dlrs 120 million) for imported weapons, and because of
budget cuts, doesn't have the means to pay, said the official who
spoke only condition of anonymity.
	   High-ranking Defense Ministry officials will meet with Finance
Ministry officials on Wednesday to try and devise a strategy for
solvency.
	   Lenders have already agreed to roll over between and 5 billion
and 10 billion baht (dlrs 120 million and 240 million) in debt held
by the ministry, The Bangkok Post reported.
	   Thailand is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in
decades, and that has forced the military to accept deep budget
cuts.
	   In the past, legislators feared asking the armed forces to scale
back expenditures because of its history of launching coup d'etats.
Thailand has had more than a dozen coups since the end of World War
II.
	   But the military has accepted the cuts without protest in light
of the economic crisis.
	   The budget difficulties of the armed forces were highlighted
earlier this year when the Thai government asked the United States
to let it out of a dlrs 392 million contract to buy eight F-18 jet
fighters because it could not afford to purchase them.
	   The United States agreed as long as Thailand could find another
buyer for the planes. So far, the Thais have been unable to do so.

Remains of U.S. airmen finally recovered from once-closed Albania
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The 10 U.S. airmen aboard the B-24
Liberator were returning to their base in Italy after a bombing
raid when storms forced the plane to go south _ and closer to the
range of German gunners.
	   Soon, the sky was filled with fire from anti-aircraft guns. The
burning plane spun out of control and plowed into an Albanian
village. It was Aug. 10, 1944.
	   Last week, a U.S. military unit that searches for missing
American servicemen who are presumed dead finally returned to bring
the remains home. It was the first such mission for the U.S.
military in Albania.
	   ``It's incredible after all these years to come upon the site
and even see bits of the plane still there,'' said David Roath, the
unit's director from his headquarters in Landstuhl, Germany.
	   The end of the Cold War opened up vast new areas for Roath's
team. Albania, almost entirely closed to the outside world for
decades, represents an area of great potential for military
forensic investigators.
	   ``There could be other sites out around Albania with U.S.
military remains. At this point, we just don't know,'' said Roath.
``We hope that this mission will open other leads.''
	   The ill-fated plane was returning to Brindisi, Italy, after a
bombing run over Romania when it came under attack. The shattered
B-24 crashed into a home in the village of Goraj, 45 miles (70
kilometers) south of the capital Tirana, killing 13 people.
	   The tail gunner was blasted out of the plane. Four crew members
parachuted and were taken prisoner by the Germans. Three airmen
died as the plane was devoured by fire.
	   The two remaining airmen jumped clear of the plane but died of
burns and were carefully buried by Albanian villagers. Finding
their graves was the goal of Roath's unit.
	   The search was spearheaded by the brother of one of the men lost
in the crash. Since the early 1990s, James McConnon of Wynnewood,
Pennsylvania, has worked with an Albanian researcher to locate the
mountain village.
	   McConnon, who was raised with his brother in Pittsburgh,
accompanied the forensics team to Albania, although it is still
uncertain whether his late brother, 2nd Lt. John Steel McConnon,
was one of the two men buried.
	   The body in one grave had been placed in Muslim tradition with
the head facing toward the holy city of Mecca. Both graves were
tended to with care.
	   ``If that was his grave I saw, then he was buried in a beautiful
spot and his grave was lovingly cared for more than 50 years,''
said McConnon. ``You can't ask for more than that.''
	   Parts of the plane were used by villagers, who lived in a
desperately poor region. A wing was used to build part of an
outhouse, and parts of the fuselage became shelters for animals.
	   The remains were transported to Germany and will be sent to the
U.S. military identification lab in Hawaii to officially confirm
the identities.
	   ``It's a great feeling to be able to return the remains to the
family,'' said Roath. ``That's our entire goal.''
	   There are about 78,000 U.S. military personnel who fought in
World War II who are still missing. Most are believe to have
perished at sea, said Roath. It's unclear how many remains may be
found across Eastern Europe.
	   Roath's unit is scheduled for missions later this year to
Lithuania and Poland.
	   ``But Albania is probably the place where we have the least
information to begin possible searches,'' said Roath. ``There could
definitely be cases out there that we won't know about until
someone _ a villager or someone _ comes forward with the story.''

Report: Russian missiles already on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cyprus refusing to respond. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian air defense missiles have been delivered
to Cyprus despite vows by Turkey to stop the weapons reaching the
island, a newspaper reported on Tuesday.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry refused to confirm or deny the
report by the respected Segodnya daily.
	   While declining to comment on whether the S-300 missiles were
already on Cyprus, ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin
reiterated the long-held Russian argument that the missiles would
threaten no one.
	   ``We have been giving repeated explanations that the missiles
are a defensive weapon,'' Nesterushkin said in a telephone
interview. ``The presence of weapons on the island is the outcome
of the unsettled conflict between the Turkish and Greek population
on the island.''
	   Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms trading monopoly denied that the
delivery had taken place and said the missiles will be sent to
Cyprus in mid-August as earlier planned, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   In Nicosia, government spokesman Christos Stylianides refused to
comment on the newspaper report.
	   The S-300, capable of shooting down aircraft and missiles, is a
Russian equivalent of the U.S. Patriot missiles which gained fame
during the Gulf War.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the missiles'
deployment.
	   Greece has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military conflict between
two NATO allies.
	   Turkey maintains some 30,000 troops on Cyprus since it invaded
the island in 1974, following a failed coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Cyprus has said it is ready to cancel the dlrs 200 million
missile deal if there is substantial progress toward the
reunification of the island and if Turkey accepts its proposal for
demilitarization.
	   The latest attempt to restart talks to reunify the Mediterranean
island by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed earlier last month.

Major Chinese newspapers announce new media groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Mirroring trends in other industries, two of
China's state-run newspapers have announced they are setting up
media conglomerates, state media reported Tuesday.
	   The government is encouraging formation of such corporate groups
in a wide range of industries as part of its effort to make
state-ownedups enterprises profitable.
	   Newspapers, which are owned and controlled by the government,
are following suit.
	   The Guangming Daily is a Beijing-based Communist Party
enterprise that publishes newspapers, magazines and books and also
has various information industry businesses. The Economic Daily,
founded in 1983, likewise publishes newspapers and magazines
focused on business and financial news, the Beijing Youth Daily
reported.
	   Last month, another newspaper, the Southern Daily, based in
southern Guangdong province across the border from Hong Kong,
announced it was setting up a conglomerate.
	   The first newspaper to do so, the Guangzhou Daily, based in the
Guangdong provincial capital Guangzhou, set up its media group in
1995.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,
but share prices in Tokyo rose on optimism that Japanese exports
would rise in the face of a falling yen. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average rose 235.46 points, or 1.52 percent, to close at
15,530.17. Exporters such as Sony Corp., Canon Inc. and Toyota
Motor Corp. led the rise in the Nikkei index. In Hong Kong, share
prices slumped as torrential rains forced trading to be suspended
for the morning session on the stock exchange. The Hang Seng Index,
the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, fell 195.17
points, or 2.3 percent, to 8,391.46. Brokers attributed the slump
to worries about the weakening Japanese currency, which investors
feared could lead to a devaluation of the Chinese yuan. They said
investors kept dumping red-chips, which are Hong Kong-listed
companies controlled by Chinese state-owned enterprises. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a potent sign of Asia's economic
crisis, Thailand's largest conglomerate _ which has more
investments in China than any other firm in the world _ has
announced a major restructuring. Charoen Pokphand Group revealed
late Monday it would consolidate 12 core agribusiness companies
into a single entity listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. The
move reflects the start of a back-to-basics strategy by a company
that over 70 years has became an Asian business empire and even
surfaced in the campaign contribution scandal that touched U.S.
President Bill Clinton. CP Group expanded during the Asian economic
boom into everything from chicken and shrimp farming to beer,
motorcycles and pharmaceuticals. Founded by Chinese immigrants to
Thailand, it is has plowed money back into the old country and is
the No. 1 investor in China in terms of projects. But analysts say
the expansion left the company overextended and heavily in debt
once the Asian boom went bust last year. (THAILAND-CP STRUGGLES)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Pressure mounted on the government Tuesday to
stimulate Hong Kong's troubled economy, with some legislators
threatening to stop cooperating with the authorities if it turns
down their economic proposals. The warning came ahead of Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang's scheduled meeting later Tuesday with
political party leaders. ``We would withhold cooperation with the
government to force them to the negotiation table,'' said Lee
Cheuk-yan of the populist Frontier goup. ``We want to send the
government a message that there will be a constitutional crisis if
it ignore our demands.'' Impatient with the government, seven
political parties from across the political spectrum agreed at a
rare summit last week on a six-measure stimulus package, which
includes cuts in taxes and government fees and a refund of prepaid
taxes to boost consumer spending spending. (HONG KONG-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Labor officials ordered about 600
striking Philippine Airlines pilots to return to work Tuesday,
warning they would authorize the troubled airline to hire
replacements if the strike continues. The pilots' union, however,
refused the labor department's attempts to formally deliver the
back-to-work order and said it would continue the walkout. PAL
President Jose Antonio Garcia said the airline agreed to take the
strikers back if they complied with the new Tuesday deadline. On
Sunday it had fired all the striking pilots, calling their action
illegal. Garcia said the 4-day-old strike caused several potential
foreign buyers of the airline, including Northwest Airlines, to
break off talks and could force the airline to shut down.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will issue 50 billion baht
(dlrs 1.2 billion) in one-year bonds this week to help replenish
the country's bank rescue fund, a senior ministry official said
Tuesday. The bonds will be issued via the central bank to Thai
financial institutions and will carry a coupon rate of 12.5
percent, said Kamol Juntima, ministry comptroller-general. They are
the first installment of a planned 500 billion baht (dlrs 12
billion) domestic bond offering to help refinance the debts of the
Financial Institutions Development Fund. The fund is an arm of the
Bank of Thailand responsible for bailing out troubled financial
institutions reeling under bad debts and the Asian currency crisis.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Scrambling to avoid a power vacuum in the
wake of Gen. Sani Abacha's unexpected death, the ruling military
moved quickly Tuesday to appoint another general as Nigeria's new
head of state. Abdulsalam Abubakar, wearing a beret and army green,
was sworn into office during a predawn ceremony, becoming the ninth
military leader in oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.
Although the immediate question of succession was answered, many
Nigerians were waiting to see if Abubakar would push forward with
some form of political transition to democratic rule this year.
Abacha in the final months of his life appeared again to be moving
away from his pledge to hand power over to an elected civilian
government. (NIGERIA-ABACHA)
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia kept its promise Tuesday to
attack if Eritrea failed to withdraw its troops, launching a fresh
offensive to recapture a town on the border of the former allies.
The Ethiopian army attacked Eritrean positions in a bid to take
Zala Ambessa, 100 kilometers (65 miles) southeast of Asmara, the
Eritrean government said. Eritrea captured the town earlier this
month. The two East African nations are engaged in a battle over
their border. Ethiopia is resisting its smaller neighbor's attempts
to control territory it says is wrongly held by Ethiopia. The
Eritrean government on Monday called for direct talks between the
two countries in the presence of high-level mediators to find ``a
speedy resolution of the crisis.'' (ERITREA-ETHIOPIA)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
ministers met with German officials Tuesday on how to prevent
escalating violence in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The talks
also focused on Russia's market collapse last month following an
oil-price drop. But Yeltsin and other Russian officials have
insisted publicly that they are not looking for any new aid or
funding. The two-day talks, the first in a series of periodic
German-Russian consultations agreed to by Yeltsin and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl last year, also focused on nuclear tests in Pakistan
and India and on whether to jointly build a military transport
plane. (GERMANY-RUSSIA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung is making
a triumphant return visit to the country that received him years
ago when he was down and out, barely escaping execution for his
dissident views in his native land. Almost 18 years ago, Kim was
under death sentence from the military government that ruled South
Korea at the time. The outgoing Carter and incoming Reagan
administrations interceded to save his life. On Tuesday night, Kim

	   PARIS (AP) _ Criticism of striking French pilots mounted Tuesday
as their walkout entered its ninth day, and Air France arranged to
transport soccer teams on special flights for the World Cup. No new
talks have been planned between Air France management and the
pilots, who are increasingly seen as the spoilers of French efforts
to stage the World Cup. Air France is the official carrier of the
World Cup, which opens Wednesday, and the airline has arranged 110
special flights to transport the teams to their destinations
throughout the tournament. (FRANCE-AIR FRANCE-STRIKE)

Yeltsin, Kohl meet on Russia's financial troubles, Kosovo

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
Tuesday he was counting on ``personal support'' from Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, not direct aid, to help Russia recover from its latest
financial market turbulence.
	   Talks between the two leaders, which Kohl described as ``very
open,'' also touched on issues ranging from trade and security to
the crisis in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   At a joint news conference, Kohl quoted Yeltsin as saying he
would use his influence with Serbia to put a stop to the escalating
violence in the separatist region. Serbia and Russia are
traditional allies.
	   ``Everything has to be done to stop the bloodshed as soon as
possible,'' Kohl said.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was also seeking Russian
backing for the European Union's decision Monday to punish Serbia
with economic sanctions for its attacks on villages in Kosovo.
	   But asked Monday night whether Moscow would support the ban on
investment in Serbia and a freeze of its foreign assets, Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said: ``No, I don't think so.''
	   Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembski said Russia and other
European nations need to address the Kosovo conflict ``as a team''
to prevent other nations from being drawn into the fighting.
	   The main focus of the two-day talks, however, was last month's
market collapse in Russia following an oil-price drop. The crisis
had raised speculation that Germany, Russia's most important
trading partner outside the former Soviet Union, might offer
financial assistance, although Russian officials have insisted
publicly that they are not looking for any new aid.
	   Asked at the news conference whether German aid was discussed,
Yeltsin said it was most important to obtain ``personal support
from Helmut Kohl as a great political figure'' to support Russia's
reform policies.
	   ``On this basis, international investors won't leave our
country,'' he added.
	   Kohl said Germany plans to continue its support for Russia
within an international framework, in particular with the
International Monetary Fund.
	   An IMF official in Washington, Stanley Fischer, said that the
organization didn't see any immediate reason to boost an existing
dlrs 9.2 billion credit arrangement with Russia.
	   The talks were the first in a series of periodic German-Russian
consultations agreed to by Yeltsin and Kohl last year, when Kohl
helped negotiate Russia's acquiescence to the eastward expansion of
the NATO military alliance.
	   Ministers of finance, economics, foreign affairs, defense and
nuclear energy met separately with their counterparts on a broad
range of security and trade issues. Yeltsin also met with German
opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Shortly after arriving in Bonn, Russian and German ministers
signed two agreements dealing with cooperation in the nuclear power
industry.
	   Cooperation in the defense industry also was on the agenda.
Ukraine has been trying to enlist Germany, Russia and France to
help build a new Ukrainian version of the Antonov An-70 aircraft.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About 600 striking Philippine
Airlines pilots defied a government deadline to return to work
Tuesday despite a warning that labor officials would allow the
airline to hire replacements.
	   ``Nobody has walked in,'' an airline spokesman said nearly an
hour after the 6 p.m. deadline set by the labor department lapsed.
	   The pilots' union refused the labor department's attempts to
formally deliver the back-to-work order and said it would continue
its walkout.
	   PAL president Jose Antonio Garcia said the cash-strapped airline
agreed to take the strikers back if they complied with the Tuesday
deadline. On Sunday it had fired all the striking pilots, calling
their action illegal.
	   Garcia said the 4-day-old strike caused several potential
foreign buyers of the airline, including Northwest Airlines, to
break off talks and could force the airline to shut down.
	   ``Closing PAL is an option. If there are no pilots and
operations, what work can we do?'' Garcia said to reporters after
attending an emergency meeting of PAL's board of directors called
to discuss the strike.
	   The union is protesting a new management policy of ordering
pilots to retire who have reached 20 years of service or flown
20,000 hours, regardless of age. The policy puts about 200 pilots
in danger of forced retirement, the union said.
	   PAL, however, said it was not a unilateral management policy but
a provision in a collective bargaining agreement signed by airline
and union officials.
	   The airline earlier announced plans to reduce staff, slash costs
and cut flights to survive a financial crisis.
	   The strike began Friday, forcing cancellations of most
international and domestic flights and affecting thousands of
passengers.
	   PAL says the strike is causing daily losses of 150 million to
200 million pesos (dlrs 3.8 million to 5.1 million) in revenue,
pushing it ``closer to the brink of insolvency.''
	   President Fidel Ramos urged both sides to follow the labor
department's order and resume negotiations.
	   PAL said Monday it lost 8 billion pesos (dlrs 205 million) in
the last fiscal year _ three times more than the previous year.
	   PAL tried to recover from its spiraling losses with an ambitious
dlrs 4 billion modernization program in 1996, ordering 36 new
aircraft. But Asia's currency crisis forced it to delay many of the
orders.
	   PAL, Asia's first airline, is controlled by Chinese Filipino
tycoon Lucio Tan. It had been completely owned by the Philippine
government from 1941 until it was partly sold in 1992.

World Cup: South Korean chief organizer hopeful about joint team,
</HEADLINE>
North role in 2002 &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES material from Seoul-dated
Sports-Soccer-2002-World Cup &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The chief South Korean organizer of the 2002 World
Cup said Tuesday he was optimistic that a host role for North Korea
and a joint team for the tournament could be worked out.
	   Park Seh-jik, chairman of the Korean Organizing Committee, said
a recent lessening of tensions between the capitalist south and
communist north on the divided peninsula have improved the chances
of agreement on World Cup involvement.
	   Park was president of the organizing committee for the 1988
Olympics in Seoul and was involved in years of frustrating and
ultimately unsuccessful efforts to meet North Korean demands to
stage some part of the Summer Games. He said things have changed
drastically, even though the two nations remain technically at war.
	   ``The situations in 1988 and now are quite different,'' Park
said. ``The tensions are very much reduced. We are looking for a
positive answer from North Korea.''
	   A high-ranking North Korean soccer official, meanwhile, said in
a published interview that his country could consider sharing World
Cup matches.
	   ``We are not in a stage to discuss details yet, but in
principle, it is very desirable to form a single team and for North
Korea to hold some games,'' Choi Pyong Joo, vice president of North
Korea's soccer association, said in an interview with South Korea's
Sports Seoul newspaper.
	   In Seoul, officials of the Korean Football Association said they
had received government approval to discuss sharing some matches in
2002 with the north and forming a unified team. They said a letter
would be sent soon to Pyongyang asking for a meeting where
negotiations could begin.
	   Such contact also could take up the issue of promoting regular
sports exchanges between the two sides, they said.
	   Choi and Park were both in Paris a day before the start of the
World Cup, where South Korea is playing for the fourth straight
tournament. North Korea did not qualify.
	   At a news conference Saturday, Joao Havelange, the outgoing
president of the international soccer federation FIFA, said he
would like to see a joint Korean team and some matches of the 2002
tournament staged in Pyongyang's 100,000-seat stadium. A joint
Korean team played in the last under-16 world championships in
Portugal and FIFA said it was ready to follow that path again.
	   ``There is precedence for that, although, of course, there is a
huge difference between youth soccer championships and the World
Cup,'' federation spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``That is strictly a
matter for the two national (soccer) associations to decide.''
	   The 2002 World Cup already has to deal with logistical problems,
since it's being shared by South Korea and Japan _ the first time
the world's biggest single sports event will be split between
countries.
	   South Korea will play host to half the games, 32 in all, and any
games in Pyongyang would come from that batch.
	   Because of the existing limits, Park said, it was imperative
that any negotiations with the north not drag out as they did a
decade ago.
	   ``It is very complicated, so the sooner, the better,'' he said.
	   At the same time, Park said, there was enough time to work out
details of the north's role and bring facilities in the
impoverished country up to international standards.
	   ``We still have a full five years, so any complications could be
solved,'' he said.

China calls Kosovo Yugoslavia's problem but urges dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ While calling the fighting between Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian separatists in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province a
domestic matter, China urged both sides Tuesday to negotiate a
settlement.
	   ``The Kosovo problem is the internal affair of Yugoslavia. It
should be addressed by relevant authorities in Yugoslavia through
political means,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
said.
	   Zhu said efforts by Albanians in Kosovo to open a dialogue with
the government were in the best interests of stability and should
be supported by the international community.
	   After E.U. diplomats got a glimpse of the devastation over the
weekend, the United States and European Union both tightened
sanctions against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia Monday, freezing its
assets and banning investments.
	   China has steadfastly resisted imposing sanctions on other
countries. As one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, China sought to limit the body's response to punishing
Yugoslavia, a Cold War ally, during its earlier conflicts with the
former provinces of Croatia and Bosnia.

Report: Russian missiles already on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cyprus refusing to respond. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian air defense missiles have been delivered
to Cyprus despite vows by Turkey to stop the weapons reaching the
island, a newspaper reported on Tuesday.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry refused to confirm or deny the
report by the respected Segodnya daily.
	   While declining to comment on whether the S-300 missiles were
already on Cyprus, ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin
reiterated the long-held Russian argument that the missiles would
threaten no one.
	   ``We have been giving repeated explanations that the missiles
are a defensive weapon,'' Nesterushkin said in a telephone
interview. ``The presence of weapons on the island is the outcome
of the unsettled conflict between the Turkish and Greek population
on the island.''
	   Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms trading monopoly denied that the
delivery had taken place and said the missiles will be sent to
Cyprus in mid-August as earlier planned, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   In Nicosia, government spokesman Christos Stylianides refused to
comment on the newspaper report.
	   The S-300, capable of shooting down aircraft and missiles, is a
Russian equivalent of the U.S. Patriot missiles which gained fame
during the Gulf War.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the missiles'
deployment.
	   Greece has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military conflict between
two NATO allies.
	   Turkey maintains some 30,000 troops on Cyprus since it invaded
the island in 1974, following a failed coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Cyprus has said it is ready to cancel the dlrs 200 million
missile deal if there is substantial progress toward the
reunification of the island and if Turkey accepts its proposal for
demilitarization.
	   The latest attempt to restart talks to reunify the Mediterranean
island by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed earlier last month.

Taiwan to inaugurate electronic warfare force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Seeking to plug a hole in its defenses,
Taiwan's air force will inaugurate a flight wing dedicated to
electronic warfare in July, a senior officer said Tuesday.
	   Tang Ting, the air force's deputy chief of planning announced
the formation of the wing at a weekly Defense Ministry news
conference, but provided no other details.
	   The move follows repeated public fretting by the military over
what it says is China's advantage in using electromagnetic
interference to scramble missile targeting and communications
between fighting units.
	   Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling told legislators last month
that China could disrupt Taiwan's communications during a conflict
and win control of the electronic battlefield over the Taiwan
Strait.
	   Major Chinese military units are capable of electronic
surveillance and interference, while its air force has more than 10
electronic warfare planes and navy vessels have also been outfitted
for such missions, Chiang said.
	   Though they've been united for just four of the last 100 years,
China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and threatens to use its
massive military to bring the island back into the fold.
	   The United Evening News reported the air force this year
received a second Lockheed C-130H converted to C-130HE electronic
warfare specifications. Another of the converted planes is likely
to be added to the wing, the paper said.
	   It said the Defense Ministry's Chungshan Institute of Science
and Technology carried out the conversions.
	   Newspapers have also reported Taiwan plans to further upgrade
the planes' signal interception and jamming capabilities.
	   Those reports said the air force's four Grumman E-2T Hawkeye
early-warning planes will also be more closely linked to military
information networks.
	   Aged RF-104 Starfighter reconnaissance planes have also been
replaced by RF-5Es, former jet fighters converted by the air force.

Communist move to impeach Yeltsin face hurdles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 4-5 with lawmaker's comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist-backed impeachment motion against
President Boris Yeltsin hit a snag on Tuesday when lawmakers failed
to agree on setting up a panel to draw up formal charges.
	   The parliament's lower house, the State Duma, must create a
commission made up of representatives of all factions to prepare an
indictment. The Duma will then have to vote by a two-thirds
majority to launch impeachment proceedings.
	   When the Communists called for the commission's creation
Tuesday, the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction said it
didn't want to take part, bringing the move to a grinding halt.
	   The impeachment motion ``is an absolutely unrealistic and
pointless affair,'' said deputy head of the liberal Yabloko faction
Sergei Ivanenko.
	   He added that the Communists have initiated the motion to
``clear themselves in the eyes of the voters'' after having caved
in to Yeltsin this spring by approving his nominee for prime
minister, Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Previous impeachment motions against Yeltsin have fizzled
without reaching the floor. Russia's Constitution gives the
president the upper hand in confrontations with parliament.
	   Even if the Duma finally votes to start the impeachment
proceedings, the motion will then go to the upper chamber
consisting of regional officials many of whom are loyal to Yeltsin.
The charges will also have to win confirmation from both
Constitutional and Supreme courts _ a highly unlikely development.
	   The Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of a range
of transgressions, including instigating the Soviet collapse,
launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining the country's
economy.
	   The accusations have been drafted ``on a very unsatisfactory
level, and have no substantiating points in the legal sense,''
Ivanenko said.

Murdered nurse's brother donates most money from convicted nurses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with further details and quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The brother of an Australian nurse
murdered in Saudi Arabia donated on Tuesday U.S. dlrs 620,000
(Australian dollars 1.035 million) of the money he received to
waive the death penalty for her accused killers.
	   Frank Gilford handed over a check to the Adelaide Women's and
Children's Hospital to help expand and refurbish a children's day
surgery unit which will treat 7,000 children a year.
	   The unit will be dedicated to Yvonne Gilford, although the final
name is yet to be decided.
	   Gilford received U.S. dlrs 1 million (Australian dollars 1.7
million) compensation for waiving his right to call for the death
penalty for British nurse Deborah Parry, who was convicted by a
Saudi court of the murder.
	   Yvonne Gifford was killed at a hospital in Saudi Arabia in
December 1996.
	   A second British nurse, Lucille McLauchlan, was convicted of
being an accessory to the murder and was sentenced to eight years
jail and 500 lashes.
	   Parry and McLauchlan were released last month after the Saudi
King Fahd commuted their sentences to the 17 months already served
in prison.
	   Gilford will keep about U.S. dlrs 30,000 (Australian dollars
50,000) of the payout, about U.S. dlrs 5,400 (Australian dollars
9,000) will go to his mother and the rest will pay legal fees.
	   ``As a nurse, Yvonne cared for people, especially children, for
almost all of her life,'' Gilford said at the presentation
ceremony. ``She would be pleased, as I am, that some good has come
from her terrible murder.''
	   He said he hoped the donation towards the unit would help many
people to live comfortably.
	   Gilford's lawyer Michael Abbott said Gilford's only wish during
the 18-months murder trial had been to see the establishment of a
memorial to his sister.

Belgian steel maker in alliance talks with Thyssen Krupp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Shares in the Belgian steelmaker
Cockerill Sambre SA rose sharply in early trading Tuesday following
reports that Germany's Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG was considering a
takeover.
	   Newspapers in Germany and Belgium reported Thyssen Krupp was
mulling a takeover bid for Cockerill, whose main shareholder is the
government of Belgium's southern Wallonia region.
	   Cockerill spokesman Christophe Weerts confirmed talks had taken
place on a possible alliance with Thyssen Krupp, Europe's largest
steel producer. But he declined to say whether Cockerill would
accept a takeover bid.
	   Weerts said Cockerill, which has been seeking a partner for
years, had also held alliance talks with other steelmakers.
	   Other companies that have been considered potential partners of
Cockerill are Arbed SA of Luxembourg, Usinor SA of France,
Hoogovens NV of the Netherlands and British Steel PLC.
	   Cockerill shares rose by 8.3 percent to 236 francs (dlrs 7.19)
on the takeover speculation early Tuesday.
	   A spokesman for Thyssen Krupp was reported in the Brussels
financial daily L'Echo saying the company is considering making a
takeover offer for the Belgian steelmaker within the next few
weeks.
	   ``It is up to Thyssen to present its conclusions and make its
proposal to the Walloon government,'' Weerts said. Asked whether
Cockerill would accept a takeover by Thyssen Krupp, he said
Cockerill is interested mainly in an ``alliance'' with another
steel company.
	   Thyssen Krupp Stahl as formed last year when the German
industrial giants Thyssen AG, and Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp merged
their steel operations. In 1994, Cockerill took over the huge
Eko-Stahl steelworks in eastern Germany.
	   The Walloon government said in March it would dilute its 78.77
percent stake to a blocking minority or around 25 percent if
Cockerill were to ally itself with another steel producer.

Report: Malaysia to seek Indonesian pirates' extradition from China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Malaysia is seeking to extradite 12 Indonesians
held by China in connection with the April hijacking of the Petro
Ranger, a Malaysian-registered oil tanker, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Malaysia and China have an extradition treaty, and the Malaysian
government has notified Beijing that the Indonesians are being
sought on charges or armed robbery, The Business Times quoted an
official of the International Maritime Bureau in Kuala Lumpur as
saying.
	   ``This will be the first test case involving an action by a flag
state against crimes committed by such hijackers on the high seas
in which a coastal state was powerless to act,'' the maritime
bureau's director, P. Mukundun, was quoted as telling Lloyd's List.
	   As the coastal state, where the hijacked ship and its crew were
discovered on April 26, China has the first option of trying the 12
Indonesians who were taken into custody.
	   The ship and its crew of 21 were released on May 30 after a
Chinese investigation, but there has been no word about charging
the Indonesians.
	   They are alleged to have hijacked the Petro Ranger as it sailed
from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City on April 17, and offloaded most
of its 10,000 tons of gas oil and kerosene, worth 2.4 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.4 million) to another vessel in Chinese
waters, according to various news reports.
	   Neither the ship's agents in Singapore nor the Chinese
authorities have said what happened to the cargo.
	   Chinese maritime authorities escorted the tanker to the port of
Haikou, holding it and the crew for more than a month.

Falling Japanese yen alarms South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The plunge of the Japanese yen could
derail South Korea's efforts to revive its ailing economy by
boosting exports, the central Bank of Korea said in a report
released Tuesday.
	   The yen plummeted to 141.11 against the dollar at one point
Tuesday, a seven-year low. The news jolted the Korean stock market,
where the benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell by 6.66
percent.
	   The yen recovered later in the day, hitting 140.36 yen to the
dollar in late afternoon in Tokyo.
	   A falling yen means more competition for South Korean exports as
Japanese goods become cheaper overseas. The two countries share
many of their key exports items such as cars, computer chips and
home appliances.
	   ``If the Japanese yen continues to stay weak, which is quite
likely ... it will seriously weaken South Korea's export
competitiveness,'' the Bank of Korea said.
	   South Korea's main strategy to survive its financial crisis has
been to use its own weak currency to dramatically boost its
exports. But the falling yen all but dashed such hope, the bank
said.
	   It estimated that when the Japanese yen falls by 10 percent,
South Korea's annual exports would decrease by dlrs 1.2 billion.
	   South Korea's car and computer chip makers are already
struggling under mounds of unsold products.
	   Domestic car sales dropped by half this year. And Hyundai,
Daewoo, Kia and other auto manufacturers exported 140,322 cars in
May, down 0.7 percent from a year ago, the Korea Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said.
	   South Korean semiconductor makers, which supply 40 percent of
the world's computer memory chips, are planning to cut production
to bolster plunging prices.
	   Hyundai Electronics Co. suspended chip production for the last
week while Samsung Electronics Co., the world's biggest computer
memory chip maker, will follow suit next week.
	   Cheap prices have been the key competitiveness of South Korean
goods abroad.

Rwanda tribunal adopts procedures to speed up genocide trials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Judges at the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda have adopted new procedures to speed up trials
of defendants charged in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, the court
said Tuesday.
	   The measures were adopted after a plenary session of the six
judges sitting on the tribunal in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha and an additional five visiting from the Appeals Chamber of
the International War Crimes Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia in
The Hague.
	   Procedures adopted include pre-trial discussion between the
prosecution and the defense to decide which issues are uncontested.
	   This would enable judges to shorten the time needed for
questioning witnesses or to dispense with them altogether, a
statement from the tribunal said.
	   Judges will also have more power to control the questioning and
cross-examination of witnesses and to receive written testimony if
neither the defense nor the prosecution objects.
	   The judges also decided that defense attorneys should have at
least 10 years experience in order to provide the defendants with
adequate legal representation.
	   The U.N. tribunal has been criticized, especially by Rwandan
authorities, for being too slow.
	   The tribunal was established in November 1994 and won its first
conviction May 1 when former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda
pleaded guilty and offered to testify against ringleaders of the
three-month slaughter. At least 500,000 people, mostly minority
Tutsis, were stabbed, shot, bludgeoned or hacked to death.
	   The first verdict is expected this month. The tribunal has
indicted 35 people and is holding 24 defendants in custody.
	   There are 130,000 genocide suspects imprisoned in Rwanda. Many
have not been formally charged. Rwandan began trying the suspects
in December 1996, and to date, 350 people have been convicted of
varying degrees of crimes against humanity and genocide.
	   A third were sentenced to death, most others received prison
sentences and a small number have been acquitted. The first 22
convicts were executed by firing squad on April 24.
	   The heaviest penalty the Arusha tribunal can impose is life in
prison.

celebration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Only one foreign head of government
will join the foreign dignitaries at the centennial of the
Philippines' declaration of independence from Spanish rule,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Limited overseas publicity and a strike by Philippine Airlines
pilots will mean that the number of foreign tourists and overseas
Filipinos attending Friday's celebrations will also be lower than
hoped.
	   Governor General Silas Atopare of Papua New Guinea will be the
only head of government among the representatives of 32 countries,
the Department of Foreign Affairs said.
	   The Philippines was a Spanish possession for 333 years, from
1565 to 1898.
	   On June 12, 1898, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, a former mayor who
became the republic's first president, declared the Philippines'
independence from Spain at a house in Cavite province, south of
Manila.
	   Before the Philippines could gain independence, however, the
United States acquired it after defeating Spain in the 1898
Spanish-American War.
	   The Philippine government, helped by private companies, is
spending at least 3.5 billion pesos (dlrs 92 million) on the
centennial celebrations, which are to be highlighted by a trade and
historical exposition at the Clark Special Economic Zone, a former
U.S. air base in northern Pampanga province.
	   The United Nations will send Undersecretary General Adrianus
Mooy while the United States will be represented by its former
ambassador to Manila, Nicholas Platt, the department said.
	   Most countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of
which the Philippines is a member, will send a representative,
along with Spain, Cuba, China, Libya, Nicaragua, Britain and
Australia. Many will be Cabinet members.
	   The dignitaries are expected to attend ceremonies in Cavite,
visit trade exhibits in Clark and watch a parade and fireworks
display in Manila. President Fidel Ramos will host a dinner for the
guests Friday.
	   Police plan to tightly guard the government parade and other
centennial activities, which are expected to draw large crowds of
people.

Parliament approves privatization of banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In a further move to step up Egypt's
privatization program, parliament has approved the sale of shares
in state-owned banks, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The 500-member People's Assembly voted on the bill in a general
session Monday that was marred by heated discussions by opposition
deputies who accused the government of succumbing to pressures from
the International Monetary Fund.
	   But the economic daily Alam Al-Yawm quoted Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzoury, who presented the bill to Parliament, as saying the
government will continue to control banking operations through the
Central Bank although it will not be a major shareholder.
	   Under the new law, which must be endorsed by President Hosni
Mubarak, the government will sell unlimited shares in four major
commercial banks and several other development banks it now owns.
	   The law also stipulates that private investors will be limited
to 10 per cent shares each, apparently to prevent monopoly on large
shares by both local and foreign investors.
	   The head of the Parliament's economic committee Abdullah Tayel
said the move is expected to improve efficiency of the banking
sector and bring more investment to the Egyptian economy.
	   But Khalid Moheidin, leader of the opposition socialist
Progressive Unionist Party, told Parliament that the privatization
of the banks will put the Egyptian economy under foreign control.
He and other opposition members voted against the bill.
	   Parliament endorsed another bill which allows the sale of shares
in state-owned insurance companies.
	   Banking and other sectors were nationalized after Gamal Abdel
Nasser's 1952 army coup. The state began to loosen control in 1991
when President Hosni Mubarak began his economic reforms.
	   Since then, Egypt's gross domestic product has grown from 2
percent to more than 5 percent. Inflation has fallen from 20
percent to under 4 percent and foreign currency reserves have risen
to about dlrs 20 billion.
	   The country's major economic newspaper, Al-Ahram Al-Iqtisadi,
reported last month that Egyptian banks in February registered
assets totaling 205 billion pounds (dlrs 60 billion).
	   The four main state banks which will be privatized are the
National Bank of Egypt, the Bank of Alexandria, Banque du Caire and
Banque Misr.

Thai stocks at new 11-year low on financial fears; baht rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai stock prices dipped 1.3 percent to
a new 11-year low Tuesday amid growing worries about the health of
Thai financial institutions as the economy shrinks.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.12 points from
Monday to 308.25 points, its lowest level since 1987 and nearing
the psychological threshold of 300 points.
	   The baht meanwhile ended stronger against the U.S. dollar at
42.95, compared to 43.35 on Monday, as foreign funds holding long
positions on the dollar sold to take profit.
	   Dealers attributed the shares slump to investor gloom about
prospects for Thailand's financial markets in the medium term. The
government so far has shown little alarm about the decline of the
currency in recent weeks.
	   ``There are a lot of fears over the health of the finance
industry and over the implementation of new guidelines of the Bank
of Thailand for debt restructuring,'' said Stuart Matthews, head of
research at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Securities.
	   Foreign investors are reluctant to buy stocks given the
likelihood the Thai currency may continue to decline, Matthews
said.
	   The Thai central-bank governor said last week he considers 43 to
45 baht to dlr 1 an acceptable range, leading investors to worry
the baht may be allowed to drop to 45.

Chelsea signs Spanish defender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli continued his
off-season international recruitment drive, signing Spanish right
back Albert Ferrer for five years in a reported 2.2 million pound
(dlrs 3.6 million) deal.
	   The European Cup Winners Cup champions lured the Spanish
international from Barcelona five days before he kicks off his
World Cup campaign for Spain against Nigeria in Nantes.
	   Chelsea adds Ferrer to a list of recent international signings,
including a club record 5.4 million pound (dlrs 8.8 million) deal
with Italian Pierluigi Casiraghi two weeks ago.
	   Ferrer, who turned 28 Saturday, has a wealth of international
experience. He has 35 caps for Spain, the 1992 Olympic gold medal,
as well as five Spanish League championship medals, the European
Cup and two Cup Winner's Cups.
	   Ferrer and Chelsea concluded negotiations at the Spanish World
Cup training base in Chantilly on Monday night.
	   Ferrer, who has made 330 league and cup appearances for
Barcelona since 1990, said was he very happy to join the Blues.
	   ``I've played in the Champions League but I think this will be a
new experience for me and I think that experience will be very
successful,'' he said.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with bank employees freed, more details

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Police freed two bank employees trapped
in their workplace during a hold-up Tuesday in Brussels, but two
suspected robbers appeared to have escaped.
	   Fearing the employees were being held hostage, members of a
police SWAT team surrounded the bank in the Molenbeek district of
the Belgium capital shortly after robbery started at 9.0 a.m.
(0700). When police entered the building two hours later they found
the two women, but not the assailants.
	   A third suspected member of the gang was caught as he tried to
flee shortly after the start of the attempted robbery. Police were
searching neighboring houses in an attempt to find the others.
	   It was unclear if the employees had been held hostage or if they
had hidden from the robbers.

Official: Weakening yen bad for China but no devaluation ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Although the weakening Japanese yen is
complicating Chinese economic growth prospects, China's central
banker vowed Tuesday not to devalue the Chinese yuan.
	   The depreciating yen ``is having a very negative impact on
Chinese imports and exports and the utilization of foreign
capital,'' People's Bank of China governor Dai Xianglong said in a
speech at a symposium on Asia's financial crisis.
	   Slacker exports and less hard currency coming in will make it
more difficult for China to get protected state industries to
compete in the market, Dai admitted. The Chinese government says it
needs the economy to grow by 8 percent this year to help generate
jobs for millions of laid-off state workers.
	   Despite the added difficulties, Dai said China would keep to a
pledge not to devalue. Made after financial turmoil began hammering
Asian currencies nearly a year ago, the pledge has been praised
worldwide as a stabilizing factor.
	   Dai also reiterated that the 8 percent growth target was still
attainable, despite a relatively strong currency. He projected that
fixed-asset investment will grow more than 15 percent this year,
five percentage points higher than last year and a rate many
economists say is crucial to revive flagging growth.
	   The State Statistical Bureau on Tuesday said China's value-added
output for the first five months climbed 7.9 percent from the same
period a year ago _ well below the 10.5 percent level some
officials have said China must maintain to reach the growth target.

Apartheid scientist made ecstasy

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A former apartheid scientist
confessed Tuesday to running a secret government program that made
912 kilograms of the drug ecstasy with a street value of up to 1
billion rand (dlrs 200 million).
	   Testifying before a panel probing apartheid abuses, Dr. Johan
Koekemoer described working in 1992 for an army front company and
being asked to make the drug as part of a chemical warfare project.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is holding a weeklong
session on chemical and biological warfare projects set up by the
South African Defense Force during apartheid.
	   Koekemoer told the panel that he suspected his superiors might
be dealing privately in the drug after telling him it was to be
used to incapacitate enemies of the white-run state. Ecstasy has a
reputation for giving users a feeling of bliss and happiness.
	   Koekemoer said he confronted his superiors with his doubts, but
they assured him the drug was to be used for military purposes.
	   ``I was just a bit suspicious,'' he said. ``I would not like to
kiss my enemy, but rather work on his central nervous system so he
can't operate properly.''
	   Aiming to shed light on the murky world of espionage and secret
weapons projects, the hearings are focused on the activities of Dr.
Wouter Basson, who headed the army's Seventh Medical Battalion,
which ran biological and chemical weapons programs through a
sophisticated network of front companies.
	   Basson was forced to resign from the army in 1993 after a
government report accused him of making poisons and chemical bombs.
He is being investigated on charges of making and possessing
ecstasy and mandrax drugs. Basson is expected to testify later this
week.
	   The commission was set up by President Nelson Mandela in 1995 to
uncover the truth about apartheid crimes and promote racial
healing.

 &UR; South Korean officials to contact northern counterpart for 2002
World Cup

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean soccer officials said
Tuesday they have obtained government approval to discuss sharing
some matches of the 2002 World Cup finals with rival North Korea.
	   South Korea and Japan will co-host the games, but South Korea
hopes to share some of its 32 matches with North Korea to promote
peace on the peninsula.
	   Officials at the Korea Football Association said they will send
a letter to North Korea soon to arrange a meeting on the
match-sharing idea or even forming a unified Korean team for the
competition.
	   They also said the contact, if held, could take up the issue of
promoting regular sports exchanges between the two sides.
	   South Korean soccer officials needed government approval for the
move. The two Koreas are technically at war, with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   A high-ranking North Korean soccer official in Paris said in a
published interview Tuesday that the communist country could
consider sharing World Cup matches if such a proposal is made.
	   ``We are not in a stage to discuss details yet, but in
principle, it is very desirable to form a single team and for North
Korea to hold some games,'' Choi Pyong Joo, vice president of North
Korea's soccer association said in an interview with South Korea's
Sports Seoul newspaper.
	   Choi was in Paris attending various functions of FIFA, soccer's
world governing body, ahead of the 1998 World Cup finals.
	   In the early 1990s, the two Koreas formed single soccer and
table tennis teams for international tournaments.

Opposition says it won't support government on NATO vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi's main ally in the center-right
opposition confirmed Tuesday that the alliance won't bail out
Premier Romano Prodi's government on a crucial vote later this
month on NATO.
	   Without the support of the media mogul's Freedom Alliance,
Prodi's center-left coalition risks losing the vote and thus facing
a vote of confidence.
	   While Berlusconi and his allies support NATO's eastward
expansion, they have announced their refusal to come to the rescue
of the government yet again in the face of the governing
coalition's difficulties with its troublesome Communist allies.
	   Fausto Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party which Prodi
counts on for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, where a vote
on NATO is planned the week of June 22, has repeatedly said it will
vote against the military alliance's expansion.
	   Boosted by a strong showing for the center-right in scattered
local elections last weekend, Berlusconi said Monday he wanted to
``send Prodi and his government home.''
	   ``We don't want to bail Prodi out in any way,'' Gianfranco Fini,
leader of the rightwing National Alliance, a key ally in
Berlusconi's coalition, told reporters.
	   However, both opposition leaders have said they support NATO
expansion in principle, and it is unlikely they will ultimately
stop Italy from approving the addition of new countries.
	   Among the options to the opposition is one in which Berlusconi's
alliance would vote against Prodi's bill but propose another
version that changes only minor points while approving NATO
expansion.
	   Bertinotti pushed the government to the brink of collapse last
year when it voted against Italy's plans to send peacekeeping
troops to Albania, but Berlusconi's coalition bailed out Prodi
then.
	   A top Prodi aide, Enrico Micheli, asserted that the government
would be capable of ``defending themselves against this attack'' by
the center-right.
	   ``If this government must be sent packing, it won't be decided
by this thing or that. It will be the country, and it seems to me
that Italians are far from taking such a decision,'' Micheli said.
	   Prodi's coalition suffered a setback Tuesday with the formal end
of parliamentary efforts on political reform, a key plank of the
government.
	   ``It's not a happy day,'' said Sen. Cesare Salvi, a former
Communist, about the failure of a two-chamber commission on reform
to produce results.
	   Refusal by Berlusconi to back the government's proposal for
changing the powers of the Italian president brought collapse of
the reforms.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador and other envoys were
refusing Tuesday to budge after the Belarusian government said they
had to leave their residences to allow repairs and renovations.
	   The Foreign Ministry expressed regret for the ``inconvenience,''
but said 22 ambassadors have to vacate their homes in a diplomatic
complex on the outskirts of the capital, Minsk, for long overdue
repairs.
	   A long statement said the homes built just after the World War
II were in poor condition, the water supply was no longer safe and
the sewage system was polluting the environment.
	   Diplomatic missions had been offered apartments in downtown
Minsk to accommodate staff while those willing to build their own
residences would be offered plots, the ministry said late Monday.
	   The Belarusian government served notice in April that it wanted
to overhaul water and sewage pipes in the diplomatic complex and
gave the ambassadors until June to leave.
	   Diplomats protested, saying they would prefer to make
arrangements to remain in the complex during the repairs. They
noted that the government's decision was sudden, and that some
embassies had signed new multi-year leases just the month before.
	   Under international law, ambassadors' residences are considered
sovereign territory and governments have no right to enter without
permission or insist that diplomats leave.
	   U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard called a news conference Monday
and said he and a number of other ambassadors would not leave their
homes, and appealed to President Alexander Lukashenko to rescind
the order.
	   When he returned home after the news conference accompanied by
camera crews, he found a team of workers and a policeman trying to
weld shut the side gate. The workers left when Speckhard protested.
	   ``To lock ambassadors into their residences and weld their door
shut is not becoming to the dignity of your country,'' Speckhard
said.
	   He called the incident the most serious violation of the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations since the end of the Cold War.
	   Speckhard said that he doesn't doubt that some repairs are
needed, but insisted that the government must reach agreements with
the foreign missions and cannot simply evict them.
	   Speckhard said the United States has had a lease on the
residence since 1992, the year after Belarus gained independence
with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The lease does not expire
until 2001.
	   If the government forcibly evicts the ambassadors, it would be
the first violation of the Vienna Convention since Iranian
militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, an embassy
spokeswoman said.
	   Russia and Lithuania also protested the planned eviction on
Tuesday. Russia's Foreign Ministry voiced ``deep concern'' over the
incident, and Lithuania recalled its envoy in protest, according to
the Interfax news agency.

Yugoslavia assails renewed Kosovo sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Belgrade criticizing sanctions, Bildt comments on
West's inaction; DELETES outdated material. No pickup. CHANGES

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia on Tuesday denounced new
international sanctions over its offensive in Kosovo, where a
western strip of the separatist province has been turned into a war
zone of burned houses and deserted villages.
	   In a statement issued on the official Tanjug news agency,
Yugoslav officials called the imposition of sanctions a ``strange
and unreasonable decision.'' The sanctions apply only to Serbia.
Its lone partner in the Yugoslav federation, Montenegro, is exempt
because of its pro-Western leadership.
	   ``This is the first case that EU has made a decision about a
sovereign state that applies to only one of its federal units,''
the Tanjug commentary said.
	   The European Union and the United States imposed the sanctions
within hours Monday, banning new investments in Serbia and freezing
its assets abroad.
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, welcomed the new
sanctions on Monday but said they were only a ``small step.''
	   There were no immediate reports of new clashes Tuesday between
the Serbs and ethnic Albanian militants fighting for Kosovo's
independence from Serbia.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb forces on Monday attacked
seven southwestern villages near the Albanian border with artillery
and helicopter gunships. The Serbs, meanwhile, accused the Kosovo
Liberation Army of launching a new attack on Yugoslav army forces
near the border that killed one soldier and injured three.
	   International outcry has increased against Serbia to stop using
its police and army against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population. NATO is considering military
intervention.
	   Carl Bildt, formerly the European Union's high representative in
Bosnia and still an influential figure regarding policy on former
Yugoslavia, harshly criticized Western officials in a commentary
published Tuesday for being indecisive and slow. He warned of a
``huge humanitarian and political disaster.''
	   He urged that troops be deployed to northern Albania to close
the border, that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Kosovo and threaten
air strikes against remaining Serb forces, and that the Kosovo
Liberation Army's sponsors in Europe and the United States be
pressured to get the KLA to halt military operations.
	   ``Kosovo is a testing ground,'' Bildt wrote in the Financial
Times of London. ``Here, we will see if the lessons of the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia have been learned. So far, there are only faint
signs that this has been the case.''
	   More than 250 people are said to have died in Kosovo since March
1 in escalating clashes between government forces and the KLA.

King Hussein to meet President Clinton in Washington on Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein left Tuesday on a tour of
Britain and the United States, including a stop in Washington for
talks with President Clinton on the stalled Middle East peace
process.
	   A Royal Palace official said Hussein's first stop will be
Washington, where he is scheduled to meet with President Clinton in
the White House next Monday. But before that, he's expected to have
a series of discussions with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other administration officials.
	   ``The Washington meetings will focus on ways to push forward the
peace process and prevent it from collapsing,'' said the palace
official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   King Hussein, Israel's closest Arab friend since the 1994
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, has become increasingly critical of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's tough stance with the
Arabs.
	   Hussein is eager to see an Israeli-Palestinian settlement to
ease opposition among his predominantly Palestinian population to
his own peace treaty with Israel.
	   The Palace official said after Washington, Hussein will go to
Boston to attend the high school graduation of his 16-year-old
daughter Iman.
	   He will later travel to Rochester, Minn., for routine medical
checkups he has been undergoing since a 1992 cancer surgery.
	   Hussein will later go on a private visit to England, where he
has residence in Ascot outside London.

Army kills 13 rebels in clash, one soldier dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ The army killed 13 rebels in a clash
in southern Burundi in which one government soldier died, army
spokesman Lt. Col. Isaie Nibizi said Tuesday.
	   The fighting occurred June 6 at Kiderege in Makamba province,
123 kilometers (75 miles) south of Bujumbura.
	   ``We want to end the rebellion in this country, we want to
neutralize it,'' Nibizi said.
	   The Tutsi-dominated army and the Hutu rebels have been battling
since late 1993 after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's
first democratically election president, Hutu Melchoir Ndadaye.
	   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the fighting.
	   On Monday, another round of talks on peace in Burundi is
scheduled to begin in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha under
the mediation for former President Julius Nyerere.
	   President Pierre Buyoya, who overthrew a coalition Hutu-Tutsi
government in July 1996, will take part in the talks for the first
time.

Spain demands compensation from Canada in fishery dispute before
</HEADLINE>
World Court &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In a long-running fishery dispute,
Spain Tuesday demanded compensation from Canada for the 1995
seizure of a Spanish trawler and backed the World Court's
jurisdiction to rule in their conflict.
	   Spain presented its arguments on the opening day of hearings to
examine whether the U.N. court has jurisdiction to hear the case.
	   Spain took Canada to court in March, 1995 after the
highly-publicized seizure of the Spanish trawler Estai in
international waters by Canadian officials. The Estai's captain was
also arrested.
	   Canada claimed the boat was fishing endangered turbot and using
small-mesh gear, as well as underreporting its catch.
	   Canadian officials made the arrest based on a national law which
allowed its authorities to seize ships in international waters if
they believe vessels are overfishing.
	   But Spain claims Canada violated international laws protecting
freedom of navigation and freedom of fishing on the high seas.
	   Spain's sovereignty was also under attack since the Estai was
sailing under its flag, said Spain's agent Jose Antonio Pastor
Ridruejo, who described Canada's actions as ``armed coercion.''
	   ``It is Canada's legislation which is attacking us,'' said
Ridruejo, in his opening statement. ``It is infringing on the
sovereignty of Spain because it is attacking our flag.''
	   ``We ask Canada to stop repeating its acts ... and provide us
with proper compensations,'' added Ridruejo.
	   He did not specify what kind of compensation Spain is seeking.
	   The incident, which occurred on March 9, 1995 in international
waters in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, wrecked relations
between the two countries, but Canada claimed the dispute has long
been resolved through an agreement with the European Union on fish
stock conservation and management.
	   But Spain insists the court, the U.N.'s highest judicial organ,
must ``look at the wrongfulness of the actions of Canada.''
	   ``Canada has no legal international title to act in such a way
on the high seas as regard to a vessel flying a Spanish flag,''
said Ridruejo.
	   Representatives of Canada's legal team declined comment ahead of
their presentations on Thursday. They are expected to challenge the
court's authority to rule in the matter.
	   The current round of hearings, which will last six days, deals
only with the court's jurisdiction and not on the actual merits of
the case.
	   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, has no enforcement powers.

Nigerian players say Abacha's death won't deter World Cup quest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ELINCOURT-STE. MARGUERITE, France (AP) _ Nigeria's World Cup
players said Tuesday they wouldn't let the death of their country's
ruler distract them from their quest for soccer's world
championship.
	   The team gathered on its practice ground for a moment of silence
for Gen. San Abacha before the morning training session.
	   ``It was shocking for the team. It's a surprise. We just pray
his soul rests in peace,'' said midfielder Sunday Oliseh. ``He was
a big man. He was one of our greatest fans. He had a lot of contact
with the team.''
	   News of Abacha's death broke Monday while the squad was holding
a closed practice in Ressons, a village in the countryside north of
Paris.
	   The Nigerian team captain, Uche Okechukwu, said the team was
considering wearing black armbands on their jerseys during World
Cup matches.
	   ``The players are sad but we are here for a mission,'' team
leader Col. Gregory Adebiyi said. ``We've come for what we've come
for. We have some games to win.''
	   Players were told of the death Monday night after officials
received confirmation from Lagos, although some players said they
had already heard reports of the death on CNN.
	   ``We didn't know he was sick,'' said Oliseh, the Ajax Amsterdam
midfielder, said after Tuesday's practice. ``It's like if you don't
know a team is in the World Cup and then you find out it has won
it.''
	   There had been speculation earlier this year that Abacha might
make a rare public appearance at France '98.
	   In Nigeria, family friends said Abacha died of a heart attack.
The official News Agency of Nigeria confirmed only that he died
Monday.
	   Abacha came to power in a 1993 coup and faced worldwide
condemnation for his hard-line regime.
	   Members of the West African nation's soccer team have waged a
battle with the government over World Cup pay, meeting several
times with the country's military rulers. The players reportedly
rejected an offer of dlrs 6,000 a person per match, demanding dlrs
8,000 each.
	   The country's political situation has affected the squad
repeatedly. As recently as Friday, the national soccer federation
threatened to pull out of a World Cup warmup match in Amsterdam
because of human-rights protests in the Netherlands.
	   An advertisement in the Nigeria-Netherlands match program
featured pictures of 12 prominent Nigerian activists who have been
imprisoned or harassed by the country's rulers.
	   The 12 activists made up an ``alternative Nigerian team,''
organizers of the protest said. The advertisement was placed by a
group of Dutch human-rights groups, trade unions and religious
bodies.
	   In addition, Nigeria did not participate in the last two
editions of the African Cup of Nations.
	   It was barred from this year's tournament in January after
boycotting the 1996 tournament in South Africa. The reason for
Nigeria's non-participation is thought to be anger over President
Nelson Mandela's call for sanctions against the military regime for
hanging nine dissidents.

Explosion in Iranian hospital kills one, injures five
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An explosion in a hospital in northern Iran
killed one person and injured five others, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Two of the injured were in critical condition as a result of the
explosion at the Totonkaran Hospital in the northern city of Rasht,
the capital of Iran's northern Gilan province, the agency said.
	   The cause of the blast was not immediately known but officials
believe a suspected gas leakage from the hospital's heating
installations caused it.
	   The hospital's heating installations were totally destroyed and
efforts were underway to clear debris, the agency quoted a hospital
official as saying.
	   The blast shattered window panes of the hospital and those of
nearby buildings.
	   None of the hospital's patients or visitors were hurt and all
the casualties were hospital employees, the agency said.

Indonesia prepared to grant special status to East Timor: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with reaction, detail &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Tuesday he's prepared to grant special status within Indonesia to
East Timor, in a bid to find a solution to the conflict in the
disputed territory, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.
	   But East Timorese activists contacted by The Associated Press
said Habibie's gesture is not enough for them to end their
long-running guerrilla war against Indonesian rule.
	   Neverthless Habibie's comments appear to be a significant change
in policy toward East Timor following the resignation last month of
ex-President Suharto, who steadfastly refused to make any
concessions to calls for greater autonmy.
	   It's not clear what form the East Timor's special status might
take, but it is clear it would fall short of the self-determination
separatist groups want.
	   A presidential aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that mainly Muslim Indonesia would grant some form of recognition
to the territory's culture and Roman Catholic religion.
	   Other parts of Indonesia with special status include the capital
Jakarta, the deeply Muslim province of Aceh in north Sumatra Island
and the sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java.
	   Their local governments enjoy a few, most symbolic privileges
and powers.
	   Giving details of an interview with Habibie, the BBC said the
Indonesian president had also signed a decree to release 10
Timorese fighters jailed by Indonesia, which invaded the former
Portuguese colony in 1975.
	   But Habibie made clear that the releases would not include the
jailed East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao, the BBC reported.
	   Indonesia regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has committed
violent acts in his fight against Indonesian rule in East Timor.
Gusmao is currently serving a 20-year prison term in Jakarta's
Cipinang Prison.
	   Fernando Araujo, an East Timorese activist and former political
prisoner who is in regular contact with Gusmao, said the withdrawl
of Indonesia troops and the release of Gusmao were basic demands
for any peaceful solution.
	   ``If Habibie won't release Xanana, we will continue fight and
die for the independence of our country all out,'' Araujo said.
	   Indonesian troops, under Suharto's orders, invaded the former
East Timor in 1975 after the Portuguese, withdrew ending about 400
years of colonial rule.
	   In 1976 Suharto declared East Timor the 27th province of
Indonesia _ an act not recognized by the United Nations.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim to
sovereignty. It has been sponsoring talks between Indonesia and
Portugal over the territory's future, but with little progress.
	   Under Suharto, Indonesia steadfastly refused to consider the
granting any special status or any form of local autonomy to East
Timor.
	   Suharto quit office last month and was replaced by Habibie,
raising hopes of a possible change in policy.
	   Last week U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to Habibie
asking that Gusmao be released.
	   Other foreign leaders, including South African President Nelson
Mandela have done the same.
	   Habibie, sworn in on May 21, has already released four other
political prisoners and has signalled that more will be released
soon.
	   Earlier on Tuesday Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Suharto's departure from politics has provided an opportunity for
Portugal, East Timorese separatists and Indonesia to resolve
conflicts over the disputed territory.
	   ``I think now is a good time to resolve our disagreement under
the auspices of the United Nations secretary general who has taken
the initiative over the years,'' Alatas said after a meeting with
Habibie.
	   In the past, Alatas has accused Portugal and the East Timorese
separatists, led by Nobel peace prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta, of
being inflexible.

Scotland loses to Barbarians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Scotland lost its first match on the
Australian leg of its southern rugby tour when beaten 39-34 by
Australian Barbarians at Penrith on Tuesday.
	   The Barbarians, made up of Super 12 regulars but with no current
test players, scored six tries to five with Ricky Nalatu getting a
brace.
	   Scotland fielded a mostly second string side as test fullback
Derrick Lee scored a double.
	   Queensland's Shane Drahm made a significant contribution after
coming on as a substitute, scoring a try, two conversions and a
penalty.
	   With the scores at 32-22 and 10 minutes left, fly-half Drahm,
who replaced Elton Flatley, closed out the match with a spectacular
solo 70-meter try.
	   The Scots scored two late tries to set up a nervous last two
minutes and they nearly stole the match when the ball was kicked
through but went dead just as referee Wayne Erickson blew
full-time.
	   The match was the last for the tourists before Saturday's first
test against Australia in Sydney. Scotland's only other test so far
on tour was a 51-26 loss to Fiji in Suva.
	   Scorers: Australian Barbarians 39 (Ricky Nalatu 2, Pat Howard,
John Langford, Ipolito Fenukitau, Shane Drahm tries; Shane Drahm 2
goals, Elton Flatley 1 goal, 1 pen goal) def. Scotland 34 (Derrick
Lee 2, Jamie Mayer, Ian Jardine, Adam Roxburgh tries; Duncan Hodge
3 goals, 1 penalty goal).

Rebel general urges president to step down, calls for transition
</HEADLINE>
government, elections &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The leader of renegade soldiers locked
in battle Tuesday with government troops in the West African nation
of Guinea-Bissau urged President Joao Bernardo Vieira to step down.
	   Former armed forces chief Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane, in a
handwritten statement sent to the Portuguese news agency Lusa, said
a transition government should be installed to prepare for
elections in July.
	   Mane, describing himself as head of a military junta, said he
had no intention of seizing power himself.
	   Mane's statement came after government troops launched an
unsuccessful pre-dawn attack aimed at dislodging rebel forces from
positions they held in the capital.
	   The general, fired six months ago during an investigation into
arms trafficking with the separatist rebels of Casamansa, a
Senegalese province that borders Guinea-Bissau to the north, had
waited until Saturday to officially step down.
	   There was no immediate reaction available from the president,
who had vowed Sunday to ``use all possible means'' to quash the
revolt swiftly.
	   But Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva called Mane's
appeal for July elections ``a joke.'' Da Silva was interviewed by
phone in Lisbon, where he was stuck because of flight cancellations
to Guinea-Bissau.
	   Delfim da Silva said the two military sides were ``deadlocked.''
	   ``The rebels are hemmed in. They're not advancing, but we can't
get them out either,'' he said.
	   Heavy fighting could be heard at two military installations in
the Bissau suburb of Bra and around the army headquarters in the
suburb of Queije, U.S. embassy spokesman Bryan Hunt said in a
telephone interview with the Lisbon bureau of The Associated Press.
	   The fighting began at 5.30 a.m. (0530 GMT) and lasted about 30
minutes, Hunt said.
	   ``The major offensive by government troops ... was unsuccessful
as far as we can tell. The situation is very unsettled,'' Hunt
said.
	   Guinea Bissau's ambassador in Lisbon said the military situation
was ``deadlocked.''
	   ``The rebels are entrenched in Bra. Loyalist troops have been
trying to dislodge them but they haven't been successful so far,''
Ambassador Jose Baptista said in an interview.
	   Streets around the two areas, which were seized by an unknown
number of rebel soldiers early Sunday, were blocked off. However,
diplomats housed nearby reported that the two sides used mortars
and automatic weapons in the battles.
	   Hunt said it was not clear which side held the army
headquarters, nor were there any credible figures for the number
killed in the fighting.
	   A reporter for Guinea-Bissau national radio, interviewed by
Lisbon radio TSF on Tuesday, said he counted 30 bodies scattered
around the bases at Bra.
	   The Bra military installation, which includes a barracks and an
arms depot, is 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside the capital.
	   The nearby international airport remained closed. Peace Corps
representatives and U.S. citizens around the country reported there
was no fighting elsewhere.
	   In downtown Bissau, streets were quiet and people shopped at
grocery stores. However, police and troops ordered people to return
home by noon (1200 GMT), according to Hunt.
	   The city power supply was working normally, he said.
	   The ruling PAIGC party said in a statement broadcast on national
radio Tuesday that the government remained in control.
	   ``Legislative elections are scheduled for this year and
presidential elections are scheduled for next year,'' the foreign
minister said.
	   ``That is when the mandates for Parliament and the president end
and that's when the ballots will be held. We won't be given orders
by the head of a military junta,'' he said.
	   The PAIGC _ the Portuguese initials for the African Party for
the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde _ won the 1994 general
election and has 60 lawmakers in the 100-seat National Assembly,
the country's parliament.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has 1 million people.
Most of them live from farming and fishing.

Amokachi injures knee in practice; Shakpoke ruled out with broken
</HEADLINE>
collarbone &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RESSONS, France (AP) _ Nigeria's World Cup team, already
battered by injuries and distracted by the death of the country's
leader, was hit twice more Tuesday when starting defender Jero
Shakpoke was lost for the tournament with a broken left collarbone
and striker Daniel Amokachi twisted his right knee.
	   The status of Amokachi, a possible starter, for Saturday's
opener against Spain in Nantes should be known within 24 hours,
officials said.
	   Shakpoke was ruled out of the tournament after doctors in Italy
diagnosed his shoulder injury as a fracture, team spokesman Austin
Mgbolu said. Shakpoke had flown to Reggiana to be examined by his
club doctor.
	   He sustained the injury during the first half of Nigeria's 5-1
loss to the Netherlands in a warmup match last Friday.
	   Mgbolu said Nigeria would ask FIFA, the international soccer
federation, for permission to replace Shakpoke on the roster.
	   Amokachi hurt himself about an hour into Tuesday's training
session when his foot got caught in the damp turf as he attempted a
shot. He was helped off the field by trainers with his right knee
heavily bandaged.
	   An assistant team trainer said it would be about 24 hours before
the extent of the injury was known.
	   ``He told me he had the same injury six months ago, and after 24
hours he was fine. I hope it's the same this time,'' coach Bora
Milutinovic said.
	   A member of Nigeria's 1994 World Cup squad and 1996 Olympic
championship team, Amokachi provides a creative element for the
attack. His injury is another blow for a team that was already
without injured forward Emanuel Ammunike and has leader Nwankwo
Kanu playing at less than 100 percent.
	   Kanu, a forward who underwent heart surgery 18 months ago, has
skipped all of the team's workouts in France because of a bad left
ankle.
	   The players were also dealing with the death of their country's
ruler, gathering for a moment of silence for Gen. San Abacha before
the morning training session.
	   Players learned of Abacha's death Monday night, and team captain
Uche Okechukwu said the team was considering wearing black armbands
on their jerseys during World Cup matches.

Thai government trims stake in Thai Airways
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet decided Tuesday to
trim the government's stake in Thai Airways by authorizing the
Finance Ministry to sell 235 million shares in the national
carrier.
	   The sale would reduce the Finance Ministry's stake in Thai
Airways from 80 percent to 72 percent.
	   In the past, various government-appointed panels have
recommended the Finance Ministry reduce its ownership in the
carrier to a maximum of 49 percent as part of an aggressive
privatization program.
	   The reduction to 72 percent was a commitment made by the
government to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has demanded
reforms and privatization procedures at state enterprises as part
of the dlrs 17.2 billion economic bailout package its is overseeing
for Thailand.
	   The Cabinet also approved the issuance by the airline of 100
million new shares in a capital-raising exercise, said Supachai
Pisitvanich, the ministry's permanent secretary.
	   Supachai said funds raised from the sale of the ministry's 235
shares would be used to pay off debts incurred by the country's
bank-rescue fund.
	   That fund, an arm of the Thai central bank known as the
Financial Institutions Development Fund, depleted its resources by
spending about 1 trillion baht (dlrs 23 billion) to prop up
troubled financial institutions last year.
	   The FIDF had borrowed most of its own funds from strong Thai
financial institutions, paying steep interest rates for the money.
	   The Cabinet said that the 335 million Thai Airways shares that
will enter the market _ the government's shares plus the new shares
_ may be sold both to individuals and institutions.
	   Some government officials have said the shares should be sold to
foreign airlines to help improve the efficiency of Thai Airways. A
company spokeswoman said Tuesday no foreign carrier had formally
approached Thai Airways to buy its shares.
	   In a statement, the cabinet said it ``asks Thai Airways to speed
up improvement of its operations to attract investors to buy its
shares so the state will get the best price possible.''
	   The cabinet asked the company to increase revenue, cut spending
and adjust its investment plans.
	   Thai Airways previously reported that its earnings for the six
months that ended March 31 dropped 55 percent year-on-year to 1.32
billion baht (dlrs 30 million).

Polish premier to discuss administrative reform with president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said Tuesday he
will try to convince the president not to veto a government plan to
consolidate the country's provinces as part of an administrative
reform to begin Jan. 1.
	   Following heated debates in parliament and protests across
Poland, the government revised its original plan of turning the 49
provinces into 12 big ones, adding three more provinces to make 15.
	   However, President Aleksander Kwasniewski's aides have indicated
he supports the idea of creating 17 provinces and would veto any
other solution.
	   Kwasniewski seems to have joined forces with his former
ex-communist colleagues, who form the leftist opposition bloc in
parliament.
	   The leftists argue that a return to the 17 provinces that
functioned in Poland until 1975 is natural. They say the government
has failed to win public approval for the reform, which will do
away with the communist-era administration by transferring power to
municipalities.
	   Leaders of the rightist government coalition argue Poland needs
big and strong provinces and thus increasing the number only
weakens the plan.
	   The Solidarity-dominated Senate is meeting June 18 and is
expected to support the government plan.
	   Buzek said he wanted to see Kwasniewski as soon as possible
because he wanted to avoid a veto. But the president's press office
said no meeting with Buzek was scheduled.
	   Buzek said he was surprised by Kwasniewski's position, because
the president ``has repeatedly said during our previous
conversations that any solution between 12 and 17 provinces is
acceptable to him.''
	   Poles also are divided over the government reform. A survey by
the state-run CBOS agency in mid-April showed that only 24 percent
of Poles approve of consolidating the country's 49 provinces into
12 new ones. Some 29 percent preferred 17 provinces, and 27 percent
wanted to see the present 49 provinces remain.
	   The poll had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.

Report: Volkswagen interested in merger with Renault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Fresh from its purchase of British
luxury automaker Rolls-Royce, Volkswagen reportedly is looking to
buy something French: Renault.
	   Stern magazine reported Tuesday that VW, Europe's biggest
carmaker, is interested in a merger with Renault mainly for its
truck division. Renault is the third biggest manufacturer of
commercial vehicles in the world.
	   VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech has often said he would like to add
a truck division to VW _ either through an acquisition or through
internal development.
	   VW spokesman Kurt Rippholz called the Stern report ``pure
speculation'' and declined to comment further.
	   The magazine also said VW plans for luxury cars did not end with
its recent acquisition of Rolls-Royce.
	   According to Stern, VW plans to build a Horch luxury model, with
an 18-cylinder motor, in Dresden.
	   Last month VW's high-end unit, Audi AG, confirmed it was
considering a joint project with Lamborghini, but declined to
comment on a Stern report that it might buy the Italian sportscar
maker.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of Russia's government statistics service
has been arrested on charges of helping tax dodgers and selling
confidential data, officials said Tuesday. Investigators said they
found over dlrs 1 million in cash at his apartment.
	   Yuri Yurkov, head of the State Statistics Committee, was
arrested late on Monday along with several other senior workers,
government spokesman Alexei Volin said.
	   They were charged with ``systematic distortion of statistical
data on big companies which allowed them to evade taxes,'' Volin
said.
	   The arrests could have far-reaching economic implications for
Russia if it turns out that data government officials rely on to
make policy and collect taxes was in fact manipulated.
	   Volin said that investigators had found over dlrs 1 million in
cash during a search at Yurkov's apartment.
	   Russian Prosecutor's General office later said that Yurkov's
deputy Valery Dalin and the head of the agency's data processing
center Boris Saakyan were among those arrested. The authorities
have seized more than dlrs 1.5 million in cash and a large amount
of jewelry pieces from Yurkov and others, it said in a statement
released to the media.
	   Altogether, over 20 people were involved in the scheme, the
prosecutor's office said. ``They have distributed roles among
themselves making every member of the criminal group earn money,''
it said.
	   Yurkov and Saakyan made statements pleading guilty to the
charges, the statement said.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with pope's condolence note &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican's
former No. 2 official whose cautious diplomacy helped the church
survive in Eastern Europe during Cold War years, died Tuesday at
83.
	   A Rome hospital said the cardinal was hospitalized on Thursday
and died of heart problems.
	   The Italian cardinal served as secretary of state of the Vatican
from 1979 until 1990.
	   When Casaroli retired, Pope John Paul II expressed his gratitude
to the tailor's son from Piacenza in northern Italy and said it was
``providential'' to have worked with him during such ``historic
times.''
	   That was a reference to the changes that brought the church
renewed freedoms in Europe after 40 years of Communist rule in the
former Soviet bloc.
	   John Paul, in a condolence note, praised Casaroli for ``carrying
out with refined diplomatic sensitivity courageous and significant
steps, in particular for improving the situatin of the church in
eastern Europe.''

Greek freighter catches fire after crossing Bosporus strait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A fire broke out on a Greek freighter
Tuesday after it crossed the Bosporus Strait.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties or injuries.
	   A thick gray smoke, rising from the ``Marianna'' off Istanbul,
hung over parts of this metropolis. Firefighters on boats rushed to
battle the blaze.
	   It was not clear what caused the fire in the cargo section of
the ship, carrying sheet iron from a Black Sea port, the Anatolia
news agency said.
	   The ship's destination was not clear.
	   The incident comes only two days after Turkish activists staged
a protest pointing out to the danger of heavy traffic posed to this
city of 10 million people.
	   The narrow waterway has been the site of nearly 200 accidents,
many of them fatal, in the past decade.
	   The stakes are rising since Russia proposes to carry Caspian oil
from a Black Sea port through the Bosporus, which Turkey ardently
opposes.

Dutch Prince operated for `malignant condition' in prostate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prince Claus, the husband of Dutch
Queen Beatrix, underwent emergency surgery Tuesday to remove his
prostate gland after doctors discovered what the Royal House
described as ``a malignant condition.''
	   A spokesman speaking on customary condition of anonymity said he
could not be more specific about the condition.
	   German-born Claus, 71, underwent surgery at the Allgemeines
Krankenhaus Barmbek in Hamburg, Germany early Tuesday morning. The
surgery was a success, the Royal House announced in a press
statement.
	   German surgeon Ronald Tauber performed the operation. Claus, who
suffers from Parkinson's disease, chose the surgeon himself. No
further details of the surgery were released.
	   The condition was discovered last week during a checkup in
Hamburg. Surgeons recommended surgery as soon as possible.
	   Claus was expected to spend ``some time'' in hospital recovering
from the surgery, the Royal House statement said.
	   A German aristocrat by birth, Claus married then Princess
Beatrix March 10, 1966 in Amsterdam. The princess' marriage to a
German sparked riots in the Dutch capital where memories of the
brutal World War II occupation of the Netherlands were still fresh.

Scotland fans bought tickets that didn't exist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Scottish soccer fans who bought tickets
from unofficial outlets for Scotland's World Cup opener against
Brazil in Paris may have paid for tickets which don't exist and
could be refused entry to the match.
	   The Independent newspaper reported Tuesday that hundreds of
Scottish fans who had paid for package deals including World Cup
tickets had paid for tickets which did not exist.
	   And travel agents who sold the tickets in good faith fear that
the majority of fans have already arrived in France for Wednesday's
match.
	   The Independent said those affected were those who decided,
against Scottish Football Association recommendations, to buy
tickets from unofficial outlets.
	   The official SFA allocation for the Scotland versus Brazil game
was 5,000 of the 80,000 seats in the stadium.
	   The Independent said a U.S. company thought to be responsible
for supplying the tickets to unofficial outlets has not delivered
them.
	   Glasgow-based travel agent Kelvin Travel reportedly admitted
that it is having to cancel 640 of the 960 World Cup packages it
sold to fans.
	   Scotland fan Jim Dixon, who paid 640 pounds (dlrs 1,043) for
such a package, said staff at Kelvin Travel told him the company
had set up an office in Paris to buy some of the 15,000 tickets
released Monday.
	   Last week the government closed down a company which had
allegedly made 2.4 million pounds (dlrs 3.9 million) by selling
40,000 World Cup seats, but failed to deliver all the tickets.

Yeltsin, Kohl meet on Russia's financial troubles, Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin saying he'll seek meeting with
Milosevic to try to end Kosovo conflict, details. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
Tuesday he would seek a meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to persuade him to end escalating violence in that
country's Kosovo region.
	   But Yeltsin wouldn't say what kind of leverage he might use to
get Milosevic to stop Yugoslav attacks on separatist Kosovo
Albanians, or enter peace talks with them.
	   ``The more softly I speak the better the chances of a meeting,''
Yeltsin said at a news conference following two days of
broad-ranging talks with German officials.
	   ``We will meet and discuss the question of how to get out of
this situation without getting into a big war,'' Yeltsin said,
adding that any deployment of foreign troops in Kosovo would be
``very dangerous.''
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Yeltsin was prepared to ``use his
big influence in Belgrade so that the bloodshed ends as quickly as
possible.''
	   Germany was hoping to get Russia behind the European Union's ban
on investment in the main Yugoslav republic of Serbia. But Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Russia probably wouldn't
join the sanctions, announced Monday and aimed at persuading
Belgrade to negotiate peace in Kosovo.
	   Another focus of the discussion was Russia's market collapse and
fiscal crisis last month following an oil-price drop.
	   The crisis had raised speculation that Germany, Russia's most
important trading partner outside the former Soviet Union, might
offer financial assistance. But the leaders announced no new aid.
	   Kohl said Germany was satisfied with Russian measures taken so
far to deal with the crisis, but did not elaborate. ``We trust that
the Russian government will go further with these reforms,'' Kohl
said.
	   Yeltsin, who has announced a vigorous new tax collection
program, said he was not seeking any new aid or loans. But he said
it was important to have Kohl's ``personal support'' while his
country negotiates loans with the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``On this basis, international investors won't leave our
country,'' he added.
	   The talks were the first in a series of periodic German-Russian
consultations agreed to by Yeltsin and Kohl last year in an effort
to ease Russian concerns over the eastward expansion of NATO.
	   Ministers of finance, economics, foreign affairs, defense,
interior and nuclear energy met with their counterparts on a broad
range of security and trade issues. Yeltsin also met with German
opposition chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Kohl noted it was the first time the two country's interior
ministers had met, underscoring their increasingly ``friendly''
relations.
	   Shortly after arriving in Bonn, Russian and German ministers
signed two agreements dealing with cooperation in the nuclear power
industry.

Eight states demand that nuclear powers disarm within a few years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Eight nations joined Tuesday in pressing
the world's nuclear powers to take immediate steps to dispose of
their arsenals within a few years.
	   ``We are jointly resolved to achieve the goal of a world free
from nuclear weapons,'' said the declaration by the Republic of
Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, South Africa, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico
and Slovenia.
	   The declaration called on India and Pakistan to sign up to the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and for the five nuclear powers _
the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain _ to act on
that treaty's commitments to rid the world of nuclear weapons.
	   Irish Foreign Ministry David Andrews said consultations among
the eight began at the start of the year, before the recent round
of nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
	   ``The collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War
provided opportunities for the final thrust leading to the
elimination of nuclear weapons,'' Andrews told a news conference.
	   ``These opportunities have sadly been squandered in the decade
since then by the international community. The nuclear weapon
states have found new justifications where none exist for the
indefinite retention of their nuclear weapons,'' Andrews said.
	   Andrews said the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obliged
signatories to move toward disarming.
	   ``The failure of the nuclear weapon states to fulfill their
legally binding obligations under the treaty is not the result of
any inadequacy in the treaty itself. It is the result of the lack
of political will,'' Andrews said.
	   ``Today's initiative is about securing that political will so
that in a few short years we will have consigned nuclear weapons to
history.''
	   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the eight nations would be
pursuing their initiative through the United Nations General
Assembly later this year.
	   In their declaration, the eight said: ``We can no longer remain
complacent at the reluctance of the nuclear-weapon states and the
three nuclear-weapons-capable states to take that fundamental and
requisite step, namely a clear commitment to the speedy, final and
total elimination of their nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons
capability, and we urge them to take that step now.''
	   The nuclear-capable states referred to India, Pakistan and
Israel.
	   The declaration called on the nuclear powers to ``abandon
present hair-trigger postures'' by taking weapons off alert and by
deactivating them; to develop measure to ban the production of
fissionable materials, and to engage in pledges not to be the first
to use nuclear weapons.

Wordl Cup: Zidane juggles ball like never before; France looking up
</HEADLINE>
for 1st match &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Zinedine Zidane juggled the ball
like never before Tuesday, easing fears an ankle injury would keep
the star playmaker out of France's opening match against South
Africa.
	   The Juventus Turin ace felt little discomfort from his tender
right ankle that was hurt in Finland last weekend and coach Aime
Jacquet stuck to his plans to build the strategic concept for
Friday's first game around Zidane.
	   At the end of a two-hour training session, Zidane put on a big
smile, happy that three days of uncertainty were behind him.
	   ``I'm OK, I didn't feel any pain,'' said Zidane. ``Now we have
to prepare the match. We're ready.''
	   France is the overwhelming favorite to win the first round Group
C, which also includes Denmark and Saudi Arabia.
	   Jacquet has no illusions whatsoever that the underdog will chose
open and fluent play. The coach knows he will need all the
offensive prowess of Zidane if France is to break down the wall of
11 South Africans in front of their goal.
	   ``It will be something like that. And it is logical,'' he said.
	   He expects little else from Saudi Arabia.
	   Despite criticism for lackluster play over the last three
preparation games, Zidane is confident France will show its true
face in his hometown of Marseille Friday.
	   ``That first match will liberate us. I'm convinced we can do
great things. There is no alternative,'' he said.
	   And he realized it was of no use crying over the tough marking
during the preparation games. It will be the same Friday. ``I'll
always have someone on my back. That is the way it is,'' he said.
	   France's backbone is set, build around a strong and experienced
defense, a solid midfield anchored around captain Didier Deschamps
and creative sparkplugs Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff.
	   The central striker and the second forward remain the main
worry.
	   Based on the team that edged Finland 1-0 last Friday, Jacquet is
expected to start Christophe Dugarry, a tireless worker that weighs
on any defense, before replacing the Marseille forward with a young
challenger like David Trezeguet of Monaco.
	   Even though South Africa is just a rank outsider, the
realization that fireworks won't necessarily be set off is taking
hold.
	   ``All games will be tough. We won't see too many 3-0, 4-0
matches. The important thing is to win them,'' said Zidane.
	   Les Bleus, as the French team is known, will stay for another
two days at its chilly training camp here in the woods southwest of
Paris before heading to the Mediterranean warmth of Marseille on
Thursday, ready for their Coupe du Monde.
	   Training in a strong breeze and temperatures that barely reached
14 C (57 F), many kept their full training gear on, hardly the
ideal conditions to prepare for a summer of soccer.

 &UR; Mandela applauds Blatter's election

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
Tuesday applauded the election of Sepp Blatter to head
international soccer, lauding his commitment to take the World Cup
to South Africa in 2006.
	   ``I speak not only for ... the people of South Africa, but for
the entire African continent and the people of the developing and
underdeveloped countries,'' Mandela said in a statement released in
Johannesburg.
	   Blatter was elected Monday as president of FIFA, defeating UEFA
president Lennart Johansson for the most powerful post in soccer.
	   During a visit to South Africa last month, Blatter promised to
back South Africa's bid for the 2006 World Cup. England, Germany
and possibly Brazil and Argentina are also bidding for the
tournament.
	   ``I am heartened by (this) remarkable display of foresight and
commitment to development of all people around the globe,'' Mandela
said.

Report: Intel says FTC complaint to have no effect on business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The president of Intel Corp. on Tuesday said the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission's anti-monopoly complaint against the
computer chip giant will not have any impact on its business, a
news report said.
	   Intel President Craig Barrett was quoted by Kyodo News agency as
telling reporters in Tokyo that he expects the FTC's complaint to
have ``no impact'' on Intel's business performance, including
development of new products.
	   Barrett said the FTC's administrative complaint before an FTC
Administrative Law judge is based on a mistaken interpretation of
the law and the facts, adding Intel has never committed itself to
any action that could hamper fair competition.
	   The Federal Trade Commission moved Monday to rein in Intel,
claiming it misused its position as the world's leading producer of
chips for personal computers to punish competitors and customers.
	   The FTC antitrust complaint also charged that Intel, which
controls up to 90 percent of the world market for personal computer
chips, abused companies that need its help to develop new products.

Rupee hits closing low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The demand for dollars _ increasing since
dealers deemed the new Indian budget lackluster _ pushed the rupee
to a new low at the end of trading Tuesday.
	   The Indian currency closed at 42.24 rupees to the dollar, down
from the previous close of 41.80. The rupee touched a low during
the day of 42.25.
	   The demand for dollars increased after the Indian budget last
week didn't taken any special measures to encourage foreign direct
or portfolio investments. Even before that, the rupee had been
plummeting.
	   Since the budget was announced last Monday, the State Bank had
been selling dollars to prevent the rupee from falling below 41.80.
But the partly state-owned institution that is India's largest
commercial bank did not sell Tuesday.
	   Shortly before presenting his budget, Finance Minister Jaswant
Sinha said the rupee slide, which traders have linked to
international sanctions imposed following India's five nuclear
tests, was a welcome and orderly devaluation. He added the central
bank, which owns 68 percent of State Bank, had no plans to
intervene.

French government to provide television programs for Laos

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The French government has begun
donating funds to Laos to build a station that will broadcast
France's Channel 5 in the Southeast Asian country, Lao government
radio said Tuesday.
	   French Ambassador Renauld Levy presented dlrs 10,000 to the
Ministry of Information in Vientiane as the first installment of
the fund to build the station.
	   The total cost of project and its completion date was not
contained in the report.
	   The French government will send experts to work on setting up
the station and transmitting French programs with Lao subtitles to
provinces along the Mekong River, government radio said.
	   Laos was a colony of France from 1893 until 1953.

Former foes exchange bodies of soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and Iraq on Tuesday exchanged the
remains of 187 soldiers killed during their 1980-99 war, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Iran handed over the remains of 134 Iraqi soldiers killed during
the eight-year conflict and Iraq delivered the bodies of 53 Iranian
soldiers, the agency said.
	   The exchange of remains took place on the Iran-Iraq border in
the southwestern Khuzestan province in the presence of Iranian and
Iraqi military officials.
	   The war, which killed or wounded at least 1 million people from
both sides, ended with a U.N. brokered cease-fire but animosity has
persisted over the issue of prisoners.
	   Iran has suggested a plan to launch joint search operations in
border areas to locate the remains of soldiers killed during the
war, IRNA said.
	   The two countries are currently carrying such operations in
Shalamcheh in southwest Iran, the agency said.
	   The two countries recently exchanged thousands of prisoners of
war. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
some 75,000 POWs on both sides have been freed since the war ended.

Japan's Parliament approves administrative reform bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament on Tuesday approved an
administrative reform bill to streamline the country's bloated
bureaucracy by cutting the number of ministries and government
agencies.
	   The bill was passed by the upper house of Parliament with the
backing of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's ruling coalition. The
measure had already been approved by Parliament's more powerful
lower house.
	   A key policy objective of Hashimoto's administration, the law
will cut the number of Japan's ministries and other government
agencies from 22 to 13 within five years.
	   It will also bolster the power of the prime minister in
policy-making and require any new public corporations to adopt
accounting techniques used in the private sector.
	   Critics, however, charge that the changes will be largely
cosmetic. The bill, they say, will only merge existing ministries
without significant downsizing.
	   The government will now move to set up an administrative reform
headquarters later this month, to be headed by Hashimoto.
	   A key aspect of the new bill will be to allow the prime minister
to propose the agenda at Cabinet meetings. Up to now, bureaucrats
have been dictating what ministers discuss at the meetings.
	   Under the new law, the number of government employees also is
expected to be cut by 10 percent over the next decade.

Del Piero glad about recovery, looking forward to comeback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, delighted to be off
the injury list, said he does not feel disappointed over his
expected exclusion from Italy's World Cup opener against Chile.
	   The young striker will be replaced by his former Juventus
teammate Roberto Baggio in Thursday's match at Bordeaux but is
looking forward to regain his place on the starting 11 in the next
game against Cameroon.
	   ``I'm happy to be here, recovered, after fearing to miss the
World Cup,'' Del Piero said at Italy's training camp Tuesday. ``I
am optimistic now and I think to be ready for the match against
Cameroon.''
	   Italy, a three-time World Champion, plays the African team on
June 17 in its second match of Group B.
	   Considered the jewel of the Italian team and a key to the
``Azzurri'' fortunes in the World Cup, Del Piero healed a right
thigh strain suffered in the Champions Cup final against Real
Madrid but still is questionable form following ten days of light
training.
	   His exclusion from Thursday's match with Chile had been
suggested by coach Cesare Maldini on Sunday when he tested the
offensive duo of Baggio and Christian Vieri in a tuneup against an
amateur team while Del Piero trained on his own.
	   Del Piero, who replaced Baggio at Juventus and on the national
team, said he could not see any sign of doom or rivalry in the fact
that his older teammate is going to substitute him, this time.
	   ``There is no rivalry with Roberto. We are good friends. I hope
he plays a great match against Chile. It would be better for coach
Maldini to chose between two fit, good players for the match
against Cameroon,'' Del Piero explained.
	   Baggio, 31, also defused controversy saying he traveled to
France as Del Piero's substitute and that he was ready to sit on
the substitutes bench once the ``Golden Boy'' is ruled fit.
	   Baggio, Italy's Word Cup hero in 1994, earned a last-minute
place on the Italian team scoring 22 goals in league matches with
low-ranked Bologna, following a lackluster season with AC Milan.
	   Del Piero had one of his best seasons ever with Juventus this
year scoring 21 goals in league matches and becoming the highest
scorer in the history of the Champions League, with 10 goals.
	   Del Piero said he could feel the psychological pressure of being
in the World Cup ``and I'm sure it's going to grow day after day.''
	   ``We all are prepared to face it. It's a great experience for
me. I have a true passion for soccer. I want to take revenge with
the national team for the bitter defeat suffered with La Juve in
the Champions Cup final,'' Del Piero said.

Bewildered Parisians look on as World Cup fever strikes

	   PARIS (AP) _ Suddenly, the cuisine consists mainly of cheap
supermarket beer. The latest fashion accessory in the city of chic?
A polyester soccer shirt with your hero's name on the back.
	   World Cup fever finally gripped Paris Tuesday as thousands of
soccer fans, mainly Scots in kilts and Brazilians in yellow,
arrived on the eve of their countries' opening game Wednesday.
	   For some, it was a fascinating mix of fans from across the
world. For others, a rude culture shock.
	   ``Are they really going to drink all that?'' said middle-aged
Parisian Betty Teyssier as she watched a dozen Scots tucking into
crates of beer off the Champs Elysees. ``How long does this last? I
need to leave the city.''
	   Near the Place de la Concorde, where tens of thousands were to
gather later Tuesday for World Cup parades, a bemused police
officer looked on as Heimo Harma, from Finland, waved the flag of
his local team, Rovaniemi, in his face.
	   ``I have a ticket for the game! Brazil, Brazil!'' he shouted,
grinning. ``I've come from the Arctic Circle. Brazil, Brazil!''
	   After five years of planning, French organizers are lamenting
that World Cup fever hasn't caught on among the French.
	   Jacques Lambert, director of the World Cup organizing committee,
said Tuesday that with hindsight he would seek ``to mobilize France
and the French from the very beginning.''
	   Former soccer great Michel Platini accused authorities of
turning their back on the tournament, and ``not giving a damn.'' He
says authorities will realize their mistake once all the fans
arrive.
	   The spirit was certainly there Tuesday, although most was
imported. Many of the fans didn't have tickets, and were just
soaking up the atmosphere.
	   Roberto Rosenthal, his Argentine shirt carrying the name of
striker Gabriel Batistuta, had taken a dlrs 7,000 loan to get to
the World Cup, and had no idea when he'd be able to pay it back.
	   ``It's expensive, but a once-in-a-life-time,'' he said. ``And I
know we'll win.''
	   Derek Christie, a Scot, was planning his day ahead of
Wednesday's match for which he had a precious ticket.
	   ``Aye, it's a fine city, but expensive. I need to find a
supermarket for beer, and a place where I can barter prices down so
I can return home with affordable perfumes and aftershave.''
	   Christie, camping on the outskirts of Paris for dlrs 7 a night,
said he fancied Scotland to beat the world champions.
	   ``It's about time we had something to cheer,'' he said.
	   Towering above him was an orange giant depicting one of the many
nationalities participating in the World Cup.
	   On a city bridge earlier Tuesday, workers frantically tried to
patch up diaper-like shorts on a yellow Asian giant damaged by
overnight rain and wind. Traffic had been cut off all around.
	   ``What a pain!'' shouted a woman passing on a bicycle, almost
falling into traffic as she gesticulated at the yellow blob.

Greece intensifies demands for return of marbles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece intensified its call Tuesday for
the return of the Elgin Marbles after revelations that British
Museum staff damaged the sculptures by cleaning them with copper
scrapers and caustic chemicals.
	   ``Britain's position is that they preserve the marbles better
than anyone else in the world and they don't need the help of a
southern European country,'' Evangelos Venizelos said. ``This
argument is a provocation.''
	   In the third edition of his book, ``Lord Elgin and the Marbles''
published Monday, historian William St. Clair says British Museum
workmen in 1937-38 removed paint and chisel marks from the
sculptures in the mistaken belief that the white marble underneath
was the original surface.
	   The cleaning irreparably damaged the historic patina in places,
St. Clair said.
	   Venizelos said he will send a formal request to British Heritage
Secretary Chris Smith proposing the formation of an international
committee to evaluate the conditions under which the 2,500 year-old
sculptures are kept.
	   St. Clair has also accepted an invitation to visit Greece in
July and brief archaeologists on the marbles' condition, the
culture minister said.
	   Greece now will deal with the marbles as a political issue,
Venizelos added, as Britain's ``tragic technical and scientific
mistakes'' prove there can no longer be an argument over which
country is better suited to care for them.
	   A new Acropolis Museum which could house the marbles under
suitable conditions in Athens is scheduled to be completed by 2003.
It will have a room for the sculptures that the government has
promised will stand empty until they are returned.
	   The marbles _ 17 figures and part of a frieze more than 160
yards (meters) long _ have been housed in the British Museum in
London since the early 19th century after Lord Elgin, then
Britain's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, removed them from
Athens' ancient Parthenon atop the Acropolis.
	   Last week, Smith assured the House of Commons the marbles would
be staying in Britain despite Greece's longstanding insistence on
their return. ``They have been kept in very good condition,'' he
told lawmakers.

Yugoslavia assails renewed Kosovo sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kosovo Serbs meeting U.S. diplomat, reaction by
Montenegrin premier, Albanians collecting funds for their cause. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia on Tuesday denounced new
international sanctions over its offensive in Kosovo, where a
western strip of the separatist province has been turned into a war
zone of burned houses and deserted villages.
	   In a statement issued on the official Tanjug news agency,
Yugoslav officials called the imposition of sanctions a ``strange
and unreasonable decision.''
	   The comment came in response to decisions made by the European
Union and the United States within hours of each other on Monday,
banning new investments in Serbia and freezing its assets abroad.
	   ``It's cynical to demand from Yugoslavia to withdraw troops from
its own province and leave it to the mercy of Albanian
terrorists,'' said the Tanjug commentary.
	   Official Belgrade also was offended that the punishment is only
against Serbia. Its lone partner in the Yugoslav federation,
Montenegro, is exempted because of its pro-Western leadership.
	   ``This is the first case that EU has made a decision about a
sovereign state that applies to only one of its federal units,''
the Tanjug commentary said.
	   Montenegro's Premier Filip Vujanovic said that exempting
Montenegro would be difficult in practice as that would require ``a
border'' between the two republics and that is ``out of the
question.''
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, had welcomed the
new sanctions on Monday but said they were only a ``small step''
compared to the situation on the ground.
	   Ethnic Albanians form a 90 percent majority living in Serbia's
southern province. More than 250 have died this year in clashes
between government forces and the pro-independence Albanian
militants, known as Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The international community has ruled out any change of borders
but wants Serbia to restore the autonomy Kosovo once enjoyed.
	   There were no immediate reports of new clashes Tuesday in
Kosovo.
	   The destruction in the southern Serb province has increased the
international outcry for Serbia to stop using its police and army
against ethnic Albanians. NATO is considering military
intervention.
	   Exiled Kosovo Albanian political leaders on Tuesday announced
they would collect an extra tax from an estimated 400,000 Kosovo
Albanians living in the west to finance the ``defense of our
people'' from attacks by government forces. They didn't say how
they would do this.
	   In 1993 Kosovo Albanians established a parallel system of
administration involving collecting taxes and financing education
and health care for Albanians.
	   The announcement made by the Germany-based Kosovo Albanian
government-in-exile was published Tuesday in Albanian-language
papers in Kosovo, saying every Albanian working in the West would
have to contribute to the ``obligatory financial mobilization''
with an equivalent of dlrs 300-600.
	   Also on Tuesday, a group of Serbs living in Kosovo and
dissatisfied with Milosevic's policy in the province met with
Richard Miles, the most senior U.S. diplomat in Yugoslavia.
	   A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Miles told them the United States want to see meaningful
negotiations between the sides and will ``apply a form of pressure
on the government, and also on the Albanian side.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday the United States has not ruled out military options to stop
violence in Kosovo.
	   Carl Bildt, formerly the European Union's high representative in
Bosnia and still an influential figure regarding policy on former
Yugoslavia, harshly criticized Western officials in a commentary
published Tuesday for being indecisive and slow. He warned of a
``huge humanitarian and political disaster'' if swift actions
aren't taken.
	   He urged that troops be deployed to northern Albania to close
the border, that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Kosovo and threaten
air strikes against remaining Serb forces, and that the Kosovo
Liberation Army's sponsors in Europe and the United States be
pressured to get the KLA to halt military operations.
	   ``Kosovo is a testing ground,'' Bildt wrote in the Financial
Times of London. ``Here we will see if the lessons of the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia have been learned. So far, there are only faint
signs that this has been the case.''

Dutch captain may miss first World Cup game after injuring ankle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch captain Frank de Boer may
miss the Netherlands' first World Cup qualifying match after
injuring his ankle in training, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said
Tuesday.
	   De Boer, 27, twisted his left ankle Monday. He stood on the
sidelines during team training Tuesday, his injured ankle bandaged.
	   ``We will see how he reacts today and tomorrow,'' Hiddink said.
``He is receiving treatment.'' No decision will be made until
Friday on whether De Boer can play in the Netherlands' opening
World Cup Group E match Saturday against Belgium in St. Denis.
	   Left-footed defender De Boer, who missed the Euro 96 tournament
in England with a similar injury, hobbled off the training pitch at
Amsterdam's Arena stadium Monday after falling during training.
	   Barcelona defender Winston Bogarde is De Boer's most likely
replacement alongside Jaap Stam in the center of the Dutch defense.
	   Another injured Dutch star, Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp,
went through light training Tuesday as he fights to regain fitness
in the wake of a six-week layoff caused by a hamstring injury.
	   Hiddink said the prognosis for Bergkamp was improving. It had
been feared that Bergkamp would miss not only the Belgium match,
but also the Netherlands' second qualifying tie, against South
Korea June 20 in Marseille.
	   ``I don't have a great deal of faith he will be fit (for
Belgium) but before Korea we have another week so I think it should
be okay,'' Hiddink said.

Chelsea signs Spanish defender
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates with Ferrer quotes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli continued his
off-season international recruitment drive, signing Spanish right
back Albert Ferrer for five years in a reported 2.2 million pound
(dlrs 3.6 million) deal.
	   The European Cup Winners Cup champions lured the Spanish
international from Barcelona five days before he kicks off his
World Cup campaign for Spain against Nigeria in Nantes.
	   ``I'm sad to be leaving Barcelona,'' Ferrer said Tuesday at the
Spanish World Cup team base in Chantilly, north of Paris. ``I
didn't want to leave but I'm happy to be joining another great
European club.''
	   Chelsea adds Ferrer to a list of recent international signings,
including a club record 5.4 million pound (dlrs 8.8 million) deal
with Italian Pierluigi Casiraghi two weeks ago.
	   Ferrer, who turned 28 Saturday, has a wealth of international
experience. He has 35 caps for Spain, the 1992 Olympic gold medal,
as well as five Spanish League championship medals, the European
Cup and two Cup Winner's Cups.
	   Ferrer, known as ``Chapi'' in Spain, has made 330 league and cup
appearances for Barcelona since 1990. He is a terrier-like defender
and a regular Spanish team starter.
	   ``I hope to debut for Chelsea on August 28 in the Supercup game
against Real Madrid,'' he said. ``I will go all out to help win
that game as it is important to begin a new period by winning.''
	   Ferrer declined to comment on Barcelona coach Louis Van Gaal's
decision to let him go, saying ``that's his opinion.''
	   ``But I hope to demonstrate with Chelsea that I am still able to
play at top level soccer,'' he said.

World Cup: Troussier puts positive spin on South African chances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Facing long odds and crushing pressure,
South African coach Philippe Troussier wants his players to believe
they can overcome any World Cup challenge.
	   So when asked Tuesday to assess Bafana Bafana's chances against
favored France in their opening Group C match Friday, he shrugged
his shoulders and said: ``100 percent.''
	   For Troussier, it was another opportunity to deliver the
unexpected by putting positive spin on his situation _ a new coach
of a team making its first World Cup appearance against the host
nation.
	   He wasn't predicting South Africa would beat France, but instead
saying his players must believe they can do so for it to happen.
	   ``Some times the match is not about potential,'' said Troussier,
who took over as coach in March. ``It's about playing under much
pressure.''
	   A Frenchman who has coached in Africa for a decade, Troussier
knows the French mentality, particularly how the crowd can turn if
the home team fails to start well. He wants South Africa to stymie
the French attack early to quiet the fans in Marseilles, all the
while looking for attacking opportunities.
	   ``Sometimes the best defense is a good attack,'' he said.
	   Attacker Shaun Bartlett said Troussier is telling his players to
think to concentrate on winning the first half.
	   ``His idea is that if you can compress and contain a team for
one half and score a goal, that's good enough,'' Bartlett
explained. ``He says he has more players on the bench to help out
in the next half. He doesn't want us running ourselves ragged for
90 minutes.''
	   To remove some of the pressure from the opening match, Troussier
constantly reminds players and journalists that the other two Group
C opponents _ Denmark and Saudi Arabia _ are equally important.
	   Stressing discipline, he has warned his players that promised
red cards for tackling from behind would devastate South Africa's
chances of achieving its main goal _ advancing to the second round.
	   ``For sure, it will be a rough game physically,'' he said about
France.
	   Troussier's positive spin also surfaced when he was asked about
injuries, particularly the bruised heel that kept captain Lucas
Radebe of Leeds United from practicing Monday and Tuesday.
	   ``For us nobody is injured. Everything is okay,'' Troussier
said, adding that Radebe simply needed 48 hours of rest after the
long English season and his South African commitments.
	   But Troussier also downplayed the possible loss of the captain,
saying all his players were capable of filling the role if Radebe
missed Friday's match.

patrol its borders. Now, one official said Tuesday, intervention
could be on the agenda.
	   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Scrambling to avoid a power vacuum in the wake

	   THE government is bracing for a head-on collision with Executive
Councillors and political parties over the controversial Expo 2001.
	   It is believed that the Economic Services Bureau is reluctant to
approve the exposition because it may not be cost-effective.
	   But a number of Executive Councillors and political parties are
pushing for the project in the hopes of reviving the tourism
industry.
	   A spokeswoman for the Economic Services Bureau said bureau
officials were still reviewing the proposal.
	   ``After the bureau decides, it has to go through the Exco so we
are not expecting any announcement until next month,'' she said.
	   Outbound Travel Agents Association president Ronnie Ho Pak-ting
said it had already rejected the idea.
	   ``I think the government is not convinced that the project will
attract enough tourists and it could be a waste of taxpayers
money,'' he said.
	   Mr Ho said his association and a number of key players in the
industry shared the government's view.
	   ``We would prefer the government to concentrate on projects
which have long-term impact in attracting tourists rather than
funding ad hoc projects.'' Mr Ho said the government could use the
$2 billion injection into the project to build new facilities with
long-term impact.
	   ``There may be disagreements between the government and
politicians on this issue but I hope the government will consider
what is good for the community,'' he said.
	   It is believed that most Executive Councillors, including Henry
Tang Ying-yen and Exco Convenor Chung Sze-yuen support the
exposition.
	   Like the Hong Kong Tourist Association, which proposed the
project, executive councillors believe the project will help
encourage tourists to visit Hong Kong and generate much needed
jobs.
	   Executive councillors believe that the government should inject
funds into the project because it will provide long-term benefits
for the community.
	   The proposal is for the exposition to be held at the southern
part of the West Kowloon Reclamation for a period of six months in
2001.
	   The 54.5 hectare area will feature various attractions including
theatres, public plazas and a waterfront promenade.
	   The project will aim at attracting an attendance level of 19.4
million.
	   At least three million tourists are expected to generate about
$29 billion.

	   EXECUTIVE Council convenor Chung Sze-yuen has for the first time
publicly predicted the budget for this financial year will end in
the red.
	   This was due mainly to poor land sale receipts and advanced
infrastructure works to create jobs.
	   Mr Chung made the remarks after visiting the Equal Opportunities
Commission and was asked by reporters to comment on the growing
pressure from academics and politicians for a deficit budget for
the next financial year to fight the threat of an economic
recession.
	   ``The land sale revenue will definitely decrease following a
slide in the property market this year, and the public is demanding
the government delay freeing land to the market under its five-year
land sale program,'' he said.
	   ``But at the same time, the government has to create more jobs
this year by starting infrastructure works earlier than scheduled.
That will increase its expenditure.
	   ``Thus, government income will be less than budgeted and
expenses will increase and finally, a deficit will result.'' But Mr
Chung did not comment on whether the government should plan a
deficit budget for fiscal 1999-2000.
	   ``It still has nine months to go (for the new budget). It's too
early to decide whether we should have a deficit budget or not.''
Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said he would stick
to the Basic Law when drafting the budget next year.
	   Speaking after inaugurating the new Air Mail Centre at Chek Lap
Kok, Sir Donald said it was too early to say if the budget proposal
for next year would be a deficit one or not.
	   He said he would maintain the principle of controlling spending
in accordance with economic growth.
	   Sir Donald went on to say that a one-year deficit budget would
not be the answer to all the current problems.
	   ``The most important thing is how to improve Hong Kong's
business environment to increase job vacancies and attract
investment,'' he said.
	   In yet another ominous hint that Hong Kong's economy was
hurtling towards a recession, Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), admitted that Hong
Kong's growth would remain slow through the third quarter of this
year.
	   Talking in Basle, Switzerland, where he is attending the annual
meeting of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr Yam said:
``My guess is that the second quarter would not be good, either,
because the first half of last year was quite buoyant and we are
talking about year-on-year comparisons.'' He added that the third
quarter may not be good either.
	   ``I have been saying that things may get worse before they get
better. One's got to be realistic about the sort of situation that
we are facing,'' Mr Yam said.
	   Meanwhile, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa told a visiting
European Parliament delegation that Hong Kong was experiencing a
credit crunch which has worsened because of the fear of an attack
on the dollar peg.
	   ``Hong Kong's economy needs to be corrected if we are to regain
our competitiveness.'' Mr Tung said it would take time for the
fiscal stimuli to take effect.

	   The two-day long march to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) by
the BNP-led 7-party alliance to press for scrapping the agreement
on the CHT begins from Dhaka city today morning.
	   Marchers from the northern and south-western districts started
arriving in Dhaka from yesterday afternoon in buses and other
transports. In Dhaka final touches were given to the preparations
to hold the march peacefully.
	   Reports of clashes between the supporters and opponents of the
march in different parts of the country reached Dhaka yesterday.
The administration was taking some undeclared precautionary
measures to discourage people from participating in the march. The
measures included requisitioning of heavy vehicles and microbuses
in Dhaka and house to house campaigning in Khagrachhari asking the
people not to participate in it.
	   While the government has termed the march a programme to
destabilise the CHT peace, the opposition termed it a rehearsal to
safeguard the country's independence and sovereignty.
	   Campaigning in favour of the march continued while posters and
leaflets were distributed in Dhaka city and other district towns
yesterday.
	   Amid speculations of violence with rival political workers along
the route, the National Standing Committee of the BNP had a meeting
last evening to take necessary precautions.
	   The long march of the BNP begins from the Paltan Maidan after a
rally to be addressed by BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia. The programme
of Jamaat-e-Islami begins from Ramna Square.
	   Leaders and workers of five other parties of the 7-party
alliance will take part in the march with the BNP and the Jamaat.
	   The march is scheduled to reach Chittagong by this evening. On
the way more motor vehicles carrying long marchers from different
districts and thanas would join the convoy at different points.
There would be brief rallies at such points including Comilla and
Feni. Long marchers would make a night halt at Chittagong.
	   From there the long march of the BNP would proceed towards
Khagrachhari. Jamaat's long march will proceed towards Rangamati.
BNP's long march would end after the holding of a rally at
Khagrachhari early in the afternoon on Wednesday. Jamaat would end
its long march after holding a rally at Rangamati on the same day.
	   Meanwhile, the police administration in Dhaka requisitioned at
least 350 town service buses and mini-buses apparently in a bid to
prevent the marchers from hiring those for the programme.
	   By yesterday evening the streets of Dhaka city were almost
stripped of buses and mini-buses. Members of the travelling public
were seen crowding bus stops to take trips. They also had to take
alternative modes of transport. Office-goers were the worst
sufferers as they got stuck-up on their way back home late in the
afternoon.
	   Police also started searching the buses carrying the marchers to
the city at Aricha and Daulatdia ghats and at Manikganj. Police
said that they tried to make sure none carried weapons. At least
one hundred buses coming from the northern and south-western
districts drove to Dhaka city via Manikganj by 9-30 pm.
	   The BNP and its front organisations brought out processions in
different parts of Dhaka city to drum up support for the march.
Workers of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh also brought out similar
processions.
	   To maintain discipline during the programme, the BNP issued
leaflets containing instructions to the marchers. About 2,000
stickers were prepared by yesterday evening as serial numbers for
the motor vehicles that would be taken to the long march.
	   The first 50 motor vehicles of the march would carry volunteers
who would be responsible for maintenance of discipline.
	   Cars carrying national leaders would be positioned after every
ten vehicles carrying the volunteers. There would be one ambulance
after every 20 motor vehicles to attend to the marchers who fell
sick.
	   One motor vehicle carrying volunteers would be positioned after
every 25 motor vehicles of the long march.
	   In another leaflet marchers have been advised about how to
protect themselves from the scorching heat and avoid getting
dehydrated. They also have been advised to carry dry food, water
and packets of oral saline.
	   The front organisations of BNP and its district and thana units
would use separate banners on motor vehicles for proper
identification.
	   Last night long marchers coming from northern and southern
districts were sheltered under a tarpaulin erected on the premises
of the Minto Road official residence of Begum Khaleda Zia, also the
leader of the opposition in Parliament.
	   To maintain law and order in the capital during the CHT Long
March programme, the government would deploy over 3000 law
enforcing agency personnel including Bangladesh Rifles (BDR).
	   Sources in Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told The Independent
last night that 166 police officers including 7 Deputy
Commissioners (DC) would supervise the operation.
	   DMP Commissioner Mahmud Al-Farid yesterday at a session briefed
the supervising officers about their duties. He directed them to
ensure safe passage to the marchers and maintain peace in the city,
the sources said.
	   The supervising officers include 9 ADCs, 5 Assistant
Commissioners (AC), 14 Inspectors, 82 Sub-Inspectors, 22 Sergeants
and 9 Assistant Sub-Inspectors.
	   Our Narayangonj Correspondent reported last night that the
district police administration would deploy a total 700 police
personnel at 13 sensitive spots on the Dhaka-Chittagong and
Dhaka-Sylhet highways as part of security measures.
	   Police sources said that of the total 700 personnel, 100 would
be members of the Armed Police Battalion.
	   Two of the 13 named spots have been identified as the ``most
sensitive points'' as the district unit of the ruling Awami League
(AL), is scheduled to hold ``peace- rally'' at Shimrail Crossing
near Muktee Smarani under Bandar thana and Mograpara under
Sonargaon thana. Other spots are - Munshirkhola and Panchabati
under Fatullah thana, Chashara at Narayangonj town, Thanarpar, Old
Demra Road, Galakata bridge and Madanpur under Bander thana,
Kanchpur Bridge under Sonargaon and Meghnaghat under Sonargaon,
Purinda under Araihazar and Bhulta under Rupgonj thana.
	   Additional Police Super Dr Abdur Rahman would coordinate the
duties while ASP (Headquarters) Abu Baker take position near
Kanchpur bridge round the clock.
	   Our Staff Reporter from Feni adds: The district administration
has doubled its police force and planned to deploy para-military
troops, to avert any violence here during today's long march while
the restive local activists of both, the ruling party and the main
opposition BNP have taken up respective programmes.
	   According to sources, local BNP leaders and activists will
receive the convoy of the long march at the Feni-Comilla border and
escort it to Mohipal where BNP chief and former prime minister
Begum Khaleda Zia is expected to address a rally on the way to
Khagrachhari.
	   The Local Awami League, however, vowed to resist it if there was
any untoward incident in the name of long march. Earlier at a
meeting ruling party leader Joynal Abedin Hajari MP also said that
his workers would resist any vandalism in the name of long march.
	   Sources said that the district administration had pointed out
nine vulnerable points in Feni, the ancestral home district of
Begum Zia along the highway to Chittagong.
	   The Deputy Commissioner Noor Mohammad said ``We have taken the
strongest precautionary measures to avert any untoward incident
during the long march programme''.
	   Sources in the local administration said that the most sensitive
points would include Mohipal, Mohammad Ali, Fatehpur, Dagon
Bhuiyan, Rampur, Lalpool, Mohoriganj and Shuvapur.
	   They said that at least one platoon of police force under a
magistrate would be deployed in each of the vulnerable points.
	   ``We have asked for additional forces and three platoons of
para-military force, BDR, which will be added to our local forces
to maintain law and order in the areas,'' said Superintendent of
Police Kazi Anwar Hossain.
	   Our Mirersarai correspondent adds: Thirteen persons were injured
in Mirersarai in Chittagong district today when the a procession
and miking when a group of the supporters of the long march came
under attack from the rivals. One person was missing. Six persons
were injured in the attack. Two persons were injured when a bomb
was hurled at a taxi engaged in miking in support of the long march
at about 3 pm.
	   Four persons were injured and another remained missing when a
procession of Jamaat-e-Islami came under attack near Abur hat at
about 3.30 pm.
	   Tension was prevailing in Mirersarai. Chhatra League workers
have held a rally and procession against the long march.
	   Our Bandarban Correspondent adds: A group of long marchers led
by seven-party alliance leader Kazi Zafar Ahmed would reach
Bandarban tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.
	   The Deputy Commissioner of Bandarban this morning held a meeting
with the leaders of 7-party alliance. Leaders of BNP, Jamaat and JP
(Z-M) attended the meeting.
	   The ruling party leader of Bandarban Bir Bahadur MP visited
different parts of the town yesterday. He said the people of
Bandarban want peace. He said the ruling party had no counter
programme in Bandarban against the march.
	   Our Chandpur Correspondent adds: A big procession organised by
the district units of BNP and JCD in support of the long march
paraded streets of the town yesterday afternoon. A roadside rally
was held later near Railway court Station. SA Sultan Titu presided
and local MPs and leaders of BNP spoke. The long march will start
from Hasan Ali High School at 8 am tomorrow (Tuesday), said
organisation sources.

Jewish leader says Sweden must assess its World War II behavior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ In its investigation of whether
property of Holocaust victims remains in the country, a Swedish
commission should do a moral accounting as well as a tally of
tangible items, the secretary-general of the World Jewish Congress
said Tuesday.
	   ``We don't just want a bean-counting,'' Israel Singer said at a
news conference. ``That's the least interesting part of the
story.''
	   Singer spoke after meetings with Prime Minister Goeran Persson
and the government commission looking into Jewish property. The WJC
was a prime mover in encouraging Sweden to form the commission,
which is expected to present its report in December.
	   Sweden was neutral in World War II, during which it sold Nazi
Germany goods critical to the war effort, including steel and ball
bearings. Germany paid for the goods in gold, much of which was
returned by Sweden after the war to countries from which the Nazis
had looted it.
	   Despite the return, questions had hovered for decades about
whether other property belonging to Jews had ended up in Sweden and
the government formed the investigation commission last year.
	   Already, the commission has identified more than 600 bank
accounts that had been dormant since the war and that may have
belonged to Jews.
	   Singer said that such developments were welcome, but that he
believes the most important question for the commission to assess
is ``what did Sweden do in World War II and what does Sweden think
of this in 1998.''
	   That is an uncomfortable question for many in Sweden, which both
traded with Adolf Hitler's regime and rescued tens of thousands of
people from it.
	   The Wallenberg family _ often referred to as ``Sweden's
Rockefellers'' _ encompassed the two poles, with Raoul Wallenberg
lionized for his role in saving some 17,000 Hungarian Jews while
his cousins Jacob and Marcus led business dealings with Germany.
	   Singer said the commission's moral assessment should not be a
finger-pointing or an apology. ``I don't know anybody whose
behavior was impeccable'' during the war,'' he said. ``Basically in
Europe there are only gray figures.''
	   ``They don't owe us a `sorry.' They owe themselves the truth,''
he said.

Events in Kosovo unfolding faster than NATO can plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Military events in Kosovo are unfolding
almost faster than NATO military planners can plan.
	   Just a few days ago, the generals were focusing on military
exercises and dispatching troops to help Albania and Macedonia deal
with refugees and patrol borders. Now, as one senior NATO official
put it Tuesday, ``We are contemplating more challenging options,
which could include intervention.''
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo since Mar. 1 in
escalating clashes between government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, armed wing of the Albanian independence movement.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the larger of
the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose the rebels' demands for independence and condemn violence on
both sides.
	   In recent days entire villages in Kosovo have been flattened and
thousands of people driven from their homes, making the need for
action more urgent if the crisis is not to erupt into a wider
Balkan war.
	   Twelve days ago, NATO foreign ministers agreed to enhance
military exercises in Albania and Macedonia as a way of increasing
the military presence there. A NATO assessment team is still the
region looking at future options. But as a senior NATO official
said, speaking anonymously: ``With the events of the last week,
shoring up the periphery seems of secondary value.''
	   NATO defense ministers meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday for
discussions certain to be dominated by Kosovo. It is expected they
will order the military to start looking at direct intervention in
Kosovo.
	   Exactly what form such action might take is unclear. Some have
suggested air strikes against Serbian forces, or a no-fly zone. But
military moves that may deter the Serbs may not necessary work
against the insurgents.
	   Any significant move away from the current focus of preventive
deployment along the borders to active military intervention will
require, as one NATO official put it, ``significant political
guidance.''
	   ``We have to see what direction our governments want us to move
in,'' he said.
	   Another official said there is an ``emerging consensus'' toward
direct military action, if not on the specifics.
	   The British, backed by the Americans, are pushing for a U.N.
Security Council Resolution authorizing ``all necessary measures''
to deal with the situation in Kosovo, including intervention. This
would be a sufficient legal basis, but requires the Russians go
along.
	   Until now, Moscow has opposed any direct move against the
Belgrade government of Slobodan Milosevic.
	   NATO officials say there are other legal bases for conducting
such an operation, but are vague about exactly what they are.
	   ``If we can't get that resolution, we'll have to find another
legal basis to act, if action is necessary,'' said the senior
official.
	   The 15-nation European Union and the United States have slapped
a ban on all investments in Serbia and frozen Yugoslav assets
abroad, though Molosevic has not shown himself particularly
susceptible to sanctions in the past.
	   ``We have learned the Serbs don't respond to pressure unless it
is military pressure,'' said the senior official.

Italy's prime minister confident about NATO vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
Tuesday that his government's stability will not be shaken by a
parliament vote later this month on NATO.
	   Italy's conservative opposition, which won a majority of
municipal elections last Sunday, has threatened to veto the NATO
bill in the lower house of parliament. The move could force a vote
of confidence.
	   ``We can't forget that the NATO proposal has passed in one
chamber of parliament,'' said Prodi during a visit to Germany. If
the opposition were to vote against the proposal, it would be ``the
opposition's problem, not mine.''
	   The Italian senate last month approved the enlargement of NATO
to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and Prodi's
center-left coalition received the support he needed from the
conservative opposition.
	   But in the lower house vote, expected June 23 or 24, Prodi's
coalition could need opposition support because its far-left ally,
the Rifondazione Comunista, is against NATO's expansion.

	   CHIEF Executive Tung Chee-hwa yesterday met with a visiting
delegation from the European Parliament and briefed them on the
latest developments in Hong Kong.
	   The two sides also discussed issues ranging from the evolution
of democracy and the economy in Hong Kong since it returned to
Chinese rule in July last year and future links with the European
Community.
	   On the development of democracy Mr Tung said the process was
enshrined in the Basic Law, which sets a 10-year timetable leading
to full elections including for the post of chief executive.
	   ``The development of democracy must comply with the timetable
set out in the Basic Law. The Basic Law is our constitution and was
written after four years' consultation and should not be amended
lightly,'' he said.
	   Reiterating Hong Kong was going through a difficult period of
economic adjustment, Mr Tung said years of high property prices,
high wages and negative interest rates had built a bubble economy.
	   ``We are experiencing a credit crunch which has worsened because
of the fear of an attack on the linked rate (between the Hong Kong
dollar and the US dollar). Tourism and consumer spending have also
taken a downturn.
	   ``Hong Kong's economy needs to be corrected if we are to regain
our competitiveness.'' The government had foreseen difficulties
ahead when drawing up the 1998-99 budget early this year and
introduced tax reductions and expenditure increases totalling $53
billion or 4 per cent of GDP.
	   ``This has been done well within the principle of prudent
financial management,'' Mr Tung said, adding it would take time for
these efforts to take effect.
	   The chief executive expressed optimism about the future, saying
its economic fundamentals remain sound and economic development on
the mainland is going well.
	   Turning to Europe, Mr Tung said that he was impressed by the
achievements of the European Union in its convergence on the Euro
and in other areas.

	   Preparations have been completed in the port city of Chittagong
to welcome thousands of people coming in a long march towards
Khagrachhari.
	   The big political showdown is being organised by the BNP and its
allies including Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh to register their
protest against the peace accord on CHT and the consequent passage
of law giving it a legal ever.
	   Briefing newsmen at the party office here at Nasimon Bhaban this
afternoon, Oli Ahmed, the convener of long march supervisory
committee, said the programme was going to be a historic event in
safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of the country.
	   The long marchers, are scheduled to reach Chittagong by tomorrow
evening, but the advance group of volunteers are active to make the
long march a grand success.
	   Two big pandals have been set up at the outer stadium and in
front of Nasimon Bhaban to accommodate the marchers. They will stay
overnight there and will be entertained by the JASAS and the JISAS
cultural groups with cultural function.
	   WASA and the city corporation have extended facilities to supply
drinking water to ten different points and the places of gathering.
Five thousand volunteers have also been deployed to look after the
marchers.

long march organisers to shun politics of anarchy and work for the
economic prosperity of Chittagong.

each ward of the corporation to promote peace and development in
the port city.
	   Meanwhile, BNP city unit north and south district units held
rallies in different wards and at key points at thana sadar today

Chowdhury said as commercial capital of the country, Chittagong
should be kept free from all trouble so that foreign investment was
not affected and business could be carried on smoothly.
	   According to report received from Khagrachhari, ruling Awami
League and its front organisations have organised a meeting and
procession in the district headquarters denouncing the opposition
long march. A good number of tribesmen attended the meeting.

	   Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad has urged the opposition not
to play foul games to destabilise the peace and harmony in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts.
	   He blamed the BNP and its allies of doing so in all possible
ways. ``They do not want peace to prevail in that area. Their long
march is the latest in the series of their plan to disturb peace
and harmony in the region,'' he added.
	   The Foreign Minister was addressing foreign diplomats at a
briefing session yesterday at state guest house Padma on the
situation arising out of the opposition's march scheduled for
today. Later he briefed newsmen at the same venue on the situation.
	   The briefing session was arranged hurriedly as the BNP leaders
had briefed the foreign diplomats on the long march issue and the
CHT peace process on Sunday.
	   The Foreign Minister accompanied by State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury and Acting Foreign Secretary Mohiuddin
Ahmed said that the opposition had the right to ventilate its
grievances, but, within the laws. ``We hope they are fully aware of
their obligations under the law, when undertaking these kinds of
activities,'' he added.
	   The Foreign Minister said that the government, as promise-bound,
did not have the slightest intention to create any obstacle. ``But
we are worried that some of their leaders have been making
provocative statements.'' He referred to a statement of Col (retd)
Akbar MP of BNP in Comilla in which the BNP MP urged the party
workers to carry licensed arms along with them and not to hesitate
to fire in case of any attack from any quarter on the participants
of the march.
	   Abdus Samad Azad said that they had information that the
opposition would like to deliberately create a law and order
problem. ``For this purpose, it has advised its armed cadres from
different places to join the march,'' he added.
	   Abdus Samad Azad feared that factional feuds within the BNP
itself might encourage some BNP leaders to deliberately create a
situation in which one faction would attack another. He pointed to
the fact that in Chittagong the BNP was sharply divided down the
middle with its two powerful leaders heading two rival factions.
	   He termed the long march a long drive', which he said was
targeted against peace and was a very expensive programme. He said
that the purpose of such an expensive long march was something else
but definitely not peace.
	   He said that he briefed the foreign diplomats about the possible
consequences of the march and the aggressive attitude of the BNP
leaders. When the whole world hailed the peace treaty the BNP was
staging long march against it and that was ridiculous, he added.

	   JENS Galschiot, sculptor of the homeless Pillar of Shame, has
urged the Provisional Urban Council to accept his work for display
in public parks.
	   In an open letter to members of the council, the Danish sculptor
said he understood one reason for the repeated rejections by the
council was the belief the work supported British colonialism.
	   He found the argument far-fetched since democracy and the
rejection of colonialism were not contradictory, Mr Galschiot said.
	   ``The Pillar of Shame sculptures will be set up around the world
in defence of human rights and as a denouncement of all sorts of
infringements against humanity, committed by authorities and
others,'' he said in the letter.
	   He described his work as ``a valuable, although humble,
contribution to the celebration of the end of British colonialism,
and simultaneously a symbol of the struggle for human rights and
freedom of expression in China, including Hong Kong''.
	   But his comments were derided as ``far-fetched'' and
``unfounded'', by the vice chairman of the Provisional Urban
Council Ip Kwok-chung, who is a member of the pro-Beijing
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong.
	   ``We have never rejected it on ground of colonialism. We
rejected it because it just did not fit in our venues,'' Mr Ip
said.
	   Politically and artistically, the Pillar of Shame did not suit
Hong Kong, he said.
	   ``Different people will have different points of views. If he
likes his work so much, why didn't he display it in his homeland?''
But Mr Galschiot won sympathy from democrats, who said they would
keep fighting for a permanent home for the symbol of freedom and
democracy.
	   Newly-elected legislator Lee Wing-tat said: ``As long as I am
alive, I will keep fighting for it.
	   ``Obviously this is political censorship and against the wishes
of the public.'' In May, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the
Patriotic Democratic Movement in China failed in its second
application to the council to have the pillar displayed in the
Sculpture Walk in Kowloon Park.

	   Both the supporters and opponents of the long march against the
CHT agreement are making hectic preparations to demonstrate their
strength on June 10, when the BNP is scheduled to hold a massive
rally at the Khargrachhari stadium at the fag end of the two-day
long long march'.
	   The supporters of the long march apprehend violent clashes
during the programme. However, they are sharing no efforts to make
the long march programme a success.
	   The organisers of long march have alleged that the police have
already arrested seven persons who were working for the success of
the programme. But the police administration said that none had
been arrested so far.
	   The long march preparatory committee at a press conference
alleged that the police were frequently raiding the houses of the
activists of the BNP and the members of the All-Party Unity
Council. Hence no leader or worker of the BNP was staying at his
house far fear of arrest.
	   The administration has fixed June 10 as the day for ration card
checking for all Bengali settlers who are now staying at cluster
villages. The leaders of the long march preparatory committee
alleged that the arrangement was made to prevent the Bengalees from
attending the rally at the stadium.
	   They also alleged that though the administration had allowed the
organisers of long march to use the Khagrachhari Stadium, they were
asked not to use the bathrooms and toilets of the stadium.
	   Meanwhile the government has asked the Khagrachhari
administration to observe protocol during the stay of the Leader of
the Opposition in Parliament, Begum Khaleda Zia, in Khagrachhari.
	   The press conference was addressed among others by central
leaders Manjur Elahi, Belayet Hossein Bhuiyan, Shabauddin, Syed
Abdul Momen, Haroon or Rashid, Joynal Abedin and Ahasanuddin.
	   Manjur Elahi said that in case of any obstacle from the
administration in organising the long march peacefully , the BNP
would give a call for toppling the government.
	   Meanwhile the administration has kept 1,300, policemen and BDR
force on standby alert to tackle the situation. Twelve magistrates
have been stationed at various points of the town and adjacent
areas.
	   Meanwhile, convener of the Communication Committee on CHT
Hangshadhaj Chakma said that nothing would happen on the day of
long march. He said that the BNP was trying to a create problem in
the CHT. But the people in the region were totally in favour of the
agreement.
	   Chairman of Khagrachhari Pourashava Abul Quasem said that he
would welcome the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament who would
lead the long march procession.
	   Meanwhile activists of both BNP and the Awami League are going
from house to house separately to mobilise public opinion for and
against the long march.
	   The BNP and the Awami League also took out separate processions
in Khagrachhari.
	   Several gates have been erected to receive the Leader of the
Opposition in Khagrachhari by the organisers of the long march. The
main gate was erected in Manikchhari.

	   A DEFICIT budget for the next fiscal year might violate the
spirit of Article 107 of the Basic Law, a legal expert said
yesterday.
	   Political parties are demanding a budget deficit for the year
1999-2000 to stimulate the economy.
	   But associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong
Johannes Chan Man-man said Article 107 was not clear in requiring
the Special Administrative Region government's expenditure to be
limited by its revenue receipts and economic growth.
	   According to Prof Chan there was no violation judging from the
written meaning of the article.
	   ``The written meaning is permissive rather than mandatory,'' he
said.
	   ``However, whether it (a deficit budget) might violate the
spirit of the article is questionable.'' He said a deficit budget
might only be needed and justified under exceptional circumstance
which leaves no option other than breaking the principle of the
article.
	   ``We are not talking about the deficiency of money of the
government but spending more to stimulate the economy,'' he said,
adding it was up to the courts to determine if a deficit was
justified.
	   Article 107 states: ``The SAR shall follow the principle of
keeping expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its
budget, and strive to . . avoid deficits . . .''

Saddam says India, Pakistan have right to acquire nuclear bombs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein whose country was
stripped of a potential to build nuclear weapons said Tuesday that
India and Pakistan have the right to possess nuclear bombs.
	   In a message to the leaders of the two countries, Saddam said he
saw no reason why the nuclear tests conducted by the two countries
last month should spark an international outcry.
	   ``We see that both India and Pakistan had acted in accordance
with the right of sovereignty,'' Saddam said in his almost
identical messages, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``We see no justification for the mounting of the campaign
against India and Pakistan,'' Saddam said.
	   INA said Saddam made the remarks in response to letters Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee of India sent to him, explaining the reasons why they
decided to detonate nuclear devices.
	   Saddam said any criticism of the explosion is part of ``the
double standards policy'' that the United States and Britain pursue
to deny others what they already have.
	   ``If they want to have a world free of nuclear weapons, and this
is what we support and call for, then this has to be applied to all
countries without exception,'' Saddam said. He also criticized the
United Nations for not acting on Israel, which is believed to
possess a large nuclear arsenal.
	   Iraq was suspected to be about one year away from producing the
nuclear bomb when U.N. arms monitors dismantled the program over
seven years under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms. Iraq
maintains that its program was for peaceful purposes.

	   Telecommunications and Works Minister Mohammad Nasim has said
that the BNP and its allies have been making preparations for the
so-called long march programme towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHT) at the ``signal and with the support of a particular force ``
which opposed the birth of independent Bangladesh in 1971.
	   ``That force does not want political stability in Bangladesh ...
And the long march programme is designed to create disturbance in
Bangladesh so that we can't develop as a prosperous nation,''
Nasim, also the Organising Secretary of the Awami League, told
reporters at his Secretariat office yesterday.
	   Nasim did not identify the ``particular force'' but said that
the organisers of the long march were still opposing the spirit of
the liberation war.
	   The Minister said that the BNP was going to the CHT in the name
of long march spending crores of Taka. ``The only purpose of this
long drive is to create disturbance in the country,'' he said.
	   Referring to the BNP contention that the Bangalees would not be
allowed to live in the CHT and that area would become a part of
India with the signing of the peace accord, Nasim said:'' The BNP's
campaign has failed to confuse the people. A peaceful environment
has been prevailing in the CHT and the tribal and the non-tribal
people are living there in a peaceful environment. Local and
foreign investors are now showing interest in investing in the
CHT.''
	   Asked to comment on the remark of BNP leader Lt Col (retd) Akbar
Hossain, who had urged the BNP workers to join the long march
equipped with their licensed firearms, the Minister said: ``No sane
person can say so...Such persons should be admitted to the Pabna
Mental Hospital.''
	   However, Nasim said that the motive of the BNP's 'long drive' in
the name of a long march towards the CHT had become clear with the
remark of Akbar.

	   FOR the second time in a month, Wing On Department Store has
announced a staff lay off.
	   The company said in a statement yesterday that 40 more employees
would be laid off.
	   The statement said that compensation according to the law would
be offered along with a special gratuity based on the number of
years' service.
	   The 40 employees are from the receive and despatch department
which, according to Wing On, has been centralised to increase
efficiency.
	   The department store chain, one of the biggest in Hong Kong,
laid off 270 employees in May.
	   The company said it regretted the latest decision but added that
it was necessary since the company recorded a more than 30 per cent
drop in revenue in March compared to the same period last year.
	   Newly elected legislator Chan Yuen-han of the Hong Kong
Federation of Trade Unions, said the federation was unhappy over
the company's lack of consultation with staff.
	   ``All of the laid-off employees, including the previous 270,
were sacked suddenly. This is most unfair,'' he said.

Tchaikovsky competition opens in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prestigious Tchaikovsky competition
opened Tuesday, with nearly 500 young pianists, violinists,
cellists and vocalists hoping the contest will vault them into the
world's top concert halls.
	   ``This is truly an international musical holiday, which has no
equal anywhere in the world,'' President Boris Yeltsin said in a
greeting to contestants.
	   The competition has been held in Moscow every four years since
1958, when a young American, Van Cliburn, won the piano competition
and instantly became one of the world's best known pianists.
	   The competition runs for two weeks, and will be judged by juries
that include previous Tchaikovsky winners.

	   The National Standing Committee of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) yesterday protested the Prime Minister's remark that
clashes in the long march might be the outcome of feuds between the
BNP's own terrorists. The turn of events would prove whether or not
the remark was part of a blueprint to attack the long march or a
cover-up for other conspiratorial activities, it said.
	   The Standing Committee had a meeting at the Minto Road official
residence of the Leader of the Opposition and said that the Prime
Minister's remark had created suspicion in the minds of the people
that it was motivated.
	   In a resolution the meeting also complained that the government
and the ruling party had announced peace processions' in an effort
to foil the long march through provocation and attack.
	   The meeting, presided over by BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia, urged
the people to make the long march a success. It said that the
government would have to bear serious consequences' if it
obstructed the long march.
	   The BNP Standing Committee reiterated that the long march was a
peaceful political programme announced well in time to safeguard
national independence, sovereignty and integrity, and ensure equal
rights of all citizens.
	   It alleged that the government had been creating obstacles to
the long march programme in various ways as the programme had
attracted huge popular response and the government had become
isolated from the people.
	   The meeting complained that the publicity activities had been
obstructed, terrorist attacks were made, fabricated cases filed and
arrests made without cases. The government had continued to
obstruct the efforts to collect transports for the long march, it
said.
	   Referring to the Prime Minister's remark, the meeting said that
there was no intra-party feud in the BNP, and that the leaders,
workers and well-wishers at all levels had been working shoulder to
shoulder to make the programme a success.
	   The BNP Standing Committee warned that the people of the country
were prepared to give a befitting reply to conspiracies against the
long march.
	   The meeting said that the leaders, workers and volunteers of the
party would remain determined to make the long march a disciplined
and peaceful one. Allout preparations had been made for this. In
addition, cooperation had also been sought in black and white from
the Ministry of Home Affairs, the communications authorities and
others concerned to help keep the march peaceful.
	   The meeting felt assured that the long march would be peaceful
if the government refrained from provocation and attacking it.

	   FOURTEEN replies have been received in the government's
consultation exercise on a common gas carrier system to make the
fuel supply market more competitive.
	   The market is currently monopolised by the Hong Kong and China
Gas Company.
	   An Economic Services Bureau spokesman yesterday said the 14
responses were from gas suppliers and the public.
	   Advice from the Energy Advisory Committee on the issue has also
been sought.
	   The spokesman described the current government position as being
``open'', pending a study by gas company on a series of related
issues including availability of natural gas, the economic benefits
to consumers and transportation costs.
	   The spokesman said the government wished to explore ways of
encouraging more competition in the gas supply market while
ensuring it was secure and reliable.
	   ``The government believes that the common carrier idea warrants
further consideration in view of its potential to introduce more
competition to the gas market.'' Political parties welcomed the
consultation, which began in June last year, which they said would
eventually benefit the public.
	   Both Democratic Party newly elected legislator Lee Wing-tat and
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong's Miss Chan
Yuen-han applauded the study.
	   A common gas carrier system enables more than one gas supplier
to supply households.
	   In the long-term, customers would benefit from the increased
competition, although the final cost would be a little higher, both
legislators believed.
	   A spokesman for Hong Kong and China Gas also welcomed the study,
but added that the company was conscious of the ``uncertainties''
involving the issue, including the economic benefits to customers
and the availability of natural gas.

Seven women rightists win prestigious Spanish prize

<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Seven prominent women jointly won Spain's
Prince of Asturias prize Tuesday for defending the rights and
dignity of women in the world.
	   The annual prize for international cooperation was awarded
Tuesday to Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala, Fatiha
Boudiaf of Algeria, Emma Bonino of Italy, Olayinka Koso-Thomas of
Nigeria, Graca Machel of Mozambique, Fatana Ishaq of Afghanistan
and Somaly Mam of Cambodia.
	   The international cooperation prize is one of eight Prince of
Asturias awards this year. The jury said it hoped the prize would
``attract the attention of millions of women all over the world
living in dramatic situations and discrimination.'' It urged
international institutions and nations to adopt measures to
eliminate the abuse of women.
	   Eight prizes for different themes are awarded annually. They are
named after Crown Prince Felipe, son of King Juan Carlos.
	   Bonino is the European Union's top human rights official. Menchu
won the Nobel peace prize in 1992, while Olayinka Koso-Thomas has
been working for 15 years to stop female circumcision.
	   Machel works on children and women issues for the United Nations
and Ishaq is president of the Afghan Women's Council.
	   Mam has fought against prostitution while Boudiaf, widow of
former Algerian president Mohammed Boudiaf, is the president of a
foundation that opposes the extremes of Islamic fundamentalism.
	   The prizes, which include a check for 5 million pesetas (dlrs
35,000) and an original sculpture by Spanish artist Joan Miro, are
often called the Spanish-speaking world's Nobels.
	   Previous winners include German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzak Rabin.

	   The ruling party-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL)
yesterday brought out a peace procession in the city centring
today's long march to Khagrachhari by the main opposition BNP and
its allies.
	   The BCL (S-P) procession paraded the city's main thoroughfares.
Processionists carried white flags, and photographs of Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina. It chanted slogans against the long march
after gathering at Bot Tola of Dhaka University at around noon.
	   The BCL (S-P) members held a rally on the campus prior to the
procession protesting what they called the BNP's plan to create
anarchy in the name of long march.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had established peace in Chittagong
Hill Tracts through the signing of the historic CHT peace accord,
said the BCL (S-P) leaders.
	   They also called upon their members to remain alert against any
conspiracy to foil the peaceful atmosphere in the CHT.
	   Presided over by BCL (S-P) President Enamul Haq Shamim, the
rally was addressed, among others, by General Secretary Ishaq Ali
Khan Panna, Ajoykor Khokon, Bahadur Bepary, Abdul Oadud Khokon and
Rafiqul Islam Kotwal.

	   THE Chief Executive of the Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam
Chi-kwong, said efforts to boost the supply of accommodation in
Hong Kong should be applied in a ``flexible'' manner when dealing
with land sales and the building of flats.
	   Speaking in Basle, Switzerland, where he is attending the annual
meeting of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr Yam said the
administration was aware of the need to keep property prices from
falling further.
	   ``I think it would be in the interests of everybody if the
property market stabilises. Because if it continues to fall, then
nobody wants to buy,'' he said, adding further property price
declines could also hit sentiment throughout the rest of the
economy.
	   He said efforts to make more housing available were important.
``Of course this policy must have a long-term dimension, which is
that we ought really to be producing a lot more land and a lot more
housing.'' But he added: ``In the short-term, given what is going
on in the economy, given the deflation process and the fall in
property prices, some flexibility in this long-term policy is
called for, and I think the administration has indicated
willingness to be flexible.'' Meanwhile, Director of Lands Bob Pope
said yesterday he was worried about the difficulty developers were
having obtaining funds to bid for land.
	   Mr Pope acknowledged ``they have a lot of problems raising
finances''.
	   He revealed many developers had tried to negotiate lower
premiums when they modified the use of land.
	   Mr Pope said officials would assess the premium on the market
value. ``If prices are down, we will reflect that,'' he said.
	   Despite these worries, Mr Pope said it was too early to revise
downwards land sale revenue estimates of $50 billion for this
financial year.
	   ``We are fairly conservative in our estimates,'' he said.
``We've got a long time to go. It is just two months into the
financial year. Maybe I can be a little bit more certain in six
months' time.'' He said about $10 billion had been raised from land
sales so far.
	   ``Hopefully towards the end of the year, things will improve and
we will get the revenue expected.'' Mr Pope emphasised that the
land sale program was proceeding to schedule and no changes were
planned.
	   But he also said the government would be flexible when it came
to the program.
	   Several criteria would be taken into account if changes to the
land sale program were needed.
	   ``The aim is obviously to provide housing, that's by far the
most important aim. Revenue is secondary,'' he said.
	   ``Obviously because people in Hong Kong follow the property
market so closely, whatever happens in the property market has an
effect on the economy as a whole.'' He said smaller developers were
more active in bidding for land, either through public auction or
tendering.
	   But he pointed out that this did not mean major developers had
withdrawn from the market.
	   The wider range of developers bidding for land was positive for
Hong Kong, he said.

	   Their shelves were stocked with brands and goods which are not
easily available elsewhere.

	   Two rallies organised separate by the BNP and the Jamaat in
support of the long march to the CHT could not be held here this
afternoon following bomb attacks allegedly by the Bangladesh
Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling party.
	   A group of armed youths allegedly belonging to the BCL also
attacked two launches at the Barisal launch terminal. The launches
were scheduled to carry the long marchers to Dhaka.
	   The youths were reportedly under heavy protection of a
contingent of police during the incident.
	   The activists of the BCL who brought out a ``peace procession''
at about 4 pm launched a bomb attack on BNP activists who gathered
in front of the BNP office to hold a pre-long march rally. The BCL
activists later attacked the BNP and the Juba Dal offices. They
ransacked the two offices and threw chairs, tables and other
materials on the road.
	   The BCL activists also hurled bombs at ``Aviruchi'' cinema owned
by a local BNP leader.
	   Later BCL activists went to the launch terminal where two
launches - ``Parabat'' and ``Tibraj-2'' were kept ready to take the
long marchers to Dhaka. They allegedly beat up the long marchers on
board the launches and threw away their belongings. Seven BNP
activists were injured and two Jamaat activists were thrown into
the Kirtonkhola river.
	   A rally of the Jamaat which was schedule to be held at
Girjamahalla was also foiled by the BCL activists.

Villeneuve says Schumacher a law unto himself
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Reigning Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve
has made a scathing attack on Michael Schumacher following the
German driver's Canadian Grand Prix win Sunday.
	   Villeneuve, whose car was rammed by Schumacher in last year's
season-ending Grand Prix, wrote in his Daily Telegraph newspaper
column Tuesday that Schumacher had become a law unto himself.
	   Villeneuve accused Schumacher of producing several
``questionable maneuvers'' during the Canadian Grand Prix.
	   ``What planet is this guy on?'' Villeneuve said. ``On `Planet
Michael' it would seem, as he believes himself to be all alone on
the track.''
	   ``In Monaco he ran into Pedro Paolo Diniz for no other reason
than he was three laps behind him, and in Montreal he compounded
his errors,'' Villeneuve said. ``Before leaving the pits for the
grid he passed me on the left on the inside of the yellow line
where everyone was working. Why, I have no idea.
	   ``Then, leaving the pits during the race, he forced nz-Harald
Frentzen off the track before cutting across a chicane after
overtaking Damon Hill.''
	   Villeneuve said it was a shame such a talented driver had to
make so many ``blunders'' and questioned how he would be stopped.
	   Schumacher, a two-time world champion and leading Ferrari
driver, caused a furor during the European Formula One Grand Prix
in Jerez, Spain, in October last year when he collided with
Villeneuve.
	   Schumacher held a one-point lead in the drivers' championship
when he rammed into Villeneuve on the 48th lap. Schumacher slid off
the track and out of the race, while Villeneuve went on to win his
first Formula One title.
	   The Formula One world governing body, FIA, ruled the collision
was deliberate, but instead of suspending Schumacher or fining him,
merely voided his second-place finish in the season standings.

	   A FIRM established to cheat innocent companies and employees of
their money creamed more than $2 million from its victims, the
District Court heard yesterday.
	   Vista Industries, registered in the name of Kwok Wai-ming, 42,
was controlled by the manager who, ``used Vista to cheat people for
money'', prosecutor Isaac Tam said.
	   Between March 1994 and when the company closed down in October
1994, Vista swindled 26 companies with 49 bounced cheques amounting
to $2.3 million, Mr Tam said.
	   Although Kwok signed up two chequebooks for the company, he only
went to the Kwun Tong office a few times each month.
	   Vista employed three female clerks, and two male merchandisers,
Ho Kai-cheung and Tai Chui-ming who were the front men for the
fraudulent activities, having direct dealings with the victim
companies, it was alleged.
	   Both Ho and Tai claimed they were only employees and acted
according to instructions, ordering goods from the companies and
giving the companies Kwok's signed cheques.
	   The men denied any knowledge of the fraud, Mr Tam said.
	   In most cases Vista would conduct legitimate purchases of
electronic goods and present a cheque that would be honoured.
	   But subsequent cheques were dishonoured because the account had
closed, or the account had been overdrawn.
	   The company finally closed on 4 October 1994. Victims reported
their losses to police.
	   Kwok told police that although he ``did not know in the
beginning as to what sort of business the Vista manager was to do,
he knew right from the start when he let the man run his business
that they were doing illegal business to cheat people'', the court
was told.
	   Kwok admitted one count of conspiracy to defraud.
	   His co-defendant pleaded not guilty to the same charge.

South African fishing vessel sinks in South Atlantic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Twelve fishermen died and 21 were
rescued after a South African vessel sank in heavy seas near South
Georgia in the South Sandwich islands, the owners said Tuesday.
	   The 45-meter Sudurhavid sank in the Atlantic Saturday night
about 4,000 kilometers (2,600 miles) east of the Argentinean coast,
City Fishing Ltd. of Cape Town confirmed.
	   The survivors were rescued by the Isla Camilla, a South Sandwich
local ship that worked with aircraft from the British Royal Air
Force and the Argentinean Air Force. Four life rafts and an
inflatable boat were retrieved, the company said.
	   The survivors appeared to be in good health at a British
military base on South Georgia Island.
	   The British Royal Navy is expected to send a supply vessel to
transport the men about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) to the
Falkland Islands, City Fishing said.
	   The men would then be flown via London back to Cape Town.
	   There was little chance that more survivors would be found, and
rescue efforts were stopped.
	   ``Given the temperature of the sea ... there is now no hope of
recovering any further crew members alive,'' City Fishing said.

Flat reaction to offer of special status for troubled East Timor

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's offer to grant special status
to East Timor to end a long running fight for independence seems to
have fallen flat among its troubled people.
	   Bishop Carlos Belo, Nobel peace prize winner and the spiritual
leader of the predominately Roman Catholic territory, refused to
comment. Instead, he attended a church concert in park adjacent to
his residence in the provincial capital, Dili.
	   Ordinary people said they were unaware of what President B.J.
Habibie's concession would mean for the former Portuguese
territory, invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Community leaders were dismissive, saying that Habibie should
live up earlier promises to grant more democracy to all.
	   Habibie said Tuesday he's prepared to grant special status
within Indonesia to East Timor, but he did not explain exactly what
form the special status would take, the British Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
	   Outspoken former legislator Manuel Viegas Carrascalao said East
Timorese should be allowed to vote on their future through a free
and fair referendum.
	   ``He should respect our right to self determiniation,''
Carrascalao said of Habibie.
	   Students, who have consistently protested against Indonesian
rule while pro-independence rebels fight a guerrilla war, also
called for a referendum.
	   Student leader Jose Aparicio said the offer of special status
for East Timor meant little if East Timorese did not have a say on
whether they wanted to be part of Indonesia.
	   Aparicio also said that rebel leader Xanana Gusmao should be
freed from serving a 20-year prison sentence for leading the fight
against Indonesia's military.
	   Habibie on Tuesday specifically ruled out the possibility of an
amnesty for Gusmao, who is considered a violent criminal.
	   ``They still believe that Xanana is not political leader but
only a criminal. That shows the Indonesian government doesn't know
how to solve the East Timor problem,'' Aparicio said.
	   However, Florentio Sarmento, chairman of the East Timor Action
for Development and Progress, a non-governmental organization,
called for compromise.
	   A political moderate, he argued against a referendum, saying it
could cause more conflict among divided East Timorese.
	   ``We do not have any democratic tradition here. No one is ready
to lose in a referendum,'' he said.

	   Country's forthcoming budget is expected to increase revenue by
expanding the VAT net and to help spur economic growth through
subsidies to agriculture and reduced duties on the import of
industrial raw materials and machinery, business leaders said on
Monday, reports Reuters.
	   ``We want a budget that will support the development of domestic
industries,'' said Yusuf Abdullah Harun, president of the
Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industries.
	   This in turn would help create employment and raise the
country's exports.
	   Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria is expected to announce the new
revenue budget for 1998/99 (July-June) on Thursday.
	   ``The budget should encourage productivity in the industrial
sector and must protect it by discouraging imports of finished
goods,'' Sharif Afzal Hossain, president of Bangladesh Chamber of
Industries, said.
	   He said the tariff difference for imports of industrial raw
materials and finished goods should be substantial.
	   ``The tax on imports of industrial raw materials should not be
more than 15 per cent and that for finished goods not less than 30
per cent.''
	   Entrepreneurs said the budget was also likely to reduce
subsidies to exports of specialised textile products as the
industry, which annually makes nearly $3.0 billion, had sufficient
help in the past and now employs more than one million people.
	   The government, burdened with heavy recurrent expenditures due
to huge losses by public companies, may expand the value-added tax
net and simplify income tax procedures.
	   Atiur Rahman, a senior economist with Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies, said he expected a pragmatic budget.
	   ``It may not raise taxes but may seek to expand VAT net and
simplify procedures on filing income tax returns to mobilise
increased revenue.''
	   He said the government might spend some 1.5 billion taka ($32.4
million) on agriculture to boost farm production. The money would
allow farmers to get fertiliser and pesticides at subsidised or
reduced rates.
	   Rahman also said the new budget should be crafted to control
inflation, which is now at an annualised eight per cent.
	   He said the government might fix the growth of gross domestic
product at 6.0 per cent for the new year against an expected 5.6
per cent in the current year.
	   Businessmen and investors are worried about Bangladesh's power
shortfall. The country is currently producing about 1,850 megawatts
of electricity against demand for more than 2,100 megawatts.
	   Rahman said the government ``should immediately put money on the
maintenance of existing power infrastructures and reduce pilferage
or theft of electricity.''

	   THE streets of Central and Tsim Sha Tsui will be illuminated
within the next two months as part of a package of measures to
attract tourists for the summer sale.
	   The brightening up of the renowned Golden Mile in Tsim Sha Tsui
and Central, organised by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA),
will be accompanied by the promotion of airlines, restaurants and
hotels.
	   The streets near Lan Kwai Fong will be decorated in July and
August and special menus will be prepared by bars and restaurants
in the area. Nightly special appearances of fringe entertainers
will be organised.
	   The lane of bars at Knutsford Terrace will be decorated and
illuminated during the promotion period and will feature strolling
musicians and entertainers as well as special features.
	   On weekends, a Harbour-front Fest will be organised outside the
Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui from next month.
	   Street performances, live bands and choirs will be featured.
	   The HKTA hopes the summer promotion will increase visitor
arrivals during July and August, capitalising on the first birthday
of the Special Administrative Region, the new airport and Airport
Express opening and the Hong Kong Food Festival.
	   The gimmicks are also expected to create awareness and
excitement over the summer sales.
	   The HKTA will also offer special packages for the Airport
Express and city rides which include tickets and admissions to the
new Museum of History.
	   Fashion shows, theme parties and instant lucky draws will be
launched by major shopping and retail outlets, including Shanghai
Tang, Lane Crawford, Times Square and Dutyfree Shoppers.
	   Two major trade shows _ the Asia Pacific International Marine
Exhibition and Asia Pacific International Motor Show _ will also be
held.
	   But president of the Outbound Travel Agents Association Ronnie
Ho Pak-ting said decorating the streets would be of little help in
attracting tourists.
	   ``You cannot expect tourists to come here just to see the street
activities and band performances,'' he said.
	   ``We need more permanent tourist attractions to win more
visitors.''

Anti-nuclear gatehring blasts India, Pakistan tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ In the country's largest anti-nuclear
gathering since India's five controversial underground tests last
month, more than 500 activists met Tuesday to condemn the
government's actions and urged it to pull back its nuclear weapons
program.
	   ``A global (nuclear arms) race may be renewed because of these
tests,'' sociologist Rajni Kothari said at a panel discussion that
included a former naval chief, the head of India's Communist party,
a senior judge and other prominent thinkers and academicians.
	   When India first conducted the tests, domestic reaction was
euphoric, with the tests portrayed as a reason for national pride.
But neighboring Pakistan's retaliatory tests and economic sanctions
imposed on India and Pakistan by the international community had a
sobering effect and enlivened the nuclear debate.
	   Admiral Ram Das, who retired as India's navy chief in the
mid-1990s, cautioned that several things could go wrong when
inexperienced and emotional leaders have control over nuclear
weapons.
	   ``We have been told we have a control and command system set up
.... This is all humbug. There is no safety measure built into the
system,'' Das said.
	   Ordinary Indians, he said, were unfamiliar with the horrors of
nuclear weapons and unaware how ill-equipped India and Pakistan
were to deal with a nuclear holocaust. The region had no civil
defense system and no underground shelters, he said.
	   Das said the three nuclear powers in the region _ China,
Pakistan and India _ should talk and agree to end their nuclear
weapon programs. He also said the cost of the weapons was too high
in a region desperate for hospitals and schools.

	   Fifty three per cent people of Dhaka City expect the third
budget of this government to follow the usual pattern. On the other
hand 47 per cent think the Finance Minister's recent series of
pre-budget discussion meeting with various organisations,
economists and other groups will enable him to present a budget
which is likely to reflect the general expectations of the people.
	   This has been revealed at the 19th Opinion Poll conducted by the
Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) from June 4 to June 6.
The poll sought opinions from 720 residents from different areas of
the city.
	   The respondents are aged from 18 and above. Of them 48.8 per
cent are from 18 to 29 years, 37.2 per cent from 30 to 44 years, 11
per cent from 45 to 59 years and 3.1 per cent from 60 plus age
groups.
	   The sample included people with education level SSC or
equivalent and above. All occupational classes and of both sexes.
The margin of error of the poll results is 1 out of 16. Professor
Ainun Nishat and Dr A K Enamul Haque supervised the poll using
standard polling techniques.
	   When asked to name five areas of expenditures where they want
the government to allocate more funds, primary and secondary
education topped the list with 84 per cent support, power and
electricity from 64.6 per cent, hospitals and health care from 53.1
per cent, transport sector from 31.7 per cent and higher education
from 29.4 per cent people.
	   At the same time, when asked to name five heads of expenditures
where they want the government to cut expenses, 78.4 per cent
favoured the military expenses, 29.6 per cent salary expenses of
the public servants, 22.6 per cent expenses on jute sector, 18.7
per cent in recently introduced old-age allowances and 15.1 per
cent in industry.
	   It has been reported in several newspapers that this budget may
extend the VAT net to increase revenue collections. Responding to
the question, 81.5 per cent think the government should rather try
to cut its own expenses than expanding the tax net. Only 18.5 per
cent think that government has no alternative but to expand the VAT
net to fund its expenses.
	   Government has been slow in deregulating public industries.
Responding to the question of privatisation, 65 per cent opined
that government should speed up the process while 35 per cent said
government should announce deadlines for the privatisation process
to be completed.
	   It has been alleged that tax collection is low due to corruption
in the taxation department. Responding to this question 72.5 per
cent think that the method of tax payment must be made easier to
attract more voluntary tax payment from the public while 27.5 per
cent think that government should lower the tax rate to attract
more payment of taxes.
	   Finance Ministers of Bangladesh on several occasions increased
tax rates, fuel prices, utility rates etc, after the budget was
passed by Parliament. Referring to this practice 87.9 per cent
wanted the Jatiya Sangsad to be called for discussing these before
making such unilateral announcements. At the same time only 12.1
per cent supported the actions of the Finance Minister and thought

World Cup: Norway heavily favored in their first-ever meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Perfect preparations, no injuries and
perhaps the most impressive warmup record of all World Cup teams.
	   Norway's ``Drillos'', fourth on FIFA's world rankings after
winning their last three exhibitions over fellow Cup teams Denmark,
Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a whopping combined score of 13-2, are
heavily favored to win their first-ever meeting against Morocco on
the opening day of the tournament Wednesday.
	   Norway scored only one goal in three games during a
disappointing 1994 World Cup in the United States. But it would be
much more disappointing should they fail to make the second round
this time.
	   Morocco's ``Atlas Lions'', also playing in the World Cup finals
for the third time, were eliminated in the first round during the
'94 Cup as well. But another early exit would not be a big
surprise. The Moroccans, coached by former French manager Henri
Michel, are clearly the underdogs in this group.
	   Eleven Norwegians are back, most of them with more experience
from some of the toughest leagues in the world. In fact, Norway
could line up a complete starting lineup of English-based players.
	   Coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen watched Morocco draw Chile 1-1 in a
lackluster tuneup in southern France last week.
	   ``Morocco did not play well,'' he said ``Yet I think they were
better than Chile.
	   ``There are no easy matches in the World Cup, but I think we
have a good schedule. If I had the chance to choose, I would never
have picked Brazil in the opening game.''
	   The Moroccans will face a disciplined Norwegian defense that
only allowed two goals in eight games in an unbeaten qualifying
campaign. Norway has played 14 straight games without defeat since
losing 1-0 with a B team away to Australia early last year.
	   Known for its somewhat boring long-ball attack and tireless
running, Olsen will probably stick to his 4-5-1 formation. Tore
Andre Flo, a Cup Winners' Cup champion last month in his first
season with Chelsea, would be the lone striker.
	   Aerial attacks are a Norwegian specialty. So Flo and his older
brother, Jostein, both 1.93 meters (6-foot-4), could be joined by
their cousin Havard Flo (1.85 meters - 6-foot-1) if Olsen decides
to launch an aerial war against the shorter Moroccans with a rare
combo of three relatives.
	   ``Morocco has two or there good players in the air, but that's
it,'' Olsen said.
	   A speedy counterattack is the main offensive weapon from a
defensively oriented Moroccan team. Its key players play together
for Deportivo La Coruna in Spain: defender Noureddine Naybet,
midfielder Mustapha Hadji and forward Salaheddine Bassir.
	   Hadji, a native of France, played eight years for French club
Nancy. Naybet, a sweeper with more than 90 caps, is one of eight
veterans back on the team from 1994.
	   In the 1994 World Cup, Morocco lost all three matches _ against
Poland (2-1), Belgium (1-0) and Saudi Arabia (2-1). Adding to the
team's frustration was its 1-0 quarterfinals loss to South Africa
in the 1998 African Nations Cup in Burkina Faso.
	   Michel, who has led the Atlas Lions since 1995 after coaching
France to the 1986 World Cup semifinals in Mexico, says the Nations
Cup defeat is a huge motivating factor.
	   The players ``want to prove that what happened in Burkina Faso
is not representative of their real abilities,'' Michel said.
	   ``The World Cup is the best chance for them to prove their
abilities.''

	   A TOP chiropractor has disputed another doctor's claim that
wearing canvas shoes _ common among primary school children _ can
cause flat feet.
	   Hong Kong Chiropractors' Association president Dr Edward Lee
Tin-tak said there was no evidence to back the claim.
	   For people with healthy feet, built-in muscles were able to
support their bodies well, he said.
	   ``Wearing any kind of shoes can't really lead to serious
problems because human feet can adapt very well _ they are
themselves good shock absorbers,'' Dr Lee said.
	   ``Shoes are just a protective layer (from cuts).'' But Dr Tsang
Wing-hon, prosthetic and orthopaedics department manager at the
Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, had earlier warned that
playing sports in canvas shoes for a period of time could lead to
flat feet and urged schools to scrap them as a dress code.
	   He said canvas shoes were no better than slippers since they
could not prevent the feet from sliding inside the shoes.
	   Parents should choose shoes with more support on the ankles and
the arches, he said.
	   Children wearing canvas shoes to play sports could develop flat
feet as too much pressure was put on their feet, causing the arches
to lose their ability to spring back.
	   White canvas shoes _ with or without laces _ have been worn by
almost all school children in Hong Kong as sneakers during physical
education lessons at most public primary schools.
	   The compulsory dress code is aimed at standardising uniforms to
avoid brand-name competition among students.
	   The code will probably remain unchanged despite the medical
warning.
	   Chairman of the Subsidised Primary Schools Council Nelson Lau
Chi-keung said he had not noticed any problems with students
wearing canvas shoes during more than 30 years in the profession.
	   ``Pupils with flat feet are usually advised by doctors to wear a
special insole in their shoes, and they would be wearing the
orthopaedic shoes,'' Mr Lau.
	   ``Our school requires students to wear the all-white shoes for
economic reasons.'' But he would suggest parents not buy canvas
shoes without laces, nor those with a thin sole.
	   The Education Department said parents did not have to be
concerned as white canvas shoes were suitable for most sports
taught at schools, such as floor exercises, table tennis and
badminton.

	   Makita Corporation, a renowned industrial power tools
manufacturer in Japan, on Monday launched its marketing in
Bangladesh.
	   Superior Builders and Engineers Ltd, Bangladesh is the sole
distributor of Makita products in the country.
	   Some 37 kinds of portable industrial power tools which are being
introduced in Bangladesh include hammer drill, scraper screwdriver,
auto-feed screwdriver, wrench dise sander, grinder, saw,
planer-jointer, shear and blower.
	   R Maksud Khan, President of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (DCCI), opened the launching of Makita product at a
function held at a city hotel.
	   Attended by suppliers and dealers, the function was addressed by
Satoru Watanabe, Managing Director of Makita Corporation, Japan,
Kazuya Nakamura, and Engr Manzarul Ahsan MP, Chairman of Superior
Builders and Engineers, Bangladesh.
	   Appreciating marketing of Makita power tools, R Maksud said that
it would help industrial as well as domestic activities in the
country.
	   He expressed the hope that Superior Builders and Engineers would
be able to manufanture power tools in the country with the
assistance of Makita in near future.
	   Manzarul Ahsan said his company had already established an
after-sales and backup centre at Nowabpur road in the city to
provide service to the users.
	   He said users would get service including replacement of spare
parts from the engineers and technicians trained from the Makita
workshop in Singapore.
	   Makita products would be popular in the country very soon for
its quality and reasonable price, he hoped.
	   Headquatered in Anjo, near Nagoya, Makita designs manufacturers
and markets at least 900 types of power tools. Makita also offers
stationary wood-dorking machines, pneumatic tools, gardening tools
and indoor household products.
	   APB adds: A leading Japanese power tools company evinced
interest in setting up an industrial unit in Bangladesh for
manufacturing their products here.
	   ``We are actually considering setting up a manufacturing unit in
South Asia but we well give Bangladesh priority if our products go
well here,'' said Kazuya Nakamura, Managing Director of Makita
Singapore Ltd.
	   Talking to APB, Nakamura said: ``It would take time to set up a
unit as you know the economic situation in South Asia is not
good.''

World Cup: Practice canceled in favor of watching Cameroon-Denmark
</HEADLINE>
video &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARSAC, France (AP) _ With two days to go until their opening
game against Cameroon, the Austrians on Tuesday canceled a planned
practice session and replaced it with a favorite video _ the
African squad's drubbing of the Danes.
	   Morning practice went ahead as planned, with the Austrians
concentrating on offense and defense in front of the goal and free
kicks from behind a defensive wall. The atmosphere was relaxed,
with squad members squirting each other with fizzy mineral water
and coach Herbert Prohaska loudly cracking jokes with several
players.
	   But an afternoon session was canned in favor of watching the
Cameroon-Denmark game of Friday, with its surprise 2-1 win for the
Africans. And with Cameroon recently looking better than for a long
time, the Austrians were careful not to overestimate themselves.
	   ``Cameroon is a tough team,'' said Anton Pfeffer, as he wiped
the sweat off after training. ``And because it's our first game,
we'll have a tough time coming back if we lose against them.''
	   With the Austrians struggling in their pre-World Cup friendlies
_ winning only against low-ranked Tunisia and even less threatening
Liechtenstein _ players refused to be drawn on chances against
Italy, the team to beat in Group B, which also contains Chile.
	   ``We'll have to see that we get second place _ that will be
difficult enough,'' commented forward Anton Polster, the veteran
forward who plays for Cologne in Germany's top league. ``Italy is
definitely the favorite.''
	   Forward Andreas Herzog said the plan on Thursday was to play
offensively from the opening whistle _ at least until the first
goal.
	   ``We will try to score in the first few minutes,'' he said.
``Then things will be easier.''
	   Prohaska, the coach, refused to tip his cards on the lineup in
Toulouse on Thursday. But judging from the practice sessions since
the team's arrival on Friday, the following configuration was
likely:
	   Michael Konsel, goal; Wolfgang Feiersinger, sweeper; Peter
Schoettel, Pfeffer, defense; Harald Cerny, Dietmar Kuehbauer, Roman
Maehlich, Heimo Pfeiffenberger, midfield; Andreas Herzog, Arnold
Wetl and Polster, forwards.

	   In the local forex market, demand for US dollar was high on
Monday due to import payment and a three-day long virtual weekend
in both local and international markets and the exchange rate was
between Taka 46.45 and Taka 46.48. Call money rate was higher in
the morning due to the payment of T-bills worth of Taka 153.50
crore but it came down in the afternoon, says a Standard Chartered
market commentary.
	   International markets saw US dollar reaching its seven years
high against yen on Monday when US dollar broke through the
resistance level of 140 and reached 140.73 yen. Remoteness of G7's
support for yen and lingering Bank of Japan's intervention fuelled
US dollar to run this high against yen. Dollar-mark is expected to
remain steady as all are very concerned about dollar-yen.
	   At 1645 local time, dollar traded at 1.7736/41 DEM, 140.19/29
yen and GBP traded against 1.6335/40 US dollar.

 &UR; Dissident: Abacha's death `incredible opportunity' for Nigeria

 &UR; With BC-Nigeria-Abacha &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo JRL111 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The death of Nigeria's military ruler inspired
fresh hope among dissidents and governments that the nation could
now move rapidly toward democracy.
	   Some campaigners for democracy were cheered by the appointment
of a career military man to succeed Gen. Sani Abacha as head of the
government.
	   ``It's my belief, it is my hope that in the next few days, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakara, whom I know very well, is going to open
dialogue with the civilian opposition leaders in that country
towards redressing the issues that are on the table,'' former
Nigerian foreign minister Bolaji Akinyemi said Tuesday in an
interview with BBC radio.
	   Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian writer who won the 1986 Nobel Prize
in literature and an outspoken opponent of military rule, told
reporters in Jerusalem that Abacha's death presented ``an
opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity for the
Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' Soyinka said.
``So it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   The United States, Britain and the Commonwealth of Britain and
its former colonies urged a quick transition to democracy in
Nigeria, a former British colony. France also urged Nigeria's new
leaders in that direction.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   ``Our hope, among others, would be, at this moment of
transition, that an accountable civilian government ... will emerge
from what has been a very horrific episode in which basic
fundamental rights have been suspended,'' said White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   The 53-nation Commonwealth suspended Nigeria after playwright
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other dissidents were executed in 1995.
	   Nigerian Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the
Commonwealth, told BBC TV: ``The Commonwealth would hope and would
expect that the Nigerians will decide to go back to the way of
democracy and in so doing will gain readmission to the
Commonwealth.''
	   The international community should now press for elections in
Nigeria this year, said New Zealand's foreign minister, Don
McKinnon, who is also vice-chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group on Nigeria.
	   ``Nigeria was one of the leaders in democracy in Africa back in
the 1960s and there's no reason why they can't return to it,''
McKinnon said.
	   In New York, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Annan praised the contribution made by Nigeria under Abacha to
ending the civil war in nearby Liberia and to restoring the
democratically elected government of Sierra Leone.
	   ``It is our hope that the good relations that exist between our
two countries will persist and that the path to democracy in
Nigeria will be pursued to its full conclusion,'' read a statement
issued from the Organization of African Unity summit in Burkina
Faso.
	   Nigeria's next leader could hardly be worse than Abacha,
Saro-Wiwa's son said in Britain.
	   ``In Nigeria, the thinking has always been that every successive
dictator is worse than the previous one, so one hopes that we don't
get another dictator because he will have quite a record to better
Abacha's appalling record,'' said Ken Wiwa.
	   Soyinka urged the military to release all political prisoners,
including Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of Nigeria's aborted
1993 presidential elections, and name Abiola head of a transitional
national unity government.
	   ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's a democratic
option,'' he said. ``And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting,'' Soyinka said.

	   ANTI-FRAUD investigators are searching for a car dealer after he
disappeared with $9.6 million in deposits for discounted luxury
vehicles.
	   The Commercial Crime Bureau launched an investigation after
police received 154 complaints concerning the non-delivery of
luxury vehicles, mostly BMWs, which were offered at discounted
prices, since 16 May.
	   Police are appealing to people who have signed contracts to buy
cars from the dealer _ trading as Carboy in Wan Chai _ between
April 1997 and May 1998, as well as those who have received the
ordered vehicles, to contact the Commercial Crime Bureau at 2860
4971.
	   The dealer's showroom in Gloucester Road was found to be closed
down.
	   The latest alleged scam triggered a Consumer Council warning for
the public to beware of unauthorised car dealers who offer
discounts.
	   The council has received 80 complaints against authorised and
unauthorised car dealers in the first four months this year _ 43
complaints more than the same period in 1997.
	   Council spokesman Kenneth So Wai-sang advised consumers to
exercise caution if they wanted to buy vehicles from unauthorised
vehicle dealers.
	   ``It is better to pay on delivery. Consumers should be cautious
about paying a deposit, which should be as little as possible. And
if the delivery takes sometime, consumers should consider whether
they have confidence in the dealers,'' he said.
	   Mr So declined to reveal how many complaints were related to
Carboy or the nature of complaints.
	   Carboy had been offering discounts on its luxury vehicles in the
past year.
	   Authorised dealers have also published a notice in newspapers
warning buyers to be cautious.
	   But one authorised car dealer, a Mr Cheng, said the existence of
both types of dealers provided more choice for consumers.
	   ``The consumers have the freedom to purchase what they like,''
he said. But Mr Cheng warned consumers that the after-sales
services of unauthorised dealers, including maintenance and
provision of accessories, may not be as good as those provided by
authorised agents.

Chinese trade minister: impact of Asian crisis ``far from over''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 7-10 with details, comment on EU-China trade &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ China's Foreign Trade Minister said
Tuesday the impact of the Asian economic crisis is ``far from
over,'' but insisted China would uphold the value of its currency
despite the regional turbulence.
	   ``The crisis does have inestimable implications for China that
have already resulted in a sharp decrease in exports to Southeast
Asia, Japan and South Korea,'' Shi Guangsheng told a China-European
Union trade seminar.
	   He said currency devaluations in Southeast Asian countries had
weakened China's export competitiveness, but stressed China would
not devalue its currency, the yuan.
	   He said China's policy of maintaining the yuan's value
``effectively prevented further deterioration of the Southeast
Asian economy.''
	   Shi said the Asian economic turmoil would not slow reforms to
open up China's economy. He said China will make ``all efforts'' to
achieve 8 percent economic growth this year, control inflation at
below 3 percent and hold the yuan steady.
	   ``We firmly believe the Asian crisis is only a transient
phenomenon and the affected countries will overcome the economic
hardships through efforts made by themselves and the region, and
with assistance from the world community,'' he added.
	   Shi is scheduled to meet Thursday with EU Trade Commissioner
Leon Brittan to discuss trade-opening measures. Brittan told the
seminar China ``must improve its offer on tariffs and make early,
substantial and credible offers on the liberalization of
services.''
	   Shi reiterated China's current offer to reduce tariffs from the
current average of 17 percent to the level of developing countries
by the year 2000 and then to an average 10 percent by 2005.
	   The EU is China's third-largest trading partner behind the
United States and Japan. China's exports to the European Union rose
20 percent in 1997 to dlrs 23.81 billion while imports grew 3.4
percent to dlrs 19.19 billion.
	   ``The Sino-EU relationship has entered a period of favorable
development unmatched before,'' Shi said in his speech.

	   KUWAIT (Dow Jones) _ Kuwait will ``soon'' cut its oil production
further, Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said Tuesday.
	   ``I think everybody, for their own interest, has to take a
cut,'' the minister told a joint news conference with Saudi Oil
Minister Ali Naimi.
	   Naimi is touring the region to lobby fellow Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries members to trim output in a bid to
boost prices.
	   Last week Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, the three
countries which cut back their production levels in March, pledged
to cut another 450,000 barrels of oil a day from world markets,
beginning July 1.
	   Sheik Saud said the Kuwaiti cuts would be announced following
consultations with the cabinet.
	   He said the cuts were likely to be in the range of 50,000
barrels a day to 100,000 barrels a day.
	   Venezuelan Oil Minister Erwin Arrieta said last week that Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates would each trim their outputs by
75,000 barrels a day. The U.A.E. has not announced any cuts.
	   ____
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Revenue flowing from Egypt's three main
sources of income has fallen dramatically, the Central Bank said
Tuesday.
	   In its monthly report, the Bank said income from oil, tourism
and ships passing through the Suez Canal fell in April.
	   Income from oil sales was dlrs 69 million, down from dlrs 146
million in April last year, because of the fall in world prices.
	   Revenue from fees charged to ships in the Canal was dlrs 146.3,
down from 149.3 millions for the same period last year. Fewer ships
have been passing through the Canal.
	   As for tourism, the report said the number of tourists in April
was 170,000, down from 317.000 in April last year. It gave no
figure for the decline in revenue for the tourist industry.
	   Tourism has yet to recover from the attack by Islamic extremists
that killed 58 tourists in the southern city of Luxor last year.
	   The report, which is published as an indicator, gave no
prediction of the state's total revenue for 1998.
	   The number one source of hard currency is remittances sent by
Egyptian workers abroad. The report gave no figures for that in
April.
	   ____
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Dubai airport is to embark on
a dlrs 200 million expansion of its cargo facilities, the head of
its department of civil aviation said Tuesday.
	   The project will increase the annual handling capacity of the
airport's cargo village from 400,000 tons to nearly three million
tons by 2010, said Sheik Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum.
	   The expansion will be carried out in three phases and will
include the construction of a mega terminal, capable of handling
2.7 million tons.
	   The Dubai Cargo Village, which was built in 1991, is the
region's busiest cargo hub. It was originally designed to handle
250,000 tons of cargo per year. Its capacity was increased to
350,000 tons in 1995, but it handled more than 400,000 tons in
1997.
	   Officials say the volume is expected to reach 1 million tons by
2005, 2 million tons by 2014 and 2.7 million by 2018.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany is to grant dlrs 1.8 million to the
U.N. Relief and Works Agency for the building and equipping of two
schools for Palestinian refugees in northern Jordan, a U.N.
official said Tuesday.
	   UNRWA spokesman Mattar Saqer told The Associated Press the
schools will replace five old ones which are currently attended by
5,000 students in a refugee camps in Irbid, Jordan's second largest
city which lies 88 kilometers (55 miles) north of Amman.
	   Saqer said the new premises will save UNRWA dlrs 140,000 per
year in money spent on maintenance and leasing. The agency faces a
budget deficit of dlrs 9 million,
	   UNRWA provides educational, health, relief and social services
to more than 3.4 million Palestinian refugees living in the Gaza
Strip, West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
	   In Jordan, the agency runs 198 schools which serve 142,000
students in 13 Palestinian refugee camps.

	   UP TO 90 per cent of poultry stall owners face having their
business licences cancelled for failing to fully comply with new
hygiene requirements to combat avian flu.
	   The 15 June deadline is a week away for full compliance with the
new hygiene requirements imposed following the avian flu scare.
	   The new hygiene conditions were aimed at upgrading hygiene at
poultry stalls.
	   The measures include the installation of a refrigerator for
slaughtered poultry and a high pressure water jet cleaner, as well
as the use of durable and impervious cages for live poultry.
	   Steven Wong Wai-chuen, vice-chairman of the Poultry Retailers
Association, appealed for a three-month extension of the grace
period which ends next Monday.
	   He estimated only 10 per cent of poultry vendors had fully
complied with the government's new standards.
	   Mr Wong said many business owners were reluctant to further
invest in the stores due to the recent business slump. He estimated
the new facilities would cost around $100,000 for each stall.
	   Mr Wong said business had dropped 40 per cent due to the
economic slump aggravated by high chicken prices.
	   He said wholesale prices remained at the $14 to $18 per catty
level, compared to the $9 to $12 before the government ban on
chickens in December. The retail price is now between $22 and $24
per catty.
	   ``Many people see it as not worth spending about $80 on a
chicken, especially when the whole economy is in a slump,'' Mr Wong
said.
	   He added that many consumers were now choosing other meats such
as pork for their meals.
	   Meanwhile a spokeswoman for the Urban Services Department _ the
licensing authority for the 383 poultry market stalls and about 220
fresh provision shops in the urban area _ said the department was
unlikely to extend the deadline.
	   What it would do was consider the poultry stalls and meat shops
on a ``case-by-case'' basis when the 90-day-grace period was over
next Monday.
	   The spokeswoman said the department had been aware of the
situation where most vendors failed to use the high pressure water
jets to clean the shops and equipment on a daily basis.
	   The officials of the Regional Services Department could not be
reached for comment.

 &UR; Dissident: Abacha's death `incredible opportunity' for Nigeria

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The death of Nigeria's military ruler inspired
fresh hope among dissidents and governments that the nation could
now move rapidly toward democracy.
	   Some campaigners for democracy were cheered by the appointment
of a career military man to succeed Gen. Sani Abacha as head of the
government.
	   ``It's my belief, it is my hope that in the next few days, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakara, whom I know very well, is going to open
dialogue with the civilian opposition leaders in that country
towards redressing the issues that are on the table,'' former
Nigerian foreign minister Bolaji Akinyemi said Tuesday in an
interview with BBC radio.
	   Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian writer who won the 1986 Nobel Prize
in literature and an outspoken opponent of military rule, told
reporters in Jerusalem that Abacha's death presented ``an
opportunity for Nigerian civic society, an opportunity for the
Nigerian military, and an opportunity for the international
community.''
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' Soyinka said.
``So it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
	   The United States, Britain and the Commonwealth of Britain and
its former colonies urged a quick transition to democracy in
Nigeria, a former British colony. France also urged Nigeria's new
leaders in that direction.
	   ``We hope that following the death of Gen. Abacha, there will be
an opening for a stable transition to an early return to democracy,
with the election of an accountable civilian government which will
restore and respect human rights,'' Britain's Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said in a statement.
	   ``Our hope, among others, would be, at this moment of
transition, that an accountable civilian government ... will emerge
from what has been a very horrific episode in which basic
fundamental rights have been suspended,'' said White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   The 53-nation Commonwealth suspended Nigeria after playwright
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other dissidents were executed in 1995.
	   Nigerian Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the
Commonwealth, told BBC TV: ``The Commonwealth would hope and would
expect that the Nigerians will decide to go back to the way of
democracy and in so doing will gain readmission to the
Commonwealth.''
	   The international community should now press for elections in
Nigeria this year, said New Zealand's foreign minister, Don
McKinnon, who is also vice-chairman of the Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group on Nigeria.
	   ``Nigeria was one of the leaders in democracy in Africa back in
the 1960s and there's no reason why they can't return to it,''
McKinnon said.
	   In New York, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Annan praised the contribution made by Nigeria under Abacha to
ending the civil war in nearby Liberia and to restoring the
democratically elected government of Sierra Leone.
	   ``It is our hope that the good relations that exist between our
two countries will persist and that the path to democracy in
Nigeria will be pursued to its full conclusion,'' read a statement
issued from the Organization of African Unity summit in Burkina
Faso.
	   Nigeria's next leader could hardly be worse than Abacha,
Saro-Wiwa's son said in Britain.
	   ``In Nigeria, the thinking has always been that every successive
dictator is worse than the previous one, so one hopes that we don't
get another dictator because he will have quite a record to better
Abacha's appalling record,'' said Ken Wiwa.
	   Soyinka urged the military to release all political prisoners,
including Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of Nigeria's aborted
1993 presidential elections, and name Abiola head of a transitional
national unity government.
	   ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's a democratic
option,'' he said. ``And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting,'' Soyinka said.

	   The all share price index in the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)
further plummeted yesterday for the second consecutive day created
a fresh crisis in the market following a bullish business for the
last few days.
	   The DSE price index plunged by over 16 points yesterday to 672
points following a nose-dive of 89 points Sunday. The change in
capitalisation yesterday was 2.41 per cent over that of Sunday.
	   The downswing in the DSE came as a thunderbolt as the market had
been steadily gaining in the previous week, with a jump of over 81
points in share prices alone on Saturday, the first business day of
the current week.
	   Then came the abrupt nose-dive from Sunday that continued
yesterday. The Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) was also witnessing
similar decline in the share price index after an upswing last
week.
	   The CSE price index yesterday fell by 9.6 points to 303 points.
In terms of capitalisation it declined by 2.90 per cent over the
previous day's (Sunday) business turnover. On Saturday, the index
also fell by 11.32 points.
	   In all 133 issues were traded yesterday in the DSE of which 27
gained and 104 incurred loss, while in the CSE 38 issues were
traded yesterday of which three gained and 35 incurred loss.
	   The market analysts said yesterday's fall in the price index
both at Chittagong Stock Exchange and Dhaka Stock Exchange was in
conformity with the plunge the market suffered on Sunday. But they
were quite at a loss to explain why it was behaving so erratic
while the market fundamentals remained by and large poor.
	   The DSE sources were, however, unanimous on, one point -- that
is the short supply of shares and debentures to put investors money
from a wide range of choice.
	   A Kerb market trader said because there was a shortage of blue
chips, how long will the traders wait and keep away from investment
in anticipation that new issues were coming in the market?
	   He said there was no indication that fresh issues were coming,
so they were buying second rate shares and even the shares that
which had otherwise no appeal to the investors. It was a supply
crisis. But it was also a confidence of crisis at the same time.
	   He said investors were not ready to take risks, so everytime
there would be a rise in the share prices it would be followed by
rush for sale and cash the profit. The DSE officials also made
similar observations and said that in the present context even bad
chips had become good ones only to bridge the gap between the poor
supply and the increasing demand.
	   A section of dishonest traders had tried through the kerb market
to create a market warm up and thereby make whatever financial gain
was possible to exploit from the floor, some sources alleged.
	   That was what exactly happened in a wider scale before market
crash in December 1996. It could partly explain why the share
prices fell over the last two days after a bullish business over
the last few weeks.
	   The analysts said that the market indication was that the small
investors were prepared to put money in the stock market. But the
government failed to increase the number of new issues.

	   PROVISIONAL Regional Councillors are searching for a consensus
over an expected pay rise proposed in a review on the allowance
system.
	   The review is said to have proposed a 16.3 per cent increase in
allowance, from $51,360 to $57,520 a month.
	   It will also introduce a new system to divide the allowance into
personal and administrative expenses.
	   Two-thirds of the proposed allowance will be earmarked for
office expenses.
	   Democrat Josephine Chan Shu-ying, a member of the interim
council's ad hoc committee on members' allowance, said the group
had yet to discuss the recommendation which was originally
scheduled for April.
	   ``Given the current economic situation, it is hard to justify
the rate of increase to the public,'' she said.
	   Ms Chan said either the allowance should be frozen or a ceiling
for the increase should be set.
	   ``The personal allowance should be revised according to the
civil service pay rise, but the office expenses can be revised
according to the inflation rate.'' She said councillors from the
Democratic Party would meet later to unify their stance.
	   Her colleague Lee Wing-tat said the party supported the new
system, but added members had yet to decide whether to agree to
freeze the increment.
	   Au Yeung Po-chun, of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment
of Hong Kong, said her party agreed the new allowance should be
frozen for a year.
	   But she said they were still considering whether to endorse
dividing the allowance into two parts.
	   ``Take me as an example, I run two offices, so the new system
will not be an advantage,'' she said.
	   But she added that the debate on the new system should not be a
big problem _ she will support it if her party does.
	   Independent Ting Yin-wah is all for freezing the increase.
	   ``If the new system is implemented, an increase in allowance
will follow eventually, so it should be frozen together with the
allowance increase.''

	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday directed the officials of
Water Resources Ministry for taking into consideration the natural
condition of the surroundings while making any plan.
	   ``All plans should be drawn up maintaining ecological balance,''
she said reviewing a high-level meeting at the Secretariat
yesterday.
	   She emphatically stated the need for land reclamation and
evolving domestic system for implementing water-related projects as
well as achieving self-reliance rather than dependence on donors.
	   Referring to the crying need for creating green belt in the
coastal region, Hasina called for coordination among Water
Resources Ministry, Forest and Environment Ministry and Bangladesh
Navy for afforestation programme in the region.
	   She also stressed on dredging of rivers to reclaim lands and
said country's water bodies and canals are being silted up which
should be redressed urgently.
	   The Prime Minister asked the officials for taking steps to
ensure navigability of the rivers and solve the waterlogging
problem.
	   Hasina directed the officials to make judicious use of land and
suggested appropriate measures for development of haor, baor and
beels.
	   She expressed her concern over the encroachment of rivers and
canals and suggested coordinated efforts to stop this.
	   While reviewing various projects of the ministry Hasina called
for speedy implementation of the projects and their proper
monitoring.
	   She was happy to know that the Water Resources Ministry has been
using mini machine for dredging purposes.
	   Earlier, Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak said due to the
dynamic effort of the Prime Minister Water Sharing Treaty with
India has been signed and the Ganges Barrage Project will now be a
reality.
	   He listed several steps for streamlining the manpower and
resources of the ministry.
	   Razzak informed that the ministry has prepared a draft of
National Water Policy which will be placed for approval soon.

EBRD announces investment in Czech savings bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development acquired an 11.8 percent stake in
Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech Republic's largest savings bank, EBRD
said Tuesday.
	   The stake, valued at 2.5 billion koruna (dlrs 75.8 million),
represents the largest ever single equity investment by the EBRD,
the bank said in a statement.
	   The Czech state's 45 percent stake in Ceska Sporitelna remains
unaffected, it said.
	   The EBRD is a development bank established in 1991 to help the
post-communist countries in central and eastern Europe in their
transition fromas centrally planned to a market economy.
	   EBRD said it is buying the share in Ceska Sporitelna to enhance
its attractiveness to foreign investors ahead of its possible
complete privatization next year.

Jordan endorses controversial draft press law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government on Tuesday endorsed a
controversial draft press law that could considerably restrict
press freedoms.
	   The draft has to be approved by Parliament which will debate it
later this month, said a senior government official, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The bill comes five months after the supreme court overturned a
government decree ordering 13 tabloids to cease publication for
allegedly violating the provisions of another draft press law that
was introduced in May 1997.
	   The January ruling invalidated the previous draft law. The court
said then that the government could not enforce the draft law
without parliament endorsement.
	   The current press law has been in force since 1993. But the
government says its flexible provisions has led to a freewheeling
media which it says violate the norms and ethics of professional
journalism.
	   King Hussein had said his patience was wearing thin with
Jordan's 22 weekly tabloids, which are largely affiliated with
Muslim fundamentalist and other hard-line groups opposed to his
1994 peace treaty with Israel and pro-Western style.
	   The king's warnings were often accompanied by a clampdown on the
media, including sporadic blackout on news events, newspaper and
magazine censorship and frequent arrests and imprisonment of
journalists.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists named Prime
Minister Abdul-Salam Majali as one of 10 enemies of the press
worldwide in 1998.
	   Critics had warned the government against adopting the draft
press law.
	   ``Endorsing such a law will be a real massacre of public
freedoms in Jordan,'' wrote columnist Saleh Qalab recently in the
mass circulation al Arab al Yawm newspaper.
	   ``If it is endorsed, it will take Jordan back to the days of
martial law and it will impede its progress for a long time to
come,'' he added.
	   But King Hussein told a group of 150 journalists last Saturday
that the law will provide a ``more responsible press'' and increase
public freedoms.
	   A minimum fine of dlrs 50,000 _ a 30-fold hike _ will be slapped
on those who violate vaguely defined provisions of the state
security, said the government sources.
	   The draft law also forces journalists to divulge their sources
in court and gives the government more powers to censor the media.

	   THE Democratic Party will call for a motion in the new
Legislative Council to overturn the Education Department's decision
to place two more pupils in every classroom.
	   Backed by seven major education groups, Democrat Cheung
Man-kwong, chairman of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union,
said yesterday he would ask fellow legislators to stop the
government from cramming classrooms.
	   Whatever the outcome, it will not be able to change the fact
that 30,518 kindergarten children were allocated primary one places
last Saturday.
	   They will register with the schools they have been assigned
today and tomorrow.
	   Any changes will only take place next year.
	   However, Yeung Yiu-chung of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong does not see the necessity to freeze the
plan, provided more teachers are employed.
	   Mr Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Education
Workers, will meet officials from the Education and Manpower Bureau
to demand 182 more teachers be hired at a cost of $41 million to
cope with the inflated class size.
	   The government has refused to open about 1,961 vacant classrooms
to ease the overcrowding because they are either situated in remote
areas, scheduled for demolition or reserved for whole-day
schooling.
	   ``We do support whole-day schooling, but the resources saved (on
closed classrooms) should be spent on frontline educators,'' Mr
Yeung said.
	   In response to the pledge in the Policy Address for 60 per cent
of schools to operate on a whole-day basis by 2002/2003, the
Education Department has ordered the class size increases as a
temporary measure.
	   But the education groups argued whole-day schooling should be
achieved through building more schools and making use of vacant
classrooms.
	   They said the larger class sizes would reduce interaction
between teachers and pupils and increase teachers' workload.
	   At least 20,000 signatures have been collected from teachers and
school heads from primary and secondary schools to oppose the plan
with a second round of the campaign running currently under way.
	   From September, Primary One classes will be boosted from 35 to
37, while activity approach classes will increase from 30 to 32.
	   The reduction in class sizes in secondary schools is being
shelved.

Editor of Iranian newspaper found guilty of libel and defamation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court has convicted the editor of one of
Iran's most popular newspapers of libel and defamation.
	   The court handed down its verdict Monday against Hamid Reza
Jalaipur after hearing charges brought by the deputy public
prosecutor, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and
the State Prisons Organization, Iranian television reported
Tuesday.
	   The plaintiffs accused Jalaipur of printing ``insults, lies,
actions against public morality and publication of lies to agitate
public opinion,'' the television reported.
	   Last month, the revolutionary guard said reports published in
the newspaper accusing its commander of attacking growing
liberalism in the country were distorted and aimed at creating
tension.
	   Jalaipur's newspaper, Jameah, has been testing the limits of new
press freedoms introduced since moderate President Mohammad Khatami
took office in August. The afternoon daily, which started in
December with a circulation of 200,000, sells out within hours.
	   Khatami's reforms enjoy the support of most Iranians, but
hard-line elements in the government, particularly the powerful
judiciary, have resisted them.
	   Jalaipur's sentence was not made public.

	   THE national anthem was played and the flag raised in front of
hundreds of students yesterday _ on screens showing education
television programs.
	   The 15-minute film _ Under Our National Flag _ was aired for the
first time during civic education lessons at primary schools to
boost students' sense of patriotism.
	   It shows the flag raising ceremony with the national anthem

	   The screening is part of the Education Department's efforts ``to
promote civic education and instil a sense of identity with the
motherland'', a department spokesman said. ``It will also enhance a
proper understanding and respect among students for the national

been encouraged to fly the national flag and to teach their
students to sing the anthem on days such as the anniversary of the
handover and national day.

As World Cup begins, Air France strike lucrative for rivals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For Air France's rivals, the timing couldn't be
better: A strike by pilots has crippled the French flagship carrier
just as thousands of people are heading to France for the World Cup
games.
	   Most Air France flights are grounded, but anybody watching the
runways in Paris can see that the other guys are landing with the
largest airplanes they can find.
	   British Airways said Tuesday it is replacing some short-haul
Boeing 757s with 747 jumbo jets on routes into France, adding more
than 200 seats per flight that it can sell to stranded soccer fans.
	   Switching to bigger airplanes _ British Airways is also
replacing some 757s with larger 767s _ will let the carrier fly up
to 2,400 extra people from London to Paris this week alone.
	   With sports enthusiasts from around the world forced to change
their plans, British Airways estimates it's bringing in an
additional 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) a day in unexpected
revenues.
	   Air France's misfortune is also creating a bonanza at the
Eurostar high-speed train services that take people between England
and France through the undersea Channel Tunnel.
	   Eurostar is bringing in tens of thousands of pounds (dollars)
daily in extra revenue, although the train bosses were bashful
about offering any precise estimates. A separate desk has been set
up to handle the flood of passengers transferring from Air France,
Eurostar said.
	   ``It's a few hundred coming our way each day,'' Eurostar
spokesman Roger Harrison said. With fares running up to 319 pounds
(dlrs 520) per passenger, that adds up quickly.
	   Airlines and train companies had counted on lots of extra
business from the World Cup matches that begin Wednesday and run
for a month in 10 French cities. But the walkout at Air France made
the business outlook even better.
	   Lufthansa German Airlines said demand was up on routes between
Germany and France, so Lufthansa, too, is rolling out bigger
aircraft when possible. Spokeswoman Gudrun Gorner could not say how
many seats will be added or how much extra money Germany's big
airline hopes to rack up.
	   At British Midland, executives said the Air France strike had
created a marginal improvement over business that was booming
anyway because of the World Cup.
	   How high will profits rise?
	   ``I would imagine it's going to be an extra 40 percent, but I
don't have a pound figure,'' spokeswoman Sarah Able said.

Report: Russian missiles already on Cyprus

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian air defense missiles have been delivered
to Cyprus despite Turkey's vow to stop the weapons reaching the
island, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry refused to confirm or deny the
report by the respected Segodnya daily.
	   However, ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin reiterated the
long-held Russian argument that the S-300 missiles would threaten
no one.
	   ``We have been giving repeated explanations that the missiles
are a defensive weapon,'' Nesterushkin said. ``The presence of
weapons on the island is the outcome of the unsettled conflict
between the Turkish and Greek population on the island.''
	   Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms trading monopoly denied that the
delivery had taken place and said the missiles will be sent to
Cyprus in mid-August as planned, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin reiterated that his
country would not tolerate the missiles' deployment in Cyprus. ``If
the S-300 missiles are deployed on Cyprus, we will do whatever is
necessary,'' the Anatolia news agency quoted him as saying.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the missiles'
deployment.
	   In Nicosia, government spokesman Christos Stylianides refused to
comment on the newspaper report.
	   The S-300, capable of shooting down aircraft and missiles, is
the Russian equivalent of the U.S. Patriot missiles that gained
fame during the Gulf War.
	   Greece has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military conflict between
two NATO allies.
	   Turkey maintains 30,000 troops on Cyprus since it invaded the
island in 1974, following a failed coup by supporters of union with
Greece.
	   Cyprus has said it is ready to cancel the dlrs 200 million
missile deal if there is substantial progress toward the
reunification of the island and if Turkey accepts its proposal for
demilitarization.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that demilitarization
of Cyprus is essential for solving the conflict and called for more
international efforts to help end the confrontation.
	   The latest attempt to restart talks to reunify the Mediterranean
island by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed last month.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Through no fault of his, a businessman
holding a Citibank Bhd Preferred Mastercard lost a RM1.5 million
contract when the bank rejected his application for a RM1,710 cash
advance, the Sessions Court heard today.
	   Businessman Kogelen Govindasamy said besides losing the
contract, he also had to pay RM150,000 to the other party for
failing to deliver the goods concerned.
	   Kogelen said the bank rejected his application for a purported
payment default, when in fact he had made the payment, but the
money was credited to someone else's account.
	   In his statement of claim, Kogelen, a card holder since 1994,
said he paid RM2,000 to the bank on Oct 15 and was told he could
use the card three days after payment was received.
	   On Oct 28, 1996 when he was in Madras, he applied from Citibank
Madras for an advance of Rs 25,000 (RM1,710), but his application
was rejected since he had purportedly failed to pay RM2,000.
	   Kogelen said although he appealed for his application to be
considered to avoid losing the contract to supply the anti-wrinkle
creme Liposol, the bank refused to entertain his appeal.
	   He found out later that due to Citibank's negligence, the Oct
15, 1996 payment was credited into the account of another
Mastercard holder on Oct 19, 1996. The money reverted to his
account only on Nov 12, 1996.
	   He is claiming RM150,000 in damages, interest, costs and other
relief.
	   Kogelen was represented by T. Kunan while K. Vijayaram appeared
for the bank.
	   In its defence, the bank denied telling Kogelen that he could
use the card after paying RM2,000.
	   It said at the material time Kogelen had passed the due date for
payment and had failed to settle within time.
	   The bank said it could suspend the card facilities if payment
was late.
	   Asked by his counsel, Kogelen said he could not buy his plane
ticket to Bangalore since he normally used his credit card when
abroad.
	   Moreover, there was a limit on the amount of rupees one could
take into India.
	   The bank's witness Calvin Chan said even if the money was
rightly credited, Kogelen was still not entitled to use the card
since he still had to pay another RM474 as the minimum payment was
RM2,474.
	   Hearing continues on June 15.

	   THE pro-Beijing Hong Kong Progressive Alliance (HKPA) will
contribute towards reviving Hong Kong's economy by freezing any
salary increase for lawmakers and lobbying others to do the same.
	   Party chairman Ambrose Lau Hon-chuen hoped his austerity move
would also influence members of the two municipal councils and
district boards to freeze their salaries.
	   He and three other party members unveiled their proposal after
holding pre-budget talks yesterday with Financial Secretary Sir
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen.
	   Mr Lau also hoped the proposal would influence civil servants to
consent to lowering their proposed pay rise, which ranges from 5.79
per cent to 6.03 per cent.
	   He said the rate of increase was not in line with the spirit of
the government in sharing difficulties with the people.
	   But he did not confirm whether HKPA members in the first SAR
legislature would go for the freeze alone if other parties refuse
to follow suit.
	   The next pay rise for the legislature is scheduled for October.
	   ``We will consider what we should do. It is not fair if only you
are frugal and others not,'' Mr Lau said.
	   ``We are willing to take the lead to freeze our members' salary
in the legislature which may produce a catalytic effect to share
the economic hardship with Hong Kong citizens.'' He proposed
keeping the salary at $57,330, the same level as before last
October.
	   In February, 52 of the 60 provisional legislators decided not to
implement a salary increase to $60,830 backdated to October.
	   On the next budget, Mr Lau told Sir Donald a deficit budget
would be acceptable if the government needed large expenses to
maintain basic social services and stimulate the economy.
	   Mr Lau did not think a deficit budget would violate the Basic
Law.

Low-cost airline wars heat up in Europe

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Little airlines across Europe are taking off on
dozens of new routes, luring passengers with colorful sales pitches
and cheap fares.
	   One advertisement shows Greek businessman Stelios Haji-Ioannou,
the boss of easyJet, lamenting that he's ``tired of being ripped
off'' every time he flies home to Athens.
	   Haji-Ioannou's response: Two daily flights from London that take
off in July with tickets starting at 69 pounds (dlrs 112) one way _
one-third less than similar flights on British Airways or the Greek
flag carrier, Olympic Airways.
	   Low-cost rival Debonair is running ads featuring a promise by
its boss, former Continental Airlines executive Franco Mancassola,
not to squash passengers into tiny seats. In all his years of
running airlines, Mancassola boasts, he has never sold a seat to a
sardine.
	   And a low-cost Irish carrier, Ryanair, recently launched new
London-to-Dublin flights with fares as low as 30 pounds (dlrs 49)
one-way.
	   ``This fare is not a gimmick. It's here to stay,'' says
Ryanair's marketing director, Tim Jeans.
	   The big airlines are taking note, and it's not the clever ad
copy that has them worried.
	   The small, no-frills carriers are cutting into their business on
routes that for decades were run in cartel fashion. But that was
before the European Union began a deregulation of its aviation
industry that was completed a year ago.
	   With new carriers starting up services all around Europe,
analysts have been wondering if the newly deregulated skies will
run into the same problems that followed U.S. deregulation two
decades ago _ numerous airline bankruptcies.
	   An ominous shadow was cast on the low-cost sector of the
industry in May when one of Europe's biggest and most profitable
airlines, British Airways, stepped into the market. BA launched its
own low-cost carrier, called Go, based at London's uncrowded
Stansted Airport.
	   Accusing BA of illegally subsidizing Go in a bid to wreck the
competition, easyJet is fighting back in court.
	   ``The suspicion we have is that British Airways is doing this to
put the other low-cost carriers out of business,'' easyJet
spokesman James Rothnie said. ``That's historically what they do.
They either buy you out or stamp you out.''
	   Go executives did not respond to interview requests. But after a
judge stuck down easyJet's bid to stop Go from flying, chief
executive Barbara Cassani predicted that if the case went to trial,
it would show that ``Go is entirely lawful.''
	   The cheap carriers are modeled after Dallas-based Southwest
Airlines, which reshaped air travel in America. But while Southwest
turned heads in the U.S. industry by serving only complimentary
peanuts and drinks, many of the low-cost European carriers make
passengers pay for even a cup of coffee if they want one.
	   Southwest's low fares forced the big players in the domestic
U.S. market to shave costs by cutting meals on many flights and to
operate small carriers to fly passengers into their hubs from
secondary cities.
	   The trend in European aviation is likewise forcing the big
players to find different ways to respond.
	   Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, found itself confronted with
low-cost competition at its Brussels hub from Virgin Express, run
by British entrepreneur Richard Branson.
	   Rather than get into a damaging fare war, Sabena forged a
partnership with Virgin Express. Sabena canceled a number of its
services from Brussels to three cities, London, Barcelona and Rome,
and let Virgin Express take over the routes with its own airplanes
and crew.
	   Both carriers sell tickets on the same jets, however, with
Sabena marketing all of the high-priced business class fares and
Virgin Express selling some of the cheaper seats in the back of the
airplane.
	   ``It was a win-win situation,'' said Etienne De Nil, Sabena's
general manager for the United Kingdom and Ireland. ``Instead of
fighting with each other, we said, `Let's cooperate.'''
	   The deregulation of Europe's skies came at a time when air
travel was booming and many airlines around the world were racking
up record profits.
	   Perhaps thanks to the timing, nobody has gone broke _ yet _ and
the expansion seems to be continuing with no letup in sight. But
the pressure will be on when times turn tough in what has always
been a highly cyclical business.
	   ``As long as British Airways are there, it is inevitable that
some of the low-cost carriers will go out of business,'' said
Rothnie, the easyJet spokesman.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Malaysians will have an opportunity to buy
a wide range of Made-in-Malaysia products at the biggest exposition
to be held in the country next month, Transport Minister Datuk Seri

	   Organised by the Kuala Lumpur/Selangor Chinese Chamber of
Commerce and Industries, the ``Love Malaysia Consumer Fair 1998''
will have more than 400 booths selling local products.
	   Dr Ling, who is also the MCA president, said the exposition
would be held over 10 days, from July 10, at the Mines Exhibition
Centre.
	   ``The organiser is also inviting Bumiputera and Indian
entrepreneurs to participate,'' he told a Press conference at his
office after meeting a delegation of KLSCCCI members, led by its
president Lim Guan Teik.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad has consented to
be the patron and will be opening the fair.
	   Dr Ling said: ``To show their love for Malaysia, the people must
buy local products, particularly during this period of economic
downturn.

Virginia company sells cheap phone calls to Russia

	   RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) _ Want to make a call from Yakutsk _
Russia's Siberian diamond and gold capital _ to Moscow? Route the
call through the United States, then back to Russia, and you could
save a lot of rubles.
	   A small Virginia company, Applied Information Technologies, has
found a niche by supplying cheaper and clearer phone connections to
Russians, even if those calls have to travel thousands of extra
kilometers (miles).
	   Russia's primary phone company, Rostelcom, charges about dlrs
2.50 a minute for a call from Yakutsk to Moscow during peak hours.
AIT can do the same for dlrs 1.30, said Kim Kerns, owner of the
husband-and-wife operation based in the Richmond suburb of
Midlothian.
	   Discount or ``callback'' telephone systems allow callers
overseas to save a bundle by using an American phone line, skirting
the much higher prices charged by government-owned phone companies
in other countries.
	   To use a callback service, a subscriber dials an American phone
number provided by the service, lets it ring once and hangs up.
Since no one picks up on the other end, the caller is not charged.
The service's computer then calls the user back and gives a dial
tone, allowing the subscriber to make the call back overseas, but
billed as a call originating from the United States.
	   The callback computer wizardry is done by specialized
telecommunications companies that sell phone numbers to smaller
resellers such as the Kerns, who in turn market them around the
world.
	   ``What you're ... trying to do is circumvent the telephone
monopolies and everything that goes along with that, including high
rates and virtually nonexistent service,'' Trevor Gunnd said.
	   Gunnd is deputy director of Business Information Service for the
Newly Independent States, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department
that tries to help companies like AIT do business in the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``Obviously callback is inconvenient but people use it to save
money,'' said Stacy Oh, director of marketing for Encino,
California-based Cross Communications Inc., an international
callback provider.
	   The callback industry started in the early 1990s and is worth
about dlrs 1.4 billion this year, said Cathleen Woodall, director
of marketing for M.J. Scheele and Associates, a San Francisco-based
telecommunications consulting company. The services have become
popular among expatriates living in countries like Japan that have
steep long-distance phone rates.
	   Ms. Woodall said there are about 170 callback providers, most
based in the United States.
	   Fifty-seven countries ban callback services, including the
Bahamas, India, China and Venezuela, according to a survey
conducted by the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva.
The services are legal in the United States.
	   While some countries try to block callback companies, others
embrace the new technology.
	   ``There are countries like Russia that support and encourage the
use of callback because it allows business to flourish and their
infrastructure is bad and they know it,'' Kerns said.
	   Kerns has about 140 customers, most in Russia and Ukraine, and
he has sales agents in Moscow and Yakutsk with about 500 additional
clients. He also has customers scattered around other countries
including India, Pakistan and Brazil. He would not say how much his
company earns.
	   Kerns has never been to Russia. He uses the Internet to find
salespeople and advertise his service. He requires most of his
customers to pay up front so people a world away don't stick him
with unpaid bills.
	   His agent in Yakutsk found him by trolling the World Wide Web
for a company offering cheap phone service. The agent runs a travel
business and his customers were complaining that they needed a
reliable and inexpensive way to call their home offices in St.
Petersburg on the other side of Russia.
	   Small callback resale businesses like Kerns' face a tough
future, Ms. Woodall said. Foreign phone companies are lowering
their rates in response to competition, cutting the callback
providers' profits.
	   ``We are definitely seeing a dropoff in callback service because
the margins are being squeezed so extremely,'' she said. ``I'd say
growth is going to be kind of flat. Staying the same for the next
year and maybe dropping of a little the year after that.''
	   Kerns has noticed that it's more difficult to make money.

	   THE new airport was given a stamp of approval with the launch of
a $566 million postal centre yesterday.
	   Organisers said the 24-hour operating Hongkong Post Air Mail
Centre at Hong Kong International Airport, Chek Lap Kok, will
handle around 548,000 letters daily.
	   Postmaster General Robert Footman said it would be operated by a
staff of 250 and open on 6 July when the new airport was launched.
	   ``The air-mail centre will meet postal needs well into the next
millenium and help us to offer superb postal services to the
community,'' he said.
	   ``It is equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology
capable of handling rapidly growing air- mail traffic.'' Letters
and parcels will be sorted by special processing machines instead
of by hand. And a container storage system will process mail that
will then be put onboard planes.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen praised
organisations such as government department Architectural Services,
who were the building managers and designers behind the new centre,
for launching the project.
	   British Postal Consultancy Service was the project consultant
and Yau Lee Construction was the building contractor. Siemens
ElectroCom of Germany was the main contractor for supplying postal
automation equipment.
	   ``The new centre will bring our postal services into a new era.
The state-of-the-art system will ensure that our postal services
will be efficient and one of the most advanced in the world,'' Sir
Donald said.
	   Other facilities at the new postal centre include an Elevating
Transfer Vehicle which handles bags of post for outgoing airmail.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Billboards with big, red English
lettering along the main streets of Damascus herald the arrival of
something new: the U.S. fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken has
come to Syria.
	   The KFC restaurant, opened in mid-May, joins a growing number of
Western companies like Germany's Adidas and Italy's United Colors
of Benetton brought by franchise or license under Syria's 12-year
effort to modernize its economy.
	   Reforms have been encouraged by the West, especially Europe,
under the theory that giving Syrians and other Arabs more of an
economic stake in the Middle East would encourage peace in the
region.
	   But change comes slowly in Syria's staid socialist system, and
the economy has not been growing fast enough to improve living
standards or create jobs for thousands of young Syrians entering
the work force.
	   All this is creating rare public grumbling in Syria, where Hafez
Assad has ruled with an iron hand for nearly three decades.
	   Even state-run newspapers like Tishrin have complained that
government workers are forced to seek second jobs to supplement
salaries of 2,000 to 5,000 Syrian pounds (dlrs 40 to 100) a month.
	   And businessmen like Rateb al-Shallah, president of the Syrian
Chambers of Commerce, have become outspoken in calling for more
economic liberalization.
	   Al-Shallah told a recent chamber meeting that the government
must take ``a daring and necessary decision'' to reform the banking
system, establish a stock exchange and ease import restrictions so
the country can compete internationally.
	   Syria already has come a long way from the 1960s, when the
government nationalized all large industries, including banks and
public utilities.
	   Since 1986, it has allowed private investment in agriculture and
industry. Then, in May 1991, Parliament passed what has become
Syria's economic mantra, Law No. 10.
	   It aims at attracting investment _ from foreigners as well as
Syrians with billions of dollars squirreled abroad _ by giving tax
holidays of up to nine years, customs exemptions on machinery and
the right to repatriate profits.
	   So far, 1,292 new agricultural, industrial and transport
projects worth 312 billion Syrian pounds, or about dlrs 8 billion,
have been approved, says Mohammed Sarakbi, head of Syria's
Investment Office.
	   Sarakbi says the country is happy with its ``pluralistic
economy'' of public and private enterprises and does not envision
major new reforms soon.
	   ``Syria follows reforms in gradual steps,'' he said. ``The
government takes a step, then studies the results. It doesn't want
to do anything like what happened in Southeast Asia, where the
tigers turned into cats and rabbits.''
	   According to economic statistics, Syria can't afford to wait.
	   After oil discoveries and Law No. 10 spurred strong growth in
the early 1990s, expansion of Syria's dlrs 16 billion economy
slowed to 3.5 percent or less in recent years.
	   That's barely enough to keep up with the 3.3 percent population
growth, among the world's highest. More than half of Syria's 16
million people are under age 16, and some 200,000 young people
enter the work force each year.
	   Faced with low pay and an unemployment rate of some 15 percent,
an estimated one million Syrians have gone to neighboring Lebanon
for work. Thousands more are in the Gulf.
	   Foreign investment has fallen after the initial burst. The
economy didn't get the expected boost from the Middle East peace
process, which all but collapsed in 1996 after the election of a
hard-line Israeli government.
	   Western diplomats say foreign investors are discouraged by
widespread corruption, and young entrepreneurs complain they can't
get financing because state-run banks still give preference to
state-run companies.
	   Even successful businessmen say inadequate financing is
hindering development.
	   ``Law No. 10 was the first step in the direction of a market
economy. What we need is to complete it,'' said industrialist Saeb
Nahas, who urges that private banks replace government institutions
with their ``civil service mentality.''
	   Nahas' companies show how liberalizing the economy can benefit
Syria. One is a dlrs 17 million pharmaceutical plant that has some
300 workers producing medicine under license from Glaxo Wellcome of
Britain, Organon of Holland and Upjohn of the United States.
	   Another company has turned Syria from an importer to an exporter
of industrial chemicals, and a third makes ice cream bars.
	   Business consultant Nabil Sukkar says growing regional pressures
mean ``the time is right for another push on economic reform'' in
Syria.
	   Entrepreneurial Lebanon is seeking more open trade with its
neighbor, the Arab League has a 10-year plan for a free-trade zone,
and the European Union is negotiating a partnership agreement with
Syria to be phased in by 2010.
	   ``All of these will require a restructuring of the economy if we
want to take advantage of these alliances,'' Sukkar said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Restaurant owners who complain of
insufficient water supply in their areas should check whether they
have tanks big enough to store water for their consumption.
	   Selangor Waterworks Department deputy director V. Subramaniam
said many restaurants might have tanks which are too small to store
sufficient water for their daily use.
	   He said this was often true in the case of restaurant owners who
had renovated their premises to cater to more customers, resulting
in an increased use for water.
	   ``When an average restaurant with a tank big enough to store
sufficient water for its use is renovated to cater to more
customers, owners should also installbigger tanks.''
	   Meanwhile, the water level at the Sungai Semenyih, Sungai
Langat, Klang Gates and Tasik Subang dams remained relatively
stable today compared to yesterday.
	   As of noon today, the water level at Sungai Semenyih was
recorded at 99.74m, 205.61m at Sungai Langat, 89.53m at Klang Gates
and 36.45m at Tasik Subang.
	   However, there was a notable increase in the level of rainfall
at the catchment areas of the Sungai Semenyih and Sungai Langat
dams compared to yesterday.
	   At both dams, the level of rainfall was 14.3mm and 0.5mm
respectively compared to none at all yesterday.
	   Overall, the water output today was 82.3 per cent compared to
60.2 per cent yesterday at the Sungai Langat, Cheras and Ampang
Intake treatment plants.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - In a kind gesture that is hoped to motivate
others to do likewise, 25 Public Service Department's pension
division staff donated a portion of their monetary award to the
National Special Fund.
	   The staff, who had earlier received their bonus at an excellent
service award ceremony, collected the money and handed a RM1,240
cheque to PSD director-general Tan Sri Dr Mazlan Ahmad.
	   Pension division assistant director Shamsuddin Yunus said
although the contribution to the fund was small, it was done with
sincerity which could set a good example.
	   ``I don't know of any other government staff who had done
this,'' he said at his office today.
	   He said the contribution was also a reflection of the PSD
staff's patriotism apart from their gratitude for having been given
the excellent service award.
	   The National Special Fund was set up in March 6 to collect
donations and valuables to boost national reserves and help
economic recovery.

	   The High Court yesterday dismissed the writ petition that was
filed challenging the legality of the four bills on Chittagong Hill
Tracts.
	   BNP leader Barrister Rafiq filed the writ on behalf of one Aung
Yung Murong on June 1. He did not appear before the court on a
previous date fixed for hearing on June 2.
	   The case was dismissed as no lawyer appeared before the court
for the petition, which came up for hearing as motion in the
division bench yesterday.
	   Dismissing the case, the High Court bench, comprising Justice AM
Mahmudur Rahman and Justice Md Mozammel Hossain, gave ``dismissed
for default'' order.
	   It was reported that BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia directly
interfered to stop Barrister Rafiq from moving the writ.
	   However, during a recent press conference BNP leader Prof AQM
Badruddozza Chowdhury on a query told newsmen that the writ
petition filed by Barrister Rafiq was not a party decision.

Seven women win prestigious Spanish prize

<TEXT>
	   OVIEDO, Spain (AP) _ Seven prominent women jointly won Spain's
Prince of Asturias prize Tuesday for defending the rights and
dignity of women in the world.
	   Recipients of the annual prize for international cooperation
were Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala; Fatiha Boudiaf
of Algeria; Emma Bonino of Italy; Olayinka Koso-Thomas of Nigeria;
Graca Machel of Mozambique; Fatana Ishaq of Afghanistan; and Somaly
Mam of Cambodia.
	   The international cooperation prize is one of eight Prince of
Asturias awards this year.
	   The jury said it hoped the prize would ``attract the attention
of millions of women all over the world living in dramatic
situations and discrimination.'' It urged international
institutions and nations to adopt measures to eliminate the abuse
of women.
	   Eight prizes for different themes are awarded annually. They are
named after Crown Prince Felipe, son of King Juan Carlos.
	   Bonino is the European Union's top human rights official. Menchu
won the Nobel peace prize in 1992. Olayinka Koso-Thomas has been
working for 15 years to stop female circumcision.
	   Machel, widow of former Mozambican President Samora Machel,
works on children and women issues for the United Nations. Ishaq is
president of the Afghan Women's Council.
	   Mam has fought against prostitution. Boudiaf, widow of former
Algerian President Mohammed Boudiaf, leads a foundation that
opposes the extremes of Islamic fundamentalism.
	   The prizes, which include a check for 5 million pesetas (dlrs
35,000) and an original sculpture by Spanish artist Joan Miro, are
often called the Spanish-speaking world's Nobels.
	   Previous winners include German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzak Rabin.

	   THE mainland holds the key to reviving Hong Kong's film industry
which has been reeling from poor box-office receipts since the
early 90s.
	   Investors would put in up to 30 times the current $4 to $5
million backing for each Hong Kong film if Beijing eased
restrictions, said Crucindo Hung, the head of a 48-member industry
delegation visiting the mainland.
	   The delegation arrived in Beijing yesterday to discuss further
opening up the mainland market to Hong Kong films.
	   The delegation will meet Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and officials
of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, the Central
Propaganda Department and National Copyright Administration during
its four-day mission.
	   Mr Hung said that following the contraction of the Southeast
Asian market, the need to expand into the mainland had become more
important.
	   ``Without the mainland market, investors who are now willing to
put up $4-$5 million in a film will invest 20 to 30 times more if
the films can be shown in the mainland,'' he said.
	   Among the mission members are personalities such as singer-actor
Andy Lau Tak-wah, comic Eric Tsang Chi-wai and producer Michael Hui
Koon-man as well as legislator-elect Ma Fung-kwok.
	   They will seek to enhance co-operation with the mainland in film
production.
	   Mr Hung said the current restrictions on co-operative production
should be scrapped. The restrictions include pre-censoring the
script and requiring post-production work to be completed in the
mainland.
	   The delegation will also try to persuade Beijing to allow Hong
Kong films to have its own quota _ the mainland allows 10 foreign
films to be co-distributed each year with the overseas distributor
sharing the box-office gross.
	   Preventing the rampant copyright privacy will also be discussed.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Tuesday he's ready to grant special status within Indonesia to East
Timor in exchange for peace in the disputed territory.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. Habibie said
he had also signed a decree to release 10 Timorese fighters jailed
by Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975.
	   But Habibie made it clear that imprisoned East Timorese rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao would remain behind bars.
	   East Timorese activists contacted by The Associated Press said
Habibie's gesture is not enough for them to end their long-running
guerrilla war against Indonesian rule.
	   Nevertheless Habibie's comments appear to be a significant
change in policy toward East Timor following the resignation last
month of ex-President Suharto, who steadfastly refused to make any
concessions.
	   It's not clear what form the East Timor's special status might
take, although it is certain to fall short of a self-determination
referendum demanded by separatists.
	   In the interview, Habibie said East Timor would remain an
integrated part of Indonesia and special status would not lead to
political autonomy.
	   ``If you want to discuss it in that direction, there is no way
you can discuss that with me. No, we will not let that happen,'' he
said of autonomy or independence for East Timor.
	   A presidential aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that mainly Muslim Indonesia would grant some form of recognition
to the territory's culture and Roman Catholic religion.
	   Other parts of Indonesia with special status include the capital
Jakarta, the deeply Muslim province of Aceh in north Sumatra Island
and the sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java.
	   Their local governments enjoy a few, most symbolic, privileges
and powers.
	   East Timor leader Jose Ramos-Horta, the co-winner of the 1996
Nobel peace prize, rejected Habibie's offer as ambiguous and
arrogant after 25 years of annexation and human rights abuse.
	   ``I don't think it will satisfy the people of East Timor,'' he
told the BBC.
	   ``Our demand, which is very basic, is that the people of East
Timor be given the right, the opportunity, to express their views
about their own future through a referendum under U.N.
supervision,'' Horta said.
	   In Dili, Bishop Carlos Belo, who won the peace prize in
partnership with Horta, refused to comment.
	   Horta welcomed the planned released of 10 Timorese prisoners,
but added that all should be freed, including Gusmao.
	   Indonesia regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has committed
violent acts in his fight against Indonesian rule. Gusmao is
currently serving a 20-year prison term in Jakarta's Cipinang
Prison.
	   Fernando Araujo, an East Timorese activist and former political
prisoner who is in regular contact with Gusmao, said the withdrawal
of Indonesia troops and the release of Gusmao were basic demands
for any peaceful solution.
	   ``If Habibie won't release Xanana, we will continue fight and
die for the independence of our country all out,'' Araujo said.
	   Indonesian troops, under Suharto's orders, invaded the former
East Timor in 1975 after the Portuguese withdrew, ending about 400
years of colonial rule.
	   In 1976 Suharto declared East Timor the 27th province of
Indonesia _ an act not recognized by the United Nations. The U.N.
has been sponsoring talks between Indonesia and Portugal over the
territory's future, but with little progress.
	   Under Suharto, Indonesia steadfastly refused to consider the
granting any special status or any form of local autonomy to East
Timor.
	   Last week U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to Habibie
asking that Gusmao be released.
	   Earlier on Tuesday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Suharto's departure from politics has provided an opportunity for
Portugal, East Timorese separatists and Indonesia to resolve
conflicts over the disputed territory.
	   ``I think now is a good time to resolve our disagreement under
the auspices of the United Nations secretary general who has taken
the initiative over the years,'' Alatas said.
	   In the past, Alatas has accused Portugal and the East Timorese
separatists, led by Horta, of being inflexible.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Fifteen heads of government, including
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, are expected to
attend the Second Southern Africa Dialogue on Smart Partnership
which is to be held in Swakopmund, Namibia, from July 26 to 29.
	   Namibian High Commissioner to Malaysia Ndeutapo Amagulu said the
conference, themed ``The Generation of Wealth in Southern Africa'',
would provide an opportunity for participants to engage each other
with fresh ideas, propositions and plans that could translate into
successful business ventures.
	   He told a Press conference that apart from the 15 leaders,
Namibia also hoped to attract about 350 participants comprising
civil servants, business executives and labour leaders throughout
Africa.
	   Amagulu said the smart partnership concept was bound to gain
popularity as it harnessed the resources of the public and private
sectors for economic development and encouraged long-term
``win-win'' business alliances.
	   He said heads of government and businessmen should work in
unison to ensure the overall success of smart partnerships.
	   He said it was high time the leaders implemented smart
partnership and took the lead in their respective countries.
	   The smart partnership philosophy, he said, which was introduced
to southern Africa in May last year through the First Southern
Africa Dialogue, had proven to be a success as it had led to
incredible economic transformations in his country.
	   ``The concept has helped push our economies into high gear. In
fact, it had showed us the way forward not just in the field of
economics but also in the social and political sectors.''

	   BUTTERWORTH, Mon. - The wooden foot bridge linking the Sultan
Abdul Halim ferry terminal with the Keretapi Tanah Melayu Bhd
railway station here will be closed indefinitely from noon on
Wednesday.
	   A KTM Rail Sdn Bhd spokesman said the closure was necessary to
facilitate the construction of the proposed 3.1km railway tracks
linking the station to the North Butterworth Container Terminal.
	   He advised ferry users and those from the Penang Port Commission
complex intending to reach the railway station to use alternative
routes to reach their destination.
	   ``Only foot passengers intending to reach the station or from
the station to proceed to the complex will be affected by the
closure. The foot bridge linking the Penang Port Commission complex
to the ferry terminal will not be closed.''
	   It is estimated that 11,000 people use the foot bridges daily.
	   Work on the railway track, costing RM235 million, is expected to
be completed by the end of next year.

Air France pilots' strike on collision course with World Cup

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with French Transport Minister urging talks. Trims.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ On the eve of the World Cup, France's Transport
Minister on Tuesday urged pilots and Air France to return to the
negotiating table as the air strike entered its ninth day.
	   ``Each moment, each hour, each minute must be used for talks for
discussion and for negotiation,'' Jean-Claude Gayssot told the
French parliament during a question-and-answer session.
	   On strike since last Monday, the pilots are increasingly seen as
the spoilers of French efforts to stage the World Cup, the world's
biggest international sporting event.
	   ``Finding a solution to the conflict is essential,'' Gayssot
said.
	   Talks broke down Saturday and no new negotiations have been set.
	   Criticism of striking French pilots continued Tuesday.
	   Alain Deleu, president of the French Confederation of Christian
Workers, said Tuesday on Radio Monte Carlo that ``nobody can
understand'' how the pilots could ``be allowed to disrupt the
welcome of foreigners for a world event.''
	   Air France is the official carrier of the World Cup, and the
airline has arranged special flights to transport the teams to
their destinations throughout the tournament.
	   Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta called an extraordinary
board meeting for Saturday.
	   The strike did not appear to be wrecking the party atmosphere in
the French capital.
	   Preparations for parades in Paris later Tuesday were in full
gear. The Champs-Elysees was decorated with the flags of competing
nations, and hotels strung up banners.
	   In the skies, only one in four Air France planes was expected to
fly Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, British Airways is cashing in on Air France's woes.
The company said Tuesday it was putting in service bigger planes to
fly an extra 2,400 people between London and Paris this week.
	   British Airways estimated it is bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) in revenues daily as a result of
the Air France strike.
	   The French pilots are protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in salary cuts Air France says are needed to modernize the
airline that was saved from bankruptcy in 1993. It reported profits
in 1996 and 1997.
	   Air France has offered to compensate the pilots by giving them
stock in exchange for the pay cuts.
	   Meanwhile, bus and subway service was reduced in Lyon, a World
Cup venue, on Tuesday following a drivers' strike there. A strike
by train conductors has been announced for Wednesday.
	   Another World Cup venue, Bordeaux, may also be hit with a
walkout by bus drivers on Thursday.

Defending champion Philippoussis upset in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Defending champion Mark Philippoussis slumped to a
first-round defeat at Queen's Club on Tuesday and then announced he
may not play at Wimbledon.
	   The ninth-seeded Australian, a power hitter with one of the
fastest serves in the game, was upset by Spanish grass-court novice
Jordi Burillo 7-6 (11-9), 7-5.
	   ``This year's been pathetic for me and I just haven't been there
at all,'' Philippoussis said. ``I'm just very confused at the
moment. I've tried to think about what's wrong, but I don't know
what it is. It's like I'm not hungry any more and it's not a good
feeling at all.''
	   In other matches, American qualifier Doug Flach, ranked 222,
surprised the Czech Republic's Daniel Vacek 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, and
12th-seeded Australian Todd Woodbridge advanced with a 6-2, 6-3 win
over Andre Sa of Brazil.
	   The 22nd-ranked Philippoussis double-faulted on set point to
hand Burillo the tiebreaker. In the second set, neither player
earned a break point until Burillo broke serve for the match when
Philippoussis sent a wild forehand long.
	   ``I believe I can play well on this surface,'' said the
92nd-ranked Burillo. ``It feels comfortable and is one of my
favorite surfaces. Mark wasn't playing badly, but I got my serves
in and was returning well, and that was the key.''
	   ``It is always an inspiration to play someone supposedly much
better than you,'' he said. ``That was an extra motivation for me,
although when I saw the draw I didn't think I could win the
match.''
	   A tournament victory in Memphis in February has proved to be the
only bright spot in a dismal year for the 21-year-old
Philippoussis. He has failed to advance beyond the opening round in
five of his 12 tournaments.
	   ``I'm actually deciding whether to play Wimbledon,'' he said.
``At the moment I'm not sure. I'm not sure what's going to happen.
I'll go to Florida and talk with my father about it.
	   ``On the court nothing's there for me. I haven't got the desire,
and I can't afford to go out there and give away matches like that.
It's better not going on the court at all.''

	   Parliament goes into budget session at 10 am tomorrow amidst
stormy political and nagging economic situation of the country.
	   Finance Minister SAMS Kibria will place the national budget for
fiscal 1998-99 at 3 pm Thursday. His budget speech will be
broadcast live by Bangladesh Betar and Bangladesh Television from
Parliament.
	   Main opposition BNP, which abstained from the House during the
last few days of the last session, will take part in budget
deliberations.
	   However, the BNP and Jamaat lawmakers, who are busy with the
long march to CHT, will not be able to attend the opening session.
	   The shadow Finance Minister of BNP M Saifur Rahman, now in
London, is expected to return home on June 22.
	   Kibria, who already indicated he will not propose fresh taxes
but seek expansion of the tax net, is under pressure from different
lobbies to give them fiscal benefits, including tariff protection
to the domestic industry.
	   The national exchequer is already in the red reportedly with
heavy government borrowings from the bank in view of shortfall in
revenue income to the tune of about Tk 1500 crore.
	   The World Bank, which will finance half of the Tk 136 billion
ADP (Annual Development Plan) for 1998-99, has been insisting on
raising prices of gas, electricity, fertiliser, etc and further
liberalising the market.
	   Kibria is unlikely to take the risk of proposing price rise of
such essentials in his budget to deny the opposition any political
leverage. But he is likely to allow respective organisations to
give effect to a higher price after the budget.
	   Besides adoption of the national budget, the lengthy session
will also take up some legislative businesses, including the
Upazila Bill.
	   The session is likely to be stormy with the opposition taking on
the government for its alleged failure to resolve the electricity,
gas and water crises, and check the rising crimes.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - The Sungai Pencala Residents' Association
will hold a meeting to discuss the issue of the Sungai Pencala Link
at 2.30pm on Sunday at Dewan Masyarakat Sungai Pencala.
	   Association chairman Datuk Noor Azam said Works Minister Datuk
Seri S.
	   Samy Vellu and relevant heads of department had been invited to
brief residents of Sungai Pencala on the project.
	   He said the meeting would be important as the Government had yet
to inform residents and affected landowners about the project,
which is part of the Sprint Highway and built on Malay reserve
land.
	   Noor Azam said this had given rise to many questions as well as
suspicions about the project.
	   On June 1, it was reported that the Cabinet had approved the
construction of the Sungai Pencala Link on the Malay reserve land.
	   Samy Vellu had said although Sungai Pencala residents had
protested against the highway, the Government felt the area had to
be developed and should not remain as Malay reserve land forever.
	   However, Noor Azam said, ``a six-lane highway in the middle of a
kampung is not development. This is destruction''.
	   ``The Pencala Link is not a project for the people. It is a
commercial project and 200ha of land will disappear and hundreds
more will be destroyed.''
	   The meeting would enable the Works Minister to explain the
development that would take place in Sungai Pencala, he said.

	   Apprehending attacks by soccer fans on power stations in case of
power failure during the World Cup, PDB has sought police
protection.
	   A decision to deploy police at every power station, supply unit
and residence of the PDB officials has already been taken, official
sources said.
	   Police protection has been sought for each and every electricity
supply centre and unit in all districts and thana headquarters of
the country, in addition to 55 power generating centres across the
country.
	   According to the sources, soccer fans are threatening the PDB
officials across the country of attacks if they fail to ensure
uninterrupted power supply during the World Cup matches to be
telecast by TV.
	   In the wake of frequent threats, they urged the police
administration to ensure their security.
	   Meanwhile, BTV has decided to telecast live 56 matches of the
France World Cup Football to be kicked off on Wednesday, leaving
the country's fans in great anxiety as erratic power supply has
been a common phenomenon.
	   A recent survey showed that 80.70 per cent soccer fans may react
sharply against the government if it fails to tackle the
load-shedding during the World Cup matches.
	   According to police, there is every possibility that the
political opponents will use the sentiment of the soccer fans
against the government.
	   If such a situation arises there is also possibility to deploy
BDR and army forces at the power generating centres to avert
possible attacks, the sources said.
	   PDB sources said the present shortfall of power generation in
the country stands at 500 megawatt everyday.

	   HONG KONG Interbank Offered Rates (Hibor) shot up dramatically
at yesterday's fixing against last Friday's as the troubled yen
went beyond 140 against the United States dollar.
	   The benchmark three-month Hibor rate soared to 9.17434 per cent
yesterday morning from 8.36458 per cent last Friday, before closing
yesterday at 8.75 per cent.
	   One-month Hibor was at 8.96711 per cent against 7.65972 per cent
at Friday's fixing, with the closing rate at 8.5 per cent
yesterday.
	   Carlos Cheung, head of the spot market division at the Bank of
East Asia, said Asian currencies had been battered again as the yen
crumpled against the US dollar. The yen dived to as low as 140
against the US dollar in yesterday's trading, from 139.44 last
Friday.
	   The yen's plunge hit regional currencies, including the Thai
baht and Malaysian ringgit, and eventually exerted pressure on Hong
Kong's interbank rates.
	   Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, however, denied
there was any speculative attack on the Hong Kong dollar yesterday
even as he stressed the strength of the US dollar peg.
	   ``There is no sign of weakness. There is no sign of any attack
at all. I do not need to do any additional measure to defend the
link. It is very strong,'' he said.
	   Mr Cheung expects the latest round of volatility in the
interbank rates to last at least until end-1998.
	   ``The (interbank) rates won't drop in a large magnitude even if
the yen declines further,'' he said.
	   But he did not rule out the possibility that the yen would
continue to slide if the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised
countries failed to come up with any rescue plan to bolster the yen
in the near future.
	   The market is awaiting a G7 meeting next week.
	   Yesterday's six-month Hibor was at 9.73684 per cent versus
8.94444 per cent on Friday. The overnight rate was at 5.50-6.00 per
cent against 5.00-5.50 per cent on Friday.

Fighters beat BlueWave 13-4

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters rapped out 16 hits, including a grand slam home run by
Jerry Brooks, trouncing the Orix BlueWave 13-4 at Tokyo Dome on
Tuesday.
	   Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins, has 11 homers.
	   The Fighters are one game ahead of the second-place Fukuoka
Daiei Hawks, who beat the Seibu Lions 9-3 at Yamagata.
	   The Hawks' Hiroki Kokubo hit a two-run home run, his first homer
of the season, in the fifth inning.
	   The Lions' Domingo Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A
Rochester, hit a home run, his 12th homer of the season, in the
eighth inning.
	   At Chiba, Joe Crawford hurled a four-hitter over seven innings
for his fourth victory against four defeats as the Chiba Lotte
Marines edged the Kintetsu Buffaloes 3-2.
	   The Marines scored three runs on two home runs _ a home run by
Iwao Oomura in the fourth and a two-run home run by Kiyoshi
Hatsushiba in the sixth. Oomura has one homer and Hatsushiba 11
homers this season.
	   In the Central League, Takanori Suzuki hit a one-run single and
Norihiro Komada also drove in another run with an infield hit in
the two-run eighth as the Yokohama BayStars beat the Yakult
Swallows 2-0 at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium.
	   Two other scheduled games were rained out.

U.N. human rights chief ``deeply disturbed'' by Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson Tuesday
urged warring Serbs and ethnic Albanian separatists to ``curb the
spiral of violence'' in the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   As the United States and other Western powers consider using
military means to try to stop the fighting, Robinson said in a
statement issued from U.N. European headquarters in Geneva the
violence was ``deeply disturbing.''
	   She said her staff in the region were reporting a ``grave and
worsening human rights and humanitarian situation.''
	   ``I urgently call on the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia, as well as leaders of the
Kosovo Albanian community, to curb the spiral of violence,''
Robinson said.
	   There were no immediate reports of new clashes Tuesday between
the Serbs and Albanian militants fighting for Kosovo's independence
from Serbia.
	   More than 250 people have died this year in fighting between
government forces and pro-independence Albanian guerrillas, known
as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Robinson said reports of human rights violations, including
arbitrary arrests and abductions, were increasing daily.
	   The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had
received reports of arbitrary killings, shelling of villages by
police and attacks on the military and police by armed Albanian
groups.
	   ``I am concerned this violence is taking place in a region where
approximately 47 per cent of the population is under the age of
18,'' Robinson said.
	   She expressed concern the Serb authorities had not answered her
office's inquiries about the fate or whereabouts of people
allegedly held by Serb police, or about police officers themselves
reported as abducted.
	   ``Free and unimpeded access to information is essential'' to
address the causes and consequences of the human rights crisis,
Robinson said.
	   On Monday, the United States said it hadn't ruled out military
options to stop the violence.
	   Earlier Tuesday, U.N. children's agency spokesman Patrick
McCormick said UNICEF didn't advocate a military intervention. But
it favored peacekeeping operations or ``anything that will keep two
sides apart and save the lives of civilians, especially children
and women,'' he said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency supports ``vigorous action'' to stop the
fighting, said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin.
	   ``Our hope would be that any intervention would serve to
stabilize the situation so that civilians don't move,'' Kumin said.
	   UNHCR staff are traveling to eastern Albania Tuesday to check
unconfirmed reports of arrivals of refugees.
	   ``If true it would signal a shift in the refugee flow and
possibly a consequent shift in the fighting in Kosovo,'' Kumin
said.
	   UNHCR says information from various sources suggests more than
60,000 people are displaced in Kosovo, Montenegro and Albania.
	   NATO will transport humanitarian aid from UNHCR's depots in
Bosnia towards Tirana and then by shuttle operation to the north
using helicopters or small planes on Wednesday, Kumin added.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Mon. - The Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council will
try to respond to Press inquiries the soonest possible and as
``transparently'' as can be.
	   At a luncheon with reporters today, council president Datuk
Dayang Adeline Leong, said that as a responsible local authority
the KKMC administration realised the need to get public opinion.
	   The media would be among those in the best position to assist.
	   ``In many instances, the media can influence its readers,
viewers and listeners, and can help to clarify matters, or vice
versa.
	   ``I am proud and happy to say that almost all reporters have
been very reasonable in carrying out their tasks.''
	   Leong said KKMC would also continue efforts to improve what it
had achieved over the years such as the implementation of the MS
ISO9002 quality system, which was a way towards Total Quality
improvement.
	   Sabah Journalists' Association president Joniston Bangkuai was
also present.

	   Jatiya Party secretary general Naziur Rahman Monzur yesterday
filed a defamation suit claiming damages of Tk 5 crore against the
editor and the publisher of the daily Muktakantha and Iffat Obayed,
widow of Awami League leader Obaidul Haque Babul, who was killed by
some miscreants on October 10, 1996.
	   Monzur alleged that the Muktakantha editor, KG Mostafa, and its
publisher, Iqbal Ahmed, had defamed him by publishing his
photograph with an alleged killer of Babul in their May 28 issue
while Iffat Obayed, the widow of Babul, defamed him in her
interview with the dailies Manobjamin on March 2 and Muktakantha on
May 31 saying the mastermind behind the killing of Babul was Naziur
Rahman Monzur.
	   The plaintiff prayed for a decree of Tk 5 crore in favour of him
against the defendants, costs of the suit, and any other relief or
reliefs he was entitled to get under law and equity.
	   The case, no 12, was filed in the court of Fourth Sub-judge of
Dhaka.

	   THE stock exchange yesterday warned that it would not rule out
taking disciplinary action against companies that failed to
disclose information relating to their connected transactions.
	   Lawrence Fok, executive director of the stock exchange's listing
division, said the exchange has observed of late an upsurge of
cases of directors of listed firms failing to notify the exchange
of connected transactions.
	   For instance, Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holdings and C P Pokphand
have not notified the exchange of loans obtained by their
respective directors.
	   Mr Fok warned that this practise comprised a breach of the
listing rules and culprits could be subjected by the exchange to
disciplinary actions.
	   ``Ignorance of the (listing) regulations is no excuse for
company directors,'' he said.
	   Mr Fok also urged company directors to read carefully paragraph
14 of the listing regulations which relate to connected
transactions.
	   He said the exchange was considering holding a series of
workshops to remind directors to comply with listing regulations.
	   The exchange is also considering whether to revise listing rules
enabling it to order companies whose shares have been suspended to
have trading of their shares resumed.
	   ``For those companies which are in a position to resume trading
but did not do so, the exchange at the moment is powerless to order
them to resume trading,'' he said.
	   ``We will see if this is feasible in the context of the law,''
Mr Fok said.
	   There are at least two companies in this situation at the
moment.
	   As for those companies which were still unable to resume trading
after a long suspension, Mr Fok said that trading of their shares
would only resume when they could produce a detailed update of
their financial position.
	   ``We want the market to understand that the stock exchange
certainly wants the companies to resume trading,'' he said.
	   Mr Fok also said that the decision of Cable &AMP; Wireless of
Britain to remove its secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock
exchange did not mean that the local exchange was losing its
attractiveness.
	   ``In the listing of some H shares, the volume of their
transactions in Hong Kong was much more than the volume of
transactions overseas,'' Mr Fok said.
	   ``Cable &AMP; Wireless has had a secondary listing in Hong Kong for
over ten years,'' Mr Fok said.
	   Its listing has been cancelled because there was very little
trading in the company's shares for a long time.
	   ``Only a handful of shareholders had used the trading services
in Hong Kong and the turnover level had remained low,'' according
to the company.

	   PENANG, Mon. - A leak in an underground pipe in Jalan Mesjid
Negeri about 3am yesterday disrupted water supply for 17 hours to
about 1,500 homes in the Island Glades and Island Park areas.
	   Penang Water Authority technician Mohd Sheriff Mahmud, who led a
10-man repair team, said supply was restored by 7pm.
	   Repair work caused a massive traffic jam in the evening from the
junction of Jalan Batu Lanchang and Jalan Mesjid Negeri to Jalan
Udini and Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah.
	   Jalan Mesjid Negeri had to be closed as the pipe is located in
the middle of it.
	   He said a motorcyclist lost control and fell into the flooded
worksite pit. However, he was not injured.
	   Mohd Sheriff regretted that many motorists shouted derogatory
words and hooted unnecessarily despite cones being placed to
demarcate the work zone.
	   A resident, C. Selvashekar, 42, said he had to get water from
Jelutong.
	   Another resident, R. Daniel, 50, was satisfied with the PWA's
repair work.

	   A seminar organised in the city yesterday to protest the recent
nuclear explosions in South Asia was foiled when two groups of
participants clashed with each other resulting in injuries to some
of them.
	   The trouble erupted at about 5.10 PM at the seminar room of the
National Book Centre, when Mostafa Farouq, a leader of Bangladesher
Samajtantrik Dal (BSD), sought clarification from the leaders of
Shamyobadi Dal, as to why the name of the BSD Chief was mentioned
as a discussant without his prior knowledge.
	   BSD activists went berserk as Dilip Barua, General Secretary of
Shamyobadi Dal, the organiser of the seminar, tried to take control
of the microphone from Mostafa Farouq.
	   Witnesses said the clash lasted 20 minutes during which a
handmade bomb was also exploded. BSD leader Bazlur Rashid Firoj was
among the wounded.
	   Both BSD and Shamyobadi Dal are components of the Left
Democratic Front (LDF), an alliance of eight left-leaning parties.
	   Officials of the National Book Centre (NBC) said 30 chairs, the
microphone and flower-plant vases were also damaged during the
clash.
	   Shamyobadi Dal leader Shafiqur Rahman Majumder who was presiding
over function escaped unhurt along with journalist Ataus Samad
	   Dilip Barua who was manhandled by the BSD activists left the
scene immediately. However, he could not be contacted till the
filing of this report last night.
	   When contacted, Shafiqur Rahman Majumder regretted the behaviour
of the BSD activists. LDF leader Nirmal Sen said they did not do
the right thing.
	   The seminar was organised to protest the recent nuclear
explosions by India and Pakistan.
	   When contacted, Mostafa Faruoq defended their actions. ``We went
to lodge protest and there would have been no clash if I was
allowed to finish my speech.''

	   DO you know that the Government amended the Control of Tobacco
Products Regulations 1993 (CTPR 1993) in April last year to check
the growing phenomenon of teenage smoking and to protect the public
from the dangers of passive smoking?
	   Acting on the Health Ministry's suggestions, the CTPR 1993's
stipulation of non-smoking areas and provisions for controlling the
advertisement of tobacco products, the distribution of free
cigarette samples, cigarette company sponsorship, the labelling of
cigarette packages and the sales of cigarettes to those under 18
were revised.
	   The eight general areas stipulated as strictly non-smoking zones
in the CTPR 1993 were entertainment centres (including cinemas and
theatres), hospitals and clinics, public lifts, public transport,
air-conditioned restaurants (in which no more than half of the
restaurant can be designated a smoking section), petrol stations,
the Esso Tower and the Island and Peninsular office buildings (both
of which are in Kuala Lumpur).
	   To ensure greater protection of non-smokers against passive
smoking, however, the designated areas were, in 1997, broadened to
include air- conditioned shops, airports (aside from the designated
smoking areas), government premises, public halls, institutions of
higher learning, kindergartens, day-care centres, public bus and
taxi stops, schools, banks, Telekom Malaysia Berhad, Tenaga
Nasional Berhad and Pos Malaysia Berhad counters; shopping
complexes, sports complexes and stadiums.
	   Aside from this, a subsection requiring owners of public
buildings and vehicles to place non-smoking signs on their premises
or vehicles was added to the CTPR 1993.
	   For buildings, the signs are to be 50cm by 40cm with the
non-smoking symbol measuring 30cm in diameter. In buses, taxis, the
LRT and trains, the signs are to be 18cm by 15cm with the
non-smoking symbol measuring 10cm in diameter.
	   Under the amended regulation, owners of public buildings and
vehicles are required to place non-smoking signs according to the
stipulated formats and numbers (in proportion to area size) in
readily visible areas by the June 30.
	   Should any owner of a public building or vehicle fail to do so
he/she can be issued a RM500 fine. Those who distribute packets of
cigarettes on which the tar and nicotine levels of the cigarettes
are not disclosed, on the other hand, can also be fined RM500.
	   A RM200 fine awaits those who sell tobacco products to persons
under 18 while a RM100 fine can be earned by smoking in a
non-smoking area. Persons below 18 caught smoking or chewing on
tobacco products face a RM50 fine.
	   The 1997 amendment of the CPTR 1993 also makes provisions for
exhaust grilles and fans to be placed in all smoking zones while
return air grilles are to be placed at non-smoking zones.

Apartheid scientist lifts lid on dirty tricks

 &UR; Eds: ADDS more testimony, RECASTS throughout and EDITS to conform

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Describing a world of poisoned
chocolates, death threats and drugs, two scientists on Tuesday cast
light on the murky world of the apartheid state's chemical and
biological weapons program.
	   Testifying before a panel probing apartheid crimes, Schalk van
Rensburg said Roodeplaat Research Laboratories, a military front
company, had produced poisons and given them to special forces
agents to be used in killing anti-apartheid activists.
	   Van Rensburg said the company had given them chocolates and
cigarettes laced with anthrax, poisoned whiskey and orange juice
and sugar containing salmonella.
	   Describing himself as a political liberal who only realized the
company's true nature after he joined, van Rensburg said he could
not leave for fear of being killed and had stayed on to secretly
slow down production.
	   ``We had been told in no uncertain terms if we let the side down
we are dead,'' he said. ``If I stayed there, I could minimize a lot
of (their) effort.''
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is investigating covert
military research programs set up by Wouter Basson, who headed the
army's Seventh Medical Battalion and ran the projects through a
sophisticated network of front companies.
	   Van Rensburg testified that he worked on a fertility project set
up by Basson to develop a ``vaccine'' against pregnancy. He
suspected Basson may have planned to secretly use it on South
Africa's majority black population.
	   Basson, who is expected to testify later this week, was forced
to resign from the army in 1993. He is currently being investigated
on charges of making and possessing ecstasy and mandrax drugs.
	   Earlier Tuesday, another scientist confessed to running a secret
program that made 912 kilograms of ecstasy with a street value of
up to 1 billion rand (dlrs 200 million).
	   Johan Koekemoer described working in 1992 for Delta Scientific,
a Basson front company, and being asked to make the drug as part of
a chemical warfare project.
	   Koekemoer said he suspected his superiors were dealing drugs on
the side because rather than being a life-threatening drug, ecstasy
produces feelings of bliss and happiness.
	   ``From my personal point of view I don't think that ecstasy is
an ideal compound to use as an incapacitant,'' Koekemoer said.
	   Koekemoer said he confronted his superiors with his doubts, but
they assured him the drug was to be used for military purposes and
he accepted their word.
	   The commission was set up by President Nelson Mandela in 1995 to
uncover the truth about apartheid crimes and promote racial
healing.

	   In a span of two days, two young sons of a millionaire of the
city's South Mugdapara area died in 'mysterious circumstances'.
	   Tarun and Bipu, in their twenties, sons of Dr. Yusuf Ali, a
physician and a resident of 3/Ka South Mugdapara under Sabujbag
thana, died on Friday night and Monday morning.
	   Dr. Yusuf Ali is a respected man in the area, the people said
and added that the two sons reportedly used to inclined to drink
alcohol.
	   Family sources suspected that Tarun might have died of
poisoning, after taking alcohol. The second son Bipu, who died in
the early hours of Monday in the Dhaka Medical College Hospital
(DMCH), had reportedly taken phensidyl on Sunday night.
	   Sabujbag police said they did not receive any report about the
death.
	   It is said that three other children of Dr. Yusuf, including a
son and two daughters were killed in a road accident in 1988.
	   The parents now have a lone daughter living in Saudi Arabia.

	   SWIRE Pacific is being tipped as the latest major corporate
likely to tap Hong Kong's syndicated loan market.
	   This emerged as United States ratings agency Moody's Investors
Service announced it had placed the debt ratings of Swire Pacific
and its subsidiaries under review for a possible downgrade.
	   Moody's said the review reflected concerns over Swire's changing
business profile from diversified conglomerate to a company mainly
reliant on property development.
	   About $7.8 billion of the group's securities stand to be
affected by the possible downgrade.
	   Banking sources said Swire Pacific executives had made inquiries
regarding a syndicated loan.
	   They said the group was seeking pricing lower than that obtained
by Cheung Kong for its recent $3.96 billion loan.
	   The loan, obtained in March, was priced at 53.5 basis points
over Hibor (Hong Kong interbank offered rate) for an average life
of four years.
	   In the past, Swire has obtained favourable loan terms. Its $3
billion Floating Rate Notes issue launched last April was priced at
32 basis points for three years and 39 basis points for five years.
	   Nikko Research Center chief analyst Steven Thompson said he
doubted that Moody's would downgrade Swire Pacific.
	   He said another ratings agency, Standard &AMP; Poor's, re-affirmed
its ratings for Swire some time ago.
	   Mr Thompson said there was no doubting Swire's financial
strength as the group's gearing ratio stood at 10 per cent at the
end of last year, but rentals for new tenancy agreements in its
properties were coming under pressure with the vacancy rate
currently standing at just 2 per cent.
	   An analyst with a Japanese brokerage house said that as at end
of fiscal 1997, some 54 per cent of Swire Pacific's debts had
fixed-rate interest.
	   He forecast the group's net debt-to-equity ratio at the end of
fiscal 1998 to be 17 per cent, with net debt amounting to $16
billion.
	   Swire Pacific had remained committed to its investment program,
with its projects expected to have an impact on profit growth over
the longer term. The analyst estimated Swire would earn about $1.5
billion in extra rental income by fiscal 2000 from new property
projects.
	   The group was also expected to benefit from completions of joint
venture projects from fiscal 2000, such as the third phase of the
Tung Chung Airport Railway project, and the redevelopment of the
Shiu Wing steel mill site in Tseung Kwan O.
	   Moody's said Swire Pacific's greater dependence on property
income, resulting from the weak performance of its aviation and
industrial businesses and reduction of ownership in Cathay Pacific,
might increase the volatility of its financial position.
	   It said the downturn in the local property market was a rating
concern.

	   The Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology Teachers
Association (BUETTA) yesterday postponed its strike programmes.
	   The BUETTA enforced the strike fro May 5 to realise its demands
including the reinstatement of the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Iqbal
Mahmud, who resigned on May 4 protesting the government's alleged
interference with the affairs of the university. The VC's
resignation was followed by resignation of 70 other teachers from
key administrative posts.
	   The decision to postpone the strike was taken at a general
meeting of the BUETTA, held with its President, Prof Abdur Razzaq
Akhand, in the chair. About 200 teachers joined the meeting.
	   The strike has been postponed on three conditions which are: the
VC will have to be reinstated; no government interference with the
affairs of the BUET and no discrimination against the university,
said Prof Akhand while talking to The Independent yesterday.
	   When contacted Prof Iqbal Mahmud, who has been continuing his
routine work as the VC, told The Independent that the deans'
committee was scheduled to sit today to finalise the date for the
resumption of classes.
	   Prof Mahmud, who met the BUETTA on Sunday, urged the teachers to
call off the strike and resume classes.
	   According to a press release of the BUETTA, the general meeting
expressed resentment over the Chancellor's reported inaction' to
resolve the month-long BUET crisis despite the repeated requests
from the BUETTA. The association said Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina's ``indifference to BUET and reluctance to play her due role
as Chancellor has angered the teachers'', and urged the PM to
``stop interfering'' in the affairs of BUET.

	   MALAYSIA'S rhinoceros conservation programme has hit a major
snag. It is one more casualty of the regional economic crisis.
	   Unless funds are forthcoming, a major component of the
initiative to conserve the peninsula's critically endangered
Sumatran rhinoceros may not be effective, pushing the species
closer to extinction.
	   Malaysia's economic difficulties have severely cut the
Department of Wildlife and National Parks budget for rhinoceros
protection units this year.
	   That translates to fewer patrols of rhinoceros habitat
throughout the peninsula. Leaving the forest largely unattended
will result in more poaching and rhinoceros mortalities.
	   Department sources say there is some money for rhinoceros
conservation but the economic downturn has forced the department to
prioritise its activities.
	   ``In the case of rhinoceros, the department will work out a plan
using limited resources to cover Taman Negara, Ulu Selama and
Belum, the major rhinoceros areas in the peninsula. It doesn't mean
we will neglect the localities which harbour fragmented
populations, however. Once we get more funding we will step up
patrolling there,'' add the sources.
	   Wildlife conservationists describe the situation as ``just
absolutely tragic'' because Malaysia is not able to accord enough
priority to rhinoceros survival in the peninsula.
	   The shocking revelation that the Endau-Rompin rhinoceros
population is down to fewer than five animals from 20 to 25 five
years ago has sent shivers down the spine of wildlife
conservationists.
	   That seriously hampers Malaysia's plan to conserve the Sumatran
rhinoceros, one of the five living species of rhinoceros found in
the world.
	   ``It isn't looking good for the Sumatran rhinoceros,'' says
Asian Rhino Specialist Group chairman Mohamed Khan Momin Khan. ``If
we are not careful, we will lose the Sumatran rhinoceros by the
turn of the century. Remember, we lost the Javan rhinoceros in
1932,'' adds Mohamed Khan, who is also the former director-general
of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks.
	   ``With the loss of the Endau-Rompin population, the probability
of extinction of the rhinoceros in the peninsula has been increased
by at least 100 per cent,'' says International Rhino Foundation
(IRF) programme director Dr Thomas Foose, who was in Kuala Lumpur
two weeks ago for a short visit.
	   Except for Taman Negara which has 33 to 40 animals, Ulu Selama
and Belum have suffered major losses in recent years.
	   Recent patrolling showed that logging is increasing in Gunung
Bintang Hijau in Ulu Selama, a rhinoceros stronghold. Department of
Wildlife and National Parks rhinoceros conservation officer Dr
Zainal Zahari Zainuddin says the population there has been halved
to six animals.
	   Significant reduction in numbers is also seen in Belum which now
has 10 animals. The situation is aggravated because of the forest's
proximity to the Thai border, making it easy for poachers to come
and go.
	   Current estimates put the rhinoceros population in Peninsular
Malaysia at between 50 and 60 although Mohamed Khan believes
stragglers (one to three animals) are moving around several states.
	   Endau-Rompin had one of the two largest populations, the other
being in Taman Negara.
	   Rhinoceros protection units were created in 1987 by the
Department of Wildlife and National Parks to patrol rhinoceros
areas in the peninsula.
	   Each unit is made up of between four and five rangers including
a team leader. Its job is to give a precise report of any
encroachment into the forested areas, the population count of not
only rhinoceros but other animals as well, and their movement
patterns.
	   These units have proven to be very effective in maintaining
rhinoceros populations but occasional losses have occurred during
times when patrols were temporarily stopped due to the lack of
funds.
	   ``It is hard work for the wildlife rangers,'' says Mohamed Khan.
	   ``Sometimes, they have to spend 20 nights at a stretch in the
forest. For that reason, it is impossible to expect these men to do
the job without adequate rewards,'' he adds.
	   The rangers whom Mohamed Khan describes as ``extremely
dedicated'' must be paid their allowances which they have been
receiving but not adequately.
	   It costs RM400,000 a year to sustain the 10 rhinoceros
protection units which are spread over Taman Negara, Endau Rompin,
Ulu Selama and Belum.
	   The United States-based IRF is providing some support towards
rhinoceros conservation both in Malaysia and Indonesia (US$155,000
a year for four years) but most of the funds have been spent in
Indonesia to build a managed breeding centre in Way Kambas and
tourism facilities.
	   Malaysia has started receiving funds from the IRF (RM120,000 a
year for the next three years) to be spent on the rhinoceros
protection unit programme and the Rhinoceros Captive Breeding
Facility in Sungai Dusun, Selangor.
	   Besides that, the US$1 million grant from the Global
Environmental Facility (GEF) for rhinoceros conservation will
expire at the end of 1998.
	   Sadly, the funding scheme does not allow for Phase Two projects.
	   Says Foose: ``We currently have two grants for rhinoceros
protection units in Indonesia from the US Rhino and Tiger
Conservation Fund and we will probably be applying to that fund for
Malaysia in the future.''
	   A government department such as the Department of Wildlife and
National Parks should not have to appeal for funds from
international bodies for its activities but the financial crisis is
leaving it with no choice.
	   The IUCN - The World Conservation Union - has included the
Sumatran rhinoceros on its Red List Categories (IUCN 1994). Its
assessment is that the Sumatran rhinoceros is the most critically
endangered of all rhinoceros species with a population of 250-400
distributed fragmentarily in Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and
Sabah.
	   Remnants may survive in Sarawak, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos but
their existence is unconfirmed and the viability of any populations
unlikely.
	   The first written sighting of the Sumatran rhinoceros in Malaya
was by Raffles who described the species being killed in Malacca in
1820.
	   In the last century, Westerners had trapped and acquired more
than 60 known animals of this species and exported them to Europe
and America where they were exhibited in zoos and circuses.
	   The introduction of firearms in the peninsula by the colonial
masters led to big game hunting. The rhinoceros was also gunned
down by locals who believed the animal's body parts, especially the
horns, possess certain medicinal and supernatural value.
	   Rhinoceros hunting became so rampant that the Javan rhinoceros
became extinct in the peninsula in 1932.
	   Man remains the rhinoceros' chief enemy. Today, habitat
degradation and poaching conspire to drive the species to the edge
of extinction.
	   Loss of rhinoceros habitat has been especially serious in the
peninsula.
	   Logging, agricultural development, human settlement and shifting
cultivation are the main reasons for the dwindling numbers and this
has intensified over the last 10-15 years.
	   ``Deforestation, be it partial or complete, narrows the gap
between man and animal,'' says Zainal of the Department of Wildlife
and National Parks.
	   ``It gives easier access to poachers to wrest the rhinoceros
horns and people to set up snares.''
	   The goal of Malaysia's conservation strategy is to maintain or
recover viable populations of the Sumatran rhinoceros in the wild.
	   Essentially, the action plan calls for protecting and managing
the rhinoceros and its habitat. Constant surveillance of rhinoceros
localities is key.
	   Captive rearing and reintroduction is also part of the measure
to save the Sumatran rhinoceros. A managed breeding centre was set
up at the Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve in 1991 and earnest work is
now being carried out to breed rhinoceros in captivity. (See story
on Page 7).
	   Educating the public on conservation issues is also crucial and
a pilot project was introduced last year at Kampung Peta - one of
the major entry points to Endau-Rompin - to spread such awareness
among villagers living near rhinoceros habitats.
	   Every effort must be taken to ensure the Sumatran rhinoceros
does not end up like the Javan rhinoceros which many cannot
remember now.
	   Malaysia can eventually recover from the economic crisis but
without money the peninsula's mega species including the rhinoceros
may be lost forever.
	   Note: Those interested in contributing to the Wildlife Trust
Fund (Sumatran rhinoceros) can contact Department of Wildlife and
National Parks director-general Musa Nordin at 03-9052872.
	   Save the rhino, safeguard biodiversity THE uninformed are likely
to argue that pushing for rhinoceros conservation at a time when
Malaysia is facing an economic downturn seems trivial.
	   So what if a few rhinoceros disappear, they may say.
	   But they are missing the whole point of the biodiversity
argument.
	   Forest Research Institute Malaysia biodiversity division
director Dr N.
	   Manokaran says biodiversity is a hugely important concept that
stresses the interdependence of all forms of life on earth.
	   ``There must be a willingness to accept that interdependence
applies to every one of life's component parts and not just
humans,'' says the forest ecologist.
	   The interdependence of various life forms helps to maintain
ecological systems such as the tropical rainforest, acknowledged to
contain the greatest diversity of plants, animals and
microorganisms on earth.
	   Very simply, interactions between the flora and fauna through
the food web and especially through pollination of flowers and
dispersal of seeds help to regenerate the forest.
	   When you save the forest for rhinoceros, you are also saving it
for so many other species which live in it. Indeed, the Sumatran
rhinoceros is recognised as an umbrella species for the
conservation of biodiversity.
	   How would the world view Malaysia if it allowed the rhinoceros
to go extinct despite having ratified the Convention on
Biodiversity?
	   ``Badly,'' says Manokaran, one of the architects of the National
Biodiversity Policy which was endorsed by the Cabinet on Oct 22
last year, and launched by the Science, Technology and Environment
Minister on April 16.
	   ``When Malaysia makes serious attempts to safeguard the
rhinoceros, it is signalling to the world that it sees conservation
as a very important aspect of its diverse culture as outlined in
one of the principles of its biodiversity policy,'' he adds.
	   Conservation of Malaysia's wild populations can only begin when
there is a deep appreciation that man and animal need each other.

	   SPECULATORS have not yet returned to the mass residential
property market despite the massive turnout last weekend of
prospective buyers to view flats at Paliburg Holdings' Park Royale
development in Yuen Long.
	   Analysts yesterday said the general conditions in the mass
residential market were not yet ripe to lure speculators.
	   There were some indications though of speculation in the Tierra
Verde project in Tsing Yi with some 200 of the 1,700 units that
have already been sold being offered for sale in the secondary
market.
	   Analysts noted though an improvement in sentiment as reflected
by the fact that 30,000 prospective buyers flocked to Paliburg's
project to see what had been described as the cheapest flats in the
market at $2,834 per square foot.
	   Nan Fung Development's Nan Fung Plaza project also drew a strong
response from some 20,000 prospective homebuyers.
	   An analyst with an Asian brokerage house said despite the
government's recent lifting of the ban on the resale of uncompleted
flats before their titles were assigned to buyers, speculators were
not expected to return in the near future because market prospects
still looked grim.
	   While speculators could resell their ballot tickets and earn
some money quickly, the prospects of reselling their flats within a
year look very slim.
	   The analyst said the improved sentiment evidenced in the large
turnout of potential homebuyers last weekend would probably be
short-lived.
	   Prices were likely to remain depressed because major developers
are scheduled to release thousands of flats on the pre-sale market
in the second half of this year.
	   ``There is a risk that cash-strapped developers may now rush to
sell projects quickly which could put further pressure on prices by
boosting supply,'' the analyst said.
	   The managing director of Ricacorp Properties Group, Barry Law,
said the fact that a large number of people viewed flats over the
weekend did not necessarily reflect a return to the market of
speculators.
	   He said the atmosphere was good, but the secondary market was
still ``deadly quiet'' and there was hardly any sign of
speculation.
	   While developers are eager to cash in by releasing their
existing projects, soft prices in the primary market are expected
to continue to undercut price levels in the secondary market.

	   Public life in and around the capital was in torment due to
frequent loadshedding amid an extreme hotspell, as severe power
shortage forced 11 substations to a grinding halt yesterday.
	   Officials said the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority was compelled
to suspend operation of its 11 substations of a 33-KV transmission
line at the instructions from the Load Despatch Centre at
Siddhirganj.
	   They said the DESA area faced a shortage of 250 megawatt power
yesterday as the supply was around 750 megawatts against the demand
for 1,000 MW.
	   ``Many people phoned power offices threatening to set fire to
the stations'', said one official, as life became unbearable due to
on-again, off-again power supply on the hot-and-humid summer day.
	   Because of generation shortfall, Power Development Board could
not also meet the demand across the country, causing public outrage
in other areas as well.
	   The power board, however, was trying to increase generation in
the Kaptai Hydroelectric Project which could not run up to its
capacity.
	   ``The situation may improve only after full resumption of power
supply from Kaptai,'' an official said.
	   The power substations under suspension are: Mirkadim, Tongi,
Tongi-1, Tejgaon, Zinjira, Narayanganj (Khanpur), Kaliganj,
Shyampur grid-2, Narsingdi, Nawabganj and Srinagar.
	   In Tejgaon Zone, one of the three 33-KV power substations
suspended supplying electricity to the area.
	   Tejgaon unit was able to maintain supply for two hours after
each one-hour loadshedding as the zone got 14 MW power against the
demand for 38 MW.
	   Due to power shortages, industrial production is being hampered
while people in offices and various establishments are facing
problems doing their work.
	   Our Staff Correspondent from Khulna adds: Power crisis in the
western grid comprising 21 districts has further worsened with the
closure of the 110 MW unit of Khulna Power Station (KPS) on Friday
due to mechanical problems.
	   The western grid which includes greater Khulna district has been
subjected to 50 to 60 per cent loadshedding on average in recent
weeks due to reduced generation of electricity in the country,
sources in PDB said.
	   According to PDB sources, the total peak hour demand for
electricity in the western grid has been assessed at between 320
and 340 megawatts on average, while the average available load was
160 MW on Friday (June 5), 169 MW on Saturday (June 6) and 163 MW
on Sunday (June 7) at 8 pm.
	   Power crisis has seriously affected industrial production in the
region, besides causing serious disruptions in the supply of water
by the municipalities.
	   Four out of six electricity generating units of Khulna Power
Station remain out of operation. The two units now in operation are
producing about 30 to 31 MW of power. The GT 35 unit which has an
installed capacity of 10.5 MW is yielding 8 MW while the other
running barge mounted power plant (Unit No-2) is generating 22 to
23 MW as against its installed capacity of 28 MW.
	   The four units of KPS which are now out of operation are 110-MW
unit, 60-MW unit, TG-14 unit and barge mounted power plant (Unit
No-1).
	   The 110-MW unit which was shut down on Friday for some emergency
repair and maintenance is expected to be operative in a couple of
days. The overhauling and major repair of the Czech-aided plant are
learnt to be overdue.
	   During the last two months, the 110-MW plant had remained
inoperative for a total of 15 days for occasional repair and
maintenance work. The 110-MW unit was generating 50 MW of power
before its closure on Friday.
	   The 60-MW unit of KPS has remained shut down for about seven
years. At present, the overhauling and major repair works of the
unit are now being undertaken by the Chinese experts and the unit
is officially scheduled to become ready for operation by the middle
of next year 1999.
	   The TG-14 unit which has an installed capacity of 12.75 MW is
remaining idle for over a month. The authorities are trying to
import some equipment from Italy to make it operative again.
	   The barge mounted power plant unit No-1, which suffered damages
following a fire in March this year, is yet to be made ready for
switching on.

Queen Mother launches rowing boat _ without champagne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ The Queen Mother, undaunted by her 97
years and hip surgery less than five months ago, inaugurated a new
rowing boat at Cambridge University on Tuesday, but skipped the
usual champagne launch.
	   At Queens' College, the women's rowing team and sundry VIPs
gathered on the lawn to watch the mother of Queen Elizabeth II
unveil the boat's name _ the Patroness.
	   It was the 50th anniversary of her becoming the college's
patroness, and the 550th anniversary of the college's foundation.
	   The traditional breaking of a bottle on a new ship would damage
a glass fiber boat. So, after the Queen Mother left to have lunch,
the rowers held another brief ceremony to pour a glass of champagne
over the top of the boat for good luck.

	   THE Penang Development Corporation and State Government plan to
develop special education zones, similar to industrial parks, in a
move to turn Penang into a centre of educational excellence.
	   State Education Committee chairman Dr Toh Kin Woon yesterday
said the PDC had been asked to set up an education section to
promote educational services.
	   The plan was to establish special zones for education, develop
housing schemes for private college students with reasonable
rentals and public transport between the houses and colleges.
	   Toh (BN-Machang Bubok) said this in reply to points raised
during the debate on the motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertua
Negeri Tun Hamdan Sheikh Tahir for his opening address at the State
Legislative Assembly last week.
	   He said the PDC should offer incentives such as joint-promotion
of Penang's 32 private colleges, especially within the
Indonesia-Malaysia- Thailand Growth Triangle.
	   The Penang Public Library would emphasise the needs of private
colleges by providing more reference and textbooks.
	   On the role of the Penang Island and Seberang Prai municipal
councils in private education, Toh said the municipalities should
relax procedures, and speed up the approval of plans to build
private colleges.
	   Meanwhile, the House was told that Penang aims to become the
overall champion in the biennial Malaysia Games (Sukma) in the year
2004.
	   In his winding-up speech on the motion of thanks to the Yang
di-Pertua Negeri State Youth and Sports Committee chairman Koay Kar
Huah (BN-Bukit Glugor) said the the target was based on the
performance of State athletes at Sukma '98 in Selangor.
	   Penang finished sixth with 12 golds, five silvers and 24 bronze
medals, up from 11th at Sukma '96.
	   Koay said the State aimed to finish third in the overall medal
standing at the next games which it will host in two years, with at
least 35 gold medals.
	   To a question by Syed Amiruddin Syed Ahmad (BN-Teluk Kumbar) on
programmes to reactivate interest in sports among youths, Koay
said: ``Assemblymen can arrange activities with the help of
district youth and sports councils and district officers.''
	   He said his committee would come up with a comprehensive policy
to revive ``dead'' youth clubs in the State.

Iraq linked with outside world for the first time since Gulf War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ For the first time since the 1991 Gulf War,
Iraqis can now make direct international telephone calls without
having to go through the operator.
	   Calls into the country also had to go through the operator and
Iraqis living abroad used to complain it took them days to get
through.
	   Iraqis were astonished to find they could call places as far
away as America and Australia without the help of operators when
direct telephone lines resumed Monday.
	   The resumption of direct lines, however, does not apply to
Israel, which remains Iraq's arch enemy.
	   Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmed Morteda was
quoted as saying in the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper this
week that the decision to resume direct phones lines would help
business.
	   He said Iraq plans to ``improve its communications with the
outside world and upgrade its services in order to be of service to
businessmen and investors.''
	   Previously, only embassies and representatives of foreign media
were given free access to international dialing provided they paid
in U.S. dollars _ an average of dlrs 4 a minute.
	   An official at the Post, Telegraph and Telephone department in
Baghdad said lines were now overloaded as millions of Iraqis were
trying to call relatives abroad.
	   The Baghdad weekly al-Ittihad said Tuesday that the decision to
resume direct lines was taken following assurances by the PTT that
it had made ``all the necessary technical requirements for contact
with the outside world.'' It did not elaborate.
	   A direct one-minute call to London costs 1,250 dinars (about
dlrs 0.75) and less than 50 cents to Jordan, the PTT official said.
	   Iraq has earmarked dlrs 150 million under the fourth phase of
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal to revamp its
telecommunications systems which were severely damaged during the
1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Representatives from France's Alcatel, a telecommunications
firm, are currently in Baghdad to strike deals to repair the
country's telecommunications infrastructure, the weekly al-Musawir
said.
	   Alcatel modernized Iraq's telecommunications systems in the
1980s and al-Musawir said the company is also conducting talks for
post-sanctions contracts with Iraq.

	   CHU Kong Shipping Development Co will continue to look for
opportunities to expand the market share of its core businesses on
the mainland despite the economic slowdown.
	   ``We are unable to change the macroeconomic conditions but we
would take the approach to further stabilise the core businesses _
river trade transportation and toll roads in the Pearl River Delta
Economic Zone,'' said managing director Huang Fianji.
	   Mr Huang said the company was always looking for opportunities
to acquire new assets, but added no substantial agreement had been
reached so far.
	   He also said they would not only focus on the Pearl River Delta
for new investment but also look at other mainland cities for
quality projects.
	   Income from toll roads accounted for about 30 per cent of total
net profit at the end of 1997.
	   ``We would not rule out the possibility of acquiring new toll
roads with the co-operation of other parties,'' he said.
	   For the first quarter of 1998, traffic volume of the toll road
Guangfo Expressway, of which the company holds a 25 per cent equity
interest, had a capacity of about 70,000 vehicles per day, an
increase from 69,000 vehicles per day in 1997.
	   The expansion plan for Guangfo Expressway has commenced and is
expected to be completed by the end of 1999. Chu Kong's investment
will be more than $50 million, which includes financing the design,
land acquisition and tender invitations for construction contracts.
	   For the first two months of 1998, the average volume of river
trade cargo direct shipment for the entire industry rose by 5 per
cent. Mr Huang did not disclose the actual amount but said the
company's figure would be comparable to the industry as a whole.

 &UR; World Cup: Practice canceled in favor of watching Cameroon-Denmark
video &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARSAC, France (AP) _ With two days to go until their opening
game against Cameroon, the Austrians on Tuesday canceled a planned
practice session and replaced it with a favorite video _ the
African squad's drubbing of the Danes.
	   Morning practice went ahead as planned, with the Austrians
concentrating on offense and defense in front of the goal and free
kicks from behind a defensive wall. The atmosphere was relaxed,
with squad members squirting each other with fizzy mineral water
and coach Herbert Prohaska loudly cracking jokes with several
players.
	   But an afternoon session was canned in favor of watching the
Cameroon-Denmark game of Friday, with its surprise 2-1 win for the
Africans. And with Cameroon recently looking better than for a long
time, the Austrians were careful not to overestimate themselves.
	   ``Cameroon is a tough team,'' said Anton Pfeffer, as he wiped
the sweat off after training. ``And because it's our first game,
we'll have a tough time coming back if we lose against them.''
	   With the Austrians struggling in their pre-World Cup friendlies
_ winning only against low-ranked Tunisia and even less threatening
Liechtenstein _ players refused to be drawn on chances against
Italy, the team to beat in Group B, which also contains Chile.
	   ``We'll have to see that we get second place _ that will be
difficult enough,'' commented forward Anton Polster, the veteran
forward who plays for Cologne in Germany's top league. ``Italy is
definitely the favorite.''
	   Forward Andreas Herzog said the plan on Thursday was to play
offensively from the opening whistle _ at least until the first
goal.
	   ``We will try to score in the first few minutes,'' he said.
``Then things will be easier.''
	   Prohaska, the coach, refused to tip his cards on the lineup in
Toulouse on Thursday. But judging from the practice sessions since
the team's arrival on Friday, the following configuration was
likely:
	   Michael Konsel, goal; Wolfgang Feiersinger, sweeper; Peter
Schoettel, Pfeffer, defense; Harald Cerny, Dietmar Kuehbauer, Roman
Maehlich, Heimo Pfeiffenberger, midfield; Andreas Herzog, Arnold
Wetl and Polster, forwards.

	   The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court yesterday ordered Dr
Jinnah, the main accused in a rape case, to surrender before the
magistrate's court to comply with the High Court's directive.
	   The three-member bench of the Appellate Division comprising
Justice Latifur Rahman, Justice Mohammad Abdur Rouf and Justice
Bimalendu Bikash Roy Chowdhury also adjourned hearing of Jinnah's
application for stay of High Court's order to surrender before the
lower court till June 14.
	   Earlier, Dr Jinnah obtained rule and ad-interim anticipatory
bail from a HC Division Bench. But another HC bench, on the final
hearing of the anticipatory bail prayer, discharged the rule and
directed Jinnah to surrender before the lower court.
	   Dr Jinnah filed an application before the Appellate Division
seeking stay of the High Court's order, but the Appellate Division
ordered him to comply with the HC directive.
	   Senior Advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan moved the petition on
behalf of Dr Jinnah.
	   Additional Attorney General Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan along with
Assistant Attorney General Abdur Rouf on behalf of the state
opposed the stay application.

	   THE proliferation of cellular telephone communications towers
atop commerical and residential buildings in the State dominated a
major part of yesterday afternoon's sitting, with various
Assemblymen voicing their concerns and displeasure over the issue.
	   Accusations were levelled at State Infrastructure Committee
chairman Datuk Dr Hilmi Yahaya (BN-Teluk Bahang) for the delay on
the part of the authorities in either tearing down the structures
or acting against the telecommunications companies.
	   Proposals were also made for the transmission towers to be sited
in less populated areas such as hilltops.
	   ``Penang Island Muncipal Council enforcement officers have not
been able to dismantle these structures since they involve
high-tension wires,'' he said in reply to points raised during the
debate on a motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun
Hamdan Sheikh Tahir.
	   He said if the structures were to be torn down, mobile phone
users would experience service disruption.
	   ``There has been no conclusive evidence that the non-ionised
radiation emitting from these structures is cancer-causing,'' he
added.
	   Meanwhile, State Technology Committee chairman Datuk Dr Kang
Chin Seng told the House that Government departments and agencies
had already begun making preparations to address the Y2K or
Millennium Bug issue.
	   ``The State Finance, Town and Country Planning and Drainage and
Irrigation departments were found to be problem free, while
potential Y2K probelms in the Land and Mines department, State
Islamic Religious Affairs Department, Penang island and Seberang
Prai municipal councils and the Penang Development Corporation have
already been resolved,'' he added.

	   A schoolboy was kidnapped yesterday from the city's Dhanmondi
area. The kidnapers demanded a ransom of Tk one lakh from the boy's
family members for his release. Police rescued the boy and arrested
one of the abductors from Hatirpool area in the afternoon.
	   According to sources, Nafiz Ibn Mannan Rusho (14), a class IX
student of Mohammadpur Government High School, was abducted from in
front of the Coffee House in the city at gun point while he was on
his way to his aunt's residence at Hatirpool at about 1 pm.
	   The kidnappers, reportedly two in number, took the boy to
Nilkhet from where he contacted his aunt on telephone asking her to
go to his residence at 70, Pisciculture Road, in Mohammadpur area
immediately.
	   Later, he again phoned his mother Rabeya Begum asking her to go
to Eastern Plaza with Tk one lakh for his release.
	   Receiving the call, Rabeya Begum contacted Dhanmondi police and
filed a case, sources said.
	   The police then laid an ambush at Eastern Plaza at 4 pm. When
Sohel, one of the abductors, asked Rabeya Begum whether she had
brought the money, the police arrested him and took him to Shahbagh
area where his other accomplice, Rana, was waiting with the victim,
Rusho.
	   But sensing the presence of police, Rana fled the scene
immediately and Rusho was rescued.
	   Police said Sohel belonged to a gang of child-lifters active in
the city.

	   CATHAY Pacific Airways is looking at the possibility of
launching an air cargo service to Amsterdam, an airline spokeswoman
said yesterday.
	   But corporate communications manager Diana Fong said the airline
was still studying the feasibility of such a service which could
include the Asian region, Europe and North America.
	   Ms Fong said no further details about the new service could be
disclosed since the proposal was at a preliminary stage.
	   However a source said Cathay Pacific planned to launch a
twice-weekly freight service to Amsterdam in August.
	   It is understood that the new service is being considered
because the airline's Asia operations had suffered due to the
regional financial crisis.
	   OCBC Securities transport analyst Patricia Yeung said overseas
demand would justify the setting up of the new service, judging by
the strong performance of the division in the last financial year.
	   Also, the load factor of the cargo division was around 73 per
cent last year, higher than the passenger load factor of 68 per
cent.
	   Ms Yeung said that although overseas markets could sustain
business growth for cargo services it could not compensate for the
slump in passenger numbers.
	   Last year, the cargo division accounted for only 30 per cent of
total revenue.
	   Ms Yeung said it was going to be hard for the airline to make a
profit this year because she anticipated that passenger load factor
would drop to 60 per cent due to the deterioration of Hong Kong's
tourism sector.
	   Meanwhile, Ms Fong said Cathay would launch a new service to
Istanbul on 8 August.

	   HUMAN error and administrative and machinery faults in the
Penang Water Authority were among the causes of the diesel spillage
at the Lahar Tiang pump station in February this year.
	   State Infrastructure Committee chairman Datuk Dr Hilmi Yahaya
(BN-Teluk Bahang) told the House yesterday, an efficient emergency
response system within the authority could prevent a future
recurrence of the incident.
	   While he did not reveal the identities of those responsible for
the incident, Dr Hilmi told reporters later that disciplinary
action would be taken against the PWA officer who was on duty on
the day of the incident and his immediate supervisor.
	   A report on the investigation of the incident, together with
follow-up measures to ensure the incident does not recur, has been
submitted by the authority to the State Executive Council,'' he
said in reply to points raised during the debate on a motion of
thanks to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Hamdan Sheikh Tahir for his
opening address.
	   Dr Hilmi said the committee set up to investigate the incident
had also come up with several recommendations to overcome the
weaknesses identified within the PWA.
	   ``These include the need for the PWA to utilise automatic
machinery instead of manual ones.''
	   Other recommendations include: disciplinary action be taken
against officers responsible for the spillage, the need for clear
procedures on the operation of all PWA machinery, written
guidelines from the authority on steps to take in the event of an
emergency at any PWA location, information sessions be conducted by
the PWA at least once a year on emergency response procedures, all
PWA management directives be disseminated to all levels of
employees within the authority; and, surprise checks be conducted
from time to time at all PWA installations to ensure regulations
are adhered to.
	   Meanwhile, Dr Hilmi also said three toll booths - located along
Jalan Prai, Kilometer 9 near Bagan Ajam and the Butterworth-Kulim
Expressway - would be set up for the Butterworth Outer Ring Road.
	   ``Toll charges have not been finalised at this point as the
matter is being discussed between the project concessionaire and
Government authorities,'' he added.

	   People from all walks of life including the women took out a
procession carrying empty pitchers in the district town as a mark
of protest against continuous water crisis. The enraged people also
gheraoed the pourashava office and blocked the main road of the
town demanding regular water supply to the town dwellers. Acute
scarcity of drinking water has been prevailing in the district town
for a long time. The water supplied by the Barisal Pourashava
hardly meet only 10 per cent need of the consumers.
	   According to pourashava sources, there are 12,000 water
consumers in Barisal town. The authority concerned supplies 10 to
14 lakh gallons of water per day in the town against the demand of
over 80 lakh gallons. Most of the time, people procure water from
pond and ditches. In a press conference, chairman of Barisal
Pourashava Ahsan Habib Kamal said, water crisis in the town has
become acute due to irregular power supply and fall in underground
water level.
	   Faulty installation of new water pipeline, deep tubewells,
construction of overhead water tanks under the project and shortage
of manpower are some of the other causes of water crisis, he
alleged. Water Department of Barisal Pourashava said, the town is
divided into 18 water supply Pump areas. Of them, Sitlakhola,
Bottola and Police Line pump houses are totally out of order. Two
other pump houses may go out of order any moment.
	   Ten other pumps including south Amanatganj, Nazir Mohollah,
Sagardi, Zila School, Kaunia, Alamgir Hostel and Moelakhola cannot
supply more than 10 thousand gallons each whereas the capacity of
each is over 25,000 gallons per hour. Poura authority said if PDB
could ensure regular power supply the situation must improve.

	   CITIC Pacific Ltd said yesterday the possibility of Moody's
Investors Service downgrading the debt rating of its parent, China
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp, would not affect its ability
to raise funds from the market.
	   Citic Pacific shares came under tremendous pressure yesterday
amid a sell-off, which followed a 7.7 per cent fall in their value
last Friday.
	   Citic's shares were among the top 20 net losers, shedding 45
cents to close at $15.70 per share.
	   Tai Fook Securities analyst Frankie Szeto said he was puzzled by
the response of the investors.
	   He added that the investors still believed that there was a
close link between Citic Pacific and its parent in Beijing.
	   He noted that when Citic Beijing sold its shares to Citic
Pacific's management, Citic Pacific was believed to have severed
its connection with its parent.
	   As a result, Citic Pacific did not enjoy the same
price-to-earnings ratio rating as the other red chip stocks and
underperformed significantly in comparison to its peers during the
first half of 1997.
	   When Citic Beijing lost its status as being directly
administered by the Chinese State Council, people sold Citic
Pacific shares.
	   ``Now, the market reacted again to the possible downgrade
leaving Citic Pacific at its new low this year,'' Mr Szeto said.
	   ``The selling of Citic Pacific shares is overdone. While it is
true Citic Pacific is highly geared with net debt-to-equity ratio
at 53 per cent, we reckon Citic's operating cash flow is sufficient
to finance its expansion plan in fiscal 1998 and 1999.'' Copyright

Russian Orthodox Church cancels meeting by Presbyterian pastors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government of a Russian Far Eastern region has
canceled a conference by Presbyterian missionaries after the
Russian Orthodox Church complained, a Presbyterian church official
said Tuesday.
	   The annual meeting of Presbyterian missionaries and pastors in
the former Soviet Union was to be held later this month in the city
of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, on Sakhalin Island, said the Rev. Stephen
Park.
	   But local Russian Orthodox leaders said their church has been in
the region for centuries, and would not permit any other religion
to expand there. The government complied.
	   ``The local government is very, very sensitive about it, because
the Orthodox Church is behind them,'' Park, an American based in
Moscow, told The Associated Press.
	   Russian officials are eager to stay in the good graces of the
Orthodox Church, which has become a powerful political force since
the 1991 collapse of the officially atheist Soviet state.
	   The church has been assertively expanding its power, while
trying to curb the influence of other denominations. A recently
adopted law on religion enshrines the Russian Orthodox Church as
the country's predominant religion and sharply curtails the rights
of many other churches.
	   Sakhalin has a large community of ethnic Koreans, many of whom
practice Presbyterianism. Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk has only a half-dozen
Orthodox parishes, and twice as many Presbyterian ones, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Between 25 and 30 pastors from the Nakhodka region, located on
the nearby mainland, plan to hold a conference anyway, but no one
from outside is expected to attend, Park said.
	   The cancellation of the Sakhalin meeting has ``made people very,
very frustrated,'' he said.
	   Presbyterian pastors from former Soviet republics have been
holding annual meetings for the past four years in Moscow, and this
was the first time it tried to gather outside of the Russian
capital.

	   PASIR GUDANG, Mon. - A group of 47 fishermen today blocked off a
barge loaded with mud and sludge on its way to dump the muck at
their fishing grounds in Sungai Johor.
	   The dredging contractor has already dumped more than 8,000
tonnes of the slime, dug from Sime Sembawang Engineering Sdn Bhd's
harbour area at Pasir Gudang, into the fish-rich Sungai Johor.
	   The fishermen boarded the barge and demanded the contractor,
Dredgecon Engineering, stop polluting Sungai Johor.
	   The head of the fishermen's community, Zaili Chik, called on the
Department of Environment to halt the activities of the contractor
immediately.
	   Zaili said the contractor's dumping site at Tanjung Buai along
Sungai Johor, directly opposite Kong Kong Laut, a seafood haven,
was a threat to the area.
	   The muck, dug out of Sime Sembawang Engineering harbour area to
increase its depth, was toxic and should be disposed of somewhere
else.
	   The highly polluted Sungai Batu and a two-metre thick main
effluent pipe from the Pasir Gudang industrial estate empty their
contents into the harbour area.
	   Zaili said: ``We cannot understand how the DOE and Marine
Department could approve something like this.''
	   Zaili said checks indicated the Marine Department had approved
the operation.
	   State Marine Department director Rosnan Sathlal said the
department would issue a statement after a meeting with the parties
tomorrow.
	   State Department of Environment director Tengku Bakery Shah
Tengku Johan said the DOE had approved the operations on certain
conditions.
	   He said: ``The operator is required to constantly monitor the
water quality at the dredging and dumping sites to ensure that its
activities do not cause pollution.
	   ``The choice of dumping sites is the prerogative of the Marine
Department.''
	   Tengku Bakery said the DOE would investigate the allegations
that the muck was being dumped into Sungai Johor, as it was illegal
to dump at a river area.
	   If the contractor had contravened DOE conditions, it will advise
the Marine Department to withdraw the licence.

Yugoslavia assails renewed Kosovo sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kosovo Serbs meeting U.S. diplomat, reaction by
Montenegrin premier, Albanians collecting funds for their cause. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia on Tuesday denounced new
international sanctions over its offensive in Kosovo, where a
western strip of the separatist province has been turned into a war
zone of burned houses and deserted villages.
	   In a statement issued on the official Tanjug news agency,
Yugoslav officials called the imposition of sanctions a ``strange
and unreasonable decision.'' The sanctions apply only to Serbia.
Montenegro, its lone partner in the Yugoslav federation, is exempt
because of its pro-Western leadership.
	   ``This is the first case that EU has made a decision about a
sovereign state that applies to only one of its federal units,''
the Tanjug commentary said.
	   The European Union and the United States imposed the sanctions
within hours Monday, banning new investments in Serbia and freezing
its assets abroad.
	   ``It's cynical to demand from Yugoslavia to withdraw troops from
its own province and leave it to the mercy of Albanian
terrorists,'' Tanjug said.
	   Montenegro's Premier Filip Vujanovic said exempting Montenegro
would be difficult because that would require ``a border'' between
the two republics and that is ``out of the question.''
	   A prominent Kosovo Albanian, Nekibe Kelmendi, welcomed the
sanctions Monday but said they were only a ``small step.''
	   There were no immediate reports of new clashes Tuesday between
Serbs and ethnic Albanian militants fighting for Kosovo's
independence.
	   International outcry has increased against Serbia to stop using
its police and army against ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's population. NATO is considering military
intervention.
	   Carl Bildt, formerly the European Union's high representative in
Bosnia and still an influential figure regarding policy on former
Yugoslavia, harshly criticized Western officials in a commentary
published Tuesday for being indecisive and slow. He warned of a
``huge humanitarian and political disaster.''
	   He urged that troops be deployed to northern Albania to close
the border, that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Kosovo and threaten
air strikes against remaining Serb forces, and that the Kosovo
Liberation Army's sponsors in Europe and the United States be
pressured to get the KLA to halt military operations.
	   ``Kosovo is a testing ground,'' Bildt wrote in the Financial
Times of London. ``Here, we will see if the lessons of the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia have been learned. So far, there are only faint
signs that this has been the case.''
	   More than 250 people are said to have died in Kosovo since March
1 in escalating clashes between government forces and the KLA.
	   Also Tuesday, exiled Kosovo Albanian political leaders announced
they would collect an extra tax from an estimated 400,000 Kosovo
Albanians living abroad to finance the ``defense of our people.''
They didn't say how.
	   In 1993, Kosovo Albanians established a parallel system of
administration involving collecting taxes and financing education
and health care for Albanians.
	   The announcement made by the Germany-based Kosovo Albanian
government-in-exile was published Tuesday in Albanian-language
papers in Kosovo, saying every Albanian working abroad would have
to contribute an equivalent of dlrs 300-600. The tax would be
collected from June 10 through July 10.
	   Also Tuesday, a group of Serbs living in Kosovo and dissatisfied
with Milosevic's policy in the province met with Richard Miles, the
most senior U.S. diplomat in Yugoslavia.
	   A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Miles told them the United States wanted to see meaningful
negotiations between the sides and will ``apply a form of pressure
on the government, and also on the Albanian side.''

that some corrupt college teachers are allegedly involved in the
act of cheating in the examinations.The centres where free-style
copying is going on are Fulbari Degree College, Rajarhat Mir
Islamail Hossain Degree College and Ulipur Womens College.According
to different sources, like in the past more than half of about 900
examinees of Fulbari Degree College centre are outsiders from
different districts of the region.
	   Most of them allegedly paid Tk 5,000 to Tk 10,000 to some
teachers for free-style copying in the examination halls.A teacher
of Fulbaria Womens college, who was an invigilator at Fulbari
Degree Colleges centre in a written compliant to DC, Kurigram
alleged that he seized answer scripts of two examinees on June 2
last during the Bengali 2nd paper examination for adopting unfair
means. But he could not expel them as the students threatened him
saying that they were appearing in the examination as per contact
with some senior teachers of Fulbari Degree College.
	   Those senior teachers forced the invigilator to return the
answer scripts. They also told the invigilator that they had a
previous agreement to conduct examinations in this way.Local
sources said that six to eight teachers of the said College are
involved in supplying copies to the examinees at the centre. About
one and a half years ago Fulbari examination centre was cancelled
due to massive irregularities. But the college authorities managed
to do away with the cancellation order through political influence,
it is further alleged. Similar allegations have been received from
the other examination centres. Local elite and observers demanded
probe into the unfair means in the examination halls and punishment
to the persons responsible.

	   MUAR, Mon. - Less than six per cent of the factories in the
State referred their applications to renew licences to the State
Department of Environment, said State executive councillor Dr Chua
Soi Lek.
	   He said last year, only 117 factories out of the 2,000 factories
in Johor had referred to the State DOE when renewing their
licences. Of the 117, he said, the department only supported 66
applications.
	   Chua said the State DOE would come down hard on factories which
did not refer to the department before renewing their licences with
the local authorities.
	   ``This is one of the ways the DOE can check on the increasing
complaints of pollution by factories in Johor,'' he told reporters
after opening the annual general meeting of the Parent-Teacher
Association of SJK (C) Chung Hwa Presbyterian in Jalan Hashim last
night.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman, in his l998 Budget
speech, had ordered local authorities to refer all factory licence
renewals to the DOE to check complaints of pollution.
	   Chua, who is also the State Environment and Consumer Affairs
committee chairman, said: ``We need to ensure effluents and smoke
emission do not cause pollution which is harmful to the health of
the workers and residents.''

	   Boro paddy on 40,000 hectares of land at Bara Haor' have gone
under water due to massive siltation of the 20-mile long canal from
Narasunda river in Karimganj thana to Ghurauttra river in Nikli
thana.It is gathered that due to siltation of the canal standing
Boro paddy on vast tracts of land at Bara Haor' go under water even
after a slight rainfall affecting 15 to 20 thousand farmers each
year.Incessant rainfall for the last few days has damaged Boro
paddy on more than 30,000 hectares of land at Bara Haor' this
season .
	   Chairman of Gundhar Union Parishad, Golap Mia told this
correspondent that every year Boro paddy on vast tracts of land at
Bara Haor' go under water due to siltation of the 20-mile long
canal. If the canal had been excavated the Boro crop on vast tracts
of land would not have been inundated, he added . Largescale damage
of crops every year due to overflowing of the canal water has
crippled hundreds of farmers economically . Farmers who borrow
money from the local money lenders at high rate of interest can not
repay the same .
	   The local people have appealed to the concerned authorities to
take initiative to re-excavate the canal as early as possible to
save the farmers from ruination.Meanwhile the government purchasing
centres are not purchasing paddy directly from the farmers on the
ground that the paddy brought by the farmers contain more than 15
per cent moisture. Farmers who are not aware of the moisture
content are forced to sell their produce to the farias' at cheaper
rate.
	   The farias' in collusion with some officials of the Food
Department sell the paddy to the government procurement centres at
higher rate depriving the farmers.It may be mentioned that
currently Boro paddy is selling at Taka 170 to Taka 190 per maund
in the markets of the district.

	   RISK management has become an indispensable component of a
mature financial market with depth and breadth, Financial Secretary
Sir Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said yesterday.
	   Speaking at the launch of the new corporate logo of the Hong
Kong Futures Exchange, he said: ``A well-developed, liquid and
orderly derivatives market is essential to allow risks to be easily
transferred at market prices from one investor to another.
	   ``This in turn offers support for trading and turnover at the
cash market and increases overall market stability and liquidity.''
The growth of the derivative market has fundamentally transformed
financial institutions' risk management and customers have been
able to lower their funding costs and structure risks to the
desired level and configuration, he said.
	   ``As a result, `risks' and their accompanying `returns' have
become tradeable commodities, just like any other financial
instruments, between those who wish to be covered from market
volatilities and secure predictable returns and those who are
willing to undertake the exposure with a view to exceptional
yields,'' he said.
	   ``While we should welcome the phenomenal growth of the
derivatives market over the last two decades, it does lead to
concerns of market participants and brings new challenges to
regulators.'' He said that in the Report on Financial Market Review
released in April, the government reiterated its commitment to
maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre and
recognised the useful roles that a properly run and well developed
derivative market played in this context.
	   At the same time, the government also recognised the need for
improvement in the market.
	   ``In this connection, we welcome the initiative by the Futures
Exchange to increase transparency of the market and enhance trading
efficiency through the upgrading of its trading system and eventual
migration of the trading of the Hang Seng Index futures contracts
to the Automated Trading System,'' Sir Donald said.

	   SEREMBAN, Mon. - A police team from the State Anti-Narcotics
division today detained a man and seized 30 litres of cough mixture
during a raid in Panchor.
	   Department chief, Deputy Superintendent Zakaria Sudin said the
45-year- old man was allegedly involved in the illegal distribution
of the mixture to addicts.
	   He said acting on a tip-off, the police team raided a house at
Rumah Rakyat Panchor where they found the mixture stored in six
four-litre and two three-litre bottles.
	   ``Police also seized a Proton Wira after discovering another two
small bottles containing the mixture stashed in the car booth.''
	   The man is expected to be charged under Section 32(3) of the
Poisons Act.
	   Under the act, offenders face a maximum RM3,000 fine or a one
year jail term or both if convicted.
	   Zakaria said the police had also handed two men believed to be
dadah pushers who were detained in the State last month, to Pahang
police for further investigation.
	   He said the two, both aged 24, were detained after they were
involved in a road crash at Simpang Keratong in Muadzam Shah,
Pahang on May 25.
	   Zakaria said, after the crash, their car was towed to a workshop
in Bahau where a mechanic found a parcel containing 35 packets with
138 grammes of heroin stashed between the door panels of the Proton
Saga.
	   He said police then detained the two men, one from Terengganu
and another from Kuala Lumpur, who were warded at the Seremban and
Kuala Pilah Hospitals following the crash.

	   The rubber companies under the Forest Industry Development
Corporation (BFIDC) in Sylhet zone, including Moulvibazar district
are incurring huge losses due to absence of buyers of their
products in both domestic and international markets. Development of
the rubber industry is being hampered due to fall in the demand for
rubber products which remained stockpiled and are gradually losing
quality. About 6,000 tonnes of rubber products worth about Tk 20
crore reportedly have remained unsold, BFIDC sources said.
	   The concerned authorities published a tender notice in all the
national dailies on February 22 last with schedule date on April 30
for dropping tenders for sale of the rubber products. But only one
tender was dropped, which was rejected for non-fulfilment of
conditions. The purchasers are showing reluctance to purchase
rubber at a price of Tk 40 per kg in the face of falling of its
price in the international market. According to sources, a ton of
rubber with tariff value at 850 dollars and 15 per cent import tax
could be sold below at Tk 50 per kg while the production cost is
above Tk 40 per kg with marginal profit.
	   The higher rubber growing countries of the world like Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand have lowered the export price of rubber from
Tk 40 to Tk 30 per kg for the last two years. The James Finlay,
Duncan Brothers and the owners of a few hundred small companies are
facing the problems. In the circumstances , the BFIDC authorities
sent a proposal to the government to take initiative for the
protection of the rubber industry of the country from the onslaught
of the foreign growers by raising tariff value of the imported
rubber goods and import tax.

	   PALEMBANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Fire swept through a crowded movie
theater complex and shopping center and rescuers fear dozens of
people were killed, police said Tuesday.
	   Fire burned the Megahira shopping center, which contained the
cinema, on Monday night while hundreds were inside watching a film.
Dozens more were lined up to buy movie tickets and others were in
an adjacent amusement center.
	   Police in Palembang on the island of Sumatra said the exact
number of victims was unknown. The fire was still smoldering
Tuesday night, hampering rescue efforts.
	   Nineteen bodies had been founds in the ashes after one small
area of the building had been searched, police said, in the city
460 kilometers (285 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Sardjo Sadjat said 19 people were
injured, 14 of them hospitalized.
	   ``Dozens are believed trapped there, but we have not known what
exactly happened, because no one is able to enter the building so
far,'' he said.
	   The cause of fire, reported to have started on the second floor,
was still not known, Sadjat said.
	   He said the cinema was made up of three theaters, each with a
capacity of about 40.
	   ``I think no one can survive,'' said Djaieni, a fire department
official.
	   The newspaper Republika said most of those who died had been on
the top three floors of the five-story shopping center.
	   It said nine people escaped the flames by climbing down ropes of
a window washing platform on the outside of the building.
	   Three of the nine fell to the ground and were hospitalized with
serious injuries.
	   The newspaper said those who escaped claimed ``many people'' had
been trapped inside after panic broke out.
	   ``On the stairs we trampled over each other to get out,''
Republika quoted one survivor, identified by the single name of
Zukar, as saying.
	   The fire follows several shopping mall blazes that killed
hundreds of people during riots in the capital Jakarta last month.
	   Police say the Jakarta fires had been deliberately lit and most
of the dead had been looters.

	   SHARES of Sinolink Worldwide Holdings dived 24 per cent to $0.87
a share in their first trading day yesterday amid the spreading
economic gloom.
	   Shares of the Shenzhen property developer and electricity
supplier made their trading debut at $1.10 per share yesterday,
compared with an issue price of $1.15.
	   The price quickly dropped to $1.02 per share in the first two
minutes of trading.
	   Sinolink chairman and managing director Thomas Ou Yaping said
the company's financial performance would be strengthened further
with the launch in July of new property projects in Shenzhen.
	   ``The property market in Shenzhen has a good potential,'' he
said.
	   The firm's share was trading between $0.81 and $1.10 a share
yesterday, posting a turnover of $97.24 million on a volume of
106.3 million.
	   The company issued 380 million shares at $1.15 a share,
representing a discount of about 36 per cent to its net asset value
of $1.80 a share.
	   Sinolink raised $406 million from its initial public offering.
	   Of the issue, 342 million shares were offered through an
international placement and was barely oversubscribed. The public
offer of 38 million shares in Hong Kong was 1.18 times subscribed.
	   Analysts said investors were cautious amid the turbulence in the
market and were unwilling to invest in big issues in the absence of
sufficient liquidity.
	   ``Companies which offer big issues will have very little chance
of success in today's gloomy market,'' said a corporate finance
director at HSBC investment Banking.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - A multimedia campaign was launched today to
create awareness about the possible extinction of endangered
species caused by consumption and buying of wildlife body parts.
	   Called the Asian Conservation Awareness Programme, the campaign
carries the message ``When the buying stops, the killing can too''.
It is depicted in a series of five printed advertisements and a
public service message to hit the local cinemas next month.
	   The message, an appeal to the people to stop eating and buying
body parts of endangered species, is by ACAP's international
ambassador, Hong Kong actor and stuntman Jackie Chan.
	   The message is targetted at those who knowingly or unknowingly
contribute to wildlife extinction.
	   Deputy Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Abu
Bakar Daud launched the programme at his ministry.
	   ACAP was designed by three international wildlife organisations
namely the Global Survival Network (GSN) from the United States,
the David Shepherd Conservation Foundation and the Tusk Force, both
from the UK.
	   In Malaysia, ACAP is being run by the Malaysian Nature Society,
the Wildlife and National Parks Department and GSN.
	   It is supported by J. Walter Thompson Advertising Agency and
Hill &AMP; Knowlton (SEA) Sdn Bhd, an international public relations
firm.
	   MNS chief executive officer Dr Rizal Roy Sirimanne said the main
objective of the programme was to promote awareness about the
plight of some of the country's endangered species.
	   Five animals have been targetted for the programme namely the
Sumatran Rhinoceros, Indo-Chinese Tiger, Malayan Sun Bear, Asian
Elephant, and Sea Turtles.
	   ``These animals are endangered and their numbers are diminishing
because they are hunted for their body parts to be turned into
medicine, ornaments or jewellery.
	   ``The public must know that they have the power to stop the
killing of endangered animals when they stop buying,'' said Rizal.
	   Globally, it is estimated that the illegal wildlife trade is a
US$7 billion (about RM28 billion) a year industry, third only to
the drugs and black-market arms business.
	   ACAP's international director Tamara Gray said demand for
products and meat from endangered species was strongest in East
Asian countries and their overseas communities.
	   She said the main consumers were those from Korea, Japan, China
and the Chinese community in the US such as in San Francisco and
New York.
	   The trading in wildlife involves a huge network. Due to the high
profits obtained, curbing the illegal trade is almost impossible.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An explosion in a hospital in northern Iran
killed two people and injured four others, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Two of the injured were in critical condition as a result of the
explosion at the Totonkaran Hospital in the northern city of Rasht,
the capital of Iran's northern Gilan province, the agency said.
	   Earlier, the agency reported that the explosion killed one
person and injured five others. It was not clear whether any of the
injured had died of their wounds.
	   The cause of the blast was not immediately known but officials
believe a suspected gas leak from the hospital's heating
installations caused it.
	   The hospital's heating installations were totally destroyed and
efforts were under way to clear debris, the agency quoted a
hospital official as saying.
	   The blast shattered windows of the hospital and nearby
buildings.
	   All the casualties were hospital employees, the agency said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - The Housing and Local Government Ministry
has set up a committee to look into ways of encouraging more people
to enrol as volunteer firemen.
	   Its Minister Datuk Dr Ting Chew Peh said today the step was
being taken due to a high number of fires over the past five years.
	   He said the committee, headed by his deputy Peter Chin Fah Kui,
was expected to submit its proposals to the Ministry soon.
	   ``There are currently only about 230 volunteer fire brigades in
the country and we need increase it to create public awareness of
the dangers of fire.
	   ``The primary objective of a volunteer fire brigade is not to
aid regular firemen in times of emergencies but to increase public
awareness of the dangers of fire and to make the public more
committed towards preventing such fires,'' he said.
	   Ting was speaking to reporters aft%
Chai Hock, City fire chief Leonard Athanasius and City police chief
Datuk Kamaruddin Ali.
	   ``We want more volunteer firemen, not just in urban areas, but
especially in high-risk areas in cities,'' Ting said.
	   Earlier, in his speech, Ting said the department received a
total of 24,350 emergency calls last year.
	   The Minister later launched the City Fire and Rescue
Department's fire hydrant hotline.
	   Members of the public who know if any of the city's 16,000 fire
hydrants are damaged or being misused can call the hotline at tel
2222994.

	   PROPERTY consultancy Brooke Hillier Parker yesterday launched
Avic Plaza in Shenzhen, the first in a series of property projects
on the mainland which will be financed through single-purpose Real
Estate Investment Funds (REIF).
	   Development of the US$370 million (HK$2.88 billion) project is
expected to be completed by late 2001.
	   The property project will be developed by a consortium
comprising Brooke Hillier Parker, Buoygues and China National
Aero-Technology Import &AMP; Export Corp (Catic).
	   Brooke Hillier Parker chairman Nicholas Brooke said Catic would
provide the land and REIF would contribute the capital for the
development of the whole project.
	   ``Despite the rapid pace of development, commercial rental
yields in China are still among the highest in the world,'' David
Faulkner, director of Brooke Hillier Parker, said yesterday.
	   Mr Faulkner said while over-supply was likely to cause a
downturn in the property markets in Shanghai and Beijing,
second-tier cities, such as Shenzhen, were emerging as attractive
options for investors.
	   ``Shenzhen, in particular is China's most developed and most
accessible economic zone,'' Mr Faulkner said.
	   He said commercial values and rents in Shenzhen had been stable
over the past year and were expected to rise during the second
half, while retail sales had increased by 9 per cent over the past
12 months and residential rents by 5 per cent.
	   The single purpose REIF established to finance the development
is the first of its kind for a mainland project.
	   Investors will be sought in Britain, continental Europe, and the
United States, said Mr Brooke.

	   Have got a twenty person sitting dinner? Can't decide what to
serve or how to manage the monumental task of organising the feast?
Well, don't get flustered. The solution is here, courtesy to Pan
Pacific Sonargaon Hotel. The ideal butler is now not just a
character in P.G Wodehouse's novel. Jeeves' can also be at your
disposal ever ready to salvage you from the hopeless situations
that often plague the modern households. Traditionally, the butler
was a British institution who worked his way up from humble junior
footman to head the male household staff and take charge of the
wine cellar and the valuable articles of daily use. He carved and
served at meals, assisted the male servants, made sure everything
was done according to protocol.
	   The role of the butler however surfaced with multifaceted
dimensions in P.G Wodehouse's Jeeves - the gentleman's gentleman
who epitomised the word perfection. Jeeves was the answer to the
prayers of the indolent, asinine wealthy fop Wooster, who was
incapable of taking care of his life and its twists. From rescuing
Wooster from social embarrassments to setting out his clothes -
Jeeves was the saviour as well as his associate. A true gentleman's
gentleman Jeeves set the trend: To overlook all the master's fault,
to keep a stiff upper lip at the sight of an unknown woman on the
master's bed, to solve all the problems (household or others), to
iron the master's newspaper and to manage large parties (often mind
boggling), The impeccable appearance of Jeeves as well as his
immaculate English also set the outline for the perfect servant.
	   The conclusion of the Second World War brought tough economic
times for Britain and the institution of the butler was on the
wane. Now-a-days this custom is restricted among the extremely
wealthy people and the well-off aristocrats. The job now also
involves the role of a personal manager. Here in Dhaka, where
having servants is an accepted and an affordable feature of city
life, the institution of Butler has multifarious prospects. It is
better service for comparatively cheaper price. The residents of
the affluent parts of the city have bearers who usually do all the
household chores. Given a butler training they can become twice as
good and three times as efficient. This was the view that prompted
the Sonargaon Hotel to introduce the butler training programme,
designed to produce certified household managers ``Why have a
bearer when you can afford a butler'' - is the slogan that has
inspired this novel inclusion to many of their laudable steps.
	   A few days ago the first batch of butlers received their
certificates of household mastery. ``This programme has made us
confident and has improved our services'', remarked a graduate
wearing a dark suit and a bow tie. ``I believe that this course
will also be helpful to the housewives as it will give them a
thorough insight into household management'', said, the owner of a
reputed restaurant. The guests present were also optimistic as they
underlined the necessity of discipline, courtesy, efficiency and
confidence in the services of waiters or bearers. ``This programme
will root out the crudity from the nature and infuse a refined air.
Shoulders straight, no grins, heads up, no rocking walk with ten
filled glasses on a tray-that's one of the things that go into
making an expert butler'. said Mr. Tanveer . Who knows this butler
programme might turn out to be as famous as Ivor Spencer's school
of Butlery - and Sheikhs and tycoons just might change their route
and start coming here to recruit their gentleman's, A bit too
imaginative, is it?

	   ALCO Holdings' decision not to adjourn a Special General Meeting
today to approve connected transactions that were not disclosed for
more than five years, has angered a group of minority shareholders
who had called for the meeting to be cancelled.
	   The row was sparked by the revelation that the company has been
supplying telephones and other consumer products in the past five
years to three Venturer Group companies, Venturer Electronics,
Venturer Electronics UK and Venturer Electronics De Chile, which
are wholly or partly owned by David Leung, the son of Alco's
substantial shareholder and chairman, Leung Kai-ching.
	   According to Anthony Fox, chairman of Managing Partners Ltd, who
is acting as spokesperson for certain minority shareholders, the
Alco board had failed to satisfactorily comment on the matter.
	   ``In the absence of comment from the board, the minority group
is unable to satisfy itself that past connected transactions with
Venturer were conducted on terms comparable to those extended to
other customers or were fair and reasonable to independent
shareholders,'' Mr Fox said.
	   Because of the board's decision not to adjourn the meeting, the
minority group is urging other minority shareholders to attend the
SGM in person.
	   ``Minority shareholders should support a call for a vote on a
poll,'' Mr Fox said.
	   ``They should also vote against the resolution ratifying the
past connected transactions and approving future dealings with
Venturer Group.'' The minority had demanded a full explanation from
Alco's directors for its failure to disclose the transactions in a
timely manner.
	   The transactions started in November 1992, but were only
disclosed in the company's annual report for last year.
	   Sales to Venturer represented 4.3 per cent of Alco's turnover
for the year ended 31 March 1997 and amounts due from Venturer for
the same period represented about 36 per cent of the Alco Group's
accounts receivable.
	   The minority group is considering lobbying the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange to probe the matter.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Padiberas Nasional Bhd (Bernas) refuted
allegations that it is the cause of the price increase in super
grade rice and instead put the blame on wholesalers and retailers.
	   Its managing director Mohd Ibrahim Nor said the higher price of
rice was caused by wholesalers and retailers who took advantage of
the demand to mark up the price.
	   At present, he said, there were 37,000 retail outlets inclusive
of supermarkets, which were being served by a network of 1,500
wholesalers which give Bernas a wholesale to retail ratio of less
than 1:25 (25 retail shops per wholesaler.) ``How can we be
responsible for the price increase? The figures quoted by Fomca
(Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association) are grossly
wrong,''he told a Press conference.
	   While admitting that there was not more than a 30 per cent price
increase, he denied allegations by Fomca that Bernas sold 80 per
cent import cheaper to its subsidiaries which in turn sell higher
to other wholesalers.
	   Bernas, he said, represents between 25 and 30 per cent of the
supply of local rice or 16.7 per cent of the total market in
Malaysia at pre- wholesaling level.
	   Mohd Ibrahim said that with the present structure of rice
distribution, up to April only 38.6 per cent of imported rice was
sold to its subsidiaries while the rest was sold to others.
	   ``Sales to other subsidiaries are at the same price as to other
wholesalers,'' he said.
	   He added that studies showed that some wholesalers sold the
Super grade rice AAA at RM3.80 per kg compared to the RM2.85 per kg
sold at Bernas outlets and by its subsidiaries.
	   On controlling the price of Super grade rice, he said if the
Government were to regulate its price, the rice industry would go
back to its position years ago where wholesalers could be blending
or mixing super grade rice to reduce costs and increase their
profit margin.
	   On recent complaints of a shortage in controlled grades of rice
(standard and premium grades), he said Bernas has not received any
complaints from consumers, and suggested that the complaints come
from wholesalers.

Nigerian dissident: new military leader `more of the same'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The succession of a new military leader to
power in Nigeria is ``not a step forward,'' exiled playwright and
dissident Wole Soyinka said Tuesday.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press in Jerusalem, where he
was lecturing at Hebrew University, Soyinka said the appointment of
Maj. Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar ``augurs very badly for Nigeria,''
because it means the military still believes it is in control of
the country's fate.
	   ``This is just more of the same thing _ it's just a change of
baton,'' he said.
	   Soyinka said he knew little about Abubakar himself, but said he
was not hearing any encouraging signs.
	   ``I'm willing to give Abubakar a couple of days to listen to
what he actually has to say,'' he said. ``But I want to say from
the outset _ and I speak for the majority of the Nigerian people _
that they're sick and tired of the military continuing to believe
that they have the right to succeed.
	   Soyinka, the winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature,
repeated his call for the international community to put pressure
on Nigeria, and urged World Cup spectators to show disapproval of
the Nigerian regime _ by booing the Nigerian flag, for example.
	   If Abubakar tries to continue in Abacha's path, he said, it
spells disaster for Nigeria.
	   ``I'm afraid that if the military does not bow to the will of
the people, armed insurrection becomes inevitable,'' he said. ``The
signs of it are already there.''
	   ``If any future Nigerian leader acts in any manner that can be
held remotely parallel to Abacha's depravity, I swear to you, that
is the end of Nigeria,'' he added, speaking slowly and emphasizing
each word. ``The nation will not hold.''
	   Asked if he had a message for the Nigerian people, Soyinka, who
fled his country in 1994, said: ``Don't let down your guard. The
battle isn't over yet.''

	   Nepal, the beautiful country which is known as the daughter of
the Himalayas, always attracts the travellers. The tiny Himalayan
kingdom is a place of excitement and fun for them who come to visit
Nepal for its dreamy fairytale-like scenery.This mythical kingdom
of Himalayas was off limits to foreigners until the early 1950's.
The country became Shangri-La for hippies in the 1960's and 1970's
and a haven in the 1980's and 1990's for the new breed of adventure
travellers in trekking, rafting and mountain climbing. And at the
heart of Nepal, Kathmandu, the home of seven world-heritage sights
- more than any other location on earth, offers a fascinating mix
of the old and the new.
	   Nepal offers variety of entertainment stuffs to the travellers
interested in visiting Nepal. Modern TV satellite dishes and modern
stupas crowd the skyline. Cows, elephant and turbo-injected
four-wheel drive vehicles share the same narrow side streets. The
country also offers the travellers interesting shopping
opportunity. Young priests sporting Tom Cruise-style sunglasses
mingle with tourists wearing Nepali dress. Shops sell the latest CD
system alongside antique carpets. Medieval buildings nestle next to
modern five-star hotels. Colourfully decorated bicycle rickshaws
and luxurious foreign taxis compete for fares. Despite the
influence of the West in this ancient city, the centuries-old
temples, palaces and pagodas are yet to be replaced by modern
skyscrapers. And in the background of this atmospheric place lies
the mighty Himalayas - the abode of the Gods - that makes anyone
feel that he is on the roof of the world. Biman started operating
their regular flights to the capital city of Himalayan kingdom from
February 8, 1974.
	   At present Biman operates 4 flights a week to Kathmandu. The
national flag carrier uses F-28 aircraft in its flights to
Kathmandu.A table showing comparative revenue earning on
Dhaka-Katmandu and Kathmandu-Dhaka route from 1991 to 1997 is given
below:`(Takas in lakh)1991-92483.841992-93 479.651993-94
383.501994-95598.161995-96505.76 1996-97 753.77From the above table
it can be understood that improved facilities and better services
in its Kathmandu flights have helped Biman gradually in earning
impressive rates of revenue.Biman carried a good number of
passengers on Dhaka-Katmandu and Kathmandu-Dhaka route from
1991-97.

1996-9715901The total number of frequency and the total number of
passengers carried by Biman on Dhaka- Kathmandu and Kathmandu-
Dhaka routes from July 97 to April 98 is very impressive. On Dhaka-
Katmandu route the total number of frequency from July 97 to April
98 was 173 and the number of passengers carried within this period
was 14943. On Kathmandu- Dhaka route the total number of frequency
from July 97 to April 98 was 173 and the number of passengers stood
at 16143. So one can easily get the picture of success of Biman on
Dhaka-Katmandu route from this figure.

	   IF you, or your child, have disfiguring pigmentation or
unsightly birthmarks, help is at hand. With laser technology, you
don't have to be the butt of jokes or comments.
	   Lasers designed to treat skin conditions were introduced into
Malaysia last year. It is thus now possible to treat many hitherto
untreatable skin conditions locally, a boon for those in the
low-income group.
	   Consultant dermatologist Dr K.C. Yee says the excitement came
from the discovery in 1980, by scientists Anderson and Parish, that
lasers could be developed to target specific tissues.
	   ``The principle is simple. Every tissue absorbs light of a
certain colour or wavelength. For example, abnormal blood vessels
contain blood pigment (haemoglobin) which absorbs yellow light
best. Hence, a yellow light laser such as the Pulsed Dye laser,
which emits short bursts of laser energy, can destroy abnormal
blood vessels without harming surrounding tissues.''
	   This thus is the concept of ``selective photothermolyis''.
``Selective'', as Dr Yee explains, means the laser can be designed
to hit a specific target whilst ``photo'' means light and
``thermo'' heat, with the term ``lysis'' meaning destruction.
	   ``Thus we have selective destruction of a chosen target by a
specific wavelength of light. Light engery is transformed into heat
which destroys the target. This is akin to some sort of magic
light,'' he muses.
	   What birthmarks and blemishes can skin lasers treat?
	   Dr Yee says a variety of conditions are amenable to laser
treatment.
	   Basically, they are vascular blemishes (related to the veins)
like birthmarks, pigmented blemishes (due to skin diseases or
tattoo pigments, and scars and wrinkles (which can be smoothened by
``laser resurfacing'').
	   All the treatments are approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration.
	   Vascular blemishes or red birthmarks cause a great deal of
anguish and guilt in parents of affected children and often
stigmatises the child for life, says Dr Yee.
	   The villain of this group of birthmarks is the port-wine stain
(PWS).
	   Prior to the advent of ``designer'' skin lasers, various
therapies had been tried with poor results and scarring, he says.
	   PWS birthmarks occur in three out of 1,000 births, often on the
face.
	   The case for treatment is compelling. Left alone, the abnormal
blood vessels grow larger and the pink stain becomes darker,
eventually becoming purplish with irregularities which can bleed.
	   Apart from the physical aspects, affected children suffer
considerable psychosocial disturbances, he says.
	   ``By age seven, children can distinguish between pleasing and
unpleasant appearances and are often brutally frank about it.
Results are best if treatment is started before four years of age.
This also avoids school- related stresses.''
	   In fact, adds Dr Yee, treatment is safe enough to be used on
children as young as four weeks, he says, with scarring very rare
and complications minimal in the right hands.
	   One important area that emerged over the past 10 years overseas
is the treatment of hypertrophic scars or keloids with the Pulsed
Dye laser.
	   These scars are lumpy, discoloured, unsightly and often itchy or
painful.
	   For these, treatment is difficult, admits Dr Yee. A significant
proportion of patients fail to respond to conventional treatment.
	   Nevertheless, Pulsed Dye laser may work in 50 to 80 per cent of
the cases by a t undetermined mechanism (possible by stimulating
collagen absorption and interfering with the blood supply to the
scar tissue.) Dr Yee points out another area of interest - the
treatment of stretch marks using Pulsed Dye laser. Stretch marks
are due to hormonal (pregnancy/puberty) and other factors,
frequently occuring after pregnancy over the stomach, thighs,
buttocks and breasts. He quotes two recent studies in the US that
show how low-energy Pulsed Dye laser treatment improves the
appearance of stretch marks. Skin biopsy reveals restoration of the
elastin content in the treated areas.
	   ``Apart from the vascular blemishes, pigmented skin blemishes
that respond to skin lasers are also common. Some of them are
birthmarks such as Nevus of Ota, occurring in 1-2 per cent of
Japanese and other Orientals.''
	   Other pigmented skin blemishes, such as freckles and lentigines,
occur later on in life. Both are induced by exposure to sunlight.
Still others are artificial pigment, for example, tattoo pigment
placed deep in the skin, or caused by damage due to materials like
glass fragments in accidents.
	   Another useful application of pigment lasers is in the removal
of tattoos.
	   Now we come to conventional lasers (CO2 laser, Erbium laser)
which are not selective lasers like what we have talked about
earlier. But they have their own uses. They are used in ``laser
resurfacing'' of the skin - the precise removal of a very thin
layer of skin without causing significant heat injury to the
underlying tissue.
	   In the West, dramatic results have been obtained in the
treatment of wrinkles using the conventional CO2 laser with a
scanner that allows the laser to dwell very briefly on the skin
surface. However, even in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin, the
skin becomes reddened and more pigmented for months. These post
operative complications are even more commom in Asian and darker
skin types, says Dr Yee. Thus, it limited its application in Asia.
	   Not to lose hope, he says, for recently, another laser was
introduced for laser resurfacing which appeared to cause less
redness and pigmentation even among Asian and Hispanic skin types.
This is the Erbium: YAG laser which causes five to 10 times less
heat injury to the underlying tissues. This refinement results in
faster healing time.
	   It would appear to be the best laser for treating soft acne
scars and wrinkles. The results are perhaps slightly less dramatic
than with the CO2 laser resurfacing but the advantages would appear
to outweigh the inherent risks of the CO2 technique. Dr Yee is
optimistic this treatment is likely to be available in the Klang
Valley in the near future.
	   The Persatuan Dermatologi Malaysia is now formulating criteria
for the credentialling of skin laser practitioners to prevent the
abuse of lasers by untrained operators. Ideally, says Dr Yee, laser
practitioners should have dermatological training. This would
prevent the treatment of potentially cancerous pigmented and
vascular lesions by non-dermatologigal practitioners, as this may
disguise the cancer till it is too late.
	   Dr Yee says: ``I've also seen patients with tattoos who
developed scarring after being treated by an unregistered
practitioner with a CO2 laser. This is a totally inappropriate
laser for this treatment in this day and age when pigment lasers
are now available.''
	   Skin lasers, the product of great scientific advances can
alleviate the suffering of many, but like all powerful tools, they
can cut or they can heal.
	   So, patients are advised to see qualified dermatologists (skin
doctors) who can give a diagnosis and then give the right
treatment. And you can get it here. Choose medical doctors who have
grounding in laser physics, a good understanding of the structure
and functioning of the skin and have proper credentials of laser
training.

	   As the quadrennial event of the World Cup approached, the pilots
of Air France decided to go for at least a week-long strike upto
14th June. It was particularly embarrassing for the airline
management as it is the official carrier for the World Cup and had
promised to provide flights for all the teams in this year's
32-nation World Cup tournament. While Air France may very well
bring in all the teams on time for their matches through lease or
charter operations, this will not hold true for the thousands of
fans and tourists flocking to France this year, in June. The French
public have mostly been sympathetic with striking workers and
professionals throughout the ages. Where else in the world will you
find restaurant and family hotel owners going off on holidays of
their own each August with no protests from locals or tourists who
are the clients?
	   This country has always been philosophically in favour of the
workers and professionals at least from the first Bastille Day. But
now public opinion and that of soccer fans and French officials
have been heavily against the pilots, who are among the best paid
in the world despite the national airline's having run up years of
losses. This industrial action by the pilot's union is being
considered by the majority of the concerned public as an act of
blackmail on the eve of the World Cup. The origins of Air France
are in the brilliant French tradition of innovation in the air in
the eighteenth century balloons (the interested reader should
re-read Jules Verne's Five Weeks in a Balloon.), and their role in
aviation is commemorated by words like fuselage, aileron,
helicopter , aeroplane.
	   One of the first international airlines, the Farman company,
which made planes in Paris, was flying its Goliath bi-planes in
1919 between London and Paris and Brussels and Paris. By l923 three
other French airlines had merged to form Air Union, which
concentrated on the cross-channel flights, with connections through
France. Another merger in 1930 created Air Orient, which the next
year began flying regularly to Saigon, via Beirut, Damascus,
Karachi, Calcutta, Rangoon, and Bangkok. The most famous of the
French airlines was the little company set up in 1919 by a French
arms manufacturer, Pierre Latecoere, to fly to North America and if
possible to Latin America. It became known simply as The Line,
immortalised by the writings of the daring young pilot, Antoine de
St-Expury, who brilliantly expressed the conflict between the sense
of liberation among the stars and the stern discipline of The Line.
	   But The Line was suddenly undermined by financial scandals, the
company went into liquidation, and was sold to Air Orient. The
French Government intervened and in 1933 forced the merger of all
the airlines into a single company, with Ernest Rhoume as
president, called Air France. It was a name - imitated by many of
the national airlines that followed - which left no doubt that it
was carrying the flag. The French were determined to catch up after
the wreckage of Second World War with all the force of their
diplomacy: they still had their network of overseas colonies, and
their lack of colour prejudice made them better than the British at
negotiating with the newly independent countries. In 1948, the
French government had bought a majority share of the old private
company Air France, and put all the power of the state behind it,
with a succession of French civil servants in charge.
	   By 1952 Air France could claim to be the world's biggest airline
in terms of its unduplicated mileage, flying all through French
West Africa, the French West Indies and as far as the remote
outpost of New Caledonia between Australia and New Guinea. The
Francophone routes by which passengers could fly round the world
without ever speaking English were a striking achievement of Air
France. I had been flying Air France, fairly regularly in the
eighties, and encountered timely flights, efficient cabin service,
and good food. For example, in First Class on the Paris-Bombay
sector the lunch menu used to be: Fresh caviar, Lobster, Rack of
Lamb with mustard, Pigeon with olives, Cepes mushrooms, Aubergines
and tomatoes sweet and sour, seasonal salad, French cheese, Ice
cream and fresh fruit, with Colombian coffee.
	   This was Michelin Star quality food. At present the General
Sales Agent for Air France in Dhaka is Bengal Airlift, with its
offices in the Landmark building in Gulshan Second Circle and a
branch office in Motijheel, opposite the Federation of Chambers of
Commerce and Industries' building. (Speaking of GSA's, I must
apologise to the readers for giving them outdated information about
the GSA of Dragonair. At present it is Omni-Trans International, a
sister company of Enem Enterprises, with its recent location at 53
Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, atop the Kawran Bazaar branch of ANZ
Grindlay's Bank).

	   SMARTONE has taken up a consultancy role for a $70 million
network planning project at the International Finance Centre (IFC),
the telecommunications company said yesterday.
	   SmarTone said it would be responsible for the design and
implementation of part of the telecommunications network at the IFC
in Central.
	   Upon completion of the project, the IFC will be able to support
all 11 mobile communications networks currently in operation in
Hong Kong, enabling quality mobile communications.
	   SmarTone said the equipment supplier for the project was Allen
Telecom, a United States-based telecom equipment manufacturer and
system supplier listed in New York.
	   The project has just commenced and completion is targeted for
August.
	   ``We are excited about this opportunity to apply our
technological knowhow and engineering capabilities to areas beyond
our core business of providing mobile communications services in
Hong Kong,'' Bengt Nordstrom, SmarTone's chief technology officer
said. ``SmarTone will continue to be committed to providing the
most comprehensive mobile communications coverage at major
infrastructure projects to be undertaken in Hong Kong.'' Mr
Nordstrom said a common antenna system, using optic fibre as the
main connection, would be constructed and a total of 140 pairs of
antennas would be installed.

	   DO you know that we produce five million tonnes of sewage every
year?
	   That's a lot of shit. And all that muck doesn't disappear into
the super- unknown once you've flushed it down the toilet. It
swooshes through underground pipes to sewage treatment plants to be
treated.
	   Since 1993, the entire sewerage system has been privatised to

for cleaning up your mess.

public, we will run a weekly question and answer column regarding
your shit, oops, we mean sewage system.
	   Question: How do I know if I am a septic tank customer or a
connected sewerage service customer?
	   Answer: If your sewage flows into a tank before being discharged
to a drain, you are a septic tank customer (diagram A).
	   Septic tanks normally have three or four rectangular metal
covers in a row and in most cases are located at the back of your
premise.
	   These tanks are merely sedimentation tanks that partially treat
sewage.
	   Septic tanks have to be desludged regularly to ensure they
operate efficiently.
	   On the other hand, if your sewage flows indirectly into
underground sewer pipes which carry it to a sewage treatment plant,
you are a connected sewerage service customer (see diagram B).
	   Normally you can identify your property connection pipe (which
you are responsible for) by an inspection chamber which has a metal
cover.
	   The inspection chamber cover is to access the property
connection pipe in instances of blockages.
	   The inspection chamber does not have to be desludged.
	   Q: As a septic tank customer, what sewerage services do I
receive?
	   A: All septic tank customers receive the following services:
regular septic tank desludging and proper and environmentally safe
disposal of the septic tank sludge Q: What services do I receive as
a connected sewerage service customer?
	   A: All connected sewerage customers will receive the following
services: proper maintenance and operations of public sewer
treatment plants where your sewage will be treated; and upkeeping
of public sewer network to ensure that there are no blockages or
broken pipes which can cause sewage backflow and overflowing
manholes.

Yugoslavs arrive in France with optimism and trouble

	   SAINT GALMIER, France (AP) _ The Yugoslav soccer team arrived at
the World Cup Tuesday in an atmosphere of optimism about their
prospects, but clearly troubled by the ethnic turmoil back home.
	   ``Of course we cannot ignore what is happening in our county,''
said midfielder Vladimir Jugovic as he and his teammates unloaded
luggage from a bus that they took from Switzerland, their previous
training site.
	   ``But we'll try to ignore it,'' Jugovic said, referring to newly
imposed international economic sanctions against Serb-led
Yugoslavia for ethnic clashes in the troubled Kosovo province that
claimed more than 250 lives over the past 3 months.
	   ``I fight against it by not watching TV or reading newspapers,''
said Jugovic of Lazio in Italy. ``After all, we are just sportsmen
and not politicians.''
	   Yugoslavia and Germany are favored to qualify to the next round
of the World Cup from preliminary Group F that also includes the
United States and Iran.
	   As they arrived in this picturesque village just outside Saint
Etienne, players were surrounded by security police, bomb-sniffing
dogs, and dozens of local children waving Yugoslav flags and
carrying banners ``Welcome Yugoslavia.''
	   Defender Sinisa Mihajlovic said the first match against Iran on
June 14th could be crucial for Yugoslavia's hopes of reaching at
least the quarterfinals.
	   ``We simply have to beat the Iranians,'' Mihajlovic, who
recently transferred from Sampdoria to Lazio in the first Italian
division, said.
	   ``With a victory against the Iranians, we'll be relaxed playing
against the much-favored Germans,'' Mihajlovic said. ``And then,
the game against the Americans could decide which team advances to
the next round.''
	   ``But the Americans shouldn't be underestimated,'' Jugovic
added.
	   Asked whether the match against the U.S. would be a grudge match
because the United States was in instrumental in imposing sanctions
against Yugoslavia for the Kosovo troubles, the head of the
Yugoslav Soccer Federation Miljan Miljanic said:
	   ``We don't want a political match against the Americans. We are
not politicians but sports friends.''
	   Banned under U.N. sanctions from soccer in 1992 for Serb
government's fomenting of wars in Bosnia and Croatia, the Yugoslav
team returns to the World Cup stronger than ever, led by such
talents as Real Madrid's high-scoring forward Predrag Mijatovic and
longtime AC Milan star midfielder Dejan Savicevic.
	   Savicevic, who has been suffering with a string of injuries, is
likely to be ready only for Yugoslavia's second match at the
championships against Germany on June 21.
	   ``We have a very good team, maybe the best ever for
Yugoslavia,'' said assistant coach Vujadin Boskov. ``With a bit of
luck, we can reach the top. But only if we forget politics and
concentrate on soccer instead.''

	   TURNOVER on the Hong Kong stock market has been falling steadily
since February as the economy continues to contract.
	   Stock exchange data show May turnover was $115.7 billion a 0.5
per cent drop from the April turnover of $116.3 billion.
	   The number of trades has also fallen 6.8 per cent to 71,705 from
77,156 in April.
	   But a heftier 33.2 per cent fall was recorded in the volume of
turnover between the March level of $174.2 billion and the April
level of $116.3 billion.
	   Stock exchange statistics showed that the volume of turnover was
steadily rising from $398.9 billion in June last year before a
sharp fall was recorded in September, when volume reached $424.6
billion from $637 billion in the previous month.
	   The global stock market crash in October last year saw the Hong
Kong stock exchange volume crash to $375.7 billion from the
previous month's level of $424.6 billion.
	   The statistics also showed market activities declining sharply
up to last month following the Asian turmoil.
	   The only break from the falling trend since August last year was
February this year when total turnover and the total number of
trades were $212.8 billion and 2.3 million respectively, compared
to the figures of $159.5 billion and 1.4 million for January this
year.
	   The statistics also showed a continuing decline in the
importance of the first computer network terminal.
	   The percentage of trades handled by the first network terminal
dropped from 45 per cent in July last year to only 31.3 per cent
last month.
	   However, the figure for the second terminal rose from 55 per
cent to 62.1 per cent for the same period.
	   The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong also started the operation of
its third computer network terminal from 9 January this year.
	   The turnover handled by the third terminal for May this year was
$7.64 billion, while the total number of trades for May fell 6.84
per cent over the previous month.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri
Muhammad Muhammad Taib will be charged in the Sessions Court on
Wednesday with failing to declare all his assets as required under
the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961.
	   Public Prosecutor Tan Sri Mohtar Abdullah, who is also
Attorney-General, today gave his consent to prosecute after being
satisfied there was prima facie evidence obtained by the
Anti-Corruption Agency in its investigations.
	   The summons has been obtained from the court to be served on
Muhammad.
	   The case will be mentioned at 9am.
	   A statement signed by the A-G's special officer Shamsuddin
Hassan stated that Muhammad will be charged under section 25(2) of
the Prevention of Corruption Act.
	   The charge carries a maximum fine of RM2,000 or a year's jail,
or both.
	   Under the section, the Public Prosecutor may, in the course of
investigations, request a person to declare all assets belonging to
him, his agent, trustee, spouse, sons or daughters; the date and
how each property was acquired.
	   The person can also be asked to give a sworn statement of any
money or property sent out of Malaysia, during a specified period.
	   ``Tan Sri Mohtar Abdullah, the Attorney-General, in his capacity
as the Public Prosecutor of Malaysia, has studied and scrutinised
all evidence obtained from investigations by the Anti-Corruption
Agency and is satisfied that there is prima facie evidence,''
Shamsuddin said.
	   The investigation papers, received on June 1 by the head of
prosecution in the A-G's Chambers, were the result of the first
part of ACA's investigations after a police report was lodged
against Muhammad at the Sentul police station on June 28 last year.
	   The investigations concerned his failure to declare all his
assets as required by section 25(2) of the Act.
	   The second part of the investigations concerns offences under
the new Anti-Corruption Act 1998 which came into force on June 8
this year.
	   On Sunday, ACA director-general Datuk Shafee Yahaya said
investigations were still ongoing regardless of Muhammad's
acquittal in an Australian court.
	   He said the ACA had completed the first part of its
investigations which started when Muhammad was detained for failing
to declare more than A$1.2 million (RM2.95 million) when he left
Brisbane International Airport on Dec 26, 1996.
	   ``We are still investigating the second part of it, and once
it's completed, we will forward the papers to the A-G's Chambers,''
he said.
	   The Brisbane District Court on May 29 acquitted Muhammad on two
charges of falsely declaring the money he took into Australia in
December 1996 and failing to declare more than A$1.2 million when
he left the country.
	   The money was seized by the Australian police following his
arrest and was released the day after his acquittal.
	   During his trial, Muhammad told the court that he had used his
wife's name, Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Hasnan, to buy assets in
Australia and New Zealand.
	   This included a plot of land valued at A$460,000 and a A$460,000
bungalow at Sovereign Island, Gold Coast; a farm in Currajong
valued at A$3.7 million, a NZ$500,000 house (RM1.05 million) and
two plots of land valued at about NZ$4 million in New Zealand.
	   FULL text of statement released by the Attorney-General's
Chambers A REPORT was lodged at the Sentul Police Station No:
7031/97 on 28.6.1997 against former Selangor Menteri Besar, Y.B.
Tan Sri Muhammad bin Muhammad Taib on the suspicion of committing
an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Part One of the
investigations is linked to the offence of failing to declare all
his properties as provided for under Section 25(2) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 (Laws of Malaysia Act 57) and
Part Two of the investigation focuses on offences linked to the
Anti- Corruption Act 1998 (Laws of Malaysia Act 575) recently
enforced on 8th June 1998.
	   2. On 1st June 1998 the Head of Prosecution, Attorney General's
Chambers, Malaysia, had received the Part One Investigation Papers
on the investigations connected to this case.
	   3. Y.B. Tan Sri Dato' Mohtar bin Abdullah, Attorney-General, as
the Public Prosecutor, Malaysia, has studied and scrutinised all
evidence obtained from investigations by the Anti-Corruption Agency
and he is satisfied there is ``prima facie'' evidence and as a
result, on this day which is also 8th June 1998 Y.B. Tan Sri Dato'
Attorney-General, as the Public Prosecutor of Malaysia has already
given permission to charge Y.B.
	   Tan Sri Muhammad bin Muhammad Taib under section 25(2)
Prevention of Corruption Act 1961 (Laws of Malaysia Act 57).
	   4. The summons has already been obtained from the Court to be
served on Y.B. Tan Sri Muhammad bin Muhammad Taib and henceforth
this case will be mentioned at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court on
Wednesday, which is 10th June 1998, at 9.00am.
	   Shamsuddin Hassan Special Officer to the Attorney-General, on
behalf of the Attorney-General, Malaysia.

	   COLOURFUL HARVEST ... Aquarium fish entrepreneurs Raymond Cheah
(left) and Jalil Tumirin gather varieties of fancy carp,
scientifically known as cyprinus carpio, at their farm in the Senai
Industrial Estate in Johor.
	   Jalil is company executive chairman and Cheah the managing
director of Technofish Sdn Bhd which has proven that the aquarium
fish business is lucrative and probably yields the fastest returns
in pisciculture activities.
	   The company is now exporting 98 per cent of its fish to
countries like Singapore, the United States, Japan, the United
Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium,
Taiwan and South Korea.
	   Technofish, which started 12 years ago as a pioneer status
company, breeds and sells wholesale about 40 species and 60
varieties of aquarium fish commercially on its eight-hectare farm.
	   It invested between RM50,000 and RM100,000 in each 0.4-ha of the
farm.
	   Each of this 0.4ha consists of about 20 to 200 earth ponds,
areas for hatchery, nursery, growout, grading, quarantine and
packing.
	   ``The sales value for every hectare ranges from between RM5,000
and RM20,000 per month,'' Cheah said.
	   Besides fancy carp, the other fish include ramirez (apistogramma
ramirezi), tiger barb (barbodes tetrazona), goldfish (carrassius
auratus), managuense cichlid (cichlasoma managuense), dwarf gourami
(colisa lalia), kissing gourami (helostoma temmincki) and angel
fish (pterophyllum scalare).
	   Cheah said among the best selling fishes were the tetras such as
penguin tetra (thayeria obliqua) and glowlight tetra (hemigrammus
erythrozonus), barbs and gouramis.
	   The company breeds its own fry from imported parent stock from
countries in Southeast Asia, Australia, China, India, Mexico,
Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Congo, Zambia and Madagascar.
	   Technofish also prepares its own fish feed, carries out
in-breeding, experiment and hatchery and supplies fry to other fish
farms.
	   Cheah, who is also the Johor Aquarium Fish Breeders Association
vice- president, said Technofish provides training for Fisheries
Department staff and Universiti Putra Malaysia students.

	   THE State's Green Garden programme is becoming a success and the
State is expected to produce nearly 370,000 kilogrammes of various
vegetable products by the end of this year, the House was told
yesterday.
	   The Green Garden programme emphasises utilisation of idle land,
usage of hydroponic farming sets and public involvement in planting
vegetables at home.
	   State Agriculture and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Abdul
Rashid Abdullah (BN-Sungai Acheh) said under the programme, the
State Agricultural Department had provided technical assistance to
40 groups of collective farmers to work on a variety of vegetables.
	   The State Government also plans to expand the collective farming
scheme from the present 700ha land area to increase vegetable
output.
	   He said a 195ha land had been identified for such development.
	   In replying to points raised during the debate on a motion of
thanks to the Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Hamdan Sheikh Tahir for his
opening address, Abdul Rashid said since the hydroponic farming
system was launched in February, 11,700 sets had been sold to
households by the State Agricultural Department with the help of
other related agencies.
	   With this initial success, he said the State Government's aim to
reduce dependency on imported vegetables could be achieved faster
than expected.
	   He said through overtime work by staff of certain departments,
the recent drought and water shortage crisis that affected at least
50 per cent or 5,774ha of the State's padi fields had been
overcome.
	   He said only 220ha of padi fields, involving 145 farmers, could
not be worked on. However, he assured that the State Government
would help them once a study on their problem was completed.
	   He said the State Government planned to install new, and upgrade
existing, basic infrastructure systems especially the irrigation
canal lines to the State's 11,500ha of padi fields under the budget
of RM220 million announced three years ago.
	   Penang has the fifth largest area under padi in the country.
	   On the fate of fishermen affected by reclamation projects in
Tanjung Tokong and the Jelutong Expressway, Abdul Rashid said each
of the 86 registered boat owners in Tanjung Tokong had received
RM12,000 in the form of high-powered and fibre glass boats and
modern fishing equipment.
	   In Jelutong, each of the 232 registered fishermen will get
RM15,000. In addition two new jetties with a fishery complex would
be built for them, he added.
	   On open burning, he said 23 people had been compounded and eight
had been taken to court so far this year.

Former England coach takes over at Crystal Palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former England coach Terry Venables returned to
English club soccer Tuesday, taking over as manager of relegated
first division side Crystal Palace.
	   Venables was appointed following the completion of new chairman
Mark Goldberg's protracted 22-million-pound (dlrs 35.8 million)
takeover of the London club last week.
	   Venables finished his playing career at Palace and started in
management with the club in 1976. He guided the club to the old
First Division from the Third Division before taking charge at
Queens Park Rangers, Barcelona and Tottenham.
	   He guided England to the semifinals of Euro 96, coached the
Australian national team and bought and then sold control of first
division Portsmouth.
	   ``I've been involved in international football for the past four
years and I really enjoyed that,'' Venables said. ``Some of that I
will miss but at the same time I missed the day-to-day running of a
football club, and this was an opportunity that I wanted to take
up.''
	   ``The first aim is to try to get the club back up to the Premier
League. ... It's not going to be easy _ people at this club have
witnessed it going up and coming down again many times. We need to
go back up and to stay there.''
	   Venables and Goldberg will aim to hold onto stars such as Matt
Jansen and Italy's Attilio Lombardo and invest in new players.
	   Goldberg revealed he would be hold the 31-year-old Lombardo to
the two years remaining on his existing contract and offer him a
three-year extension to the deal.
	   Several players, such as fellow Italian Michele Padovano, are
likely to leave.
	   Goldberg said his restructuring plan is to transform Palace into
a club capable of competing in Europe within five years.
	   Venables' assistant will be existing coach Ray Lewington. Former
manager Steve Coppell was confirmed as the club's technical
director of football.

Africans praise Abacha the man, scorn the policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMBA DADSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ African leaders, diplomats and
dignitaries on Tuesday ignored late Sani Abacha's harsh domestic
politics, opting instead to praise the man who defended democracy
abroad while squelching liberty at home.
	   From the Ivory Coast to South Africa, carefully worded tributes
marked Abacha's death _ tributes that also carried a message
calling for change in Nigeria.
	   ``He was quick to recognize that prosperity in the region
depends on the capacity of countries in West Africa to foster peace
and stability,'' Ghana's Vice President John Atta Mills said.
	   At home Abacha crushed dissent, jailed opponents and refused his
people freedom and democracy.
	   But elsewhere in West Africa, Abacha's soldiers were ironically
welcomed by villagers as champions of democracy as they drove out
villains and despots to help restore elected governments.
	   Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was returned to
power earlier this year as a direct result of Nigeria's military
intervention in his war-wracked country.
	   Kabbah was ousted in a May 1997 military coup by Lt. Col. Johnny
Paul Koroma, who was in turn driven from power by Abacha's troops
who were leading a West African coalition force.
	   Liberia's President Charles Taylor called for a national day of
mourning for Abacha. Again, Nigerian troops helped to implement
peace accords in Liberia to end seven years of civil war and clear
the way for presidential elections.
	   Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed
Salim said he was struck with personal sorrow over Abacha's death.
	   ``He had his downside, but as far as Africa is concerned he will
be missed,'' Salim said.
	   He added, however, that Abacha had failed to move his country
toward democracy.
	   ``Stability, democracy in Nigeria is important not only for the
country but for all of Africa,'' Salim said.
	   In the Ivory Coast, President Henri Konan Bedie called Abacha
one of Africa's ``most ardent architects of economic integration.''
	   The government-backed newspaper Fraternite Matin _ the
editorials of which echo the official line _ criticized Abacha's
tight grip on power. A ``diabolical plan'' the editorial said.
	   ``Abacha died without loosening the noose which strangled
Nigeria's international image,'' the newspaper's editorial said.

Bomb explodes in office of French far right political party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with two people injured, group claims responsibility
for blast, National Front leader condemns attack. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ An explosive device blew out the window
Tuesday of the office of the far right National Front in the
southern French port of Marseille, slightly injuring two people.
	   A group called ``Francs-tireurs Partisans,'' (Sniper Supporters)
has claimed responsibility for the attack, police said.
	   The explosion took place just hours before the trial of three
National Front activists, who are accused of having killed a youth
from the Comoros Islands in 1995, started in the nearby town of
Aix-en-Provence.
	   Ibrahim Ali, 17, was allegedly shot in the back by the National
Front activists while running for a bus with his friends. All three
of the accused claim to have been acting in self-defense, but
police did not find any arms or dangerous objects belonging to the
victim and his friends.
	   The ``Francs-Tireurs Partisans'' said there could be more
attacks before the end of the alleged killers' trial. The group has
already claimed responsibility for a February attack on another
National Front office, carried out in memory of the boy's death.
	   The National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, blames immigrants,
mainly from North Africa, for France's nearly 12 percent
unemployment rate. It has also been accused of anti-semitism.
	   Bruno Megret, the No. 2 in the National Front, condemned the
attack.
	   President Jacques Chirac has branded the party, which tallied
around 15 percent at recent regional elections, ``racist and
xenophobic.''
	   About a hundred anti-racism demonstrators stood outside court on
Tuesday, waving a banner that said ``Justice for Ibrahim.''
	   Demonstrations in Ibrahim Ali's honor have taken place since
Saturday in Marseille, a city with a large community from the
Comoros Islands, a former French territory in the Indian Ocean.

	   ``LEARN from our mistakes,'' urges Junichi Yoshitani who works
for Japan's Ministry of Construction. He should know. Before
Japan's 1997 River Act came into force to allow free access to
information and public participation in decision-making on
impending projects, the ministry faced hostility and strong
resistance from local communities.
	   Although some of the projects would have benefited local
communities in the long run, the latter fought hard against the
ministry simply because information was not forthcoming. Admitting
that the Japanese government machinery - as recently as 10 years
ago - was a typical top-down, bureaucratic set-up, Yoshitani says
decisions were made excluding the very people who would be affected
by them.
	   Not surprisingly, it took the ministry 28 years to build a dam
across the Nagara River to control flooding. It was first proposed
in 1968 but mounting protests against it delayed the project. It
was only in 1996 that the Nagara Dam was completed.
	   Public criticism against the ministry drove it to change the way
things were done. What are the lessons learnt from the long, bitter
battle?
	   Yoshitani responds succinctly: ``The government cannot keep data
and technical reports confidential.''
	   On the other hand, the ministry has found, albeit late, that
when information was released voluntarily and unconditionally,
opponents stopped protesting.
	   Access to information that is current and accurate - as opposed
to propaganda to gloss over mistakes - is therefore crucial when it
involves the management of land, forests and water resources.
Otherwise, public mistrust of the government grows deeper even as
the current water crisis worsens. This was the resounding message
heard at the recent seminar on ``Establishment of River Basin
Information System'' organised by the Drainage and Irrigation
Department (DID) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
	   DID deputy director-general Dr Hiew Kim Loi says making informed
decisions on water resources cannot be over-emphasised. To improve
resource management, public agencies must work together to develop
a one- stop centre where data on land uses, forests, rivers, lakes,
groundwater and other vital resources can be sourced
simultaneously. Hence, the need to establish a river basin
information system.
	   Information technology holds the key to overcoming the problem
of duplication of work among State and Federal agencies while
saving time to retrieve data.
	   IT also allows some room for transparency and accountability.
With the right IT application, obtaining crucial data, especially
when it involves land conversions, degazetting of forest reserves
and logging of forests designated as water catchment areas can be
detected quickly.
	   With IT tools such as the geographic information system and the
use of computers linked to satellites, hot spots (such as forest
fires and open burning) and the extent of environmental degradation
can be easily unearthed. This in turn will enable prompt action to
be taken.
	   The creation of a river basin information system is therefore
crucial.
	   In fact, the success of the proposed National Water Council - to
be headed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad - and
the State-level river basin authority for the respective 150 rivers
nationwide hinges on the availability of data.
	   The sooner we get on board the information superhighway on
resource management, the better.
	   A systematic river information system will allow individuals
from different discipline to sit together for a common purpose,
exhorts Dr Mohd Fadhlillah Mahmood of DID's river engineering unit.
	   To integrate river basin management, he says, the current
practice of collecting and collating data must end. Firstly, ways
must be found to reconcile the different formats of storing
information as some are in numerical forms while others are maps
and structural plans.
	   Most of the existing database systems are for the exclusive use
of the respective government agencies. These discourage
information-sharing, giving rise to the common problem of
presenting an incomplete picture of the situation.
	   The Federal-State dichotomy over natural resources also hinders
prompt decisions to be made. Says Mohd Fadhillah: ``Data on river
basin is largely in the hands of the Federal government but it is
the State government who decides the fate of the rivers with its
choice of land uses.''
	   Further, most of the information stored at State-level is still
in non- digitised form. There is a danger to it because no one
knows for sure which set of information is the most current one
when critical decisions have to be made.
	   To help Malaysia overcome its data collection problem, JICA has
stepped in. Team leader Makihiko Otogawa says the Perak River basin
- which among others, has four hydroelectric power dams across it -
has been selected for a pilot study in river basin information
system upon the Malaysian government's request, With JICA
contributing over 60 million yen to the project, sophisticated
computer hardware has been acquired to help technical experts do
the groundwork.
	   Given the multitude of parties involved - directly and
indirectly - in the management and utilisation of rivers, Otogawa
has projected that the project proper will begin in the year 2001
and end in 2020.
	   The establishment of the fundamental devices, he says, will
begin in the 8th Malaysia Plan (year 2001-2005). They include the
setting up of the systems for hydrological-gauging, data processing
and data transmission.
	   This will be followed by the installation of automatic water
quality- gauging system, radar rainfall gauging system and
satellite system in the respective 9th, 10th and 11 Malaysia Plan
periods.
	   While the move to create a river information system is lauded,
it remains to be seen how technocrats are going to disseminate
information to the public. Will they disclose the data without fear
or favour? Or will they play the role of gatekeepers?
	   Experiences in developed countries have shown that it pays when
governments allow access to information on developmental projects
that affect communities.

World Cup: Romanian coach donates to charity, slams national soccer

<TEXT>
	   ALBI, France (AP) _ Anghel Iordanescu, who will end five years
as Romania's national coach after the World Cup finals, will pocket
only a modest sum for leading the east Europeans in France.
	   After the tournament, the 48-year-old general will become coach
of Greece, on a two-year contract said to be worth some dlrs
800,000.
	   But Iordanescu, who played for Steaua Bucharest army club, feels
he owes his country something after the national team's poor
showing at Euro '96 in England, where they lost all three of their
group matches and scored just once.
	   ``I donated a considerable amount to a charity foundation which
takes care of orphans and children with social problems,''
Iordanescu told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   Iordanescu's wife is a member of the ProVita charity foundation
in Bucharest, and the couple, who has three sons and a daughter,
also plans to pay for the construction of a church and a nursery to
raise orphans.
	   ``We hope that the good God will give us power and support to
achieve our plans,'' he said.
	   Iordanescu did not give a precise figure, but according to press
reports he will receive dlrs 100,000 from the Romanian federation
for taking the team to France. Most of that amount is said to go to
the ProVita foundation.
	   But the softspoken general has made himself an army of enemies
because of his outspoken stance against corruption and match-fixing
in Romania's premier division.
	   So fierce was his opposition that two years ago he resigned, but
Romanian officials refused to accept it and convinced him to
return.
	   In 1994 in the United States, Iordanescu led Romania to its best
ever World Cup performance, reaching the quarterfinals where they
fell to Sweden on penalties.
	   In the interview at the Romanians' base camp, Iordanescu accused
the soccer authorities of endangering the country's World Cup
chances by denying him money, facilities and competitive warmup
matches.
	   ``I wanted to organize a training camp in Switzerland, but the
federation president told me there wasn't even money to pay for the
flight.''
	   Federation President Mircea Sandu told a news conference in
Bucharest that he was at least dlrs 1 million short of what was
needed to prepare the team for the finals.
	   ``Then I asked the federation to find us strong teams for our
warmup games, like France, Italy and Germany. But in the end we had
to contend ourselves with Paraguay and Moldova.''
	   He said the federation rejected a friendly with Nigeria because
they offered dlrs 15,000 but the Nigerians wanted more.
	   As a player Iordanescu played 64 times for Romania, scoring 26
goals.
	   He first caught the eye in 1986, when as player-coach of Steaua
he came on as substitute to help the club beat Barcelona on
penalties to win the European Champions Cup.
	   He was promoted to the rank of army general after the '94 World
Cup.
	   In July he will pack his bags and take over the Greek national
team.
	   ``The contract with the Greek federation is better than that
with the Romanian federation,'' he said, no regrets in his voice.

Egyptian, Israeli peace activists vow to advance peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian and Israeli peace activists pledged
Tuesday to work together to advance Middle East peace, a prospect
they said could only be realized through the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
	   The activists, who met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo
on Tuesday, also blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian talks.
	   The activists represent Peace Now, Israel's largest peace
organization, and the Egyptian Peace Movement, a small group whose
members include prominent writers, lawyers and former officials.
	   On Monday, the activists backed the right of Palestinians to
establish an independent state. They said that while they support
Israel's position that Jerusalem should remain unified, a
Palestinian capital should be set up in the city's Arab areas.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967.
	   A statement by the two groups said they decided to join hands to
counter Netanyahu's hard-line policies, which they blamed for
bringing the talks to a ``virtual standstill.''
	   The statement said some Israeli settlements should be allowed to
remain within the boundaries of a Palestinian state but others must
be evacuated with the Israeli government paying compensation.
	   The proposal said the Palestinian state should be allowed to
absorb the 1948 refugees and displaced Palestinians from the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. The refugees should receive compensation from the
international community, it said.
	   The official Israeli-Palestinian talks have left the issue of
Jerusalem and the historical disputes to be resolved last, pending
a resolution of major issues such as Israeli troops pullout from
West Bank, the opening of an airport in Gaza and the free passage
of Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   The peace talks between the two sides are currently stalled over
Israel's refusal to accept a U.S. proposal for a further 13.1
percent Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Rich in resources, gifted with great
thinkers, Nigeria in its nascent independence 38 years ago was
energized with the promise of freedom in a modern Africa.
	   That was before the military entered the picture, with its
coups, corruption and mismanagement.
	   With his death from a heart attack Monday, Gen. Sani Abacha
leaves behind a country in disarray, its natural oil wealth
plundered by only the latest in a long line of dictators.
	   Under Abacha, Nigeria's dlrs 4.45 billion in oil export revenues
did little to ease the staggering poverty in a country where rural
villages go without electricity, clean water and medical clinics.
	   In contrast, Abacha lived in a world of obscene wealth in a
capital, Abuja, which he ordered built from nothing at a staggering
cost.
	   In a pre-dawn ceremony Tuesday, the military named a new
general, Abdulsalam Abubakar, to replace Abacha. Nigerians now must
watch and wait to see what's in store from their ninth army ruler.
	   Abacha's unfinished and divisive work will continue to haunt the
country unless Abubakar moves Nigeria away from army rule and
toward democratic reform as so often promised _ but never
fulfilled.
	   In the wake of Abacha's five years in power, Nigerian prisons
are crammed with political prisoners; the former deputy military
leader remains on death row on what are probably trumped-up coup
charges.
	   The president-elect of 1993, Moshood Abiola, likewise languishes
in prison.
	   And Nigeria's noted thinkers, like Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka,
live in exile. More ominously, others, like author and
environmentalist Ken Sara-Wiwa, are dead _ executed at Abacha's
whim.
	   ``Everything has been allowed to deteriorate,'' outspoken
Nigerian political analyst Auwalu Ilu said in a recent interview
before Abacha's death. ``The only way to recovery is for every
Nigerian to play a role.''
	   After Abacha's iron-fisted rule, however, most Nigerians have
learned that playing a role means risking time in jail, or worse.
Change must come from Abubakar.
	   Abacha jailed thousands of critics, opponents and pro-democracy
activists. Meanwhile, Nigerians watched in confusion as their
leader helped defend democracy away from home.
	   In Sierra Leone, Abacha was hailed as a friend to democracy when
his army helped restored that country's elected government.
	   But then, Nigerians are quick to point out with typical
street-wise self-deprecating humor, that theirs is a country that
imports what it has (oil) and exports what it doesn't have
(democracy).
	   For its faults, the army has been credited with holding
fractious Nigeria together _ particularly in the wake of the brutal
1967-70 Biafran civil war.
	   But under Abacha, the army bridged ethnic fault lines only to
rob the country of its riches.
	   The world's sixth-largest oil exporter, Nigeria is forced to
import refined fuel _ the country's refineries have all fallen idle
for disrepair.
	   Daily life in the cities has deteriorated into a grinding
routine of day-long queues for fuel and mandatory bribes to
underpaid police officers.
	   The promise of free enterprise and burgeoning new markets in the
Nigeria of the 1960s was soon hijacked by the military. With its
legacy of corruption fine-tuned under Abacha, fair business
competition has been all but obliterated.
	   Supply and demand be damned, currying favor with the military
was the means of corporate survival in Abacha's Nigeria.
	   Apart from robbing Nigeria of civil liberties and democracy,
Abacha has left a legacy of corruption that has permeated almost
every level of society, from jacket-and-tie bankers to the
street-corner shoeshine boy.

	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ One child was killed and three girls
were raped when pupils from two neighboring schools fought pitched
battles, police said.
	   Blantyre police spokesman Oliver Soko said the clashes started
after a soccer match Monday between the two high schools near the
southern town of Nsanje.
	   The losing team accused the winning team of attacking girl
pupils who jeered at the winners. Three of the girls were allegedly
raped and classmates retaliated by invading the other school and
smashing desks and property.
	   Soko said it was not clear how the pupil died and he had no
information on the dead child's identity.
	   He said five boys were arrested and will face proceedings in a
court for juveniles.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Under military escort, the U.N. World Food
Program has begun a two-month emergency food distribution to more
than 100,000 displaced people in northwestern Rwanda, the agency
said Tuesday.
	   WFP Rwanda country director Gerard Van Dijk said until now, the
agency had
	   only been able to take small amounts of relief food into a few
areas because of insecurity and rebel attacks.
	   ``Now we hope to reach more remote villages where reports
indicate that displaced people are in urgent need of our help,''
Dijk said.
	   The U.N agency said the distribution began last week in a region
where 200 metric tons was provided to 25,000 people.
	   The agency plans to hand out a total of 1,200 tons of food aid
in the two prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri in northwest
Rwanda.
	   Thousands of people have fled the violence in the area.
	   UN and other aid agencies have had only partial and periodical
access to the two regions. This year, the majority of WFP
assistance has been food-for-work programs that support community
participation in agricultural rehabilitation.
	   -----
	   MUTARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Eleven people were killed when a bus
collided with
	   an 18-ton truck near Mutare, police said.
	   Police spokesman Assistant-Inspector Eddison Makacha said eight
passengers
	   died instantly in Monday's accident and another three died
afterwards.
	   The driver of the bus was among those who died.
	   ----
	   STUTTERHEIM, South Africa (AP) _ Stock theft cost Eastern Cape
farmers 29 million rand (dlrs 5.7 million) last year, according to
Stutterheim stock theft unit commander Capt. Theo Meyer.
	   Meyer was speaking Monday at the bail application of seven
alleged rustlers, who are charged with stealing 96 sheep worth
30,000 rand (dlrs 6,000) between April and May this year.
	   The men, who were arrested May 25, were denied bail.
	   ------
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A pick up truck carrying a
potentially life threatening radioactive device was hijacked in the
black township of Soweto, south of Johannesburg, on Tuesday, police
said.
	   Captain Johan Pelser of the Pretoria bomb disposal unit urged
anyone who found the device not to tamper with it.
	   ``Anyone within a certain radius will suffer radiation
(exposure) if the container is opened,'' he said. ``This could be
life-threatening.''
	   The heavy metal container in which an isotope was being
transported was marked with radioactive warning signs. It was red,
and measured about 250 by 300 millimeters (10 by 12 inches), said
Superintendent Dries van Sittert, commander of the Pretoria
explosives unit
	   He said the Toyota Hilux pickup truck was hijacked about noon.

Rocks thrown during student protest in Indonesia

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs threw rocks and smashed the
windows of several banks at the end of student protest against
local government corruption Tuesday, witnesses said.
	   Police said there were no reports of injuries or arrests in
Tegal, a coastal town about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   Sri Wulandari, a Tegal resident, said more than 100 students
demonstrated in the streets against corruption and collusion in the
local government.
	   Stores closed there doors after other groups joined the protests
and began throwing rocks.
	   ``Stores were shut because some were afraid a riot might
start,'' she said.
	   The failure of many banks has resulted from the worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   In Jakarta about a dozen protesters demonstrated peacefully
outside the U.S. embassy, demanding Washington speed up a 43 dlrs
billion IMF bailout plan by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Protests have been held almost daily outside the embassy since
last week.
	   Also in Jakarta, about 200 supporters of opposition figure
Megawati Sukarnoputri marched about five kilometers (3 miles) from
Justice Ministry to the offices of Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   They demanded that they take control of a building.
	   Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's first president, Suharto,
was ousted as party leader by rivals in 1996. She maintains the act
was illegal and was sponsored by the government of former President
Suharto after she called for democratic reform.
	   Suharto stepped down last month following riots and protests
triggered by rising prices and mass unemployment.
	   The latest protests continue even though Suharto has stepped
down and his successor Habibie has promised sweeping political and
economic reform.
	   Many fear violence could erupt again if soaring inflation and
mass unemployment from the worst economic crisis in 30 years is not
controlled.
	   In a third protest in the capital, about 100 students
demonstrated outside the parliament demanding the government speed
up reform.
	   About 30 people were injured when police and strikers clashed
during a street march in the second city of Surabaya, police said
Tuesday.
	   Violence erupted when a line of riot police halted a
10-kilometer (six-mile) long march by striking factory workers
Monday, setting off a spate of stone-throwing in Indonesia's
biggest protest since the new president eased restrictions on
labor.
	   At least five police and three protesters were hospitalized as a
result of violence during the march in Surabaya, about 650
kilometers (400 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Police estimated Monday's crowd at 10,000. However, the Jakarta
Post newspaper said about 25,000 took part.
	   Feeling the effects of Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30
years, the workers went on strike a week ago to demand higher
salaries.
	   Meanwhile, all 46 members of the provincial legislature of the
tourist island of Bali have promised to resign after thousands of
protesters accused them of corruption and collusion.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A cyclone spun onto India's western Gujarat
state Tuesday, whipping up high winds that toppled walls and a
communication tower, killing 21 people.
	   The storm hit land at Porbunder, 450 kilometers (280 miles)
northwest of Bombay, and gradually moved north, buffeting much of
western India with heavy rain and winds of up 80 kph (50 mph),
snapping power lines and making driving impossible.
	   Gujarat state officials said 12 of the deaths occurred in
Junagadh, Bhuj and Jamnagar, rural districts near Porbunder, where
walls collapsed in the storm.
	   Nine others died in Porbunder when a telecommunications tower
came crashing down.
	   Kamaljeet, a meteorologist who uses only one name, said by
telephone from Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat, that the storm
was expected to weaken soon.
	   Indian officials moved some 5,000 people in small towns and
villages bordering the Arabian Sea to safety on Monday, state
government officials said.

	   INEFFICIENT rubbish collection and disposal in Jalan Masjid
India by Alam Flora Sdn Bhd is now a thing of the past.
	   A check by the New Straits Times showed that all bin points were
cleared twice a day and bin sites thoroughly washed.
	   Drains in the Jalan Masjid India area were being cleared
regularly and one business owner, Maideen Razak, confirmed that
Alam Flora had indeed improved services.
	   The question of why crows are attracted to Jalan Masjid India is
something which Alam Flora and Kuala Lumpur City Hall will have to
ponder on.
	   Business operators and residents in Jalan Masjid India have been
crying foul over the crow menace for a long time and all this
while, uncollected rubbish was blamed as the cause.
	   Crows in Jalan Masjid India disappear during the day, only to
come back late in the evening to roost on the trees which have
become their home.
	   No crow was to be found feeding in the area.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Shares in the Belgian steelmaker
Cockerill Sambre SA rose sharply Tuesday on reports that Germany's
Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG was considering a takeover.
	   Newspapers in Germany and Belgium reported Thyssen Krupp was
mulling a takeover bid for Cockerill, whose main shareholder is the
government of Belgium's southern Wallonia region.
	   Cockerill spokesman Christophe Weerts confirmed talks had taken
place on a possible alliance with Thyssen Krupp, Europe's largest
steel producer. But he declined to say whether Cockerill would
accept a takeover bid.
	   Weerts said Cockerill, which has been seeking a partner for
years, had also held alliance talks with other steelmakers.
	   Other companies that have been considered potential partners of
Cockerill are Arbed SA of Luxembourg, Usinor SA of France,
Hoogovens NV of the Netherlands and British Steel PLC.
	   Cockerill shares rose 10.6 percent to finish at 241 francs (dlrs
6.57) in trading on the Brussels stock exchange Tuesday.

Cuban leader sees Russian Communist chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Reaffirming strong ties between Russian and
Cuban communists, Cuban President Fidel Castro held a meeting with
Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in Havana, Cuban news
media reported Tuesday.
	   The government's Prensa Latina news agency said the Monday night
meeting saw ``a broad interchange of information about the activity
of both parties, the progress of political relations and the
continuance of the fraternal ties which for years characterized the
relations between Russia and Cuba.''
	   Castro _ who openly embraced communism two years after his 1959
revolution _ has frequently lamented the collapse of the Soviet
communist system and expressed gratitude for Soviet support of
Cuba's socialist government against U.S. efforts to topple it.
	   Russia's Interfax agency said Castro ``spoke about the
activities of the Cuban Communists, the reforms that are being
carried out in Cuba and the Cuban people's struggle against the
American blockade.''
	   The Russian politician arrived Monday in Havana as part of a
Latin American visit that also took him to Brazil and Argentina.

	   DESPITE having to battle with heavy congestion with the
implementation of the one-way street system, Jalan Masjid India
residents and business operators have another big problem to live
with for which no solution seems to be in sight.
	   Now, they have to put up with pesky crows whose numbers seem to
be increasing by the day.
	   Following a letter published in the New Straits Times by an
affected resident on May 21, a check confirmed that the Masjid
India area was indeed a sorry sight.
	   True to the writer's claims that the pedestrian malls and roads
were littered with crow droppings, the whole of Jalan Masjid India
looked ``unsafe'' for pedestrians.
	   Saras Maniam, an employee in a textile shop in the area, said
she had seen people walking along the stretch using umbrellas to
protect themselves from crow droppings, especially in the evenings.
	   She admitted that she herself had sometimes resorted to taking
such precautions.
	   The owner of a batik shop on the ground floor who lives with his
family on the second floor of the same building, said having his
car parked under the trees proved costly as he has to send his car
for washing everyday.
	   ``Carwash does not come cheap. If I allow the crow droppings to
settle on my car for a few days, I will have difficulty removing
the stains and have to then send the car for waxing and polishing
which is even costlier,'' he said.
	   Asked what had drawn the crows to the area, N. Kumar, who has an
office in Wisma Lal Doshi, said it could be due to the large number
of hawker stalls which have dirtied the surroundings.
	   ``There is a possibility that leftover food from the stalls is
not disposed of properly and is attracting the crows here,'' Kumar
said.
	   Most business owners interviewed echoed similar complaints. They
added that the crows were noisy and a nuisance in the mornings.
	   Alam Flora Sdn Bhd acting chief executive officer Mohammad Siraj
Abdul Razak said cleaning the pedestrian malls was done on a
regular basis in the mornings but the problem recurred and there
was nothing much they could do beyond that.
	   ``We flush the walkways with water every morning but the next
morning it is back to square one. I do not agree that rubbish is an
attraction here because our rubbish collection system is scheduled
in such a way that there is nothing left to attract crows,''
Mohammad Siraj said.
	   In response, passers-by interviewed said that although they have
seen Alam Flora cleaning the pedestrian malls, it was not done on a
daily basis and this was evident from the dry crow droppings on the
pedestrian malls, roads and even telephone booths.
	   Kuala Lumpur City Hall Press officer Zakaria Mohamed Lazim said
although crow shoots were carried out regularly around the city,
Jalan Masjid India was not ideal for such an exercise.
	   ``Residential blocks like the Razak and Malayan mansions are too
low and if we shoot in this area, there is a likelihood that the
buildings will be hit by stray bullets,'' Mohamed Lazim said.
	   He said crow shoots which had taken place in the vicinity of
Jalan Masjid India, like Jalan Raja Laut and Jalan Munsyi Abdullah,
had driven the birds to seek refuge in Jalan Masjid India.
	   ``Apart from that, the trees along Jalan Masjid India have thick
branches which are an ideal habitat for the birds,'' Mohamed Lazim
said.
	   He also denied claims that rubbish was an attraction for the
birds as they were not found in Jalan Masjid India during the day.
	   ``They only fly back to the place in the evening to roost on the
trees,''
	   Mohamed Lazim said, adding that City Hall would employ
contractors to trim the branches of the trees.

Iraq linked with outside world for the first time since Gulf War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ For the first time since the 1991 Gulf War,
Iraqis can make direct international telephone calls without having
to go through the operator.
	   Calls into the country also had to go through the operator, and
Iraqis living abroad used to complain it took them days to get
through.
	   An official at the Post, Telegraph and Telephone department in
Baghdad said lines were overloaded as Iraqis tried to call
relatives abroad.
	   The direct lines that resumed Monday does not apply to Israel,
which remains Iraq's enemy.
	   Minister of Transport and Communications Ahmed Morteda was
quoted as saying in the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper this
week that the decision to resume direct phones lines would help
business.
	   He said Iraq plans to ``improve its communications with the
outside world and upgrade its services in order to be of service to
businessmen and investors.''
	   Previously, only embassies and representatives of foreign media
were given free access to international dialing provided they paid
in U.S. dollars _ an average of dlrs 4 a minute.
	   The Baghdad weekly al-Ittihad said Tuesday that the decision to
resume direct lines was taken following assurances by the PTT that
it made ``all the necessary technical requirements for contact with
the outside world.'' It did not elaborate.
	   A direct one-minute call to London costs 1,250 dinars (about
dlrs 0.75) and less than 50 cents to Jordan, the PTT official said.
	   Iraq has earmarked dlrs 150 million under the fourth phase of
the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal to revamp its
telecommunications systems, which were severely damaged during the
1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Representatives from France's Alcatel, a telecommunications
firm, are currently in Baghdad to strike deals to repair the
country's telecommunications infrastructure, the weekly al-Musawir
said.
	   Alcatel modernized Iraq's telecommunications systems in the
1980s and al-Musawir said the company is also conducting talks for
post-sanctions contracts with Iraq.

German unemployment rate drops for May
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl reaction, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's jobless rate sank to 10.9
percent in May, the first drop below 11 percent since 1996, the
Federal Labor Office said Tuesday.
	   A total 4.2 million people were still unemployed, but 223,400
more people had jobs in May than in April, when the unemployment
rate was 11.1 percent.
	   ``We can't ignore the fact that 4.2 million people in Germany
are still looking for work,'' Labor Office President Bernhard
Jagoda said. ``The positive jobless development in May doesn't
allow us to sit back. It's only a nice intermediate goal which we
achieved.''
	   With joblessness the key issue in national elections Sept. 27,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl put an optimistic spin on the latest figures
as a sign of economic recovery. He linked them to strong economic
growth, which has been forecast for 1998 at 2.5 percent to 3
percent.
	   ``The economy is recovering with a clarity that no one can
overlook,'' Kohl said. ``But more important is that a recovery in
the jobs market has started and a turnaround has been achieved.''
	   The labor office, in Nuremberg, attributed the May jobless
decline in part to a usual economic upturn in the spring. When
adjusted for seasonal factors, such as bad weather that hinders
construction work, only 60,000 more people had jobs.
	   But compared to May of last year, 58,300 more people had jobs,
making it the first time since 1995 that unemployment figures have
improved on the year.
	   For the fifth month in a row, jobless protesters held rallies
nationwide to coincide with the announcement of the unemployment
numbers. Altogether, about 50,000 people protested in 300 towns and
cities around the country.
	   The biggest gathering, with 800 people, was in the city of
Weimar, located in the former communist East Germany where
unemployment has for months been double that in the western states.
	   The labor office noted some improvement in the former east
Germany. The May rate was 18.1 percent compared to 19.4 percent in
April, although the east is still struggling in their transition
from communism to capitalism.
	   For the western states, the labor office claimed Germany had
reached a turnaround in joblessness. Unemployment dropped to 9.1
percent in May from 9.5 percent in April.

Opposition says it won't support government on NATO vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Prodi saying he not worried about vote;
Communists' resisting pressure to change &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi's main ally in the center-right
opposition said Tuesday that the alliance won't bail out Premier
Romano Prodi's government on a crucial vote later this month on
NATO.
	   Without the support of the media mogul's Freedom Alliance,
Prodi's center-left coalition risks losing the vote and thus facing
a vote of confidence.
	   While Berlusconi and his allies support NATO's eastward
expansion, they have announced their refusal to come to the rescue
of the government yet again in the face of the governing
coalition's difficulties with its troublesome Communist allies.
	   Fausto Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party which Prodi
counts on for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, where a vote
on NATO is planned the week of June 22, on Tuesday reiterated its
intention to vote against the military alliance's expansion.
	   ``There have been numerous attempts to convince us to change our
stance,'' said the party's foreign policy chief, Ramon Mantovani.
``But our `no' vote isn't under discussion.''
	   Boosted by a strong showing for the center-right in scattered
local elections last weekend, Berlusconi said Monday he wanted to
``send Prodi and his government home.''
	   ``We don't want to bail Prodi out in any way,'' Gianfranco Fini,
leader of the rightwing National Alliance, a key ally in
Berlusconi's coalition, told reporters.
	   However, both opposition leaders have said they support NATO
expansion in principle, and it is unlikely they will ultimately
stop Italy from approving the addition of new countries.
	   Among the options to the opposition is one in which Berlusconi's
alliance would vote against Prodi's bill but propose another
version that changes only minor points while approving NATO
expansion.
	   During a visit to Germany Tuesday, Prodi said his government's
stability will not be shaken by the vote.
	   ``We can't forget that the NATO proposal has passed in one
chamber of parliament,'' said Prodi. If the opposition were to vote
against the proposal, it would be ``the opposition's problem, not
mine.''
	   Bertinotti pushed the government to the brink of collapse last
year when it voted against Italy's plans to send peacekeeping
troops to Albania, but Berlusconi's coalition bailed out Prodi
then.
	   Prodi's coalition suffered a setback Tuesday with the formal end
of parliamentary efforts on political reform, a key plank of the
government.
	   ``It's not a happy day,'' said Sen. Cesare Salvi, a former
Communist, about the failure of a two-chamber commission on reform
to produce results.
	   Refusal by Berlusconi to back the government's proposal for
changing the powers of the Italian president brought collapse of
the reforms.

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ English golfer Lee Westwood moved
from sixth to first on the European Tour money list for the first
time after winning the English Open last Sunday.
	   Westwood, who fired rounds of 68-68-67-68, claimed the winner's
check of 108,330 pounds (dlrs 176,578), bringing his season's
earnings to 383,629 pounds (dlrs 625,315) and taking the top spot
from South African Ernie Els.
	   Westwood has two consecutive tour victories to his credit, after
a one-stroke win in the Open TPC of Europe in Hamburg on June 1. He
also has the lowest score on the European tour this year, a 61 at
Hamburg.
	   Els, who did not play in the English Open, slipped to second
place on the money list with 368,954 (dlrs 601395). Denmark's
Thomas Bjorn dropped into third with 327470 pounds (dlrs 533,776).
	   Sweden's Patrik Sjoland and Scotland's Colin Montgomerie each

World Cup: Ziege, Helmer still miss training
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Before getting a day off, the German team
practiced hard Tuesday on the heels of a lackluster 2-1 victory
over a Cote d'Azure selection of young professionals.
	   Still missing from the mid-morning practice were wing back
Christian Ziege and Thomas Helmer, a versatile defender who can
also play in the midfield. Ziege was spared after overcoming a
fever, while Helmer is suffering from a thigh injury.
	   The Germans were taken a little bit surprised by the seriousness
with which the local selection took the practice game Monday
evening in Nice.
	   ``We thought it was going to be a relaxed practice game,'' team
spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said. ``But they weren't all that
young and they were very competitive.''
	   Coach Berti Vogts was angry because the game featured some
tackling harder than usual in such exhibition, charity games,
Niersbach said. ``Luckily no one was injured.''
	   The Germans won on goals by Olaf Marschall and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   ``We didn't know they would be professionals, but it was good
practice, I think we needed it,'' said team captain Juergen
Klinsmann.
	   While Ziege will resume training Wednesday, Helmer is unsure
whether he'll recover by the time Germany opens its campaign June
15 in Paris against the United States.
	   ``I'll do my best to help the team, whether it's on or off the
field,'' said Helmer, the 33-year-old captain of Bayern Munich and
one of the leaders on the team.
	   Helmer will be examined Tuesday evening by Bayer's physician
Hans-Willhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who is also a doctor for the
national team and who arrived Tuesday at the team's headquarters in
the hills above this Mediterranean resort.
	   ``I don't think it's very serious and the whole atmosphere is
making me feel better already,'' Helmer said. ``It's a little
setback but I already feel more positive.''
	   The Germans are living at the four-star Mas d'Artigny, near
Saint-Paul-de-Vence, and the players have been praising the
secluded, wooded compound.
	   ``Our physiotherapists have a whole house to themselves,''
Helmer said.
	   After Tuesday's training, Vogts gave his players off until 11
a.m. Wednesday. The wives and girlfriends of the players are living
in hotels in the area.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Richie Woodhall will defend his WBC
super-middleweight title against former champion Vicenzo Nardiello
of Italy on July 25, promoter Frank Warren said Tuesday.
	   Warren said the fight will be held in Italy at a venue still to
be determined.
	   It will be Woodhall's first defense since winning the title in
March with a unanimous decision over South Africa's Thulane ``Sugar
Boy'' Malinga.
	   ``I've got no fear of traveling to Italy,'' Woodhall said. `I
know that I have to knock Nardiello out and that is exactly what I
intend to to.''

Klinsmann not guaranteed but likely to start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann is the captain of the
German team with 103 caps. This doesn't guarantee him a place in
the starting lineup, however, and Klinsmann is feeling the heat.
	   Perhaps never before has Germany come to a World Cup with four
strikers who can all make an equal claim on a place in the starting
11.
	   ``It's a healthy competition, we try very hard in practice and
we take it very seriously,'' Klinsmann said. ``We respect each
other a lot, but all of us want to show that we belong.''
	   Besides Klinsmann, there is Oliver Bierhoff, who topped the
Italian Serie A with 27 goals. Ulf Kirsten led the Bundesliga with
22, followed by Olaf Marschall, who notched 21 in 24 league
matches.
	   Compared to such feats, Klinsmann had a quiet season. He moved
in mid-season from Sampdoria Genoa to his former London club
Tottenham, and was kept on the sidelines with ankle and jaw
injuries that also forced him to miss several national team games.
	   But the 33-year-old German star bounced back strongly in the
late stage of the season, scoring four goals in one game to rescue
Tottenham from relegation.
	   His club future is uncertain. Klinsmann is leaving Tottenham but
has no new club. Reports have surfaced that he may be lured to
Major League Soccer in the United States. Klinsmann, a
well-traveled player whose wife is American, has said he would like
to play about two more years at club level.
	   His international career, however, will be over after this World
Cup, his third. Klinsmann was in the 1990 team in Italy that won
Germany's third World Cup title.
	   And Klinsmann wants to go out with a bang. Before that, he had
to convince Berti Vogts, Germany's coach, that he was still the
formidable striker that had produced 44 goals for the national
team.
	   In April, Klinsmann was benched for Germany's warmup game
against Nigeria, something that would have been unthinkable a year
ago.
	   Klinsmann did not react like a hurt diva. Instead, he earned
public praise from Vogts for his hard work in practice.
	   Vogts has a lot of loyalty for his long-serving players, but
Klinsmann still had to work his way back to the front.
	   In a scrimmage game against a local team Monday, Klinsmann
paired with Bierhoff. The same has been happening in practice,
prompting reporters to conclude that Klinsmann and Bierhoff will be
Germany's strikers against the United States in Paris on June 15.
	   But Klinsmann wasn't convinced. ``I don't think it's connected
to the starting lineup against the Americans,'' he said.
	   With the German team in headquartered near Nice, Klinsmann is on
familiar ground, having spent two seasons in nearby Monaco on the
Riviera between 1992 and 1994.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Four jolly giants _ black, yellow, red and white _
stride through Paris like good-guy Godzillas on Tuesday to
symbolize a World Cup that France hopes will loom large in history.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the 18-meter (60-foot) robots take separate routes to the
Place de la Concorde, at the heart of a party for 1 million people.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show. ``The grand theme is universality in a
single world.''
	   Parisians awoke to find the giants at familiar monuments, along
with throngs of strangely dressed tourists from the 31 nations
which join France in the globe's biggest sports tournament.
	   Pablo, the American Indian giant, crouched under the Arc de
Triomphe, ready for his afternoon stroll down the Champs Elysees to
the animated trees and bugs that depict nature.
	   Moussa, the African, waited by the Eiffel Tower, to symbolically
discover man and the earth on his wheel-assisted walk past
Napoleon's Tomb and across the ornate Alexandre III bridge.
	   Romeo, the European, snoozed outside the Opera Garnier. His
theme was love, and along his route waited a sculptor's conception
of the Urban Woman, a mere 4.5 meters (15 feet) tall.
	   Ho, the Asian, camped overnight on the Pont Neuf, where he would
encounter flying fish, dragons and whimsical beasts that
illustrated his themes of spirituality and fantasy.
	   Heavy overnight rains did not dampen the mood, but they washed
off Ho's loincloth, made of rubberized-plastic, exposing the
midriff of his articulated steel skeleton. Workmen pinned it back
on.
	   The 38-ton giants were maneuvered by small cranes that rolled
behind, but internal motors moved fingers and waved arms.
	   Among hard-to-impress Parisians, the four colossi received mixed
reviews. Along the city's grand boulevards, real characters seemed
to attract more attention. Clusters of soccer fans roamed the
streets in outlandish outfits and gaudy colors.
	   For once, passersby paid more attention to skirts on men rather
than women. Perhaps 20,000 Scots came across the Channel for the
opening game with Brazil on Wednesday. Most wore kilts.
	   Scott Wallace, a fishmonger, and his housepainter friend, Gerry
Shiels, sat behind tankards of lager at the Cafe Montecristo, each
with bare knees and Highland feathers towering above their hats.
	   ``I think we'll beat 'em, 2-1,'' Wallace said, a little
hopefully. ``Aye,'' Shiels agreed. ``And if we do, it'll be some
party.''
	   From the looks of things Tuesday, there'll be some party,
anyway. Still, transport strikes by Air France and ticket foulups
have left many fans furious.
	   Crowds pushed their way into the France 98 shop to buy World Cup
paraphernalia: polyster T-shirts, caps, crowd-parting cologne,
fuzzy stuffed versions of the goofy-looking rooster mascot named
Footix.
	   Visitors seemed to show more interest than the French. Jacques
Lambert, head of the organizing committee, complained of an evident
lack of fervor among the general public.
	   A block off the Champs Elysees, Jean-Pierre Arnal sat alone in
his little hardware store, wearing his usual white smock with his
dog at his feet.
	   ``Oouuff,'' he replied when asked about the World Cup, employing
a beloved French nonword that means the same thing as shrugged
shoulders. ``I suppose it's a good thing, economically.''
	   Around the corner, Emmannuel Delhomme painted a banner on the
awning of his bookshop, the Livre Sterling: ``Good news, ladies.
This store will be open during all of the games of the World Cup.''
	   Delhomme, although no soccer fan, said he was a little wary of
the snarled traffic, the armed police and boisterous visitors.
	   ``But, after all,'' he concluded, ``it's a good thing. Parisians
are so sad, so stressed, and this is a change. All these people in
colors and a happy mood. It is something new to talk about.''

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Coming from behind, British driver Colin
McRae, driving a Subaru Impreza, won the 45th Acropolis Rally
Tuesday.
	   McRae beat France's Didier Auriol by 20 seconds in the last
stages, after Auriol, in his Toyota Corolla, had led the second day
of the three-day rally.
	   McRae, who won the gruelling Acropolis Rally in 1996, crossed
the finish line in 4 hours, 26 minutes and 31 seconds, against
Auriol's 4:26.51.
	   Auriol, a 1992 Acropolis Rally winner, won the first two of the
five scheduled special stages Tuesday. But he lost time in the
others following engine problems, giving McRae the chance to regain
lost ground.
	   Finnish driver Juha Kankkunen in a Ford Escort WRC came in third
in 4:27.15.
	   The victory set McRae atop the world driving championships
standings with 36 points. He replaced Spain's Carlos Sainz, who
dropped to second place with 31 points.
	   Of the 103 cars that started out from the foot of the Athens
Acropolis hill on Sunday, 59 managed to complete the rally's total
distance of 1,036 kilometers (647 miles) through Greece's best and
worst roads.
	   Unlike previous races, this year's rally ended in the western
town of Delphi. The ancient Greeks considered Delphi to be the
center of the world. It was also the site of the oracle that
ancient Greeks consulted for prophesies of the future.
	   Japan's Subaru took the lead in the manufacturer's standings
with 49 points, followed by Toyota with 47 and Mitsubishi with 45.
Ford of Britain was 4th with 33 points.

Ukrainian believers protest ID codes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of Christian Orthodox believers
protested Tuesday against Ukraine's new taxpayer identification
codes, which they claim carry the ``mark of the Antichrist.''
	   The protesters recited prayers and held placards outside the
Ukrainian parliament, demanding the government rescind the new ID
system, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The new taxpayer codes, similar to U.S. Social Security numbers,
became obligatory across Ukraine on Jan. 1.
	   The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine last
month appealed to President Leonid Kuchma, asking that the system
be changed to accommodate believers' concerns.
	   The appeal noted that many Orthodox faithful consider the code
system, ``not without ground, as the fulfillment of the apocalyptic
prophesy about the mark of the Antichrist.''
	   The Synod proposed that believers be allowed to refuse numbers
that include three or more 6s. The Bible's Book of Revelations
cites 666 as the number of the Antichrist.
	   Some Christians interpret this to mean that the ``mark of the
beast'' could be any identifying number required for official and
business transactions.

	   TWENTY-ONE female employees from eight companies in the Ulu
Klang Industrial Zone, Selangor received their certificates
recently after completing a five-day training programme on
counselling women workers.
	   Launched by National Unity and Social Development Minister Datin
Paduka Zaleha Ismail at the De Palma Hotel in Ampang, the programme
was organised by the Gombak district Women's Welfare Department of
the Ministry and sponsored by the companies.
	   The participating companies were Harris Advanced Technology,
Malaysia Transformer, Pernec, Royal Selangor Pewter, Sapura,
ShinEtsu, SmithKline Beecham and Texas Instruments.
	   The programme was aimed at creating a pool of counsellors to
assist and guide women factory workers to overcome economic,
emotional, family, work or social problems they might face and help
improve their welfare and quality of life.
	   Besides helping women workers in their place of employment, the
21 counsellors will provide counselling services to the local
community in the State at the Selangor Women's Counselling Centre.
	   The Ulu Klang Industrial Zone also boasts of the first private
sector single parents club in the country which was launched by
Harris Advanced Technology last year.
	   Its aim is to help members recognise, cope with and overcome the
economic, emotional, family, work and social problems working
single parents often face.
	   Apart from promoting women's welfare, UKIZ companies have also
been active in fostering esprit de corps among their workers by
organising the Workers' Run on May 1 and an inter-company badminton
competition hosted by Malaysia Transformers.

Chemicals group's profit up 6 percent to dlrs 74 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's leading fertilizer and
chemicals company, Kemira, increased its four-month pretax profit
to 401 million markkaa (dlrs 74 million), up from 377 million
markkaa during the same period in 1997.
	   Net sales from January to April grew slightly to 5.3 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1 billion), from 5.1 billion markkaa for the same
period last year, Kemira said Tuesday.
	   Sales in the core businesses of chemicals and pigments grew
strongly, the company said. However, a fall in fertilizer prices
caused a sharp drop in operating profit of the group's largest
unit, Kemira Agro, to 174 million markkaa (dlrs 32 million) from
303 million markkaa in 1997.
	   Kemira group predicted that strong sales will continue in the
pigments and chemicals sectors, while the agro unit's performance
was expected to fall below last year's level.
	   ``Net financing expenses are expected to be roughly the same as
last year,'' the company said. ``Net income for the group is
expected to be at last year's record level.''
	   In 1997, Kemira had a record pretax profit of 864 million markka
(dlrs 160 million), with net sales of 14.4 billion markkaa (dlrs
2.6 billion).
	   In January, Kemira announced it had extended a major deal with
Rhone Poulenc Agro of France to manufacture corn herbicides worth 1
billion markkaa (dlrs 185 million).
	   Kemira also makes pharmaceuticals. It is 54-percent state-owned,
and employs 10,400 people in 25 countries.

Volcker-led panel names banks under dormant accounts audit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ A U.S.-led panel looking for
Holocaust-era assets in Swiss banks said Tuesday it had chosen 27
banks to be examined thoroughly for any remaining dormant accounts.
	   Included are the three largest Swiss banks and 24 state and
private banks, said the panel headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve
chief Paul Volcker.
	   Some 200 auditors from four international firms have been
assigned to the latest phase of the search, a statement said.
	   The selection of the banks was ``based on size, geographic
location and the desire for representation of different types of
banks,'' the statement added.
	   The search was organized after complaints from Jewish
organizations that, more than 50 years after World War II, the
banks were still hiding assets deposited by Jews who were then
killed by the Nazis.
	   The panel stressed that the investigation would be
time-consuming because of the large quantity and incomplete nature
of the banks' wartime and prewar records.
	   But investigations at the smaller banks are expected to finish
faster ``with new banks added as the first audits are completed.''
	   The committee, charged with looking at any unclaimed possession
from the Nazi period, is one of a number of Swiss measures to
investigate and atone for any wrongdoing during World War II.
	   In addition, the three biggest banks _ Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank
Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland _ are negotiating with Jewish
organizations and lawyers for class-action claimants on a global
settlement of claims by Holocaust victims. The settlement
reportedly could exceed dlrs 1 billion.

Saddam says India, Pakistan have right to acquire nuclear bombs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein whose
country was stripped of a potential to build nuclear weapons said
Tuesday that India and Pakistan have the right to possess nuclear
bombs.
	   In a message to the leaders of the two countries, Saddam said he
saw no reason why the nuclear tests conducted by the rival
neighbors last month should spark an international outcry.
	   ``We see that both India and Pakistan had acted in accordance
with the right of sovereignty,'' Saddam said in his almost
identical messages, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. ``We
see no justification for the mounting of the campaign against India
and Pakistan.''
	   INA said Saddam made the remarks in response to letters Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee of India sent to him, explaining the reasons why they
decided to detonate nuclear devices.
	   Saddam said any criticism of the explosion is part of ``the
double standards policy'' that the United States and Britain pursue
to deny others what they already have.
	   ``If they want to have a world free of nuclear weapons, and this
is what we support and call for, then this has to be applied to all
countries without exception,'' Saddam said. He also criticized the
United Nations for not acting against Israel, which is believed to
possess a large nuclear arsenal.
	   Iraq was suspected to be about one year away from producing the
nuclear bomb when United Nations arms monitors dismantled the
program over seven years under the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms.
Iraq maintains that its program was for peaceful purposes.

	   SHELTER Four Home for girls in Kajang not only need cash and
other donations, but also local volunteers.
	   To date, of the six volunteers who give the girls tuition on
school subjects and other skills, only one is local.
	   The rest are foreigners who will only be in the country for a
short while.
	   The home's ``mom'', Rajeswari George, said at the home's
fund-raising and awareness night recently, that the home needed
locals to give a helping hand.
	   After all, the 11 girls at the home, who were victims of abuse
and neglect, are also locals.
	   ``Who else if not for caring Malaysians, could the girls depend
on. The foreigners are volunteering their service, but they will
not stay in this country forever,'' she said.
	   Sadly, not many people turned up at the awareness night held at
the World Tennis Centre in Country Heights, Kajang, and those
present were mostly expatriates.
	   One of the volunteers, Mary Ann Schuerger, who teaches the girls
English, said she would probably go back to the United States in
September when her husband's contract with the KLIA project is
completed.
	   Schuerger, who was introduced to the home by a German social
worker by the name Dorethia, became attached to the girls whom she
knew about a year ago.
	   She was also seen busy attending to the guests that night,
answering their questions in the hope that more would come forward
to help and that someone would take her place when she leaves the
country.
	   Guests were given a briefing on what Shelter Four was all about,
the girls and their needs. Guests were even ``taken'' to the home
and introduced to all the 11 girls via a video presentation.
	   A friend of Shelter Four, artist Victor Chin, also nated four of
his painting prints of common flowers from his garden to be sold
that night.
	   ``I hope that this will encourage others to help Shelter Four in
whatever way they can,'' he said.
	   His association with Shelter Four goes back for about two years
when he went for lunch with Rajeswari and the girls.
	   Since then, he and his wife had organised frequent lunches for
the girls.
	   That night, the home had sales of Sarawak black pepper and
paintings by Washington Fine Arts, which donated 70 per cent of the
proceeds to the home.
	   Shelter Four which caters for abused and neglected teenage girls
was started in Oct 1996. It is the latest addition to the Shelter
Homes.
	   Rajeswari said apart from donating money, the public could also
help by paying the monthly electricity, water and telephone bills,
food, school bus fare, toiletries and pocket money for the girls.
	   ``The public can also pay for the girls' school projects
expenditure or be a volunteer to teach them school subjects or any
skills,'' she said.
	   Those interested can contact Rajeswari at 03-8345871.

Ukrainian parliament fails to elect speaker _ again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's new Communist-dominated
parliament failed again Tuesday to elect a speaker _ the sixth time
a vote was declared invalid.
	   As during the five previous attempts, several parliamentary
factions refused to take part, and the vote count was too low to be
valid.
	   Dozens have been nominated for the post. Of the two who competed
Tuesday, former parliament speaker Olexander Moroz, a socialist,
was far ahead of his rival, Olexander Pukhkal of the centrist
Hromada movement.
	   Various factions have proposed candidates for the post since the
new Verkhovna Rada, elected in March, started its work last month.
	   But the votes have been blocked by three centrist opposition
groups and the pro-government faction. These factions demand that
the entire parliament leadership be elected at once _ an idea
rejected by other lawmakers.
	   The infighting has been condemned as a political farce by the
Ukrainian media, which devised a special term _ ``speakeriade'' _
to describe it.
	   On Tuesday, newspapers said President Leonid Kuchma planned to
issue an appeal to parliament over its inability to get down to
business. Communists, a key force opposing Kuchma's attempts at
market reforms, hold 125 of the 450 seats in Verkhovna Rada.

	   GALERI Tangsi in Jalan Tangsi, Kuala Lumpur is hosting an
exhibition of photography, sculpture and architecture entitled
Beyond Boundaries by Paris-based Malaysian architect Zaini Zainul.
The show will be on until June 26.
	   The launching was held on Saturday with a cocktail reception
attended by French ambassador Edouard Braine who was accompanied by
his wife Chantal.
	   Among the guests at the reception were the gallery's patron
Tunku Abdullah Tunku Abdul Rahman.
	   Others in the guest list were director of Serikandi Pty Ltd
(Australia) Casimah Felix, theatre actor/director Zahim Albakri,
Maria Tan Sri Samad and chief executive officer of Federal Hotel
International Low Gee Tat.
	   Also there were Carol Lim of P&AMP;O Insurance Berhad and her
pianist friend Eddie Chew.
	   Gallery director June Baharuddin said in line with the gallery's
aim to cultivate young and promising talents, it is showcasing 35
of Zaini's original photography works which were previously
exhibited at the Gallery Max-Heler in Cologne (1995) and Gallery
Quicampoix, Paris (1996).
	   June said these works were realised from the award given by two
bodies in the United States - New York Foundation for the Arts and
the National Institute of Architecture Education.
	   She said Penang-born Zaini, a graduate of Colombia University,
New York, has done a series of work in Asia for the past two years,
mainly in Malaysia and Singapore, and his projects are also on
display at the exhibition.

Bhutto files suit against Pakistan government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
filed a suit against the Pakistan government Tuesday to defend her
``dignity and respect,'' she said.
	   Ms. Bhutto said the Pakistan government fed Swiss authorities
``false statements,'' which resulted in that government freezing
her bank accounts, as well as those of her husband, Asif Ali
Zardari and her mother.
	   It wasn't immediately clear what damages Ms. Bhutto was seeking.
	   As a result of information received from the Pakistan
government, the Swiss authorities also have launched an
investigation into business dealings between Ms. Bhutto and Swiss
companies.
	   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed from power in November
1996 on charges of rampant corruption and economic mismanagement.
	   Her husband is in jail on charges of masterminding the shooting
death of Ms. Bhutto's estranged brother. Murtaza Bhutto was killed
barely three months before her government was dismissed.
	   In a news conference after filing the suit in the Sindh High
Court in her hometown of Karachi, Ms. Bhutto said the information
given to the Swiss authorities has done irreparable damage to her
reputation.
	   Ms. Bhutto also said the Pakistani government breached Pakistani
law when it gave the Swiss authorities the ``misstatements and
false statements''.
	   ``I have gone to the court to defend my dignity and respect,''
Ms. Bhutto told reporters.
	   The government alleges Ms. Bhutto and her husband robbed the
exchequer of millions of dollars, a charge she vehemently denies.

	   SHARE prices closed 0.2 per cent lower yesterday as the yen
broke through the 140-yen support to a seven-year low against the
US dollar, brokers said.
	   Light selling emerged at the outset due to the yen's tumble, but
this proved to be short-lived with the yen decline to this level
largely expected and public funds stepping into the market, dealers
said.
	   ``I think public funds were modest buyers because the Nikkei 225
index rebounded every time it fell by about 30 points,'' a Yamatane
Securities broker said.
	   The key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell 28.72 points to end at 15,294.71.
	   The Topix index of all issues on the first section dropped 3.58
points to 1,198.36.
	   The yen's drop sidelined buyers and left share prices exposed to
light selling, brokers said.
	   Turnover on the major board declined to 250 million shares from
Friday's 290.8 million shares.
	   At 3pm, the dollar was trading at 140.62-65 yen, after hitting a
seven- year high of 140.73 yen in early trade.
	   Tokyo dealers said the final straw was news that a meeting of
Deputy Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised
nations this week would not focus on the yen's weakness.
	   The main market focus was on select stocks such as Nikko
Securities and Nissan, which have been the subject of speculative
activity, dealers said.
	   Nissan gained six yen to 411, bought on news it was negotiating
with Car Max for a US franchise, which would give it additional
distribution in the US market, brokers said.
	   Turnover in Nikko Securities, Japan's third largest securities
firm, shot up after it announced last week a tie-up with US
financial services giant Travelers Group.
	   Nikko closed up 51 yen at 600, gaining a sharp 9.3 per cent,
with trading turning increasingly speculative, brokers said.

	   PETALING JAYA, Mon. - The three DAP leaders who have been
suspended and removed from their positions in the party's central
executive committee today objected to two members of the party's
disciplinary committee hearing their case.
	   They said the two members - State Assemblyman for Bukit Gasing
Teng Chang Kim and assistant organising secretary Ronnie Liew -
should not be in the panel as they were the ``judge, jury and
prosecutor'' in the case.
	   Their objection came on a day when Selangor DAP chairman Chua
Kow Eng joined in the chorus for a ``fair hearing'', urging the
party's leadership to stop hurling accusations against the three
(see story on P2).
	   ``Teng and Liew have taken part in the debate and voted in
favour of the resolution to remove and suspend us,'' said Wee Choo
Keong, who was removed as party national publicity secretary.
	   At a joint Press conference with suspended national
vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing, Wee said
Teng and Liew were also responsible for referring them to the
disciplinary committee for investigation.
	   Teng, Wee said, had spoken very vociferously against the three
of them during the debate.
	   ``Therefore, Teng and Liew have to disqualify themselves from
hearing our case,'' he said.
	   Wee said they also regretted that secretary-general Lim Kit
Siang had not responded to their request for an independent and
impartial committee to investigate the allegations against them.
	   On a personal issue, Wee also cautioned Kit Siang to stop making
defamatory statements against him.
	   ``He has alleged that I leaked information on these issues to a
certain foreign news network. I categorically deny this,'' he said.
	   Wee said Kit Siang had also differentiated the case involving
his son Lim Guan Eng with the one he (Wee) faced as one between a
criminal and civil case.
	   Wee said that in Guan Eng's case, he was sentenced to a jail
term and as a result would lose his Member of Parliament position
whereas he (Wee) was fined and disqualified by the Election Court
judge.
	   ``Why is it that there was no campaign launched by the party to
show the alleged injustice and undemocractic removal of an elected
MP?'' he asked.
	   Wee also recalled the occasion when together with his mother, he
had asked Kit Siang for assistance to post a RM100,000 court bail.
	   ``Kit Siang told us that the party had no money,'' he said,
adding that he was prepared to ask his mother to testify to the
event.

	   IPOH, Mon. - SK Methodist (ACS) today sent in 656 entries for
the Kuala Lumpur Mutual Fund Future Grads contest.
	   School principal Lai Kum Mung presented the entries to KLMF Ipoh
senior branch manager Foong Kuan Mun at the school.
	   Lai said every one of the 434 pupils in Standards Five and Six,
to whom the contest was open, took part.
	   ``The boys were very excited about the contest as it was a way
of increasing their general knowledge while offering them a chance
to win attractive prizes for themselves as well as for their
school,'' said Lai.
	   One of Ipoh's premier schools, SK Methodist has five Standard
Five classes and six Standard Six classes.
	   Lai said the school stressed English Language proficiency.
	   ``One of our programmes is an English Day on Fridays where the
school assembly is conducted in English and pupils are encouraged
to speak only English on that day.''
	   English teacher Coreen Chow said the pupils' command of English
was relatively good, comparable to the standards of larger and more
established schools in the country.

British nuclear test veterans lose European court case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ Two Scottish ex-servicemen who say
their health was ruined by being ordered to attend nuclear bomb
tests in the 1950s lost their case Tuesday in the European Court of
Human Rights.
	   The ruling be a blow to thousands of former military and
civilian workers who allege they were exposed to radiation during
the British tests blasts in the Pacific. Many were hoping a
positive result would open the way to big compensation payments.
	   Edward Egan, 59, and Kenneth McGinley, 60, went to the European
rights court to claiming the Ministry of Defense covered up
documents which could have won them a compensation settlement or a
pension.
	   But a panel of nine judges ruled there had been no violation of
the European Human Rights Convention in regard to cover-up
allegations. The court further ruled it had no jurisdiction to
consider complaints over the alleged lack of protection offered
during the tests.
	   Egan serving in the Royal Navy and McGinley serving with the
British army witnessed the explosion of an eight-megaton nuclear
bomb during tests on Christmas Island in 1957.
	   They say servicemen were ordered to line up in the open, with no
protection against the blast, which they said was no more than 20
miles away.
	   Veterans of the blasts have formed the British Nuclear Tests
Veterans Association to fight their case. They allege they were
deliberately exposed to radiation to see how their bodies would
react.
	   Successive British governments have said the men were not
exposed to harmful levels of radiation because they were too far
from the center of the explosion.
	   McGinley says the effects of the explosion made him sterile and
caused arthritis and kidney and skin problems. Egan blames the
blast for his osteoporosis, lung failure and a heart attack.
	   ``It is very disappointing to hear this result today,'' Egan
told the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency. ``It is
not only the end of the road for me, it is the end of the road for
thousands of other people who were hoping this would set a
precedent.''

EU head office: Kohl, Chirac criticism unfair; vows written reply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU head office denied Tuesday it
meddled unnecessarily in the lives of Europeans and said comments
to that effect by French President Jacques Chirac and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl were unfounded.
	   EU spokesman Thierry Daman said there ``will be a written
reply'' telling them the European Commission is not a power-hungry
outfit issuing edicts affecting 370 million EU nationals.
	   Kohl and Chirac insinuated that in a letter this week to British
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   They asked him to use next week's EU summit in Cardiff to
correct ``questionable developments (such as) a tendency of some
institutions to distance themselves from citizens.''
	   The EU must not replace national, regional and local
governments, they said. ``The aim of a European policy has never
been ... to build a central EU state.''
	   Germany and France believe it is urgent to reform the European
Commission, which runs the EU's day-to-day affairs, and Council of
Ministers, the EU decision-making body.
	   France has long been wary of the European Commission, which runs
the EU's day to day affairs, exceeding its powers. And Kohl was
upset recently by a EU Court of Justice ruling on reclaiming
medical costs incurred abroad.
	   The Kohl-Chirac letter has upset small EU states, such as the
Netherlands and Belgium, which traditionally see a powerful,
assertive European Commission as an ally in containing the
aspirations of big neighbors such as Germany and France.
	   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo said Kohl and Chirac made
``gratuitous criticisms'' and complained about their letter's
vagueness.
	   Last year, the 15 EU governments failed to reform EU
institutions, partly because Kohl resisted more decision-making by
majority voting.
	   The EU governments also failed to reform the European Commission
or re-allocate votes for big and small countries _ issues that must
be settled before a dozen newcomers join in the years ahead.
	   Daman said European Commission President Jacques Santer ``shares
the approach'' of Kohl and Chirac and is studying how the EU can
legislate less.
	   He said sometimes it has no choice as in the case of recent
legislation on sanitary conditions for animals in zoos.
	   The Commission wanted to stay away from that but EU governments
asked for a directive on hygiene conditions in EU zoos.
	   The Kohl-Chirac letter seemed motivated by a need for
reconciliation after their heated dispute at a May 2 summit over
the leadership of the European Central Bank, diplomats said.
	   The EU reform debate is closely linked to a discussion among EU
governments on new ways to fund the union.
	   Proposals call for cutbacks in agriculture spending and more
money for poor regions without raising EU membership fees. After
one year of debate, no perceptible progress has been made.

Jane's: Scientists say Pakistan needs 60 to 70 nuclear warheads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pakistani scientists believe the country needs
between 60 and 70 nuclear warheads to achieve a credible deterrent
capability against India, Jane's Defense Weekly reported Tuesday.
	   Following last month's nuclear tests by both countries, there
has been worldwide concern over prospects of a nuclear arms race by
the two old foes, who have fought three wars in the last 50 years.
	   Last week, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said
the main American concern now is whether India and Pakistan have
nuclear warheads _ and are prepared to deploy them on missiles that
can deliver weapons to their targets.
	   The article in the June 10 issue of Jane's Defense Weekly's did
not state that Pakistani scientists were going ahead with building
an arsenal of 60 to 70 nuclear warheads, only that they believe
that number is necessary. Other unidentified Pakistanis were quoted
as saying ``numbers'' don't matter in the case of nuclear weapons.
	   But the respected military magazine indicated Pakistan is
proceeding with its missile development program.
	   Samar Mubrik, the head of Pakistan's National Development
Complex, was quoted by Jane's as saying the research center was
working on two new ballistic missile systems capable of carrying
nuclear warheads, in addition to the Ghauri intermediate-range
missile that Pakistan test-launched April 6.
	   The complex has started serial production of the 700-kilometer
(440-mile) range Shaheen I missile even though it has not been
flight tested, Mubrik was quoted as saying. The missile is ready
for its first test ``any time if the government gives us a go
ahead,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The Shaheen II, with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles),
will be ready for testing within a year, Jane's quoted him as
saying.
	   The Pakistani government has said it has no plans to flight test
any missiles in the near future.
	   The size and intensity of Pakistan's nuclear tests continue to
be a subject of debate among nuclear experts.
	   Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan's budding nuclear
program, was quoted by Jane's as saying the yield of the five
nuclear tests conducted May 28 was between 40 and 45 kilotons.
	   One was a ``big bomb'' with a yield of between 30 and 35
kilotons and the other four were small, low-yield tactical nuclear
weapons which when ``tipped on small missiles can be used on the
battlefield against concentrations of troops,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   A sixth device exploded by Pakistan on May 30 had an explosive
yield of between 15 and 18 kilotons, about the size of the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima at the end of World War II, Mubrik was quoted
as saying.
	   But nuclear scientist Frank Barnaby wrote in Jane's that the May
28 explosions registered 4.6 on the Richter scale, indicating that
the total explosive yield was only between 7 and 8 kilotons. And
the May 30 explosion registered about 4.3 on the Richter scale,
equivalent to only 2 to 3 kilotons, he said.

World Cup: Ferrer's transfer ends uncertainty for at least one
</HEADLINE>
Spanish player &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Soccer-Chelsea-Ferrer &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France _ Albert Ferrer's transfer to Chelsea has
sorted out his problems. But the club future of four other key
Spanish world cup players is still in the air and niggling away at
the squad's morale.
	   Ferrer's transfer came less than two weeks after he and fellow
internationals Juan Pizzi and Guillermo Amor were told abruptly by
FC Barcelona's Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal that he had no use for
them.
	   Not known for his sensitivity or tact, Van Gaal warned the
players that ``if they choose to stay out their contracts with
Barcelona they will have a terrible time.''
	   Meanwhile, Barcelona' emblematic defender and the Spanish side's
main man at the back, Miguel Angel Nadal, has spent more time on
the bench than on the pitch with Van Gaal and knows his remaining
days at the club are few.
	   Last month also saw the arrival of former Italian team coach
Arrigo Sacchi at Atletico de Madrid and rumors immediately spread
that popular striker Kiko Narvaez and long-time keeper Paco Molina
are out.
	   The sudden new-found uncertainty and the poor timing of the
reports, especially Van Gaal's comments, dealt a severe blow to the
Spanish squad and angered Clemente given that they came just prior
to France.
	   In one moving moment, midfielder Amor, one of the most liked
players in Spanish soccer, broke into tears before reporters
recently saying neither Barcelona nor Van Gaal had a right to just
dump him after nearly 19 years of service.
	   On Tuesday, Ferrer said he hoped ``to demonstrate with Chelsea
that I am still able to play at top level soccer.''
	   Curiously, barring Molina, who has only played once for Spain,
the players are all Clemente pets and have rarely been benched
since the Basque coach took over the national team in 1992.
	   Spanish press reports described them as those Van Gaal and
Sacchi may not want, but Clemente will never abandon.
	   Known for his fierce loyalty to his crew, Clemente has been
working hard to keep up a positive atmosphere at the Chantilly camp
and on Monday called on players and press to forget the club
problems.
	   Amor agreed.
	   ``I'm here trying to concentrate on winning the World Cup and
all the press wants to talk about are my problems with Barcelona,''
he said. ``I know nothing about my future and don't want to think
about it until after France.''

Chemicals group's profit up 6 percent to dlrs 74 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's leading fertilizer and
chemicals company, Kemira, increased its four-month pretax profit
to 401 million markkaa (dlrs 74 million), up from 377 million
markkaa during the same period in 1997.
	   Net sales from January to April grew slightly to 5.3 billion
markkaa (dlrs 1 billion), from 5.1 billion markkaa for the same
period last year, Kemira said Tuesday.
	   Sales in the core businesses of chemicals and pigments grew
strongly, the company said. However, a fall in fertilizer prices
caused a sharp drop in operating profit of the group's largest
unit, Kemira Agro, to 174 million markkaa (dlrs 32 million) from
303 million markkaa in 1997.
	   Kemira group predicted that strong sales will continue in the
pigments and chemicals sectors, while the agro unit's performance
was expected to fall below last year's level.
	   ``Net financing expenses are expected to be roughly the same as
last year,'' the company said. ``Net income for the group is
expected to be at last year's record level.''
	   In 1997, Kemira had a record pretax profit of 864 million markka
(dlrs 160 million), with net sales of 14.4 billion markkaa (dlrs
2.6 billion).
	   In January, Kemira announced it had extended a major deal with
Rhone Poulenc Agro of France to manufacture corn herbicides worth 1
billion markkaa (dlrs 185 million).
	   Kemira also makes pharmaceuticals. It is 54-percent state-owned,
and employs 10,400 people in 25 countries.

	   KOTA BARU, Mon. - The Education Ministry is satisfied with the
quality of matriculation courses which have been franchised to
colleges by public universities.
	   The ministry's higher learning division director, Professor
Hassan Said, said private colleges had shown an improvement in the
standards which were required for the programme to be conducted.
	   ``However, this cannot be successful if they fail to adhere
strictly to the conditions which have been laid down by the
university authorities.
	   ``Among the conditions are that the colleges should prepare
various facilities for students. They include lodgings, lecture
theatres, lecturers and suitable supervision,'' he told reporters
after opening the Fourth National Conference on Medical Sciences at
Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital in Kubang Kerian today.
	   Also present were USM research and development vice-chancellor
Professor Jamjam Rajikan and the campus director of USM Kelantan,
Professor Roslani Abdul Majid.
	   Hassan said the colleges were being monitored by two authorities
- the private education division and the respective universities
which were franchising the courses.
	   He said the ministry was now conducting a study to upgrade the
franchise system, and this included the matriculation programme.
	   In his speech earlier, Hassan praised USM for taking the
initiative in emphasising the use of information technology in
education, which could assist students in their studies.

EBRD announces investment in Czech savings bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development acquired an 11.8 percent stake in
Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech Republic's largest savings bank, EBRD
said Tuesday.
	   The stake, valued at 2.5 billion koruna (dlrs 75.8 million),
represents the largest ever single equity investment by the EBRD,
the bank said in a statement.
	   The Czech state's 45 percent stake in Ceska Sporitelna remains
unaffected, it said.
	   The EBRD is a development bank established in 1991 to help the
post-communist countries in central and eastern Europe in their
transition fromas centrally planned to a market economy.
	   EBRD said it is buying the share in Ceska Sporitelna to enhance
its attractiveness to foreign investors ahead of its possible
complete privatization next year.

Study condemns China, Colombia for union repression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., Indian comment on child labor in 12th, 13th
grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Colombia and China were singled out for criticism
over abuses of labor union rights in a report published Tuesday to
coincide with a U.N. labor conference.
	   Worldwide, 299 activists were murdered last year, the 142-page
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions report said.
	   Highlighting 156 killings of union leaders and members in
Colombia, the report complained that ``the violence was rarely if
ever investigated.''
	   Although paramilitary organizations were mostly to blame,
``union activists continue to be stigmatized as enemies of the
state,'' it said.
	   It said hundreds of unionists had to leave their homes because
of death threats.
	   Deregulation of Colombian labor laws has made it ``impossible in
practice for many workers to belong to unions and to be covered by
collective agreements,'' the report claimed.
	   In China, ``the unions in foreign-owned and joint venture
companies are largely symbolic,'' according to the Brussels-based
ICFTU, the world's biggest umbrella organization of labor unions.
	   Such unions are controlled either by the Communist Party or
plant management, its report said.
	   The report also criticized U.S. labor law for ``double standards
with respect to the rights of employers and of workers,'' claiming
that at least one in 10 activists campaigning to form a union is
illegally fired.
	   This year's International Labor Organization conference is
working on a declaration committing countries to work toward
collective bargaining and the elimination of forced labor.
	   It is also considering a new world convention aimed at
abolishing the most extreme forms of child labor.
	   U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman told delegates she had come
``with clear instructions ... to underline the United States'
strong support for the negotiation'' of that convention.
	   India was ``happy to note'' consideration of the new convention
and its ``sequential and gradual'' approach to the child labor
problem, Indian Labor Minister Satyanarayan Jatiya said.
	   Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera warned of the dangers of
competitiveness and productivity becoming the only focus of
increasingly liberal markets.
	   Newly freed Indonesian labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan promised
support for other repressed activists.
	   ``Do not be afraid. Persevere,'' he told an ICFTU gathering.

Nigerian dissident: new military leader `more of the same'

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The succession of a new military leader to
power in Nigeria is ``not a step forward,'' exiled playwright and
dissident Wole Soyinka said Tuesday.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press in Jerusalem, where he
was lecturing at Hebrew University, Soyinka said the appointment of
Maj. Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar ``augurs very badly for Nigeria,''
because it means the military still believes it is in control of
the country's fate.
	   ``This is just more of the same thing _ it's just a change of
baton,'' he said.
	   Abubakar was named early Tuesday to succeed Gen. Sani Abacha,
who died Monday of a heart attack.
	   Soyinka said he knew little about Abubakar himself, but said he
was not hearing any encouraging signs.
	   ``I'm willing to give Abubakar a couple of days to listen to
what he actually has to say,'' he said. ``But I want to say from
the outset _ and I speak for the majority of the Nigerian people _
that they're sick and tired of the military continuing to believe
that they have the right to succeed.
	   Soyinka, the winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature,
repeated his call for the international community to put pressure
on Nigeria, and urged World Cup spectators to show disapproval of
the Nigerian regime _ by booing the Nigerian flag, for example.
	   If Abubakar tries to continue in Abacha's path, he said, it
spells disaster for Nigeria.
	   ``I'm afraid that if the military does not bow to the will of
the people, armed insurrection becomes inevitable,'' he said. ``The
signs of it are already there.''
	   ``If any future Nigerian leader acts in any manner that can be
held remotely parallel to Abacha's depravity, I swear to you, that
is the end of Nigeria,'' he added, speaking slowly and emphasizing
each word. ``The nation will not hold.''
	   Asked if he had a message for the Nigerian people, Soyinka, who
fled his country in 1994, said: ``Don't let down your guard. The
battle isn't over yet.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Shares in the Belgian steelmaker
Cockerill Sambre SA rose sharply Tuesday on reports that Germany's
Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG was considering a takeover.
	   Newspapers in Germany and Belgium reported Thyssen Krupp was
mulling a takeover bid for Cockerill, whose main shareholder is the
government of Belgium's southern Wallonia region.
	   Cockerill spokesman Christophe Weerts confirmed talks had taken
place on a possible alliance with Thyssen Krupp, Europe's largest
steel producer. But he declined to say whether Cockerill would
accept a takeover bid.
	   Weerts said Cockerill, which has been seeking a partner for
years, had also held alliance talks with other steelmakers.
	   Other companies that have been considered potential partners of
Cockerill are Arbed SA of Luxembourg, Usinor SA of France,
Hoogovens NV of the Netherlands and British Steel PLC.
	   Cockerill shares rose 10.6 percent to finish at 241 francs (dlrs
6.57) in trading on the Brussels stock exchange Tuesday.

Russian Orthodox patriarch will not participate in czar's burial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church will not
participate in the burial ceremony for the country's last czar, the
church's Holy Synod ruled Tuesday.
	   The church has been skeptical about next month's ceremony,
saying that some believers still have doubts about the identity of
bones recovered from a pit in the Ural Mountains city of
Yekaterinburg in 1991.
	   The Synod's decision, reported by the Interfax news agency,
means it will be up to local church officials in St. Petersburg to
determine who will officiate at the burial in the Peter and Paul
Fortress.
	   Russian media have said that President Boris Yeltsin will not
take part unless Patriarch Alexy II does.
	   The nine skeletons recovered in Yekaterinburg have been examined
by genetics labs in Russia, Britain and the United States and
identified as those of Czar Nicholas II, his wife, three children
and four servants.
	   After six years of deliberations, a government commission
declared the remains authentic earlier this year and scheduled a
funeral for July 17, the 80th anniversary of the family's execution
by a Bolshevik firing squad. Hundreds of foreign representatives,
including many royals, have been invited to attend.
	   The ceremony will be held in the Peter and Paul Cathedral, the
traditional burial site of the Romanovs, who ruled Russia for 300
years and were related through intermarriage to many other royal
families in Europe.
	   The church has started proceedings to consider sainthood for the
royal family, which would make their bones holy relics.
	   The church has previously suggested that the bones, still held
in a police morgue, be interred in a temporary tomb until all
doubts about their identity have been removed.

still believes it is in control of the country's fate.
	   ``This is just more of the same thing _ it's just a change of

	   Abubakar was sworn in Tuesday as Nigeria's head of state one day
after Gen. Sani Abacha died of a heart attack. Abacha, 54, ruled
Nigeria for five years with an iron fist. In the final months of
his life, he appeared to be moving away from his pledge to hand
power over to an elected civilian government.
	   Soyinka said he knew little about Abubakar himself, but said he

 &UR; Amnesty urges Kenyan government to end spiral of violence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Amnesty International urged President
Daniel arap Moi's government Wednesday to end a spiral of violence
in Kenya and to prosecute its perpetrators.
	   The London-based human rights organization said in a report that
more than 120 people have been killed, thousands displaced and
hundreds of homes destroyed in Moi's own Rift Valley province since
the violence erupted early this year.
	   The violence mostly pitted Moi's Kalenjin group against the
Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. It came on the heels of December
general elections in which Moi, 74, who had governed Kenya for 19
years, won his fifth and, constitutionally, his last five-year
term.
	   Moi draws most of his support from the Kalenjin, while the
Kikuyu generally support the opposition.
	   The violence is similar to clashes before and after the 1992
general elections in which an estimated 1,500 people were killed
and hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   The report said the government's failure to act to stem the
violence forced citizens to defend themselves this time.
	   ``For the first time, members of the Kikuyu community retaliated
to the attacks in an organized fashion, following the failure of
security forces to act,'' the report said.
	   It urged the international community to increase pressure on
Moi's government to honor its national and international legal
obligations on human rights.
	   The report also urged Kenyan leaders to refrain from making
inflammatory statements that incite tribes against each other.
	   This was an apparent reference to violence among Kelenjin
sub-tribes in northwestern Kenya. They have clashed in recent weeks
after a local member of parliament urged his Pokot people to defend
their rights against the Marakwet.
	   Kenyan politicians, including members of Moi's ruling Kenya
African National Union party, human rights groups and the Law
Society of Kenya have urged the government to prosecute Francis
Lotodo, a Cabinet minister, for inciting the Pokots against the
Marakwet.
	   Since politically motivated ethnic violence erupted last August
at the Indian Ocean coast _ the heart of Kenya's tourist trade _
there have been ethnic clashes in various parts of the country.
	   The violence is blamed for the downward spiral in the tourism
industry, which had been the single most important source of
foreign currency earnins for the East African nation.
	   Government officials could not be reached for comment on the
report. But in the past, they have dismissed Amnesty's criticism as
interference in Kenya's internal affairs.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Mon. - Identifying new sources of revenue to
strengthen the State's financial position is the priority of newly
appointed Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Osu
Sukam.
	   Osu said although the State Government had sufficient funds to
implement projects under the 1998 State Budget, there was a need
further improve its finances.
	   ``I have directed officers in the Finance Ministry to look for
new sources of revenue to boost the State's financial position,''
he told a Press conference at the Finance Ministry today.
	   Earlier, Osu was sworn in as a member of the State Cabinet
before Yang di-Pertua Negeri Tun Sakaran Dandai at Istana Negeri,
witnessed by High Court Judge Datuk Charles Ho.
	   Also present were Sakaran's wife Toh Puan Rukaiyah Datuk
Panglima Abdullah, Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Dompok, State
Assembly Speaker Datuk Hassan Alban Sandukong and State Cabinet
ministers.
	   Osu, 49, replaced Datuk Abdul Ghapur Salleh, who declined to be
re- appointed.
	   Later, Osu was briefed by the ministry's permanent secretary
Datuk S.
	   Abdillah Hassan and other senior officers of the ministry about
the State's financial position.
	   ``I am confident that despite the current economic downturn we
will still be able to meet the aspirations of the people,'' he
said.
	   He also said the listing of the Sabah Land Development Board on
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, which is expected to bring a
revenue of RM500 million to the State, would take place this year.
	   Osu, who resigned as Federal Minister of Land and Co-operative
Development to take up the State posting, said one way to enhance
State revenue was to improve the collection of water bills.
	   ``We may have to introduce a new mechanism to improve the
collection of water bills.''
	   He also said priority would be given to the implementation of
rural development projects.

	   WHEN Asian currencies came under speculative attack in the
middle of last year, many western leaders joined the critics and
commentators in blaming the economies of these countries.
	   They faulted these economies for everything from overheating to
weak fundamentals, corruption, nepotism and cronyism.
	   Asian leaders who tried to defend their economies were
criticised for promoting economic nationalism. Those who blamed the
likes of currency trader George Soros for the problem were
dismissed as being anti-market.
	   Everyone, from International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus to fund managers and stock analysts, prescribed
high interest rates and tight liquidity as the ``Viagra'' of
economic salvation.
	   Yet when the Australian dollar fell to its 12-year low last week
(under US$0.60 to A$1), Australia's Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Trade Tim Fischer blamed ``evil economic forces'' for
undermining confidence in his country's economy.
	   ``I think it's a sharp reminder that there are forces, evil
economic forces abounding at this time,'' he said.
	   Over in Britain, The Guardian newspaper reported on June 5 that
the Bank of England was under heavy fire from a coalition of
unions, business, the City and opposition politicians after its
surprise decision to push up interest rates was condemned as
risking turning the economic slowdown into full-scale recession.
	   The newspaper said: ``In what was almost universally attacked as
an interest rate rise too far, the bank was accused of ignoring the
plight of hard-pressed British manufacturing after sanctioning the
sixth increase in the cost of borrowing since last year's general
election.''
	   The interest rates hike is seen as a clear defeat for the bank's
governor, Eddie George, who has been holding out against the
monetary policy committee's interest rate hawks.
	   Given this and other established facts, it is very difficult to
give some central bankers very high marks for economic management.
Or maybe it is too much to expect them to be concerned with broad
economic management when their principal role is monetary
management.
	   But the issue of credibility is not exclusive to central
bankers.
	   Commercial bankers too are under scrutiny not only in Malaysia
but worldwide as the effects of the Asian economic crisis
reverberate across the globe.
	   If a report in the Financial Times on emerging markets is any
indication, bankers can be as fickle and irresponsible as ordinary
people when it comes to spending money.
	   The newspaper noted: ``A year ago every bank in the world seemed
to be moving into emerging markets. Analysts were watching
currencies as unlikely as the Kenyan shilling. The Philippine peso
was almost mainstream.''
	   It went on to say: ``Then the Asian crisis broke, and the
currency market was famous for six months, not only did banks make
billions from the crisis but they were largely responsible for
creating it.''
	   Yet when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad blamed
currency traders for the sudden and debilitating depreciation of
regional currencies, he was accused of paranoia.
	   The British newspaper adds: ``Indonesia, Thailand and even South
Korea were, admittedly, living dangerously. They had growing
foreign debts and their trade balances were mostly in deficit, but
trouble arrived only when the currency markets took notice of the
Thai devaluation in June.
	   ``Currency analysts, who a week earlier barely knew what the
Korean currency was called, were suddenly expatiating on the
beliefs of rival politicians.
	   ``The analysts also spotted a looming problem for Asian
countries because debts were mostly payable in dollars, they might
have to default if their currencies fell sharply.''
	   Suddenly, said the Financial Times, everyone was talking about
defaults and ``banks attacked Asian currencies almost
indiscriminately.''
	   While the banking system is portrayed by some as the saviour of
the economy and should, at all costs, be protected, the banks
collectively were responsible for precipitating the crisis. Their
incompetence was obvious.
	   The Financial Times noted: ``Not one bank had predicted the
Asian crisis and almost everyone agrees that the victim currencies
fell much further than their economic fundamentals warranted.''
	   And yet Dr Mahathir was accused of being anti-market when he
called for global regulation of currency trading. His argument that
no currency was safe from speculative attacks was dismissed.
	   In a recent talk in Japan he spoke of a world colonised by ``new
capitalists'' who must certainly count among them currency traders.
	   The Financial Times report said with Asia quieter, currency
traders had been looking hard for other emerging markets.
	   ``This has been tricky. Brazilian, Argentine and Mexican stocks
and bonds are heavily traded, but most of these countries'
currencies are pegged and docile. This means that the emerging
markets desks (of banks) have recently thrown themselves into the
Polish zloty and Czech koruna.''
	   The time will come, according to the report, when the currency
traders decide that the zloty and the koruna have risen too far and
attack them (like they did the Asian currencies).
	   For those of us who are looking up to the IMF for answers, the
Indonesian debacle should have jolted us into realising that it
does not have the answers.
	   J. Malcolm Dowling, an associate professor of economics at the
University of Melbourne, Australia, and a former assistant chief
economist at the Asian Development Bank, writing in the Far Eastern
Economic Review magazine said: ``What can President B.J. Habibie's
government do to stop the economic decline and put Indonesia back
on track to positive growth? First, it must recognise that the
macroeconomic programme that the IMF has imposed is not working.''
	   In fact, said Dowling, the IMF was instrumental in helping to
erode investor confidence (in Indonesia) in the first place by
forcing the closure of banks, and its tight monetary and fiscal
policies exacerbated the decline in consumer confidence and
aggregate demand.
	   Maybe, we too have been listening too much to the IMF and
dressing up to its liking at the expense of long-term interests. We
should start listening to our hearts. The learning process is over.
It's time to act ... and with one voice decisively.

Moldova makes prostitution a crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Parliament passed a law Tuesday making
prostitution a crime in Moldova and prohibiting advertisements for
what has become a growing problem in the former Soviet republic.
	   People convicted of prostitution will face three to seven years
in prison or a fine of 3,000 lei (almost dlrs 630) under the new
law.
	   Lawmaker Alexandru Muravschi said growing poverty in Moldova is
driving women to sell their bodies for as little as a bottle of
alcohol or a chocolate bar. Until now, prostitution has not been a
crime in the country.
	   Muravschi said it will be difficult to enforce the law. He noted
that some newspaper and television ads do not specifically offer
prostitutes, but promote massage parlors where prostitutes work.
	   Advertisers who violate the law will also be subject to prison
terms of three to seven years.

	   MERSING, Mon. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
said the Government would continue to step up efforts to restore
confidence in the economy among local and foreign investors.
	   He said this would include providing more funds - not to protect
the interests of only selected companies or certain individuals -
but to be mobilised in a manner that benefited everyone, including
the low-income group.
	   He also said that while Malaysia was clamouring for reforms and
greater transparency of the international financial system, the
country should at the same time overcome its domestic weaknesses
and avoid the pitfalls experienced by others which had to resort to
the International Monetary Fund.
	   He said this when opening the third Johor Umno Convention at the
Sibu Island Resort on Sibu island, off Mersing.
	   Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, noted that not all of the
country's financial institutions were being responsible, saying
that some had given out loans at too fast a rate, including to
non-productive sectors like property.
	   There were also others which had ceased disbursing loans and did
not do enough for the Bumiputera lot.
	   ``It does not mean that we protect the attitude of financial
instutions... I protect transparency but there should be no
political inteference in the giving of loans,'' he added.
``Secondly, we must take steps to restore the confidence of local
and foreign investors (in our economy).''
	   He said if it was necessary to ensure the financial institutions
were strong, the Government would ensure just that although it
might mean causing difficulties to some parties.
	   He added that not only the big businesses were facing problems
but the rural people had also not been spared because of rising
prices, for example.
	   Anwar said while calling for transparency and reforms of the
international financial system, the country should also check its
domestic weaknesses, including corporate governance.
	   He said the country should not deny the fact that it was facing
economic problems. These problems, he said, were caused by external
factors as well as a number of weaknesses within.
	   He said if the country did not accept that domestic weaknesses
also needed to be corrected, ``we will invite an even bigger
catastrophe''.
	   Anwar also said he did not stop companies from restructuring but
if such an exercise was meant to safeguard the interests of a few,
then the companies would bring more problems to the economy.
	   ``Also, we should take steps to contain inflation and stabilise
the ringgit.''
	   Anwar said the economic system in the country should defend the
good policies, so as not to deviate from the principle of justice
to be fair to all, including the rural poor.
	   On Umno, he said the party must be prepared to demand that
weaknesses in the domestic financial and other systems be overcome.
	   In this context, he said transparency, fair distribution of
wealth and the spirit of musyawarah (consultation) were consistent
with the party's struggles.
	   Thus, he said, if within Umno, democracy and the spirit of
consensus were neglected, if transparency did not exist,
opportunities were monopolised (by certain individuals) and bribery
left rampant, then the party's very existence would be questioned.

Study condemns China, Colombia for union repression
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., Indian comment on child labor. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Colombia and China were singled out for criticism
over abuses of labor union rights in a report published Tuesday to
coincide with a United Nations labor conference.
	   Worldwide, 299 activists were murdered last year, the 142-page
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions report said.
	   Highlighting 156 killings of union leaders and members in
Colombia, the report complained ``the violence was rarely if ever
investigated.''
	   Although paramilitary organizations were mostly to blame,
``union activists continue to be stigmatized as enemies of the
state,'' it said.
	   It said hundreds of unionists had to leave their homes because
of death threats.
	   Deregulation of Colombian labor laws has made it ``impossible in
practice for many workers to belong to unions and to be covered by
collective agreements,'' its said.
	   In China, ``the unions in foreign-owned and joint venture
companies are largely symbolic,'' according to the Brussels-based
ICFTU, the world's biggest umbrella organization of labor unions.
	   Such unions are controlled either by the Communist Party or
plant management, its report said.
	   The report also criticized U.S. labor law for ``double standards
with respect to the rights of employers and of workers,'' claiming
that at least 1 in 10 activists campaigning to form a union is
illegally fired.
	   This year's International Labor Organization conference is
working on a declaration committing countries to work toward
collective bargaining and the elimination of forced labor.
	   It is also considering a new world convention aimed at
abolishing the most extreme forms of child labor.
	   U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman told delegates she had come
``with clear instructions ... to underline the United States'
strong support for the negotiation'' of that convention.
	   India was ``happy to note'' consideration of the new convention
and its ``sequential and gradual'' approach to the child labor
problem, Indian Labor Minister Satyanarayan Jatiya said.
	   Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera warned of the dangers of
competitiveness and productivity becoming the only focus of
increasingly liberal markets.
	   Newly freed Indonesian labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan promised
support for other repressed activists.
	   ``Do not be afraid. Persevere,'' he told an ICFTU gathering.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Umno secretary-general Datuk Sabbaruddin
Chik said only two resolutions will be tabled at this year's Umno
general assembly which begins on June 18.
	   He said these were the debate on the presidential address and
the economy.
	   In the past, among the resolutions tabled were on religion,
education and the economy.
	   He said the move was to allow the delegates to have more time
for debate. ``Each delegate will also be given five minutes extra
during debating time,'' he said adding that delegates will also be
allowed to touch on religious and educational issues during debate.
	   Previously, delegates were given 10 minutes each to debate. Many
had complained that this was insufficent.
	   Sabbaruddin was speaking to reporters after briefing all Umno
state liaison and divisional secretaries and information heads on
the coming general assembly at the Putra World Trade Centre.
	   He said a total of 1,910 delegates, including permanent
chairman, deputy permanent chairman and the Supreme Council
members, would be attending the assembly.

	   KLANG, Mon. - Selangor DAP chairman Chua Kow Eng today urged the
party's leadership to stop hurling accusations against its national
vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim, treasurer Fung Ket Wing and national
publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong but instead grant them a ``fair
hearing'' and allow them to defend themselves. He said it was not
right for the party's Central Executive Committee to accuse,
suspend and remove the three senior leaders without first asking
them to explain and defend themselves of any charge of wrongdoings.
	   ``I am shocked and very unhappy with the decision taken by the
CEC.
	   ``Surely there are avenues within the party for criticism.
	   ``I believe that free flow of criticism within the party must
not only be allowed but encouraged so that we can improve to become
a stronger and better party,'' he said adding that any organisation
needed members and leaders who dared to criticise so that it would
know whether its policy or decision was right or wrong.
	   Chua said the recent development had forced him to speak out on
the matter as he felt that he could no longer keep quiet while
accusations were publicly hurled by the party's top leadership
against the three daily when they were not given the privilege to
defend themselves.
	   He said the party's CEC had cited vague reasons in suspending
Liew and Fung and removing Wee from his post without explaining the
real cause of the actions against them.
	   This, he said, has caused confusion among grass roots members
and many have expressed their displeasure at the way the matter was
handled and the decision taken by the party's CEC.
	   The party's leadership, he said, was accountable to members and
must explain how a two-hour meeting convened by the trio, which was
cited by the CEC as the reason for their suspension and removal
last Thursday, could have caused a havoc within the party that such
drastic action had to be taken.

U.N. human rights chief ``deeply disturbed'' by Kosovo violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ United Nations human rights chief Mary Robinson
urged warring Serbs and ethnic Albanian separatists on Tuesday to
``curb the spiral of violence'' in the troubled Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
	   As the United States and other Western powers consider using
military means to try to stop the fighting, Robinson said in a
statement issued from U.N. European headquarters in Geneva that the
violence was ``deeply disturbing.''
	   She said her staff in the region were reporting a ``grave and
worsening human rights and humanitarian situation.''
	   There were no immediate reports of new clashes Tuesday between
the Serbs and Albanian militants fighting for Kosovo's independence
from Serbia.
	   More than 250 people have died this year in fighting between
government forces and pro-independence Albanian guerrillas, known
as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Robinson said reports of human rights violations, including
arbitrary arrests and abductions, were increasing daily.
	   The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights received
reports of arbitrary killings, shelling of villages by police and
attacks on the military and police by armed Albanian groups.
	   ``I am concerned this violence is taking place in a region where
approximately 47 percent of the population is under the age of
18,'' Robinson said.
	   She expressed concern the Serb authorities had not answered her
office's inquiries about the fate or whereabouts of people
allegedly held by Serb police, or about police officers themselves
reported as abducted.
	   ``Free and unimpeded access to information is essential'' to
address the causes and consequences of the human rights crisis,
Robinson said.
	   On Monday, the United States said it hadn't ruled out military
options to stop the violence.
	   Earlier Tuesday, U.N. children's agency spokesman Patrick
McCormick said UNICEF didn't advocate a military intervention. But
it favored peacekeeping operations or ``anything that will keep two
sides apart and save the lives of civilians, especially children
and women,'' he said.
	   The U.N. refugee agency supports ``vigorous action'' to stop the
fighting, said UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin. ``Our hope would be
that any intervention would serve to stabilize the situation so
that civilians don't move.''
	   UNHCR staff are traveling to eastern Albania on Tuesday to check
unconfirmed reports of arrivals of refugees.
	   ``If true it would signal a shift in the refugee flow and
possibly a consequent shift in the fighting in Kosovo,'' Kumin
said.
	   UNHCR says information from various sources suggests more than
60,000 people are displaced in Kosovo, Montenegro and Albania.
	   NATO will transport humanitarian aid from UNHCR's depots in
Bosnia towards Tirana and then by shuttle operation to the north
using helicopters or small planes on Wednesday, she said.

	   PETALING JAYA, Mon. - DAP secretary-general Lim Kit Siang's
offer to the three suspended DAP leaders to return to party's
mainstream on the condition that they admit to their wrongdoings
has been spurned.
	   Suspended national vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim said Lim had in his
speech in Bagan, Penang, and reported in the vernacular newspapers
that he would ``re-admit'' them if they confessed that they had
been responsible for causing disunity and harmony in the party.
	   Speaking at a joint Press conference at a hotel here, he said:
``Wee Choo Keong, who has been removed as national publicity
secretary and suspended national treasurer Fung Ket Wing and myself
maintain our innocence and will not accept Lim's condition to
return to the party''.
	   He added that to accept Lim's condition would tantamount to an
admission of guilt.
	   Instead the three gave a four-point reply to Lim: Whether Lim
and other party leaders were aware of their actions in removing and
suspending us would cause serious damage to the party's image; The
party does not belong to an individual or a small group of people
but to all party members; Our preparedness to contribute to
``real'' collective leadership; and A preparedness by the party
leaders to have reforms that will create unity, new hope, dream and
environment for members.
	   He added that they could not return to the party if the serious
allegations against them could not be cleared.

Talks reportedly on track to avert South African teachers strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Government negotiators and a
teachers union appeared headed for a settlement Tuesday aimed at
averting a nationwide strike.
	   The negotiators said they were to compile a draft agreement,
indicating a breakthrough had been achieved. The draft would then
be formally tabled at a meeting of the full negotiating teams, and
the parties would then consult further.
	   Tuesday marked a work slowdown, with some teachers leaving
classrooms early. It was to have escalated into a full strike by
the three teachers unions, though the timing had not been set. The
unions threatened the strike over new regulations they claim will
result in layoffs of thousands of teachers.
	   Meeting on Tuesday, the second straight day of talks, were
officials from the government and from the South African Democratic
Teachers' Union, the biggest labor group with more than 170,000
members.
	   The smaller National Professional Teachers Organization and the
South African teachers Union had also served notice they planned to
strike.
	   The unions say new regulations could result in at least 50,000
teachers losing their jobs and an increase in student-teacher
ratios. The unions want the regulations rescinded.

Yeltsin says he'll try to resolve Serbia's Kosovo crisis

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin vowed
Tuesday to use his influence with Balkan ally Slobodan Milosevic to
end Yugoslav attacks in Kosovo, but remained firmly opposed to any
Western military intervention.
	   Yeltsin said he'd try to meet the Yugoslav leader in person, and
made clear he prefers friendly diplomacy over any military threats
or economic sanctions to resolve the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``The more softly I speak the better the chances of a meeting,''
Yeltsin said at a news conference following two days of
broad-ranging talks with German officials. ``We will meet and
discuss the question of how to get out of this situation without
getting into a big war.''
	   Germany had sought to get Russia behind the Western efforts to
get Milosevic to talk peace with the Albanians by boosting the NATO
presence in the region and imposing an investment ban on
Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. NATO officials in Brussels
said on Tuesday they were even considering direct military
intervention.
	   But Russia, still smarting from NATO's expansion into its former
sphere of influence in eastern Europe, has been reluctant to
support heavy-handed measures there.
	   Before leaving Bonn, Yeltsin said any military deployment in
Kosovo would be ``very dangerous'' and could spark a wider Balkan
conflict.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was pleased that Yeltsin was
willing to ``use his big influence in Belgrade so that the
bloodshed ends as quickly as possible.''
	   But the Germans secured no Russian pledges to join NATO efforts
or sign on to the European Union's investment ban, announced
Monday.
	   The two-day talks with Yeltsin and a delegation of ministers
were the first in a series of periodic German-Russian consultations
agreed to by Yeltsin and Kohl last year in an effort to ease
Russian concerns over NATO expansion.
	   Another focus of the discussions was Russia's market collapse
and fiscal crisis last month following an oil-price drop.
	   The crisis had raised speculation that Germany, Russia's most
important trading partner outside the former Soviet Union, might
offer financial assistance. But the leaders announced no new aid.
	   Kohl said Germany was satisfied with Russian measures taken so
far to deal with the crisis.
	   Yeltsin, who has announced a vigorous new tax collection
program, said it was important to have Kohl's ``personal support''
while his country negotiates loans with the International Monetary
Fund.
	   ``On this basis, international investors won't leave our
country,'' he added.

	   SHARE prices rose 0.2 per cent on future-led buying yesterday
despite concerns over renewed regional currency weakness triggered
by the yen's fall, dealers said.
	   ``Obviously, it's related to future-led buying, a lot has to do
with HSBC shares,'' which investors believed had fallen to
attractively low levels, said Eugene Law, research head at Lippo
Securities.
	   ``The market is still short of momentum, because of the regional
currency weakness,'' said Law. The key Hang Seng index gained 17.16
points to close at 8,586.63, after a 4.1 per cent loss in the
previous week's trade.
	   The value of turnover amounted to HK$4.548 billion, up from
Friday's HK$3.47 billion.
	   The market opened on a strong note with the key barometer
gaining 11.84 points by the end of the morning session.
	   Dealers said regional currency weakness triggered by the yen's
fall through the psychologically important 140 level against the
dollar- dominated trading in morning session with the index falling
below the 8,500 point level at one stage.

Turkic-speaking countries meet in new Kazak capital

<TEXT>
	   ASTANA, Kazakstan (AP) _ Leaders of six Turkic-speaking
countries expressed concern Tuesday about India and Pakistan's
nuclear capability and urged them to sign the Non-Proliferation
Treaty immediately.
	   ``We are very much concerned with peace in the region'' said
Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev, noting that ``we live in the
same region.''
	   The six Turkic-speaking countries _ the Central Asian nations of
Kazakstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as
Azerbaijan and Turkey _ have been meeting annually since 1992.
	   This year's meeting coincides with celebrations formally
designating Astana the new capital of Kazakstan.
	   Leaders of the six countries also discussed the rise of Islamic
fundamentalism in some of the former Soviet republics.
	   ``We cannot allow the myth of spread that an ideological vacuum
has emerged in Central Asia in the wake of the Soviet Union's
disintegration and that Islamic or other undemocratic states can
appear in the region,'' said Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
	   Karimov and other leaders expressed special concern about the
Wahhabis, a fundamentalist sect that has been blamed for recent
violence in southern Russia and Central Asia.
	   Seven men who were said to be Wahhabis were recently found
guilty of stirring unrest in eastern Uzbekistan. Karimov has
accused Wahhabis of killing officials and destroying
food-processing plants, water reservoirs, power stations and other
strategic sites.
	   ``The fight against Wahhabism, as one of the most reactionary
movements of Islam, does not mean Uzbekistan is prosecuting Islam,
the religion'' said Karimov. ``We are not rejecting the religion of
our forefathers and fathers.''
	   Uzbekistan has enacted a new law on religions that appears
directed at the Wahhabis, who Karimov says are intent on replacing
him with an Islamic government.
	   Nazarbayev, the Kazak leader, also acknowledged the existence of
a problem and said that it should not be ignored.
	   Nazarbayev has chosen Astana _ formerly known as Akmola _ to be
the new capital of his country of 17 million, replacing Almaty,
1,125 kilometers (700 miles) away.
	   The official reasons for relocating are that Almaty is
overcrowded, too close to the Chinese border and prone to
earthquakes. One of the unofficial reasons is that Nazarbayev wants
to counter separatist tendencies in Kazakstan's north, which is
populated mostly by ethnic Russians.
	   The next Turkic summit is scheduled to be held next year in
Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek failed Tuesday
to get the president to lift his threat to veto government plans
for consolidating the country's provinces as part of an
administrative reform.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski and Buzek declined to comment
after their 90-minute meeting, but presidential adviser Ryszard
Kalisz said afterwards that no agreement had been reached.
	   Following heated debates in parliament and protests across
Poland, the government revised its original plan of turning the 49
provinces into 12 big ones, adding three more provinces to make 15.
Residents of cities that would lose their status as provincial
capitals had protested because they fear losing prestige and
government funding.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski's aides have indicated he
supports the idea of creating 17 provinces and would veto any other
solution.
	   Kwasniewski seems to have joined forces with his former
ex-communist colleagues, who form the leftist opposition bloc in
parliament.
	   The leftists argue that a return to the 17 provinces that
functioned in Poland until 1975 is natural. They say the government
has failed to win public approval for the reform, which would do
away with the communist-era administration by transferring power to
municipalities. The plan would take effect Jan. 1.
	   Leaders of the rightist government coalition argue Poland needs
big and strong provinces and thus increasing the number only
weakens the plan.
	   The Solidarity-dominated Senate is meeting June 18 and is
expected to support the government plan.
	   Buzek said before his meeting with Kwasniewski that he was
surprised by the president's position because he ``has repeatedly
said during our previous conversations that any solution between 12
and 17 provinces is acceptable to him.''
	   Poles also are divided over the government reform. A survey by
the state-run CBOS agency in mid-April showed that only 24 percent
of Poles approve of consolidating the country's 49 provinces into
12 new ones. Some 29 percent preferred 17 provinces, and 27 percent
wanted to see the present 49 provinces remain.
	   The poll had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.

Friends and fans to honor Linda McCartney in New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A day after an emotional memorial service for
Linda McCartney in London in which 700 guests sang the Beatles song
``Let It Be,'' Paul McCartney announced Tuesday that a second
service would be held later this month in New York City.
	   The former Beatle said he and the couple's children would attend
the June 22 service, at New York's Riverside Church.
	   The entire McCartney family has been surprised and touched by
the outpouring of support from fans and fellow animal lovers over
the past few weeks, he said in a statement. Mrs. McCartney was a
staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism.
	   After the service in London, at St. Martins-in-the-Fields
Church, McCartney thanked the hundreds who paid tribute to his
wife's memory, saying, `The kids and I thank them all for coming.
Although Linda's not here, she's in our hearts and her spirit and
her message will live on forever.''

	   Sunday's violent gun battle between soldiers and rebels, which
killed 11, wounded five and led to 21 arrests, revealed the
possible existence of yet another armed rebel group in the Pacific
Coast state of Guerrero, authorities report.
	   Officials say the bloody gunfight broke up a meeting the EPR
(People's Revolutionary Army) was having with the People's
Revolutionary Indigenous Army (EPRI), Spanish news agency EFE
reported.
	   The Guerrero prosecutor's office said it had confiscated
documents in El Charco, a colonia in the town of Ayutla where the
battle was played out, that point to a meeting between the EPR and
the People's Revolutionary Indigenous Army (EPRI).
	   The EPR rose up on June 28, 1996, in Guerrero, but to date
nothing is known about the EPRI, which is mysterious even to the
Center of Historic Investigations of Armed Movements (CIHMA), the
think-tank that in December reported 14 guerrilla groups were
operating in Mexico.
	   On Sunday, Army soldiers fought for six hours against EPR rebels
in El Charco.
	   Official figures report 11 soldiers died in the battle, five
civilians were injured and 21 were arrested. Following the battle
the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) mayor and city council
of the mainly Mixtec town of Ayutla blasted the Mexican Army for
not allowing Mayor Odilon Ramirez from entering El Charco, French
news agency AFP reported.
	   Arnulfo Meza, a Mixtec Indian campesino , told state officials
50 miles away in Chilpancingo the Army was throwing grenades and
rockets at the town's primary school.
	   El Charco Police Commissioner Panfilo Santiago Hernandez, who
fled Ayutla with 20 other Mixtec Indians early Sunday morning, said
that since Saturday ``there was a meeting of some people in the
primary school and when I was going out of the town in the dawn
Sunday I heard gunfire.''
	   The PRD municipal committee of Ayutla said that ``for the full
clarification of the acts and of the help of communities where the
actions occurred, the Army should permit access to our municipal
authorities, of the representatives of civil organizations and of
the defense of human rights.''
	   Federal senators lamented Sunday's gun battle and condemned the
ultra-left-wing EPR as a threat to national security.
	   In an interview with official news agency Notimex, Sen.
Guadalupe Gomez Maganda said lawlessness in that area of Guerrero
requires a military presence.
	   Fellow Guerrero senator, Porfirio Camareno Castro, opined that
the clandestine nature of the armed EPR demands a permanent
military presence in the region.
	   ``It is necessary that this vigilance is continued,'' said
Camarena.
	   Official figures say that since Aug. 28, 38 people, including
Sunday's 11, have been killed.

German railway restores service through scene of rail disaster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with search for remains ended, rail line
reopened; death toll lowered to 95 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rescue workers ended their search for remains
Tuesday at the site of last week's high-speed train disaster, and
the German railway reopened the Hamburg-Hanover line to rail
traffic.
	   Illustrating just how gruesome the crash was, officials lowered
the death toll for a second time _ from 98 to 95 _ as forensic
experts continue to put body parts together to identify the dead.
	   Police spokesman Joachim Lindenberg said workers sifting through
the last bit of sand found a women's watch and small pieces of
flesh before the site was turned over to the railway Tuesday
afternoon.
	   ``Everything has been scoured that's there to be scoured,'' he
said.
	   An hour later, a regional train from Hamburg passed through at
70 kph (44 mph) _ a third the speed of the InterCity Express that
derailed June 3 and slammed into a concrete bridge, crumpling the
cars like tin cans.
	   The severity of the disaster has made it difficult for officials
to determine exactly how many people died. They now believe 90
people died at the scene; five died in hospitals.
	   All but one of the 95 victims had been identified, police said.
	   Meanwhile, the German national railway said it was investigating
a newspaper report that it had rejected an internal proposal in
1995 for an electronic monitoring system of the wheels on express
trains.
	   Authorities believe a broken wheel caused the wreck in the
northern village of Eschede, although they have yet to determine
what caused it to break.
	   The mass-market Bild newspaper said the railway rejected the
electronic monitors then as impractical and unreliable.
	   Railway chairman Johannes Ludewig told a news conference in
Frankfurt he could not comment before the railway conducts its own
review.
	   Twelve of the 59 original model express trains pulled out of
service for safety checks after the crash were back in service on
Tuesday. Rail officials said so far no defects have been found.

Pro-Moscow lawmaker beaten in Ukraine's Crimea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ethnic Russian leaders in Ukraine's restive
Crimean peninsula accused political foes Tuesday of beating a
regional lawmaker to punish him for an ``openly pro-Russia
stance.''
	   Legislator Oleg Rodivilov was beaten Monday night by
unidentified people at the entrance to his home in the Crimean town
of Yevpatoriya, police said.
	   Crimea's Russian community said in a statement that Rodivilov
was attacked because of his ``openly pro-Russia stance, honest
political activities'' and relentless fight against crime, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Crimea, populated mostly by ethnic Russians, has been part of
Ukraine since Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to the
then-Soviet republic in 1954. It became part of independent Ukraine
in 1991, but many ethnic Russians in the region want it returned to
Kremlin rule.
	   Olexander Dombrovsky, spokesman for the Ukrainian Interior
Ministry's Crimean branch, said it was ``too early to speak of
political motives'' in the attack, which could be criminal or
domestic in nature.

U.S. Bancorp plans dlrs2.5 billion stock repurchase

 &UR; Eds: Will UPDATE with closing stock price. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ U.S. Bancorp plans to repurchase up to
dlrs2.5 billion of its common stock.
	   The buyback amounts to about 62.5 million shares, or 8 percent
of the company's outstanding shares as of March 31, based on the
company's stock price Tuesday.
	   U.S. Bancorp said in a statement Tuesday it plans to complete
the buyout by March 31, 2000.
	   U.S. Bancorp shares rose 12 1/2 cents to dlrs40.12 1/2 in
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
	   Companies use share buybacks to tighten the supply of their
stock and increase earnings per share.
	   U.S. Bancorp was formed by the merger last year of
Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Portland, Oregon-based
U.S. Bancorp. The merged company has more than dlrs70 billion in
assets, making it the 15th-largest bank holding company in the
nation with more than 1,000 banking offices in 17 states.
	   U.S. Bancorp has about 742.5 million common shares outstanding.

American, other ambassadors resist Belarus eviction orders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts and UPDATES throughout with protests from France
and Germany. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador refused Tuesday to
vacate his official residence and other countries threatened to
recall their envoys from Belarus to protest orders evicting them
from a diplomatic compound.
	   The Foreign Ministry of the former Soviet republic expressed
regret for the ``inconvenience,'' but insisted the ambassadors and
their families must leave their homes in the 50-year-old housing
complex to permit urgent repairs.
	   ``These measures are unacceptable and inadmissible,'' French
Foreign Minister spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said in Paris.
``They are contrary to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
privileges and immunity.''
	   The United States, Russia, France, Germany and Lithuania have
formally protested the planned eviction. France and Lithuania said
they will recall their ambassadors for consultations if Belarus
persists.
	   The dispute began in April when the government served notice
that the 22 ambassadors would have to vacate their homes in the
Drodzy compound on the outskirts of Minsk by June 10.
	   Under international law, including the 1948 Vienna Convention,
ambassadors' residences are considered sovereign territory and
governments have no right to enter without permission or insist
that diplomats leave.
	   Belarus says that the complex's water supply is no longer safe
and the sewage system is polluting the environment. The Foreign
Ministry has offered the ambassadors apartments in downtown Minsk
or plots on which to build new residences.
	   But U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard said Monday that envoys
would prefer to make arrangements to remain in the complex during
the repairs, in part because the houses are frequently used for
diplomatic functions.
	   He noted that the government's decision appeared to have been
sudden, and that some embassies had signed new multi-year leases
the month before.
	   The diplomatic compound was built after World War II as dachas
for the Communist Party elite.
	   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the spacious homes
inside the walled complex have been the primary residences of
ambassadors from 22 countries. Most have extensive grounds and
reception facilities.
	   After discussing the dispute at a news conference Monday, the
U.S. ambassador returned home to find workers and a policeman
trying to weld shut the side gate. The workers left when Speckhard
protested.
	   The United States has had a lease on the ambassador's residence
since 1992, the year after Belarus gained independence with the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and it does not expire until 2001.
	   Speckhard called the dispute the most serious violation of the
Vienna Convention since the end of the Cold War.

	   The government absolutely supports freedom of expression and
freedom of the press, but reporters and editors should honor codes
of ethics, as well as respect ``private life, moral life and public
peace,'' Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa said.
	   ``The president of the Republic established the promise to
respect the free demonstration of ideas and the liberty to write
and to publish whatever material, as well as not to restrict in any
way the liberty of the press, whose limits are respect for private
life, moral life and public peace,'' Labastida said Monday at a
luncheon honoring a newspaper group's 47th annual Freedom of the
Press Day.
	   He added good journalism can help the country move forward as a
democracy.
	   ``Mexico is living new realities. Its democratic life is growing
stronger. New forces and energies are making the country more
dynamic,'' he said at the luncheon sponsored by the Mexican Daily
Newspapers Editors' Association (Aedirmex). Labastida said he was
filling in for President Ernesto Zedillo, who was in New York at
the U.N. anti-drug conference.
	   Labastida told the audience of reporters, editors and newspaper
executives the government is doing more than talking about ensuring
freedom of the press. Authorities, he said, are in the process of
selling off the country's government newsprint provider, known as
PIPSA, to allow fair market access to paper.
	   Critics, such as Luis Rubio, a columnist with a major Mexico
City daily, however, charge the government with hampering freedom
of the press. At a Friday award ceremony where he received a prize
from Zedillo, Rubio blasted what he called the bribing of reporters
by government officials desiring favorable coverage.
	   Rubio told Reuters news agency that ``in all countries there is
some degree of (bribery), perhaps not many at such a public and
absurd level as in Mexico'' and that ``the practices of bribery and
intimidation persist in many (government) agencies.''
	   Labastida added that new information technology, especially in
radio, television and on the Internet, has brought more Mexicans in
touch with news faster.
	   ``We count today with information media that are more
influential in society, which all across the country exercise,
without any federal government restriction, freedom of
expression,'' Labastida said at the conference held at the Hotel
Nikko in the Polanco neighborhood.
	   ``The new plurality, the different Mexican reality, also
dictates a new relation to the government. The state is not the
omnipresent actor that decides all.
	   ``This determines that in the media the government is one of
many political actors, which also has a right to express its
opinion and defend its points of view,'' he said.
	   But though Labastida generally championed freedom of the press,
the Interior Secretary urged newsgatherers to be mindful of
individual liberties.
	   ``A common goal is to put the liberties guaranteed by freedom of
expression and freedom of the press in line with individual
rights,'' Labastida said. Aedirmex member Rodrigo Villasana Lopez,
who is the editor in chief of The Herald of San Luis Potosi,
introduced Labastida and said newspaper people have an important
responsibility to society at-large. He said reporters and editors
also should be law-abiding members of society.
	   ``We are respectful of our laws. We have followed them for many
years.
	   ``We are not anarchists of the pen. We are journalists, and we
are Mexicans - proudly Mexicans,''
	   Villasana said.
	   He added the print media need to work together to improve Mexico
for future generations.
	   ``In few words, this is not the country we want for our children
or for the children of our children,'' he said. ``The country is at
risk. Let us not leave it behind.''

World Cup: Brazil, Scotland open century's final World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Aldair to play, 12th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. DENIS, France (AP) _ When Ronaldo taps the ball off the
center spot Wednesday, the biggest and richest World Cup in history
will begin. Brazilians, who have played in every Cup and won four
of them, know how special it is.
	   ``We must understand this moment,'' says Milan midfielder
Leonardo. ``I want to make history.''
	   Brazil and Scotland write the first chapter of the 1998 World
Cup when they meet at 1530 GMT at the Stade de France in St. Denis,
north of Paris.
	   Over the next 33 days, a record 32 national teams will compete
in the last World Cup of the century.
	   Defending champion Brazil is the solid favorite to beat
Scotland. The team has been ranked No. 1 in the world by FIFA since
1994 and is spearheaded by 21-year-old forward Ronaldo, twice voted
FIFA Player of the Year.
	   Scotland's first priority is to stop Brazil displaying its
renowned attacking prowess.
	   ``We have to lift ourselves to another level and show we can
compete against Brazil,'' said midfielder John Collins, who will
win his 50th cap Wednesday. ``We will need a superb performance
that night as well as in the other two games if we are to
progress.''
	   Brazil coach Mario Zagallo draws from a talent pool that is the
envy of his rivals. When 1994 World Cup hero Romario was ruled out
of the tournament last week with a calf injury, another star from
four years ago, Bebeto, moved into the spot.
	   Waiting in the wings are Fiorentina forward Edmundo and
20-year-old phenomenon Denilson of Spain's Real Betis.
	   Zagallo has changed the team's style from the defensive setup of
1994 to a freer-flowing game he calls ``art soccer.''
	   In midfield are virtuosos Giovanni and Rivaldo, teammates at
Spanish champion Barcelona. Still more firepower comes from speedy
wing backs Cafu and thunder-footed Roberto Carlos.
	   But Brazil's seemingly relentless march to the title recently
has faltered. A shaky defense and injuries _ center back Aldair was
only cleared to play late Tuesday _ could yet derail the Brazilian
express.
	   The team lost its last home game 1-0 to archrival Argentina, and
warmup games against Spain's Atletico Bilbao and tiny Andorra
weren't much use to test the Brazilians.
	   Team coordinator Zico, a veteran of three Cups, wants to lower
expectations.
	   ``We won't be 100 percent in the first game, but we'll pick up
steam as we go,'' he said. ``A tie won't be the end of the world.''
	   Scotland has faced Brazil three times in the World Cup. A 0-0
tie in 1974 was followed by a 4-1 loss in 1982 and a 1-0 defeat in
1990 _ when rookie goalie Taffarel made a miraculous save to
guarantee the win.
	   Defender Colin Calderwood said the Scots won't leave it up to
one player to stop Ronaldo.
	   ``It is a team responsibility. That is how we are approaching
it,'' he said. ``He is someone that we will look out for, but we
are not about to concentrate all our efforts on one player.''
	   Teammate Gordon Durie is also in determined mood.
	   ``We must go for the throat,'' Durie said. ``If we sit in and
try and defend, they have players who can destroy you.''

Israel approves new housing project for Jews in east Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's interior ministry gave the
go-ahead Tuesday for construction of 58 homes for Jews on east
Jerusalem land that had been slated for an Arab girls school.
	   The decision came a day after Israelis and Palestinians clashed
in another east Jerusalem neighborhood where Jewish settlers took
over two homes in the middle of the night.
	   Settlers have been stepping up their campaign to increase the
Jewish presence in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians claim as a future capital.
	   The building proposal was submitted by the Beit Orot Jewish
seminary, run by extreme right-wing settler and lawmaker Benny
Elon. The houses would be built on land purchased by American
multi-millionaire Irving Moskowitz around the seminary's building
on the Mount of Olives.
	   The Jerusalem city spokesman's office said that if no objections
were filed to the project, the city would issue building permits
for the 58 homes in the near future.
	   The Israeli peace group Ir Shalem said it would file a formal
objection to the plan. Attorney Danny Seidemann said the group also
planned to file suit against the project in Israel's Supreme Court.
	   The building proposal was approved by the municipality four
years ago but had not received final approval from the interior
ministry.
	   In its decision Tuesday, the ministry backed a city plan to
cancel the construction of a junior high school for Arab girls on
the site, and to move it further down the hill to the Arab
neighborhood of A-Tur. The ministry also approved a plan to build
100 housing units for Palestinians in the same area.
	   Seidemann said the decision to cancel construction of the school
came after the Mount of Olives plot was purchased by Moskowitz, who
has been actively buying up land from Arabs and turning it over for
Jewish settlement.
	   ``The school was approved and Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert and
Moskowitz got it removed,'' Seidemann charged.
	   The United States has asked Israel for a time-out in settlement
construction to help restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
stalled since Israel began another settlement project on a disputed
east Jerusalem hilltop in March 1997.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War and later annexed it.

China starts to assemble Sukhoi fighters from Russian kits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ China has started to assemble Sukhoi fighter
aircraft from kits supplied by Russia, Jane's Defense Weekly
reported Tuesday.
	   The first two Su-27 fighters are expected to be delivered to the
Chinese military by the end of the year, the respected military
magazine said.
	   China's purchase of Russian Su-27s is part of a concerted drive
to modernize its military.
	   The Su-27 is set to become one of the Chinese air force's main
fighters from early next decade, serving primarily as a long-range
interceptor, Jane's said.
	   The magazine said there is little difference between the Su-27s
being assembled at the Shenyang Aircraft Corp. in China's northeast
Shenyang Province and the 48 Su-27s that Beijing purchased directly
from Russia in the early 1990s.
	   The Shenyang facility has an annual production target of 10 to
15 fighters, Jane's said. A clause in the sales contract stipulates
that Russia's Su-27 facility in Komsomolsk will provide substitute
aircraft if the Shenyang facility doesn't meet that target, it
said.

India defends nuclear tests, saying they reflect unique security
</HEADLINE>
situation &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ India tested nuclear weapons because the
collapse of the Soviet Union changed the balance of power in Asia
and left India outside the system of global nuclear umbrellas, the
Indian planning chief said Tuesday.
	   ``The nuclear security paradigm is really a club which extends
from Vancouver to Vladivostok,'' Jaswant Singh told reporters.
``The (security) vacuum that has come into existence is southern
Russia and parts of Africa.''
	   India, he said, was simply filling the vacuum in South Asia.
	   He said the collapse of the Soviet Union had led to a
``disequilibrium in the nuclear'' balance in Asia ``from which
India was excluded.'' The breakup of the Soviet Union left China as
the only nuclear state in the region.
	   Singh's remarks indicated that India, the world's second most
populous country, sees itself as a major regional power with a
right to take measures to guarantee its own defense.
	   ``Large parts of the world today enjoy the benefit of the
extended deterrence of nuclear weapons powers,'' he said. ``Missing
in the flood of comment on India's decision to test nuclear weapons
... are informed assessments of India's own security predicament.''
	   Last Saturday, the Security Council condemned nuclear tests by
India and neighboring Pakistan and called on them to halt further
weapons development.
	   The council also denied India and Pakistan formal status as
nuclear states under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
That treaty recognizes the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain as nuclear states and allows them to keep their arsenals.
	   India and Pakistan have denounced this system and called on the
nuclear states to agree to talks on dismantling their own nuclear
weapons.
	   ``No other country in the world has exercised the kind of
restraint that India has demonstrated (since its first test in
1974),'' Singh said.
	   He accused the nuclear states themselves of violating the spirit
of the nonproliferation agreement by secretly using ``nuclear
technology as commodities.''
	   Singh said it was time for the nuclear powers to move toward
global nuclear disarmament.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The European Central Bank's
policy-making governing council stuck to procedural issues and
avoided decisions on monetary policy at its first ever meeting
Tuesday.
	   Bank president Wim Duisenberg had said beforehand that it was
too early for the council to begin deciding policy questions, and
council members confirmed afterward that the meeting largely
focused on internal organization and procedure.
	   ``Some organizational decisions have been made,'' Luxembourg
central bank head Yves Mersch said. Spanish central bank head Luis
Angel Rojo said it entailed ``only procedures, and no decisions.''
	   Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet and his Portuguese
colleague, Antonio de Sousa, called the meeting ``historic,'' and
others also expressed satisfaction with it.
	   The bank's six-member executive board and the 11 heads of the
central banks of nations participating in European currency union
make up the governing council.
	   The bank, based in Frankfurt, will set monetary policy for the
11 inaugural members when monetary union begins Jan. 1.

Trial for ETA's longest kidnapping to start Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Four alleged Basque separatists are due to
stand trial in Spain's National Court on Wednesday for holding a
prison official hostage for 18 months.
	   The prosecution is seeking 32-year prison sentences for the four
who were arrested last July, hours before police rescued the
captive from a hideout in the northern Basque region.
	   The armed Basque separatist group ETA abducted Jose Antonio
Ortega Lara in January 1996, conditioning his release on improved
conditions for 450 jailed members of the group.
	   Ortega Lara, who was kept in a 3-meter by 2.5-meter (9-foot by
7-foot) windowless room for 532 days, has asked the court to excuse
him from taking the witness stand because of his delicate mental
health. A decision on the petition is expected when the trial
begins.
	   A medical evaluation of Ortega Lara submitted on Tuesday
concluded that he now suffers from acute anxiety and depression
because of the ordeal, and that a court appearance could ``provoke
a serious worsening of his psychological condition,'' the national
news agency EFE said.
	   In the pretrial report prosecutor Ignacio Gordillo said the four
defendants followed Ortega Lara, an active member of the governing
Popular Party, for several months before kidnapping him on his way
home from work.
	   As well as kidnapping, Jesus Maria Uribechevarria Bolinaga,
Javier Ugarte Villar, Jose Luis Erostegui Bidaguren and Jose Miguel
Gaztelu are also facing charges of conspiracy to murder.
	   According to Gordillo's report they had instructions to kill
their captive or let him starve to death if the government did not
give in to the pressure.
	   ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Liberty, began fighting
for the independence of northern Spain's Basque region in 1968.
Since then it has killed nearly 800 people and kidnapped 71.
	   Prosecutors are also seeking compensation of 65 million pesetas
(dlrs 424,836) for Ortega Lara, and the trial is expected to last
two days.

	   The bank bailout fund (Fobaproa) debate will not have a major
effect on the economy, though recent peso fluctuations and the
proposed congressional bill to overhaul Fobaproa stir analysts'
concern, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MSDW) brokerage said Monday.
	   MSDW visited a wide range of companies, economists, and
government officials in Mexico recently, to further align its
economic forecasts utilizing a wide array of sources.
	   MSDW said virtually everyone it met with agreed with its 15.8
billion-dollar current account deficit estimate.
	   MSDW, however, reset its foreign direct investment (FDI)
expectation at between 10 billion dollars and 12 billion dollars.
	   In regards to the foreign-exchange rate, MSDW forecasts 9.2
pesos to the dollar for the end of 1998, and projects a yearly
gross domestic product growth of 4.8 percent.
	   Ernest W. Brown, an analyst from MSDW, said the economy is
growing at a healthy pace although a slowdown is expected.
	   ``The firms visited expect an economic-growth slowdown in the
second half of the year, despite repeated stories of impressive
sales gains continuing throughout'' the first quarter, he said.
	   Despite the good economic news, Fobaproa still clouds the
horizon.
	   ``The Fobaproa issue is not going away any time soon,'' MSDW
said. ``It's this kind of unaccustomed political give-and-take
that's making many business leaders more cautious about the
economic outlook.''The opposition in Congress is using the
controversy surrounding Fobaproa to threaten blocking the passage
of the government's financial reform package.
	   The government, using Fobaproa as its instrument, has bought
about 63 billion dollars' worth of bad debt off banks, while only
seizing 25 billion dollars' worth of assets from companies that
have defaulted on debt repayments. Furthermore, the Finance
Secretariat says it only expects to recover 25 percent of the debt
--leaving taxpayers to foot the rest of the bill.
	   Financial legislation proposed by the Zedillo administration
include: Shifting exchange-rate management to the central bank
(Bank of Mexico).
	   Removing banking supervision from the Bank of Mexico.
	   Restructuring Fobaproa into 2 institutions - one solely with an
FDIC deposit insurance function, and the other BTC asset
divestiture function.
	   Limiting deposit insurance to 1 million pesos per account.
	   Eliminating restrictions on foreign capital ownership of
Mexico's largest banks.

	   The Attorney General's Office (PGR) confirmed Monday it had
captured two men suspected of being top capos in the
drug-trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel.
	   The PGR announced that Angel Salvador Gomez Herrera and Oziel
Cardenas Guillen were arrested in Tamaulipas on Friday and will be
investigated for a variety of offenses related to drug trafficking
and organized crime.
	   Arrested with the two alleged cartel members was an unnamed
Federal Highway patrolman who is believed to have been in the pay
of drug traffickers.
	   The PGR said federal agents and military personnel participated
in the capture of the suspects, but did not give further details.
	   The operation also resulted in the confiscation of 15,000
dollars in cash, several high-caliber arms and other items.
	   Several arrest warrants (on drug trafficking and murder charges)
for Gomez Herrera had been issued by Texas courts over the past
several years, the PGR said.
	   Gomez Herrera and Cardenas Guillen are believed to head a
prominent faction of the Gulf Cartel, succeeding Oscar Malherbe de
Leon (arrested late last year), who had himself succeeded Gulf
Cartel boss Juan Garcia Abrego (arrested and deported to the United
States in early 1997).
	   Newspaper accounts over the weekend described Salvador ``Chava''
Gomez Herrera as the ``acting head'' of the Gulf Cartel, referring
to Cardenas Guillen as Gomez Herrera's right-hand man.
	   With these arrests, the four principal drug cartels in Mexico
are in various stages of disarray.
	   The PGR began dismantling the Gulf Cartel in 1993 when it
arrested several of its top lieutenants; the Juarez Cartel has been
in disarray since the July 4, 1997 death of capo Amado Carrillo
Fuentes after botched plastic surgery; the Tijuana Cartel leaders,
Benjamin and Ramon Arellano Felix, reportedly have gone into deep
hiding since the PGR stepped up its pursuit of the siblings (plus
the FBI placed Ramon on its Top 10 Most Wanted list earlier this
year); and the PGR says it dismantled the Colima Cartel when it
arrested Jesus and Luis Amezcua Contreras, the chiefs of the
so-called ``Amphetamine Cartel.''The director of Mexico's Office of
the Special Prosecutor for Crimes Against Health, Mariano Herran
Salvatti, told Spanish news agency EFE last week before Friday's
arrests that government officials believe the Gulf Cartel is on the
point of disappearing. Herran Salvatti also asserted that the
Colima Cartel has been smashed by the arrests of the Amezcua
brothers.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the onetime No.
2 Vatican official whose quiet diplomacy helped keep the church
alive behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, died Tuesday. He
was 83.
	   Casaroli was hospitalized Thursday and died of heart problems,
officials at a Rome hospital said.
	   In a condolence note, John Paul II praised the churchman for
``carrying out with refined diplomatic sensitivity courageous and
significant steps, in particular for improving the situation of the
church in eastern Europe.''
	   Casaroli was considered an architect of the Vatican's diplomatic
policy to gain more freedom for the Roman Catholic Church after
open persecution by Communist nations.
	   Casaroli served as secretary of state from 1979 to 1990. The
position is the most important after the pope, and is equivalent to
premier.
	   When Casaroli retired, Pope John Paul II expressed his gratitude
to the tailor's son from Piacenza in northern Italy and said it was
``providential'' to have worked with him during such ``historic
times.''
	   Casaroli was considered a consummate but cautious diplomat and
an extremely loyal official. He once said that ``the forces that
can truly guide humanity on the moral level are so weak.''
Therefore, it was up to the pope and the Vatican ``to impose their
moral authority.''
	   The Polish-born pope and some other churchmen were said to have
had differences with Casaroli's cautious approach to diplomacy,
preferring a more uncompromising stance.
	   But John Paul promoted Casaroli to secretary of state less than
a year after becoming pontiff. He and the pope clearly had
reconciled any differences as the years went on.
	   ``He leaves an unmistakable imprint not only on the life of the
church, but in contemporary history,'' said Giulio Andreotti, a
former Christian Democrat premier and foreign minister whose tenure
concided with much of Casaroli's.
	   ``He had extraordinary intuition about the possibility of
dialogue even with his opponents in the certainty that in the end
the right approaches would have prevailed. Not everybody understood
him at the time,'' Andreotti added.
	   The policy toward Eastern Europe was the inspiration of Pope
John XXIII after the hard line taken by Pope Pius XII during the
years of Stalinist repression.
	   Pope Paul VI, who took over in 1963, implemented the policy,
working closely with Casaroli and sending him on frequent missions
to Communist capitals.
	   Casaroli also was given credit for the tough language on human
rights and religious liberty in the 1975 Helsinki accords.
	   Beyond the diplomatic field, Casaroli kept the Vatican running
smoothly after the pope was wounded by a Turkish gunman in 1981.
	   The cardinal's funeral, to be celebrated by John Paul, was
scheduled for Friday in St. Peter's Basilica.

	   The trouble-plagued privatisation drive, hailed only six months
ago as a major component of this government's economic rescue
package, appears to have stalled. The badly-needed political will
to implement this crucial, if not highly sensitive, project is
fading fast. The well-entrenched bureaucrats, it seems, have won
out again.
	   For all practical purposes, the so-called ''comprehensive''
national privatisation plan has been shelved. Each government unit
assigned to map out its plan is doing its own thing. Nobody is
quite sure what the other guy is doing and everybody seems to be
praying that its turn for the big change will never arrive.
	   Who is in charge? There was some mumbling a few weeks ago that
the Cabinet was considering putting the Finance Ministry in overall
control of all the privatisation schemes. Deputy Premier Supachai
Panitchpakdi, who should have fretted over the change, kept quiet.
He headed a national-level committee supposed to supervise the
overall privatisation process.
	   But when an uproar erupted over the proposed sale of a power
plant at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat),
the committee was conspicuous by its silence. It became a drawn-out
and noisy battle between Egat's board of directors on the one side
and the union and management on the other. The board lost and was
replaced through a face-saving mediation. The pros and cons of the
controversy were never seriously debated in an open forum. Dr
Supachai's committee was nowhere to be seen.
	   The government, instead of dealing with the privatisation issue,
shifted the focus to the question of personalities of the board of
directors to appease the union. Egat has a new board now but the
privatisation controversy remains unresolved. It's back to square
one.
	   The conflict has not disappeared. It has merely been shelved for
the time being. Sooner or later, it will explode into another
chaotic political mess -- because the hard, cold fact will have to
be faced: Policy makers are there to make policies, not simply
patch up quarrels in order to avoid making the difficult decisions.
	   The case of Thai Airways International will meet the same fate
this week if the Cabinet flinches from making a tough choice.
	   Bureaucrats will be raising legal and technical obstacles to
slow down, if not block, privatisation of the national airline. The
Finance Ministry says it plans to sell existing and new shares
through a private placement arrangement to member airlines in the
Star Alliance. But the National Economic and Social Development
Board (NESDB) and Budget Bureau propose that the offer should be
made to financial institutions and general investors to fetch a
better price.
	   Then, there will be the question of whether the move will be in
line with provisions of the 1954 Aviation Act which specifies that
at least 70 per cent of the equity must belong to Thai nationals or
else its aircraft cannot be registered as Thai. The move may also
run into a major stumbling block if a piece of 1992 legislation is
brought into the discussion. That law imposes a time-consuming
procedure for a state agency in selecting a private partner in any
substantial business joint venture.
	   The outcome isn't hard to predict. The Cabinet, which doesn't
seem to possess the necessary political will to carry out vital
economic reform, will just throw up its hands over these highly
entangled arguments -- and, keeping everyone in the room happy,
will just politely ask the opposing bureaucrats to ''review and
revise'' their respective proposals before submitting their new
findings (a new set of entangled arguments) to the Cabinet for
''future consideration.'' Back to square one yet again.
	   Bangchak Petroleum offers another classic case of a well-laid
privatisation plan gone awry. It's been turned into an ugly and
noisy confrontation between the shareholders and the managing
director, portrayed in some circles as a clash between hard, cold
economic realities against the noble cause of promoting rural
development -- or less charitably, a battle between greed and
charity, or much worse, foreign domination against nationalism.
	   The risk of a privatisation scheme creating the image of saint
and Satan among advocates and objectors is always there. But in
most cases, such an unfair division could be avoided with a
strong-minded government ready to resort to unpopular policies to
achieve the necessary goals. That means coming up with a
comprehensive privatisation plan, setting down clear-cut goals,
explaining the rationale behind each scheme and setting appropriate
deadlines, with effective action plans backed up by public hearings
for all projects under the scheme. Most important of all, make the
information public -- and ensure utmost transparency. In other
words, put it clearly and unequivocally on the public agenda.
	   Because this government has failed to communicate effectively
with a skeptical public over the issue, privatisation has been seen
only as a desperate way of raising funds to pay for mismanaged
private concerns. Privatisation, when it's done right and
responsibly, ensures a greater degree of professionalism,
transparency and sensitivity in the management of our state
enterprises, the majority of which leave much to be desired.

	   As elsewhere, the debate in Thailand regarding the relationship
between man and forest has become polarised, with the current
dispute between highlanders and lowlanders in the Doi Inthanond
National Park becoming the main battleground at a time when the
government is set to review a regulation which allows people to
live in sensitive forest areas.
	   The recent road blockade by thousands of lowland villagers in
Chiang Mai's Chom Thong district was the result of a two-decade
impasse between lowlanders and highlanders, an issue which is
further complicated by the existence of powerful NGOs on both sides
which have refused to settle for compromises and are constantly
appealing to our sense of humanity to serve their agenda.
	   To overcome this divide, one must first move away from the
politically correct tendency to describe hill tribes as indigenous
people, a term used by some NGOs in their bid to win public
sympathy and support. The hill tribes living in the highland area
of Inthanond are today normal Thai highlanders with as much
citizenship right as the lowland Thais.
	   The lowland villagers in Doi Inthanond are insisting that the
highlanders living in the park must be resettled as their
activities disturb the watershed forest, but proponents of highland
communities argue that they have the right to remain on the land
because they have lived there since before the forest was declared
protected.
	   The real issue, however, goes beyond the question of humanity,
if one can get away from the images, propaganda and distorted
information in the debate. At stake is the lack of water for both
sides following widespread fire in the area.
	   Without accurate information on the ground, it will be difficult
for decision-makers to give judgement. The technical aspect of
ecological impact is probably the best clue in the search for a
solution, but this is not to say that the historical and social
contexts of the problem should not be taken into account.
	   This must include not only the public perception of hill tribes
and local northern Thai communities but the involvement of NGOs on
both sides and whether their roles are based on hidden agenda such
as differing ideologies and even the cover-up of past errors in
ecological management.
	   But the immediate issue is how to ensure that there is water
available for everyone in Doi Inthanond. The government must step
in urgently to check the availability of water and its management
in the highland area. This, if done objectively, would inform
everyone involved in the dispute whether there is hope for
salvaging the situation and perhaps put an end to the threat of
protests which could easily turn violent.
	   Nithi Eawsriwong, a Chiang Mai University academic, has also
suggested a wide-ranging study of the pattern of water usage by
both highlanders and lowland farmers. Without such an assessment
any decision could easily be mistaken, he says. Nithi was once
accused as being ''biased'' towards the highlanders when he made a
recent comment on the forest-fire problem in Doi Inthanond and
nearby Doi Chiang Dao. Lowland villagers burnt him in effigy along
with a number of other CMU academics who were accused for
supporting the highlanders, but his useful advice should not be
ignored.
	   The conflict at Doi Inthanond should see a proper solution when
accurate information from a detailed study is made available. If
need be the cultivation of certain crops by both highland and
lowland farmers should be reassessed, taking in consideration their
demand for water. A team consisting of ecologists, hydrologists,
geologists, conservationists, social scientists, anthropologists,
well-informed forestry officials and villagers themselves who have
the trust of both sides should be set up to designate all the
aspects the study has to cover.
	   Hopefully a solution might be in sight after the completion of
such a study. The Doi Inthanond controversy could well serve as an
optional model for future solution of forest-land conflicts in
other areas. Indeed the issue of humanity should not blur our view
when resolving such disputes.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested 90 people across the
country on drug-smuggling and arms-trafficking charges in what was
believed to be a major blow to Albanian-Italian organized crime
links.
	   The suspects included Albanian mob suspects who allegedly worked
in connection with Mafia bosses from the Sicily and Calabria
regions, the ANSA news agency said.
	   Those arrested included some Egyptian nationals who were mainly
active in Milan in one of the biggest criminal rings in the whole
Lombardy region.
	   Police also seized arms, reportedly headed to the embattled and
mainly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia, and 113
kilos (248 pounds) of cocaine and heroin. The drugs were smuggled
to Italy through Eastern Europe as well as through Greece across
the Adriatic sea.
	   Police also issued arrest warrants for 25 fugitives.
	   Italian organized crime has long had links with the Balkan
countries across the Adriatic. Investigators say that Albanian
gangs took advantage of the chaos at home last year to expand their
operations in Italy.

	   THEME TOILETS ... It's nice for a change to find attractive
toilets like these located at the Panti Tropical Fruit Farm, 30km
from Kota Tinggi.
	   Travellers to and from Mersing and Tanjung Leman, who stop at
the rest station of the farm, find them a pleasant change.
	   The toilets, in mock log cabin style, are surrounded by
well-landscaped walkways. The builders, in line with the fruit farm
concept, have crafted two coconut sculptures for the roof of each
toilet.
	   The ``coconuts'' are fitted with water fountains resembling
coconut water pouring into a pool.
	   The fountain is not yet functioning as the farm resort is still
without electricity supply.
	   Panti Fruit Farm area manager Rashid Jusoh said the farm, which
was set up by Felcra Bhd, was in its first phase of development
with the building of fruit stalls, a restaurant, surau and rest
areas.
	   The 637ha fruit farm has durian, starfruit, cempedak, jackfruit
and honey lemon trees.
	   Chalets, fishing and recreational facilities will be put up in
the future.

	   KUCHING, Sat. - A temporary shelter will soon be built near the
proposed Bakun Hydroelectric Dam resettlement area in Sungai Asap
to house the 521 natives who lost their longhouse in Long Linau,
Belaga, to fire last Saturday.
	   Bakun Resettlement and Social Economy Committee chairman Dr
James Masing said a special committee headed by the Resident of
Kapit had been set up to look into the matter.
	   ``We will move the affected longhouse folks as soon as possible.
But the place to resettle them is not within the proposed Bakun
resettlement area,'' he said.
	   Masing was speaking at the Sarawak General Hospital today, after
accompanying Yang diPertua Negeri Tun Ahmad Zaidi Adruce Muhammed
Noor on a visit to the children's ward. The visit was in
conjunction with the Yang diPertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar's
birthday.
	   The 82-door Rumah Uma Nyaving, one of the longhouses which will
be submerged by the now postponed Bakun dam, caught fire about 7pm
when many of its inhabitants were busy preparing for Gawai Dayak
which was celebrated on June 1 and 2.
	   The villagers' quick action prevented eight rooms from being
destroyed by the fire which was believed to have been caused by a
short circuit.
	   Masing said the villagers were now living in makeshift huts or
with relatives in the eight rooms. Loss was estimated at RM950,000.

	   FOUR senior officers at the Highway Police Division are to be
transferred as part of the Police Department's efforts to improve
its image, sources said Monday.
	   Although the four, including division deputy chiefs, have not
been charged with any wrongdoing, they have been in their positions
for a long time reportedly due to their relationship with leading
politicians and prominent figures.
	   It has not yet been decided which positions they will be
transferred to, the sources said.
	   The planned transfer resulted from a policy by Central
Investigation Bureau chief Pol Lt Gen Seri Temiyavej who did not
want any senior officer in any position for too long, especially
within the division.
	   However, police chief Pol Gen Pracha Promnok said he had not yet
received the official order on the four officers' transfer, and
that Seri had told him earlier that it would take at least another
20 days for the CIB chief to make his decision on who should be
transferred.
	   The image of the police force has been tainted by several
scandals with highway police being accused of extorting money from
truck drivers.
	   Twenty-one officers of the Patrol and Special Operations
Division have been moved to inactive posts for their alleged
involvement in the gruesome murder of a fellow officer last month.
	   Pol Maj Gen Somsak Prasarnsuk, chief of the division, said the
transfers of all the 21, four of them commissioned officers, would
temporarily end their alleged activities or prevent their possible
interference in the ongoing investigation of the killing of Pol Sgt
Nukul Khongsuwan.
	   He said all of them, better known as 191 police, would
immediately face temporary suspension from service if more evidence
is found clearly implicating them in the killing.
	   On May 30, Nukul's body, with one of the three gunshot wounds on
his head, was found hanging out of a Mercedes with his right wrist
handcuffed to the vehicle. Police initially believed that the
motive for the murder was his involvement with many gambling dens
or several affairs he had with women.
	   Bangkok police chief Pol Lt Gen Thawee Thipphayarat, speaking
after approving Somsak's proposed transfer order, said all of them
would be anyway assigned to positions which are easy to control
should it be revealed eventually that they had nothing to do with
Nukul's murder.
	   A police source said the 21 officers, who mostly work as
plain-cloth officers, are members of an extortion ring which has
long collected protection money from all illegal businesses in
Bangkok area.
	   The source added that Nukul had also worked for the ring until
his relationship with them soured recently when he began to keep
part of the money with him instead of handing the whole amount to
the group.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The road is familiar to Park Seh-jik, one he
traveled a decade ago without ever reaching the end.
	   As president of the committee that staged the 1988 Seoul
Olympics, Park knew the stress and frustration of trying _ and
failing _ to bring North and South Korea together through sports.
	   Now, he's about to try again. Different event this time.
Different political climate. Different _ he hopes _ outcome.
	   As chairman of the South Korean organizing committee for the
2002 World Cup, Park said Tuesday he was ready to see if some of
the 32 games could be staged north of the demilitarized zone that
divides the peninsula and underscores the fact that the neighbor
nations remain at war.
	   ``The Korean people are very anxious to have the games both
north and south,'' Park said. ``We are ready to share. ... This
would affirm an atmosphere of peace.''
	   Park, in Paris for the start of this year's World Cup, also said
there was a chance of having a single, united Korean team in 2002.
Initial reactions from North Korea were favorable.
	   ``We are not in a stage to discuss details yet, but in
principle, it is very desirable to form a single team and for North
Korea to hold some games,'' said Choi Pyong Joo, vice president of
North Korea's soccer association.
	   In Seoul, soccer officials said the government had approved
contacting the north about World Cup matters. If meetings are set
up, they said, more general sports exchanges might also be
discussed.
	   Seoul was awarded the Summer Games by the IOC in 1981, and calls
followed from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang that it wanted
some of the action, too.
	   From 1986 through the summer of '88, Park's committee and the
IOC tried to cut a deal with the north, offering to let it stage a
handful of sports and ceremonies. The offers always fell short.
	   That was another time, though. The Cold War had yet to thaw and
North Korea was on relatively stable economic ground. Now, as the
last Stalinist state left, it finds itself impoverished and
isolated. The government in Seoul recently called for an easing of
decades-old sanctions and attitudes by the United States and other
Western nations.
	   Such changes lead Park to think that a sports enterprise with
the north could work this time.
	   ``The situations in 1988 and now are quite different,'' Park
said. ``The tensions are very much reduced. We are looking for a
positive answer from North Korea.''
	   He stressed, however, that any deal with Pyongyang would also
have to be approved by the international soccer federation, FIFA,
as well as Japan, South Korea's co-host in 2002.
	   Because of that unprecedented sharing, Park said, it was
imperative that any negotiations with the north not drag out as
they did a decade ago.
	   ``It is very complicated, so the sooner, the better,'' he said.
	   At the same time, Park said, there was enough time to work out
details of the north's role and bring facilities there up to
international standards.
	   ``We still have a full four years, so any complications could be
solved,'' he said.
	   A joint Korean team played in the last under-16 world
championships in Portugal and FIFA said it was ready to try it
again.
	   ``There is precedence for that, although, of course, there is a
huge difference between youth soccer championships and the World
Cup,'' federation spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``That is strictly a
matter for the two national (soccer) associations to decide.''

	   ALOR STAR, Sat. - Investors in trust funds should be patient and
wait for prices to recover, instead of hastily selling off their
shares, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Affifuddin Omar said today.
	   Admitting that trust funds had suffered paper losses, he said
they were not spared the ill-effects of the economic downturn.
	   ``We are aware the market value of the funds has dropped
drastically but investors should be patient.
	   ``There is no point panicking and selling off their shares at
such low prices ... they should wait until things improve,'' he
said, adding that the Government understood the predicament of
those who had borrowed to buy units.
	   However, he said it was not only trust fund investors who were
suffering. Almost every investor in the share market had been
affected by the economic problems.
	   Affifudin was speaking to reporters after attending a seminar on
Kedah's economic development.
	   He was asked to comment on the problems faced by investors in
trust funds following the sharp fall in unit prices after the share
market was badly hit.
	   The country's trust funds include Amanah Saham Nasional and
Amanah Saham Wawasan. There are also six trust funds run by the
State Governments of Kedah, Selangor, Johor, Terengganu, Sabah and
Sarawak.

	   LABOUR Permanent Secretary Phan Jantrapan Monday briefed the
Council of Economic Ministers, saying the number of unemployed had
reached 2,061,719, consisting of 1,322,379 jobless villagers,
250,340 laid-off workers and 489,000 workers new to the labour
force.
	   While informing the council of the measures to tackle the
problem, Phan was caught off guard when asked about the number of
Thai workers sent back from Brunei owing to the sluggish economy
there.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Panja Kesornthong voiced concern over
reports that 6,000 Thai workers had been laid off by Bruneian
employers and returned home, prompting Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
to ask for clarification on the situation of Thai workers in the
oil-rich sultanate.
	   Phan replied he had no updated information on the number of
returned Thai workers from Brunei, adding that the reports had come
in over the weekend when his office was closed.
	   Chuan rebuked the top labour bureaucrat, saying he could not use
office hours as an excuse for his failure to keep abreast of
important labour developments.
	   Chuan also instructed the National Statistics Office to review
its labour statistics and submit a report next week on how it had
arrived at the total of 2,800,000 unemployed, which differed
greatly from the Labour, Interior and National Economic and Social
Development Board reports.
	   Government deputy spokesman Pan Phuengsujarit, speaking after
the meeting, broke down assistance to the unemployed as follows: -
Job placement for 153,162 laid-off employees.
	   - Training to upgrade job skills for 85,639 workers.
	   - Preparations for the hiring of 3,008 workers.
	   - Terminating the contracts of 232,639 illegal alien workers and
securing replacement jobs for 95,149 Thai workers.
	   - Organising sales of essential consumers goods to benefit
1,012,950 consumers.
	   - Sending mobile teams to distribute bargain-price goods to
1,721,000 residents.
	   - Arranging venture capital for 9,587 laid-off workers to begin
independent careers.
	   - Disbursing Bt2.3 million for the hiring of 112,768 jobless
villagers.
	   - Prompting 8,870 rural families to join the Royal-initiated
''New Theory Agriculture'' project for self-reliance, of whom 870
have already put the knowledge to use.
	   - Providing job counselling and training for 21,600 workers.

Rollerblading cops hit Paris streets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French cops on rollerblades made their first
appearance Tuesday on Paris streets, only hours before World Cup
festivities kicked off with a parade down the Champs-Elysees.
	   Clad in helmets, kneepads and windbreakers, an eight-man brigade
skated through Paris, which is being invaded by thousands of soccer
fans.
	   The special squad _ expected to grow to 30 in the next few weeks
_ was picked on the basis of skating ability, and trained by a top
French speed skater.
	   The idea was actually developed before the World Cup, to help
keep order on weekends. On weekend evenings, some 5,000 Parisians
gather at the Place d'Italie before skating through the city.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the
brigade was not a publicity stunt, but was designed to allow police
to intervene ``with more flexibility'' on the sidewalks.
	   Several U.S., Canadian and Dutch cities have experimented with
cops on rollerblades.

	   MOTHERLY LOVE ... Johor State Executive Councillor Halimah
Mohamed Sadique cuddling neuro patient Mohd Amirul Hakeem Abmad
Nazri, two, while the child's parents Ahmad Nazri Mahmud and
Jamilah Ibrahim look on.
	   The boy has been suffering from brain complications after an
epileptic attack when he was eight months old.
	   He needs about US$75,000 (RM292,500) for treatment abroad.
Halimah launched a homepage at Plaza Angsana in Tampoi near Johor
Baru yesterday to collect funds in aid of him. The website address
is http://www.johor.net.my/amirul/ The Malaysian Islamic Welfare
and Missionary Organisation (Perkida) Johor Baru branch has also
launched the ``Mohd Amirul Hakeem Fund'' to collect donations to
finance the boy's treatment. To date, about RM62,000 has been
collected.
	   Ahmad Nazri, a former Utusan Malaysia journalist who now runs a
small carpet-cleaning business, said as the sole breadwinner of the
family he could not afford the treatment. He has four other
school-going children.
	   The family is now staying in a rented house, as they have sold
their house to finance Amirul's treatment.
	   He said doctors found that Amirul's brain had shrunk and become
inactive after the epileptic attack. As a result, the child became
very weak, has poor eyesight, cannot sit up, walk or even hold an
object. Amirul also has to be spoonfed.
	   ``I have spent more than a year seeking treatment locally for my
son including sending him to numerous medical specialists and also
going to Indonesia and Singapore several times, but to no avail.''
	   Ahmad Nazri said he hoped to raise enough funds to take his son
to the United States.
	   Contributions for the boy can be made by cheque, bank draft or
postal order under the name ``Mohd Amirul Hakeem Fund'' and posted
to Perkida, Johor Baru branch, 6A, Mara Building, Jalan Sekolah, Kg
Melayu Majidee, 81100 Johor Baru.

	   JOHOR BARU, Sat. - The State Government has identified 14,000
underprivileged people in need of Government aid in Johor.
	   They include the disabled, orphans, single mothers, the poor and
senior citizens.
	   State Executive Councillor Halimah Sadique said the State Social
Welfare department was finalising a profile of them.
	   ``This is to enable the State to have a systematic access to
information when planning programmes, such as training and
rehabilitation for the underprivileged,'' she said after
officiating at a charity show today.
	   Halimah, who is also State Unity, Women Affairs and Social
Welfare Committee chairman was representing Menteri Besar Datuk

	   OCTOBER 1956: When I went to the hospital to check up on Yit
Song this evening, I also visited Balbir Singh, Harbans Singh's
brother. He fell on the steps at school this evening and broke his
arm.
	   Munzir went with him to the hospital to have it set and was
still there when I arrived. First Harbans and his leg, now Balbir
and his arm. That family! On the way home from our football game
with the Sulaiman School this evening, I noticed that Razak was
about to have a fight with Sulaiman School's Rosli. They were
exchanging words, so I asked Razak to invite Rosli to the hostel
for a talk.
	   He came, and the three of us had a long talk before dinner. Two
names kept coming up - Manan and Safian of the ``Ketari gang''- so
I told Rosli to bring those boys to the hostel on Saturday night so
that we could have the whole thing out once and for all.
	   Meanwhile, the other boys were having study hours, and when I
went upstairs, Tengku Abdullah said that they had heard some boys
shouting as they cycled by: ``Hostel boys, come out and fight!''
	   I told the boys that if it ever happened again, to let me know
immediately; we'll take them up on the invitation! I don't want
anyone to think the hostel boys are cowards, and if fight we must,
fight we will.
	   Jalil, home from Kuala Lumpur on a week's leave, came with his
mother tonight ``to take Ghaffar home.''
	   ``What?'' was my response. According to them, the mother needs
him at home to take care of her, but I'm sure that Ghaffar had just
cooked up this excuse to get out of the control of the hostel.
	   He has good friends in the ``Ketari gang'', so I told the mother
that she would have to keep a very strict watch on her son's
activities. I said that once he moved out of the hostel, I would
wash my hands of all responsibility for him - except in school as
his headmaster.
	   ``If he gets into any `gang trouble','' I said, ``he'll be
expelled from school.'' The mother gave me the impression that she
knows her son better than I do, so he took his things (they were
already packed) and left. I was really sorry to see him go.
	   There were tears in my eyes when I left the hospital this
morning.
	   Beserah had just told me that Yit Song definitely has TB, and
the boy looked so pathetic when I talked to him. He will have to be
in hospital for a long time, and until we can get him admitted to
Lady Templer's, he'll stay in Raub.
	   Nyit Chin packed his things for him today, and it made me so sad
to think that he had to leave in this way.
	   The boys wanted to go see Sumpah Orang Minyak tonight as a
reward for winning the game yesterday with Sulaiman School. I said
``No,'' and that was that.
	   ``You can see Oliver Twist at school tomorrow night,'' I said.
The truth is that I don't want them roaming around town at night.
	   Ghaffar came along tonight with Manan, Rosli, and Safian for our
meeting. We gathered around the table in the library - Razak,
Zubir, Munzir, and Tengku Ahmad representing the hostel boys; the
others were upstairs looking at USIS films.
	   The meeting became heated a time or two, but we managed to have
a pretty sensible discussion. After it was all over and we were
weighing things, it seemed to add up to the fact that these
`outside' boys were simply jealous of the hostel boys. Their
charges were downright juvenile: Rosli said that he didn't like the
way Razak walked, and Manan said that some of the hostel boys
``stared'' at him and his friends.
	   The whole thing ended with handshakes, but Manan still had an
evil look in his eye, and Ghaffar was smilingly defiant, saying:
``If there should be trouble, and I'm not there, you can't do
anything to me.''
	   ``Ghaffar,'' I told him, ``If there's any trouble, I'll know
that you're behind it, and your name will be the first on the list
I send to the police.''
	   The Standard Six students began their central exam this morning.
Our candidates had to go to the Malay School centre, where Yeng Kee
was a proctor. Some of the students reported to Brian that it was a
``very easy,'' exam - so that's a bad sign.
	   The weather is ruling us these days. We managed to get through
our football game with the PWD this evening before the rain started
(we won 3- 1), but we didn't do so well in badminton (either way).
	   Our match with Karak began at 5.30, and we lost the first two
games; then the rain stopped the playing. We came home in a
downpour and were absolutely soaked when we were finally blown in
through the front door by the strong wind.
	   We had a late dinner, and then Munzir complained that his new
sarong didn't come back from the dhoby today. Rosli and Say Kuang,
who checked the clothes, reported that 22 sarongs were sent on
Saturday and 22 came back today - but Munzir's new one was not
among them.
	   We checked everyone's cupboard and bag tonight - which was a
good idea, because the bags had not been down from the tops of the
cupboards for weeks, and they were covered with dust and needed a
good cleaning.
	   Then we checked the shelves in the bedroom - which was a good
idea, too, for the same reason. But we didn't find the sarong.
	   Bakar and some of the others were chasing Syed Adanan around
upstairs this afternoon before study hours - with the aim of
pulling his sarong down - and they knocked over a tin of ink onto
Nyit Chin's mattress.
	   ``Starting tomorrow,'' I announced, ``study hours will start at
two instead of 2.30.'' That should do it.
	   The Poster Contest got underway this afternoon - with a hallful
of students from the Sulaiman School, the Khai Mun School, and
M.E.S. We can see that the quality of the posters is going to be
very high, and it will be extremely difficult to judge them.
	   The theme was Give to the Lady Templer Hospital Fund; the drive
had begun, and tomorrow they'll be selling flags in the school. The
Fun Fair had been cancelled for some reason or other, but there
will be a money- raising social at the Kwongsi Association tomorrow
night.
	   They're even selling tickets to tomorrow's football game - but I
wondered how they intend to control the crowd who haven't bought
tickets.
	   The main event of the day was the Poster Contest. We kept the
contestants strictly to the time limit and collected all the
posters, finished or not, at five.
	   Three teachers from Khai Mun School came to help with the
judging, but no one came from Sulaiman School.
	   First prize went to a boy from the Khai Mun School, but we took
second (Osman) and third (Johari); Tengku Ahmad and Lurn Kok Seng
both got Honourable Mentions.
	   After the judging, it was raining, and we had to wait quite
awhile before it slackened enough for us to take the posters to the
Kwongsi Association where we pinned them up on display for
tonight's social.
	   I didn't make it out tonight because it rained constantly, but
the boys who took their night out stopped by to see the display. No
one was more surprised at the results than Tengku Ahmad.
	   When the clothes came back from the dhoby this afternoon, the
boys doing the checking found several pieces that had no laundry
marks on them.
	   I distributed the clothes and asked each boy to take them
upstairs and mark them right then and there.
	   Alias was marking his, so I asked Sunny to borrow Alias' ink to
do his.
	   ``No,'' said Sunny, ``he's not my friend.''
	   I called them down and asked: ``Now what's this all about?'' It
seems they were having a spat because Alias had called Sunny
`kling'.
	   So we had a long talk, and in the end they shook hands.
	   I hope that's the end of it.
	   The boys in Forms Three and Four are beginning to get worried
about the approaching exams. Munzir and Murad had even gone so far
as to request permission to stay up late and/or get up early to
study.
	   They really are worried! Osman Sham spent his last day with us
and left for Ipoh this afternoon to take up his post as assistant
district officer.
	   He may not be stationed in Ipoh, but he had to report there for
his appointment.
	   We certainly hated to see him go because the Form Three and Four
students were just beginning to learn something about Geography,
Math, and Science - but we were happy for him.
	   We expect great things of Osman, and, as one of the boys said:
``Some day he'll be famous and we'll be proud that he was our
teacher.''
	   Inspector Niuh told me this morning that the police would be all
out to win their game with us this evening, and afterwards he
boasted: ``Well, we got our revenge.'' The score was 4-1 in favour
of the police, and there were several scratches and bruises to
doctor tonight.
	   I promised the boys that if we won the game we'd have Cha Cha
Cha Boom here at the hostel tonight. Needless to say, we spent the
evening studying.
	   Some of the LCE students are going to stay up until 11: and
Munzir tells me he has set his alarm for four in the morning. I
wonder if he'll hear it go off.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Samper saying incentives must be
offered to drug farmers &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Taking issue with U.S. views, Colombia's
president said Tuesday that wiping out narcotic fields will be
ineffective in the long run without programs to encourage farmers
to grow alternate crops.
	   ``Our experience has been that forced eradication, if not
accompanied by crop substitution programs, we find illicit crops in
the very same fields,'' President Ernesto Samper told reporters
during the second day of the U.N. General Assembly special session
on drugs.
	   Samper said Colombia has been carrying out fumigation programs
to destroy illicit cocoa fields.
	   ``But once the field has been fumigated, if there is no program
to offer the peasant crop substitution, he has no other choice but
to resow cocoa,'' Samper added.
	   During the three-day conference, which began Monday, delegates
from 150 countries are considering a U.N. program to combat drugs
in the next century.
	   The plan calls for, among other things, offering Third World
farmers financial incentives to stop growing opium poppies, cocoa
and cannabis.
	   During his speech to the opening session, President Clinton
announced a dlrs 2 billion, five-year media campaign against drugs,
targeting young people with a message that drugs ``destroy young
lives.''
	   Only dlrs 175 million of the dlrs 2 billion would be federal
funds; the rest would be contributed by corporations and
philanthropic organizations.
	   But U.S. officials showed little enthusiasm for the U.N. crop
substitution program, which is also unpopular in the
Republican-dominated Congress. Critics consider the plan
ineffective and simply a move to pay off the very people at the
root of the global drug crisis.
	   ``It is not clear to me that resources will bulldoze the
solution,'' U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey told reporters Monday.
``It's a problem for regional community solutions, not just funding
for alternative economic development.''
	   But Samper said the issue is one of economic practicality.
Colombian farmers can earn 10 times as much money from growing
cocoa as from corn, he said.
	   ``So to ask (a farmer) to sow a crop he cannot sell when he's
got an option that's 10 times more profitable is impractical,''
Samper said. ``I hope the U.S. Congress understands this.''
	   During his speech, Clinton also urged world leaders to avoid
``pointing fingers'' and work together to combat drugs. But that
did not prevent speakers from the Caribbean and Latin America for
blaming drug-consuming nations like the United States for not doing
its share to reduce demand.
	   ``The illicit drug trade is demand-driven,'' Prime Minister
Denzil Douglas of the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis
said. ``How can we truly expect small, poor countries such as mine
to defeat the wealthy drug lords if the rich countries, with their
wealth of resources, are unsuccessful in limiting the demand.''
	   President Hugo Banzer of Bolivia said his government was
committed to eradicating illegal production of cocoa, which is used
to produce cocaine.
	   But Banzer said the program will cost dlrs 952 million over five
years. He appealed to the United States and other wealthy countries
to pick up 85 percent of the cost of the program.

	   MALACCA, Sat. - The Transport Ministry has called for a meeting
with the schoolbus operators' associations to discuss ways to
prevent accidents involving pupils.
	   Deputy Minister Datuk Wira Mohd Ali Rustam said the meeting
would be held at his office in Kuala Lumpur next week.
	   ``Since the beginning of this year, three kindergarten pupils
have been killed in accidents.
	   ``We hope to get input from association members on preventing
accidents,''
	   he said after visiting the family of P. Darsheni Dewi, six, who
was killed when she was run over by a schoolbus in front of her
house in Taman Bukit Sebukor on Monday.
	   She was alighting from the bus when she fell. Not realising she
had fallen, the driver drove off.
	   Mohd Ali said police are investigating.
	   ``The driver has been released on bail of RM5,000,'' he said.
	   Under section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act, offenders shall
be liable to imprisonment of up to five years or fines not
exceeding RM10,000 or both.
	   Mohd Ali said drivers and bus conductors must be responsible for
children's safety. ``They must always make sure that the children
reach their homes safely,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The policymaking board of the new
European Central Bank held its first meeting Tuesday as part of
preparations for the launch of the continent's single currency next
year.
	   At a news conference afterward, bank president Wim Duisenberg
said the 11 central banks in the euro zone will pay around 4
billion euros into the ECB's base capital by July 1. One euro is
expected to be worth roughly the same as a dollar.
	   He also said there was a consensus among the central bankers
that between 10 percent and 15 percent of the total reserves to be
transferred to the ECB will be in gold.
	   But the meeting largely avoided monetary questions, focusing
instead on internal issues.
	   ``Some organizational decisions have been made,'' Luxembourg
central bank head Yves Mersch said. Spanish central bank head Luis
Angel Rojo said it entailed ``only procedures, and no decisions.''
	   Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet and his Portuguese
colleague, Antonio de Sousa, called the meeting ``historic,'' and
others also expressed satisfaction with it.
	   The bank's six-member executive board and the 11 heads of the
central banks of nations participating in European currency union
make up the governing council.
	   The bank, based in Frankfurt, will set monetary policy for the
11 inaugural members when monetary union begins Jan. 1.

	   KOTA KINABALU, Sat. - Chief Minister Tan Sri Bernard Giluk
Dompok has called on chambers of commerce in Sabah to pool their
resources to effectively weather the economic downturn.
	   He said close co-operation among chambers of commerce was vital
to ensure the business community continued to make positive
contributions towards the development of the State.
	   ``I hope the existing co-operation among chambers of commerce in
the State will continue to be enhanced,'' he said at the
Kadazandusun Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) installation
of office bearers here last night.
	   Also present were KCCI president Datuk Ajit Andrew Galun, Sabah
Bumiputera Chamber of Commerce president Datuk Musa Aman and Sabah
United Chinese Chambers of Commerce president Datuk Sari Tan Nuar.
	   The State Government, Dompok said, would like to see chambers of
commerce play a leading role in establishing more joint venture
projects between local and foreign firms.
	   Dompok gave an assurance that the State Government would
continue to support efforts by the chambers to encourage business
collaborations between Bumiputera and non-Bumiputera entrepreneurs.

	   THE UK has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the
world, 20 times higher than Romania and Indonesia, says a study in
the Lancet. No country wants to head the league table of a disease
and it's dismal, indeed, that the UK is not only the place where as
a woman you're most likely to die from breast cancer, but also to
have your children inconvenienced by wheezing.
	   A total of 463,801 children aged from 13-14 in 56 countries were
asked the same questions (such as, `have you had wheezing or
whistling in the chest in the last 12 months?') to ascertain the
level of, not only asthma, but other related allergic conditions.
	   The highest level of reported symptoms of asthma were in
English- speaking countries, specifically, the UK, New Zealand,
Australia and the Republic of Ireland. The other allergic
conditions were more widely distributed world-wide. Previous
studies have shown the same pattern, with such mysteries as why the
US has substantially lower rates of the disease compared with the
UK.
	   Over one million children in the UK have asthma, and the
incidence of the disease has risen ludicrously, doubling between
1964 and 1989. So far there are no clear leads. Increasing
awareness and better diagnosis by family doctors can only explain
part of the rise.
	   While pollution is an obvious candidate, the Lancet study
suggested that the global pattern showed that it was not a major
risk factor for developing the disease, although it may exacerbate
the condition.
	   China and Eastern Europe, which have some of the highest levels
of air pollutants generally had low rates of asthma, while New
Zealand, not known for its smog, had one of the highest levels.
Similarly, a study carried out by the UK part of ISAAC, published
earlier this year in the BMJ found that the incidence of asthma in
12-14-years-olds was higher in rural than in urban areas.
	   Apart from pollution, the other suspect has been the microscopic
but sinister house-dust mite, thought to have been encouraged by
the British's unhealthy penchant for wall to wall carpeting and
tropical levels of central heating. But house-dust mites on their
own, (although reducing levels does relieve symptoms) are not
responsible for the epidemic of asthma, Neither are pets, which
exacerbate symptoms but don't start them off.
	   Rather it is likely to be a concoction of things, many of which
researchers are already on to. The emphasis is moving towards
trying to prevent children from getting asthma, and some measures
involve taking action at a fetal level. You can't change your genes
(yet) and a strong family history of allergy or asthma can lead to
a 40 per cent chance of a child getting it. If your mother suffers
from allergies, your risk is higher than if your father does. Yet
environmental factors may be essential to trigger the switch.
	   This switch can mean the difference between developing an immune
system that responds appropriately to irritants or one that
produces the symptoms of asthma: wheezing, night-time cough,
breathlessness on exercise and chest tightness.
	   Poverty has been linked to asthma, the specific factors being
dampness and moulds. High salt diets, and junk food in particular
have been linked to an increase in asthma rates.
	   Breast feeding has long been thought to be protective but the
evidence is not clear cut, and it may need to be prolonged (for up
to a year) to be effective. It does reduce the risk of exzema and
food allergy and for a million other reasons is worth doing.
	   Children with older siblings are less likely to get asthma,
probably because they are exposed to infections very early in life,
which may overwhelm their immune system into behaving normally.
	   Cigarette smoke is consistently found to trigger symptoms of
asthma, and smoking in pregnancy is thought to increase the risk of
a child developing the disease. Maternal diet and exposure to
environmental triggers may also play a part.
	   While researchers are trying to detect why asthma rates vary so
much across the globe, there are worrying signs that the disease is
still undetected.
	   The ISAAC research found that up to 3 per cent of the over
27,000 children in the study had moderate to severe asthma symptoms
but had never been diagnosed or treated.

	   Kamol Sukin reports on the government's mishandling of the
country's labour problems.
	   The seven government measures to solve unemployment, officially
over two million Thais are unemployed, seem to be too little, too
late.
	   The measure seen as the most solid, so far, was when the
government forced out illegal foreign workers to increase
employment opportunities for Thais. However, the policy has been
called a misconception because foreign workers had been employed
for jobs that Thais had refused because they were too tiring or
paid too little.
	   This measure was aimed to make 300,000 jobs, held by illegal
foreign workers in 35 provinces, vacant. The latest report from the
Labour Department said that 120,000 workers had been repatriated
but only 80,000 of the vacancies had been filled by Thais.
	   The second measure was to create jobs, with cooperation from
construction contractors who had been asked to use manpower instead
of machines. This too was criticised because it was considered
short-term employment which would cover a very small number of the
unemployed.
	   The government also attempted to continue employment in the
industrial sector, however its implementation has been considered
unsystematic.
	   One of the few projects which have received widespread support
is the one initiated by His Majesty the King on integrated farming.
However, it has been considered a long-term project with no clear
target and therefore, impractical.
	   The other three projects -- the Thai-Help-Thai project which
sells cheap consumer goods to raise cash; the project through which
Thai labourers are sent to work overseas and the project to monitor
and asses all other measures -- are merely campaign measures rather
than an effective solution to the problem.
	   Most of the seven measures launched by the national unemployment
committee, headed by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, were not really
welcomed by groups, especially labour organisations. The projects
did not receive any applause mainly because they seem to provide
little help for the unemployed.
	   ''Only less than 15 per cent of all written in the paper was
implemented,'' head of the State Enterprise Labour Association
Somsak Kosaisuk said.
	   Prof Nikhom Chandrawitoon, social critic and government adviser
on labour affairs, said the measures were inefficient because their
bureaucratic process caused problems.
	   The lack of sufficient data is another problem which has brought
about the mishandling of the issue, Labour economist Lae
Dilokwattayarat said agreeing with critics and labour
organisations.
	   ''The best example is the data about amount of unemployment in
the country. The figure of two million was estimated based on the
figure collected from reports of bureaucrats. How unreliable could
it be?'' he said.
	   However, according to the latest report from the National
Statistics Office unemployment is as high as 2.8 million, which
does not include the 500,000 new graduates, or 8.8 per cent of the
country's total labour force, who are still jobless.
	   Vice president of Thailand's Development Research Institute
(TDRI) Niphon Phuaphongsathorn has recently suggested that the
government establish a labour information centre to make management
systematic, efficient and transparent.
	   The government's mismanagement of labour has been widely
criticised as one without vision. Critics say that the government's
window dressing is not enough and what's really needed are labour
protection laws and regulations.
	   The 1998 Labour Protection Act will finally be enforced on Aug
19 this year. However, the Low Income Labour Fund as well as the
Unemployment Fund, considered by labour organisations as the proper
tool, have received no response from the government over the past
six months. Labour-related funds as well as the urgent fund for the
unemployed, supported by Prof Nikhom, have hardly been able to
attract the government's attention.
	   ''Labour issues are the last priority when compared to financial
ones,'' concluded Prof Nikhom.

	   They may have different lifestyles, but Ray McDonald, Yuenyong
Opakul and Amita Tata Young have one thing in common -- they have
decided to buy shares of Bangchak Petroleum Plc.
	   The celebrities said they did not want to see the Thai-owned
company taken over by foreigners.
	   ''If I can help, I will. It's time for Thai people to help each
other. Actually there are many people out there who can afford to
buy some shares. We should do it,'' said Ray, a popular actor.
	   Songs-for-life artist Yuenyong, better known as Ad Carabao, said
he would ask his fans to buy some shares.
	   ''I just want to sneer at the power brokers [who say Bangchak
should be sold]. I want to show them that people like us think
differently from them,'' he said.
	   Teen-idol Tata Young, meanwhile, said Bangchak should be run by
Thais and that Thai people should be its beneficiaries.
	   -------Having abandoned the political arena for two years to
farm and run a leadership training school in Kanchanaburi, former
Palang Dharma Party leader Chamlong Srimuang seems to have much
more time to reflect.
	   He says he prefers living an austere life to being a politician.
	   ''It doesn't mean that I want to avoid hard work [as a
politician]. Compared with my political career, I feel more
comfortable with my current job,'' he said.
	   He admitted that his life has dramatically changed -- from being
always in the limelight to living in a rural area.
	   ''Actually I didn't want to seek popularity. But fame is a
by-product [for people in politics]. At that time life was hectic
and I didn't have time for myself. But now I'm happier,'' he said.
	   His wife Sirilak Srimuang agreed.
	   ''We feel more relaxed than before. When he was a politician, I
was always concerned about him, especially about his security
during election campaigns,'' she said.
	   Although many supporters had asked Chamlong to return to
politics, Sirilak said she tried to persuade him to stay clear of
it.
	   -------Despite a busy schedule, particularly over a takeover
battle for a big Belgian bank, Jan Kalff, chairman of ABN Amro Bank
from The Netherlands, has confirmed his visit to Bangkok this week.
He is due to host a reception at The Oriental hotel Tuesday.
	   ABN Amro Bank is increasing its presence in Thailand with a new
office and the recent control of Bank of Asia.
	   In case he misses home, here is the lead report from the Wall
Street Journal Europe: ''Jan Kalff should have read his Julius
Caesar. In the Gallic War, the Roman emperor recounts how he nearly
lost the conquest of Europe to a rag-tag alliance of Belgian
tribes. Last weekend, a similar alliance all but dashed the hopes
of ABN Amro's chairman for conquering Europe's retail banking
market.''

	   TYCOON Thaksin Shinawatra, living up to the local adage that
''if you have something to say, say it loudly'', has done it again.
This time he has launched a media blitz, taking out full-page
display advertisements to unveil his new political party.
	   Under the slogan ''New Constitution: new thinking, new doing for
every Thai'', Thaksin presented himself, or what critics called
Thaksin Inc, as a catalyst to form the new party.
	   In keeping with the pledge for a broad-based party, people will
Tuesday be asked to mail in their suggestions for the party name.
	   Among the suggested names are Nawathai (New Thai), Prachatham
(People's Justice), Thai Rak Thai (Thais-love-Thais), Prachakom
(Community) and Raksthai (Thai Guardian).
	   Respondents to the advertisements are also requested to outline
their thoughts on the party platform.
	   Without a ready platform, Thaksin displayed a picture of himself
in a forward-looking pose with the country's flag in the
background, as evidence of his leadership.

African leaders propose peace mission to Ethiopia, Eritrea

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ African leaders on Tuesday
agreed in principle to send a peace mission to the Horn of Africa
where Ethiopia and Eritrea showed no signs of abandoning their
deadly border dispute.
	   But rganization of African Unity spokesman Pascal Gayama said no
final decision was taken by the 29 heads of state and government
who debated the issue during a closed-door session devoted almost
entirely to the conflict.
	   Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldetensae praised the idea,
but his Ethiopian counterpart Seyoum Mesfin downplayed the
proposal, saying his country did not favor ``a proliferation of
mediation attempts.''
	   Last week the United States and Rwanda presented both sides with
a four-point peace plan that included, among others, a
recommendation that Eritrea withdraw to positions held before May 6
when clashes first began.
	   Ethiopia accepted the plan, but Eritrea said it was incomplete.
	   A Burkina Faso diplomat, who asked not to be further identified,
said the delegation would likely be headed by Burkina President
Blaise Campaore in his current role as OAU chairman and would
include presidents from each of Africa's five major regions.
	   In a statement issued at the three-day summit, the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry warned that its infantry and heavy artillery were
preparing to retaliate following an Ethiopian air attack early
Tuesday on Eritrean troops near Zala Ambessa, 105 kilometers (65
miles), southeast of the Ertirean capital, Asmara.
	   Eritrean forces captured the Ethiopian border town in a June 2-4
battle. Ethiopia charged Tuesday that Eritrean troops had attacked
its defensive positions south of the town.
	   Fresh troops deployed to the area would ``confront these attacks
resolutely in order to defend (Eritrea's) sovereignty and
territorial integrity,'' the Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Eritrea accused its opponents of launching a `` wave of
offensives,'' including ``indiscriminate attacks on civilians,''
but said Asmara remained hopeful that the solution to the dispute
``lies in peace and legality.''
	   Late Monday, the foreign ministers from both countries traded
accusations that each side was escalating the conflict which began
in mid-May. Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin threatened
that Eritrea faced ``full-scale war'' unless it accepted a peace
plan proposed by Rwandan and U.S. negotiators.
	   Eritrea ``has opted to escalate the conflict to a full-scale
war, for which it has to bear full responsibility for the
consequences,'' Seyoum said.
	   The Ethiopian minister urged the OAU to pressure Eritrea to
withdraw from disputed areas before entering talks. Eritrea says it
is inside its own territory and calls instead for an immediate
cease-fire and the start of direct talks ``in the presence of
high-level mediators.''

	   THE Interior Ministry will receive the biggest chunk from the
Bt30 billion the government plans to draw from fiscal reserves to
revive the economy through social safety-net programmes, a
well-informed source said Monday.
	   The Government House source said the Budget Bureau has finalised
how to divide the Bt30 billion and will propose additional
allocations for the Cabinet's approval Tuesday.
	   The Interior Ministry will receive Bt6.6 billion from the budget
increase, the source said. Earlier, the Interior Ministry's
proposed spending was cut by Bt33.5 billion.
	   On June 2, the Cabinet resolved to draw Bt30 billion from the
reserve for spending as part of the the 1998 fiscal year, which
ends in September.
	   According to the source, the Budget Bureau set Bt2 billion of
the amount as a central fund for maintaining baht stability and
dividing the rest among ministries for launching social safety-net
projects.
	   The second largest earner from the increased budget will be the
Communications Ministry, which will receive Bt5.794 billion. Its
budget has been cut by Bt23.549 billion. The Education Ministry
will receive Bt4.764 billion, making it the third largest earner
from the increase budget. Earlier its budget was cut by Bt9.628
billion.
	   The Agriculture Ministry will become the fourth largest earner
of the increased budget with Bt2.945 billion.
	   The Budget Bureau has allocated Bt2.7 billion from the increased
budget to the Public Health Ministry, making it the fifth largest
earner.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Pele, Platini and Beckenbauer on the same team.
With Maradona, Garrincha and Cruyff in support.
	   A dream team for the century was unveiled Tuesday when
MasterCard announced the FIFA World Football Team. The group of
all-time all-stars featured four Brazilians, two Argentines, a
German, a Frenchman, a Russian, an Englishman and a Dutchman.
	   ``It is a great honor to be included with such players, the best
of soccer,'' Pele said.
	   The team was chosen by a worldwide panel of journalists, who
first voted for the 11 best players of the century in different
confederations. A total of five confederation teams, from Europe,
Africa, South America, North and Central America and the Caribbean,
and Asia and Oceania, were selected.
	   From those squads, 55 finalists were picked for balloting on the
world team.
	   The team consisted of Brazil's Pele, Garrincha, Nilton Santos
and Carlos Alberto; Argentinas Diego Maradona and Alfredo Di
Stefano; West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer; France's Michel Platini,
the co-chairman of the 1998 World Cup; the Soviet Union's Lev
Yashin; England's Bobby Moore; and the Netherlands' Johan Cruyff.
	   Pele, Garrincha and Maradona were selected as forwards. In
midfield were Cruyff, Di Stefano and Platini. On defense were
Beckenbauer, Moore; Carlos Alberto and Nilton Santos. The
goalkeeper was Yashin.
	   On behalf of the 11 players, MasterCard is making a donation to
the SOC Children's Villages, FIFA's official charity.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite the loss of Romario and coach Mario
Zagallo's worry about his defense, Brazil remained Britain
bookmaker Ladbrokes favorite to win the World Cup.
	   The defending champions were listed as 3-1 favorites, while
France was the second choice at 11-2. Italy was third at 6-1 with
both Argentina and Germany 7-1 picks.
	   England sliped to 9-1, its longest odds since qualifying while
the Netherlands and Spain were 10-1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Exiled Nigerian dissident Wole Soyinka is
asking soccer fans to use the World Cup as a way to protest
Nigeria's military government.
	   Speaking Tuesday regarding the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, the
1986 Nobel Prize winner in literature urged World Cup fans to jeer
the Nigerian flag, wear black arm bands or distribute pictures and
leaflets about the regime's atrocities.
	   Nigeria plays its first match in France '98 Saturday against
Spain in Nantes, France.
	   Soyinka said that ideally Nigeria should be treated the same way
as South Africa was during apartheid, including having its teams
banned from sporting events.
	   Barring that, he said, ``What we ask is at least some gesture of
solidarity with the Nigerian people.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A day after he was elected president of FIFA, Sepp
Blatter kept a low profile Tuesday, quietly helping in preparations
for the start of the World Cup.
	   Blatter, who loves the spotlight, will undoubtedly be more
public as the tournament, which starts Wednesday, progresses. Among
other things, he's expected to make at least one appearance at the
daily news briefings FIFA and French organizers hold _ but not just
yet.
	   ``Mr. Blatter is very busy trying to figure out how to spell
`president,' and just what it means,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian striker Enrico Chiesa was
preparing to return home Tuesday with the health of Alessandro Del
Piero and Moreno Torricelli improving.
	   The Parma forward, taken to France as Italy's 23rd player, had
been put on alert as a possible substitute if case either Del Piero
or Torricelli were too hurt to play.
	   Del Piero has recovered from a right thigh strain and is
expected to return to action against Cameroon next week.
	   Torricelli, suffering from a bruised right foot, resumed
training Tuesday.
	   Neither player is expected to be ready for Italy's World Cup
opener against Chile on Thursday.
	   Also from the Italian camp, striker Fabrizio Ravanelli was
battling a slight fever and cough Tuesday, but the team hopes he
will make the trip to Bordeaux for the game against Chile.

	   THE wars of words between the Democrat Party and the New
Aspiration Party intensified Monday with the former threatening to
file a libel suit against its rival.
	   Prime Minister and Democrat leader Chuan Leekpai, meanwhile,
gave the greenlight for PM's deputy secretary general Nipon
Boonyapattharo to send a letter criticising NAP's Parliament
President Wan Mohammad Noor Matha for having attacked Chuan.
	   NAP leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh also joined the fray Monday,
saying Chuan did not have anything to say except to attack other
politicians over alleged vote-buying.
	   The war of words originated from a satirical comment from Chuan
over the NAP's plan to make in-roads into the Democrat's stronghold
in the South. Chuan said the NAP can try to expand in the South but
it should not bring the scourge of vote-buying there.
	   Wan Noor retaliated by saying that the Democrats also bought
votes, especially in Phichit, which is the home province of
Democrat secretary-general Sanan Kachornprasart.
	   Without naming names, Wan Noor said a former NAP MP in Phichit,
who is now a Cabinet member and who defected to the Democrats, also
bought votes when he was with the NAP.
	   A Democrat source said the party's legal experts had considered
and believed that Democrat Deputy Commerce Minister Paitoon
Kaewthong could sue the Parliament president for defamation.
Paitoon, a Phichit MP, had defected from the NAP.
	   Reaffirming his statement, Wan Noor said he made the comment
during an internal party seminar and he could not help it if
newspapers played it up.
	   Wan Noor said he did not name names but the media could figure
out who it was ''so this is a fact''.
	   In his letter to the Parliament president, Nipon pointed out
that Chuan was simply making a general comment, asking the NAP to
''support'' the traditional political practice in the South, which
abhors vote-buying.
	   ''So, I would like to ask your excellency, Wan Mohammad Noor,
whether you came to the conclusion yourself. What did the prime
minister do to infuriate you so much that you lost control and
attacked the prime minister. Please explain,'' Nipon said in the
letter.
	   Nipon said he had informed Chuan about the letter and the prime
minister had not stopped him from submitting it to the Parliament
president.
	   Chavalit said Monday that it was no good getting angry with
Chuan about his vote-buying comment, ''because the prime minister
knows how to speak about only a few things -- principles, laws and
vote-buying''.
	   Later, Chuan confirmed that he had allowed Nipon to send the
letter and added that Democrat MPs would retaliate against any
criticism from the NAP.

	   THE Export-Import (Exim) Bank of Thailand's president Monday
defended the bank's lending policy following alleged political
pressure for his dismissal.
	   MR Pridiyathorn Devakula was blamed for failing to help ease the
liquidity crunch by providing more loans to cash-strapped
companies.
	   To boost companies' liquidity, the Exim bank received a Bt113
billion loan from local and foreign financial institutions. Of this
amount, Bt59.87 billion was allocated to exporters, leaving a
balance of Bt53.12 billion loan, or 53 per cent.
	   This facility of Bt113 billion included Bt33 billion packing
credit of the Bank of Thailand and $500 million from foreign banks.
	   It also included Bt12 billion from Japan's Exim bank and Bt40
billion loan from Asian Development Bank (ADB).
	   The Exim bank said it had allocated the ADB loan to 15 local
commercial banks. However, the money was still inaccessible to
exporters pending document approval to Exim by ADB.
	   Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi said there was a debate among economic ministers on
the role of the bank, but reasons given by the bank were
acceptable.
	   Supachai said there was no talk on the dismissal of the bank's
president.
	   The bank did not cause the problem as alleged, but companies
appeared not to be interested in borrowing the remainder.
	   For longer-term loan, the Exim bank is supposed to provide a
total of Bt3 billion for maritime and industry structural
adjustment. According to its plan, the Exim bank will grant a
5-year soft loan to the maritime business with Exim Bank
contributing another 50 per cent of the amount.
	   Another Bt1 billion from the central bank to exporters is for
change of machinery. Exim Bank will contribute another 75 per cent
of the amount.
	   A major problem is that Exim Bank borrowed in dollar term to
match the amount from Bank of Thailand since most borrowers wanted
dollar loans. Secondly, structural adjustment loan (SAL) in baht
(Bt1 billion) for maritime and machinery change has run into
problem since baht loan is not convenient for matching fund and
cost of this SAL is higher than other sources. Borrowers, who
wanted to borrow in baht, therefore, preferred baht loan from BOT
which is cheaper.
	   However, the Exim bank believed that private firms would turn to
borrow the SAL facility after the central bank used up its Bt3
billion. Currently, the Exim bank approved a Bt448 million SAL for
exporters to change its machinery.
	   In addition, US Exim has agreed to lend US$1 billion loan
(approx Bt4 billion) as a stand-by-guarantee through the Exim bank,
could not provide to the private firms because the loan agreement
has not been signed.
	   n Meanwhile, Exim Bank was also urged to increase packing credit
amounts lending to the sugar mills as liquidity-hit commercial
banks are expected to cut their lending to the sugar industry in
the upcoming sugarcane milling season.
	   In the last season, the Exim Bank and commercial banks had put
together Bt25 billion as packing credits to the sugar industry,
with the eximbank contributing Bt2.6 billion. According to an
official from the Industry Ministry, based on the projected 45
million tonnes of sugarcane output, the sugar industry would
require Bt27 billion of packing credit amounts in the 1998/99
upcoming season.
	   ''If the commercial banks reduce the packing credit amounts, the
eximbank will have to substitute the amounts unless it would affect
the capability of sugar mills in paying money to the cane
growers'', said the official. Sugar mills are usually bring in
their letter of credits from forward sugar sales contracts for
making the packing credits in Nov enabling them to have cash paying
to cane growers for the cane inputs.
	   Last week, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperative, the Government Saving Bank, and the Bank of Thailand
have agreed in principal to extend Bt6 billion for sugar mills to
have the so-called kiew money borrowing to the cane planters. Kiew
money is an advance payment made to cane growers for them to have
funding for their cane plantations.
	   The office of Cane and Sugar Board is also negotiating with ABN
Amro Bank, Rabo Bank and ING Baring to choose one of them within
this month to lend US$80 million to the Thai cane and sugar
industry. According to the official, half of the offshore loan will
be allocated to sugar mills for fixing and maintenance of their
machineries and the other half for kiew money purpose.
	   The BAAC loan, amounted to Bt3 billion, will be available from
June 15.

	   THE Telephone Organisation of Thailand's (TOT) chairman Mechai
Viravaidya has started his new information-accessibility policy by
having the board disclose its agenda to the public Monday.
	   Mechai insists that TOT be transparent because the agency's
business has a great impact on public well-being.
	   ''TOT is an agency responsible for several public services.
Every step it takes has to be transparent. The meeting's agenda is
something which will tell the public what we are doing,'' Mechai
said.
	   It is the first time in 44 years, since it has been established,
that TOT has decided to release information considered
confidential. However, the other state telecom carrier, the
Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) does not have such a
policy.
	   Since the TOT is preparing for its privatisation later this
year, public exposure is one of the many tasks it has to undertake
before it is listed on the stock market.
	   A state enterprise policy committee, chaired by Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, will meet next week to discuss ways
to make the stock listing process for TOT and its neighbour CAT
successful.
	   Meanwhile Mechai also restructured the board's organisation by
making TOT's president work as the board secretary instead of
letting the executive vice president do the job.
	   The board secretary plays an important role in screening the
board's agenda and information, thus making him a target for
private lobbyists who seek special favours. Sometimes companies
even track inside information about a board meeting from the board
secretary. This gives the board secretary considerable power.
	   In the past some board secretaries have demanded secret
payments, for example a percentage of the value of the proposed
project, from private proponents, according to TOT sources.
	   ''Many international organisations have the top boss work as a
board secretary, so our president should do this job as well,''
Mechai said.
	   To create transparency in the organisation, Mechai has
instructed TOT to let employees' representatives attend every board
meeting to help create mutual understanding.
	   According to the agenda released Monday, the management will
report its business activities until the end of March, the second
quarter of TOT's fiscal year, which ends in September.
	   Also they will report the burden to be shouldered by TOT after
private concessionaire RadioPhone Co pulled out of the business,
leaving 7,719 trunk mobile-phone terminals in the state agency's
care.
	   RadioPhone terminated its contract on April 1, claiming that
business prospects were too low.
	   The cancellation of Ericsson's bid for supplying telephone
equipment for integrated services digital network (ISDN), the use
of digital switches to improve TOT's network and the agency's plans
with satellite mobile-phone service GlobalStar were some of the
agenda issues announced.

 &UR; Netanyahu considering referendum on troop withdrawal &QL;

Netanyahu aide on referendum, Palestinian reaction. Changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
seriously considering taking an American proposal for an Israeli
troop withdraw from the West Bank to the public in a nationwide
referendum, his aide said Tuesday.
	   Palestinians, who have already accepted the American deal,
criticized the move as a stalling tactic.
	   Netanyahu himself said that public input was important on such a
crucial decision.
	   ``It is obligatory, above all, that there be broad public
support so the rifts in the nation will heal and we have domestic
peace, not just external peace,'' he said in an interview on Israel
Radio.
	   A show of public support for the withdrawal could help Netanyahu
weather the political storm that authorizing it would bring.
Right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down
his government if he goes ahead with a pullback.
	   Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that
a final decision on a referendum would be made in the next few
days.
	   ``My feeling is that a vote will probably be on a package
regarding the present discussions which will include Palestinian
compliance and the total scope of withdrawals by Israel before
final status decisions are made,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   After much wrangling and delay, Israel's Cabinet is expected to
vote by the end of the week on a U.S. initiative for a 13 percent
pullback from the West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Netanyahu was using
the referendum as an excuse not to carry out withdrawals Israel has
committed to completing.
	   ``The peace process, the political process and implementing the
redeployments do not need a referrendum. What is needed is a prime
minister that is serious about the implementation of agreements,''
Asfour told the AP.
	   According to Israeli media reports, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Israel on Monday to quickly overcome internal disputes on the
pullback and move ahead to so-called final-status talks with the
Palestinians, in which thorny issues including Jerusalem's future
are to be decided.
	   Netanyahu said security considerations, not internal politics,
were holding up a vote.
	   ``My considerations are over what is the best agreement from the
point of view of security, settlement and the national interest,''
he told Israel Radio. ``And of course that there will be
reciprocity _ that the Palestinians will fulfill their
commitments.''
	   The Palestinians, who currently have full control over 3 percent
of the West Bank and partial control over another 24 percent, have
accepted the American initiative.
	   Under the American plan _ which has been widely reported but
never formally unveiled _ a second Israeli redeployment would take
place in three stages over 12 weeks. It would bring full and
partial Palestinian control over the West Bank to 40 percent.
	   Peace talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for more
than 15 months. They stalled after groundbreaking on a Jewish
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want the city's eastern sector as their future
capital, but Israel claims jurisdiction over all Jerusalem.
	   Bitter disputes have broken out in recent weeks over Jewish
settlers' moves into Arab parts of town, which Palestinians view as
land grabs in advance of any settlement of Jerusalem's status.
	   Before dawn on Monday, Jewish settlers took over five apartments
in two buildings in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan, setting off
angry confrontations with residents.
	   And on Tuesday, Israel's interior ministry gave key approval for
the construction of more Jewish homes in east Jerusalem.

	   THE Charoen Pokphand Group has taken a major step to consolidate
12 companies of the group through share swaps and warrants so that
its agro-industrial and aquaculture businesses are under one listed
vehicle -- Charoen Pokphand Feedmill Plc (CPF).
	   Monday, CPF said it will tender an offer to swap shares of the
three listed units -- Charoen Pokphond Northeastern Plc (CPNE),
Bangkok Agro-Industrial Products Plc (BAP), and Bangkok Produce
Merchandising Plc (BKP).
	   For the nine unlisted firms, CPF will issue warrants for CP
Group, major shareholders of these firms. The plan is subject to
shareholder resolution approval on July 14.
	   The nine unlisted companies are Bangkok Feedmill Co Ltd, Charoen
Pokphand Industry Co Ltd, Bangkok Livestock Processing Co Ltd,
Bangkok Farm Co Ltd, CP Agro Industry Co Ltd, BP Feedmill Co Ltd,
Ratchaburi Feedmill Co Ltd, CP Food Product Co Ltd, and CP Food
Industry Export Co Ltd.
	   Ratchaburi Feedmill is a subsidiary of Bangkok Feedmill. CP Food
Product is a subsidiary of Bangkok Livestock Processing, while CP
Food Industry Export is a subsidiary of Bangkok Livestock
Processing and Bangkok Farm.
	   ''The consolidation falls in line with market sentiment that if
the group's businesses are not doing well, joining the companies
that operates similar businesses into one might bring better
results. However, the share swap will not bring new money to CPF,''
said an analyst of a local brokerage house.
	   He said consolidation through such method is good because the
three companies can be delisted from the stock market without
suffering a loss of image. Also, they can later re-enter the
market.
	   Kongkiat Opaswongkarn, CEO of Asset Plus Securities Co Ltd, said
consolidation of listed and unlisted units is one way to
restructure CP's vast business empire.
	   He said creditors of CP will also have more alternatives in
negotiations with the group on debts.
	   CP previously diversified aggressively into non-core businesses
resulting in heavy foreign debts.
	   In the process of consolidation, CPF will raise registered
capital to Bt2.73 billion from Bt1.2 billion through the issuance
of 153.49 million new common shares. Moreover, CPF will also sell
50 million warrants with a maturity of four years valued at a total
of Bt1 billion to CP Group.
	   According to the CPF, about 43.49 million capital increase
shares will be used to pay for acquisition of the three companies
-- CPNE, BAP, and BKP. The three companies are altogether worth
about Bt2.35 billion.
	   About 6.45 million capital shares of CPF will be swapped for the
shares of CPNE at the ratio of 27 CPF shares to 54 CPNE shares. CPF
will pay CPNE Bt27 apiece. After the share swap, CPF will hold
94.07 per cent in CPNE against the current ownership of 57 per
cent.
	   Another 13.62 million CPF capital increase shares will be
exchanged for BAP shares at the ratio of 61 CPF shares to 54 BAP
shares. BAP will offer CPF Bt61 a share. After consolidation, CPF's
stake in BAP will rise from 59.82 per cent to 90.17 per cent. For
the BKP sale, shares will be set at Bt22 apiece. CPF will exchange
about 23.4 of its capital increase shares with BKP shareholders at
the ratio of 22 CPF shares for 54 BKP shares. After the
transaction, CPF's 67.93 per cent stake in BKP will increase to
72.1 per cent.
	   Another 60 million new common CPF shares will be offered to
investors via a private placement. The remaining 50 million shares
will be reserved for its warrants which can be converted to the
company's common share at the ratio of 1:1 for Bt80 apiece.
	   CPF said it will pay cash for the purchase of Bangkok Feedmill,
Charoen Pokphand Industry, Bangkok Livestock Processing, Bangkok
Farm, CP Agro Industry, and BP Feedmill to CP Group. The deal is
totally worth Bt4 billion.
	   CP Group and its subsidiaries have signed an agreement with CPF
to divest their BAP, BKP and CPNE shares which will enable CPF and
its subsidiaries to hold at least 94, 82 and 91 per cent in BAP,
BKP and CPNE respectively.
	   According to the company, the objective of the consolidation is
to have the entire group's agro-industry and aquaculture businesses
to be under CPF which is a reflection of CPF's corporate strategy
to invest solely in its core business activities.
	   The recapitalisation of CPF will expand CPF's common shares from
the current 120 million shares to 213.5 million shares excluding
the warrants. The post-consolidation shareholding structure will be
CPG and its subsidiaries (49 per cent), cross-holding by CPF
subsidiaries (8 per cent), and public (43 per cent).
	   In terms of market capitalisation, the consolidation will place
CPF in the top 20 list of companies on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand.
	   CPF has appointed Phatra Securities as its financial advisers.
Phatra and Merrill Lynch (Asia-Pacific) are mandated the
joint-underwriters of the private placement issue.

	   SCANDAL-PLAGUED Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) is planning to
raise Bt15 billion in new capital to complete its plan of raising a
total of Bt25 billion.
	   BBC president Aswin Kongsiri made the statement after submitting
the recapitalisation plan to the Bank of Thailand for
consideration.
	   ''We want to increase capital as planned earlier, but the
central bank asks us to wait for a privatisation study conducted by
JP Morgan,'' he said.
	   Since taking over the management of BBC in May 1996, Industrial
Finance Corp of Thailand has proposed the bank be recapitalised by
Bt25 billion. As the central bank's Financial Institution
Development Fund holds a majority stake in the bank, it plans to
inject more money in addition to the Bt10 billion given the bank in
early 1998.
	   The economic crisis has caused a suspension of the plan as the
FIDF, which extended more than Bt1 trillion to cash-strapped
financial institutions, cannot spend money without government
approval.
	   Aswin Monday met officials of JP Morgan, a US investment bank
tasked to complete privatisation plans for all four nationalised
banks -- BBC, First Bangkok City Bank, Siam City Bank and Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said earlier the
privatisation plans should be completed around the end of this
month.
	   Aswin Monday ruled out the possibility that his bank would be
merged with state-run Krung Thai Bank (KTB) as rumoured after BOT
Governor MR Chatu Mongol Sonakul said last week the financial
authorities planned to merge the three nationalised banks,
excluding BBC, to one or two entities to conserve banking licences
in the next few years.
	   He said IFCT has a clear plan for reviving the bank. Aswin said
he has submitted a rehabilitation plan to the central bank. Under
the plan, IFCT will eventually purchase a 10 per cent stake in BBC
every year until its stake reaches 50 per cent. Next year, when the
management period reaches three years, IFCT is allowed to hold a 11
per cent stake.
	   ''Thus, merger with KTB should not take place,'' Aswin said.
	   He said the bank is now tackling its rising non-performing loans
in the face of the country's deteriorating economy. Aswin also
believes loan restructuring regulations announced by the central
bank should help curb NPLs as well as the bankruptcy law.
	   Aswin told reporters BBC's credit growth is minimal due to
illiquidity. However, he predicted the economy will recover next
year and help reduce the bank's deposit costs. Moreover, the
further recapitalisation will help boost credit growth.
	   ''BBC will then extend more loans to [the real sector],'' he
added.

	   THE Charoen Pokphand Group will sell its non-core assets to
maintain the growth of its agro-business, telecommunications and
7-Eleven convenience store franchise, according to chairman Dhanin
Chearavanont.
	   One of Thailand's largest conglomerates, it will as a result of
the regional economic crisis sell or find partners for its
petrochemical and discount store operations as well as its non-core
activities in China such as the motorcycle operations and brewery,
he said.
	   CP Group recently sold part of its stake in 12 Lotus discount
stores nationwide to Tesco Co, a UK-based supermarket group, while
its motorcycle plant in Shanghai was sold to the local state
authorities.
	   Dhanin said Ford Motor Co of the US is interested in buying CP
Group's other motorcycle plant in China to use as a platform for an
engine production company there.
	   ''People still look for a partnership with us because we have
quality management in China,'' he said.
	   CP Group is also selling its brewery joint venture with Heineken
in China as well as the oil extraction plant and wheat flour plant
there. It recently sold its Chinese satellite operation.
	   ''Our aim is to secure the operation of the parent company in
Thailand,'' Dhanin admitted.
	   Dhanin said Thailand's economic freedom is, in a de facto sense,
at an end because foreigners have seized the country's financial
sector -- the lifeblood of businesses. But the CP Group chief noted
that while foreign investors and creditors have the money,
technology and manpower skill -- all of which Thailand lacks --
they must still operate or be made to abide by Thai laws.
	   CP Group has a foreign loan exposure through the parent company
and TelecomAsia Plc.
	   Other CP executives said the group's activities in Indonesia
have also been hit by the current economic trends, with the large
depreciation of the local currency causing costs of feed imports to
spiral.
	   Its shrimp farming operation located on Java was undermined by
rising feed costs, while demand for chicken fell by half.
	   Dhanin said the overall exports of the group were still bright.
CP will maintain and expand its agro-business operations because
''we have a comparative advantage on a global basis.'' He said the
group wants to expand into fish and non-toxic vegetable production
worldwide.
	   ''We want to move into processed food production to sell to
developed markets such as the US and to buy from them their fish
heads, pork legs, etc, which the Americans do not eat.'' CP Group
has also set sights on forging a partnership with Seattle-based
Microsoft Co, the world's largest computer software company, to
launch electronic money cards called ''Electronic Wallets'' for
customers of the nearly 1,000 7-Eleven convenience stores.
	   ''It is truly electronic and the customers do not need cash at
all. We can also facilitate insurance sales and coverage through
the cards,'' he said.
	   Each 7-Eleven store will have personal computers for customers
to use as a multimedia vehicle. The CP Group also plans to
introduce web-TV through a UTV cable operation with Microsoft.

	   TWENTY real estate developers have expressed their interest in
joining local holiday time-share firm Multiple Travel Club Co's
(MTC) as the number of participants is expected to double this
year.
	   MTC, a leading operator of holiday time-shares in Thailand,
announced on June 1 and 2 that it was seeking new business partners
to join the company's time-share programme in Pattaya, Phuket and
Koh Samui. Between June 1 and 5, about 20 operators of hotels,
resorts or condominiums contacted MTC about joining the programme,
according to MTC president Vittayen Muttamara.
	   Five of the companies were from the North, including Chiang Mai,
Chiang Rai, and Lampang provinces. Seven were from the South, and
four each were from the East and Northeast.
	   MTC said only 11 of the 20 companies would qualify to join the
time-share programme.
	   With a significant number of real estate developers joining the
programme under the current economic situation, the holiday travel
management service has been shown to be effective in attracting
foreign money. And such business is also a good way for hotel and
resort operators to benefit from new cashflow sources.
	   The time-share business in Thailand has expanded rapidly and
there are now about 2,000 foreign members altogether through three
networks -- Quality Suite Airport Bangkok Hotel, Green Park
Pattaya, and Lanna Resort Chiang Mai.
	   The three networks might not be enough to serve the 200-per cent
expansion rate expected this year due to the Amazing Thailand
promotional and the depreciation of baht, according to MTC.
	   Vittayen said companies which join the time-share network would
reach their break-even point within two years. The companies would
also benefit from the membership and annual fees which would help
support their cash-flow positions, and the country as a whole would
collect more foreign funds.
	   The Vacation Ownership Association of Thailand (VOAT) also met
Monday to discuss legal issues relating to the protection of
members of the time-share programme.
	   The results of the VOAT discussion will also be proposed for
further discussion on June 12 at the meeting on ''Consumer
Protection Law and Tax Law on Time-Share Business'' organised by
the Tourism Authority of Thailand. Vittayen will represent the
time-share operators at the meeting.

Nigerian gloom as the rest of the France celebrates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A touch of lightning on a cold, wet morning served
only to make things even gloomier for Nigeria on the eve of the
World Cup.
	   Already battered by injuries, the team had to deal with the
distraction of the death of their country's leader, Gen. San
Abacha, and two more doses of bad news from hobbled players during
the Tuesday morning practice.
	   The team learned that starting defender Jero Shakpoke, who hurt
himself against the Netherlands in a warmup game last week, has a
broken left collarbone and is lost for the tournament. Meanwhile,
striker Daniel Amokachi twisted his right knee and his status will
be evaluated day-to-day.
	   ``Like I always say, I worry about the things I can change,''
coach Bora Milutinovic said. Abacha's death ``is not one of those.
Neither are the injuries.''
	   The players held a moment of silence for Abacha before practice
began, and captain Uche Okechukwu said the team was considering
wearing black armbands on their jerseys during World Cup matches.
In Jerusalem, a prominent Nigerian dissident urged spectators to
show disapproval of Abacha's military regime by jeering the
country's flag during games.
	   ``We didn't know he was sick,'' midfielder Sunday Oliseh said.
``It's like if you don't know a team is in the World Cup and then
you find out it has won it.''
	   There was a distinctly different mood in Paris, where the
arrival of thousands of fans and an opening parade made for a
festive atmosphere ahead of Wednesday's opening games _ defending
champion Brazil vs. Scotland and Morocco vs. Norway.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show that featured four large giants
converging on central Paris from different directions. ``The grand
theme is universality in a single world.''
	   The Nigerians weren't the only team struggling with new
injuries. Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said team captain Frank de Boer
twisted his left ankle in practice and may miss the Netherlands'
first match against Belgium on Saturday.
	   The news was better for host France. Zinedine Zidane, the team's
creative midfielder, juggled the ball without problem Tuesday,
easing fears an ankle injury would keep him out of the opener
against South Africa on Friday.
	   ``I'm OK, I didn't feel any pain,'' Zidane said. ``Now we have
to prepare the match. We're ready.''
	   Italian striker Alessandro Del Piero was also running better on
his injured thigh, although he won't be ready for Italy's opener
against Chile on Thursday. Roberto Baggio will start in his place.
	   Germany, which faces the United States on Monday, practiced in
Nice again without wing back Christian Ziege, who had a fever, and
versatile defender Thomas Helmer, who was still dealing with a
thigh injury.
	   Among the teams arriving in France on Tuesday were England and
Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavs tried to focus on soccer as they took up
residence in Saint Galmier, but they were clearly troubled by the
ethnic turmoil back home.
	   ``Of course we cannot ignore what is happening in our county,''
midfielder Vladimir Jugovic said. ``But we'll try to ignore it.''
	   Many see Yugoslavia's June 25 match against the United States as
a grudge match because the Americans were in instrumental in
imposing sanctions against the Balkan country, both in 1992 and
again earlier this week.
	   ``We don't want a political match against the Americans,'' said
Miljan Miljanic, the head of the Yugoslav Football Association.
``We are not politicians but sports friends.''

Kosovo Albanians prepare for longer war, set new `defense tax'

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As the international outcry to halt
the bloodshed in Kosovo grew Tuesday, ethnic Albanian leaders took
steps to prepare for extended warfare against Serb forces in the
secessionist province.
	   Exiled Kosovo Albanian political leaders announced they would
collect an extra tax from an estimated 400,000 Kosovo Albanians
living abroad to finance the ``defense of our people.'' They did
not elaborate.
	   The announcement by the Germany-based Kosovo Albanian
government-in-exile underscored the apparently deepening commitment
of both sides to the conflict.
	   The Serb-led Yugoslav army shipped in a trainload of 46 armored
personnel carriers and about 1,000 soldiers to Kosovo's capital
Pristina in a fifth straight day of such reinforcements, ethnic
Albanian sources said.
	   There also was no sign of a letup in clashes between Serb police
and army forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas in western Kosovo,
where the U.N. human rights chief described a ``grave and worsening
human rights and humanitarian situation.''
	   In Geneva, Mary Robinson urged warring Serbs and ethnic Albanian
separatists to ``curb the spiral of violence.''
	   Meantime, the West was debating stronger actions a day after the
United States and the European Union imposed new sanctions on
Serbia. NATO defense ministers are expected to discuss the
possibility of direct intervention at a meeting in Brussels on
Thursday and Friday. At the United Nations, diplomatic sources said
the United States and Britain plan to ask the Security Council to
approve the use of force against the Serbs.
	   In a statement issued to the official Tanjug news agency,
Yugoslavia denounced the imposition of new sanctions as a ``strange
and unreasonable decision.'' The sanctions banned new investments
in Serbia and froze its assets abroad.
	   Serbia's lone partner in the Yugoslav federation, Montenegro,
was exempt because of its pro-Western leadership.
	   Published in Kosovo newspapers Tuesday, an announcement by
exiled ethnic Albanian government said Kosovo Albanians working
abroad would have to contribute the equivalent of dlrs 300-600
(500-1,000 DM) to the ``obligatory financial mobilization.''
	   Majority ethnic Albanians in the southern Serbian province
formed their own government after their autonomy was revoked in
1989. But it is not recognized by Serbian authorities and many of
its officials live in Western Europe.
	   The parallel administration has been collecting taxes and
financing education and health care for Kosovo Albanians since
1993.
	   According to the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center, Serb
forces Tuesday were firing grenades on villages along the Albanian
border in southwestern Kosovo. Several other villages were attacked
in northwestern Kosovo, and three people were killed, the Albanian
center said.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 of the population in Serbia's
southern province. More than 250 have died this year in clashes
between government forces and the pro-independence Albanian
militants, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Yugoslavia's Supreme Defense Council, the top commanding body
for the country's army, met Tuesday in Belgrade to discuss Kosovo
despite deep disputes between some of its members.
	   The panel, headed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
``concluded that the Yugoslav army and the police entirely control
the state border and successfully take measures that guarantee the
safety of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' Tanjug reported.
	   Among the council members present was Montenegro's President
Milo Djukanovic, a Milosevic rival _ apparently signifying that
Milosevic has accepted election results giving a victory to the
reformist Djukanovic's party.
	   In Germany, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said he would seek a
meeting with Milosevic to persuade him to end the violence in
Kosovo. Russia is a traditional Serb ally.

Head of Russian statistics service accused of helping tax cheats

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The two top officials of the Russian statistics
service have been charged with helping big companies evade taxes,
raising fears that figures used to make government policy and
collect other taxes were falsified.
	   Investigators said they arrested Yuri Yurkov, head of the State
Statistics Committee, his deputy, Valery Dalin, and up to 20
alleged accomplices on Monday after a yearlong investigation.
	   More than dlrs 1 million in cash was found in Yurkov's
apartment, said government spokesman Alexei Volin said. Another
dlrs 500,000 and a large amount of jewelry was seized from the
others.
	   Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia, from ordinary citizens
to large corporations. The government's inability to collect tax
revenues has hobbled efforts to boost the economy.
	   Yurkov and the others were accused of manipulating economic data
to hide the real output of companies and reduce their tax
liability, and with selling classified information about rival
companies' performance.
	   The arrests could have far-reaching economic implications if it
turns out that data government officials rely on to make policy and
collect taxes was falsified. Yurkov has been head of the statistics
agency since 1993.
	   The Russian Prosecutor General's office said more than 20 people
were involved in the scheme, including the head of the agency's
data processing center, Boris Saakyan.
	   ``They have distributed roles among themselves making every
member of the criminal group earn money,'' it said in a statement.
	   It said that Yurkov and Saakyan made statements pleading guilty
to the charges. Yurkov is one of the highest-ranking Russian
officials to be arrested in recent years.
	   Russia's new tax enforcement chief, Boris Fyodorov, said he had
no information about the arrests Tuesday. But at a news conference,
he pledged once again to enforce the law equally against all tax
dodgers.
	   ``I've been told to collect taxes.'' he said. Because he intends
to do so, ``People are hysterical. It's like 1937, the year of the
Stalin purges.''
	   In a country of 150 million people, only 3.2 million tax
declarations were submitted last year, Fyodorov said. He said his
first targets will be rich Russians and foreigners.
	   ``For years, the government has been pretending to collect
taxes, and people have been pretending to be paying them,''
Fyodorov said.

	   JAPAN'S non-vessel operating common carrier, Naigai Trans Line
Co Ltd, has opened its representative office in Thailand with plans
to form a joint venture locally, Shigemori Hatano of the company's
Bangkok representative office said.
	   Under the plan, the company expects to expand its business in
Thailand in partnership with local transportation and logistic firm
Leo Transport Corp Ltd as well as to use Thailand as a centre to
expand its transportation services in the Southeast Asian region.
	   Kettivit Sittisootornwong, president of Leo Transport Corp Ltd,
said the company is studying the joint venture proposal with Naigai
Trans Line, which is expected to be concluded and formed in two
years. Under the joint venture agreement, Naigai Trans Line will
help Leo Transport Corp contact Japanese clients to transport their
products between Thailand and Japan and other markets.
	   Hatano said Naigai Trans Line's headquarters in Tokyo decided to
expand their business to Thailand, the second country with a
permanent office in the region after Singapore.
	   ''We expect Thailand to be the headquarters of Naigai Trans Line
Co to expand its non-vessel operating common carrier and related
transportation services in the region,'' said Hatano, adding that
Thailand's potential for transportation business is very big along
with the country's improving transportation system and
fundamentals, as well as the increasing number of Japanese firms
doing business locally.

Russia has already sent missiles to Cyprus, newspaper says

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expressed indignation Tuesday over a
newspaper report that it has already delivered powerful air-defense
missiles to Cyprus despite Turkey's threat to use force to stop
their deployment.
	   The Segodnya daily reported that Cyprus has already received the
S-300 missiles _ the Russian equivalent of the U.S. Patriot
missiles used in the Gulf War _ under a contract with the Russian
state arms exporter.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin denounced the
paper's report, saying it was part of a media campaign to discredit
Russia's foreign policy, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Rakhmanin did not say whether the missiles have been delivered,
according to ITAR-Tass. However, Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms
trading monopoly denied that delivery had taken place and said the
missiles will be sent to Cyprus in mid-August as planned, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia says the weapons are defensive.
	   But Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin reiterated Tuesday
that his country would not tolerate the missiles' deployment on the
divided Mediterranean island.
	   ``If the S-300 missiles are deployed on Cyprus, we will do
whatever is necessary,'' the Anatolia news agency quoted him as
saying.
	   Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the missiles'
deployment. Turkey has maintained 30,000 troops on Cyprus since it
invaded the island in 1974, following a failed coup by supporters
of union with Greece.
	   In Nicosia, government spokesman Christos Stylianides refused to
comment on the newspaper report.
	   Greece has said it will come to the aid of Cyprus if it is
attacked by Turkey, raising fears of a military conflict between
two NATO allies.
	   Cyprus has said it is ready to cancel the dlrs 200 million
missile deal if there is substantial progress toward the
reunification of the island and if Turkey accepts its proposal for
demilitarization.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that demilitarization
of Cyprus is essential for solving the conflict and called for more
international efforts to help end the confrontation.
	   The latest attempt to restart talks to reunify Cyprus by U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke failed last month.

	   MATTEL Bangkok Ltd, subsidiary of the US-based toy manufacturer
Mattel Inc, known best for Barbie, Winnie the Pooh and Sesame
Street dolls, plans to export toy cars worth Bt1.1 billion in its
first year of operation here.
	   President for Mattel Inc's operations Joseph Gandolfo said Thai
plants would most produce die-cast cars, small toy cars made with
zinc-alloy. The products will be produced under the Mattel
trademark of Hot Wheels and will be mainly exported to the US and
Europe.
	   Last week, the company completed its first stage plan to export
one million units. The production has been planned at 60 million
units a year. Export value is expected to reach Bt1.6 billion by
the year 2000 with the export of 110 million units. Mattel's
worldwide sales revenue, from toy cars, was US$700 million last
year.
	   Thailand's toy export industry should wake up again once foreign
investors foresee long-term investments. A few years ago, several
local toy companies had been forced to shut down some operations in
order to survive.
	   Gandolfo said the parent company had not yet planned to produce
a doll, like Barbie, in Thailand. This is because Mattel had
recently invested $60 million to complete its Indonesian production
plant, which currently produces 33 million dolls a year. The full
capacity of the plant is expected to increase to 55 million.
	   ''The plant in Indonesia did not have any interruptions during
the political and financial crisis. Moreover, the investment is
enough for its long-term expansion. We seek new potential countries
instead of injecting more capital there,'' Gandolfo said.
	   He added that Mattel still eyed Thailand for product line
expansion and for the production of dolls. An investment
feasibility study will be conducted within the next two or three
years.
	   ''Thailand has the most potential among Asean member countries
with strong facilities, a highly skilled workforce and stable
political concerns, which will help strengthen production and
export,'' Gandolfo noted.
	   Mattel's biggest plant is in China where the company produces
particular Barbie dolls and accessories. The other types of dolls
are produced in Malaysia.
	   The combined output from Mattel's plants in China, Malaysia and
Indonesia is 130 million dolls a year which suits the worldwide
market demand.
	   Gandolfo believes that the Asian economy will recover in the
near future, adding that Thailand was headed the right way in
solving the crisis.
	   In 1997, Mattel Inc acquired a majority stake in Tyco
Corporation, which in the same year took over Universal
International (Holding) Ltd. Universal International is the parent
company of Universal Matchbox (Thailand) which was renamed Mattel
Bangkok Ltd.
	   Mattel, with sales networks in more than 140 countries and
manufacturing plants in nine countries, has reached global sales
worth more than $5 billion.
	   The company invested $26 million in Mattel Bangkok to cover two
phases of manufacturing through to the year 2000. The first phase
has employed over 1,200 workers and the second phase is projected
to have additional 2,000 employees who would, in full capacity,
produce 110 units yearly.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The policymaking board of the new
European Central Bank held its first meeting Tuesday to help it
prepare for the launch of the continent's single currency next
year.
	   Wim Duisenberg, the bank's newly named president, said the 11
central banks participating in the euro currency will pay the
equivalent of around 4 billion euros into the bank's capital base
by July 1. One euro is expected to be worth roughly dlrs1.
	   He also told a news conference that the central bankers were in
general agreement that between 10 percent and 15 percent of the
total reserves transferred to the ECB will be in gold.
	   The euro currency will debut on Jan. 1 as part of the European
Union's efforts to create an economic and monetary union. Eleven of
its 15 member nations will be in the initial wave of euro
participants.
	   The ECB, which will be based in Frankfurt, will be in charge of
setting monetary policy for the euro. Its governing council
includes the six members on the ECB's executive board and the 11
central bankers of the participating nations.

	   THE Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) has refused to buy 37
petrol stations offered by Petro Asia (Thailand) Co (PA), a PTT
executive said.
	   The source, who asked not to be named, said the decision to
refuse came from the fact that many PA stations are situated close
to PTT otlets and would compete with them. PA has 400 small outlets
in Thailand.
	   ''If PA sells all its stations, it will automatically have to
close down the company, possibly within two to five years'', said
the executive.
	   In addition, PTT does not have any money available for the
investment.
	   ''If PA cannot go further, it should close down operations,''
said the executive, adding that PTT would bring back staff who had
been moved to PA.
	   PA is owned by the Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, PTT and a
Chinese state-owned firm, China Petrochemical Corp.
	   CP is also negotiating the sale of its 35-per-cent stake in PA
to US company Atlantic Richfields (Arco). The executive said PTT
would maintain its holding in PA if it could not be sold to Arco.
	   With regard to PA's Chinese ventures, PTT has decided to retain
its current holding even if CP pulls out because investment in
China's downstream industry has high potential, he said.
	   PTT is also helping PA with aspects like marketing and
cost-cutting.
	   The Commercial Registration Department had reported earlier that
the number of petrol outlets, as of the end of March, totalled
12,726, up 22 per cent from the same period last year.
	   PTT has retained its position as a leader with 1,526 outlets,
followed by Bangchak, Shell, Esso and Caltex.
	   Petrol outlets of Article 6-registered oil companies have grown
by only three per cent to 7,098 in the first quarter of this year.

	   EMPLOYEES, particularly women and children, will benefit most
from Thailand's new labour-protection law, said Suriyong Tungsuwan,
a partner of international law firm Baker &AMP; McKenzie in an address
to the Singapore-Thai Chamber of Commerce.
	   Speaking on the impact and implications of the act which comes
into force on Aug 19, Suriyong said that while the new law would
provide better protection to employees, some provisions,
particularly those limiting daily working hours, might be too rigid
and impractical for some workplaces and that while the new law
cleared up some of the issues in the existing legislation it raised
many new aspects which would inevitably require clarification in
the courts.
	   ''The new act will certainly provide better protection to
employees,'' Suriyong said, ''but while the contents of the act are
pretty lengthy, it does not tell us everything. A lot of
implementing legislation will be necessary, and we will have to
wait and see what will come out after that. The Ministry of Labour
and Social Welfare is given a lot of flexibility in what it can put
in its ministerial regulations.'' Changes and new requirements will
prevail over the provisions of existing regulations in workplaces
as well as terms and conditions of existing employment contracts.
The new legislation is intented to meet standards set by the
International Labour Organisation (ILO).
	   Suriyong commented on the implications of the new law in the
workplace: ''The new law will make it necessary for every workplace
to take a look at its personnel-management policy and to amend all
existing documents relating to employment matters, including work
rules and regulations and employment contracts.'' He said some of
the highlights of the new law included prohibition of child labour
and sex discrimination, restrictions on the work of pregnant
employees, outlawing of sexual harassment, a ceiling on working
hours, new overtime regulations, compulsory welfare and provident
funds and increases in severance pay for some employees.
	   Addressing sex-discrimination laws, he said that while the law
required the equal treatment of men and women in the workplace, the
issue of whether this applied before employment, as in job
advertisements, and during the recruitment process would need to be
resolved. Similarly, the act does not specify how it interprets
sexual harassment and does not penalise sexual harassment against
male employees or by an employee against a fellow employee of equal
ranking.
	   While long-term employees are set to gain more from new
severance-pay regulations, this would, he said, given the current
economic crisis, probably trigger accelerated and more widespread
lay-offs before the new law comes into force. Also, Suriyong said,
a new stipulation requiring employers to make severance payments
and other outstanding mandatory payments within three days of the
termination date might create some problems for insolvent companies
or those in need of cash flow.
	   ''In effect, some companies may not be able to close down until
they have the cash to do so.'' he said.
	   ''Once in force, all employment relationships will be governed
by this act,'' Suriyong concluded. ''It is important that employers
and employees be aware of the new labour-protection law and
familiar with its implications and impacts on the
personnel-management policy of every workplace''.

World Cup: Nigeria deals with key injuries, Abacha death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: incorporates copy from Sports-Soccer-Nigeria-Abacha Reaction

 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELINCOURT-STE. MARGUERITE, France (AP) _ Another day, another
distraction.
	   From the death of its country's leader to mounting injuries,
from a string of poor outings to rumors about coach Bora
Milutinovic's job status, Nigeria had plenty to think about Tuesday
as its World Cup opener neared.
	   The team got word that starting defender Jero Shakpore is out
for the tournament with a broken collarbone. Just a few hours
before, striker Daniel Amokachi had to be helped off the practice
field with a heavily bandaged right knee.
	   ``Like I always say, I worry about the things I can change,''
Milutinovic said. Gen. Sani Abacha's death ``is not one of those.
Neither are the injuries.''
	   Nor is the speculation that his job is on the line. Team
officials denied Tuesday that Milutinovic _ a Yugoslav at the helm
of his fourth different World Cup side _ will be fired immediately
if Nigeria loses its first match.
	   That outing, against Spain on Saturday, will set the tone for
the tournament, several players said.
	   ``Spain is very strong, but we are not thinking about Spain,''
said forward Nwankwo Kanu, who's battling an ankle injury. ``We
have to be thinking about ourselves.''
	   Nigeria has lost three straight tuneup games against World Cup
participants. The defense has been lackadaisical, the attack
anemic.
	   Shakpore, 19, quickly became one of Milutinovic's prized pupils
and was hoped to provide consistency at the revolving-door right
back spot.
	   But he was injured in a warmup game against the Netherlands last
week. After days of uncertainty, he was examined in Italy by his
club doctor, who diagnosed a broken collarbone and told the team
the player would be sidelined for six weeks.
	   Nigeria has petitioned FIFA, the sport's governing body, to
allow a roster move to replace Shakpore, team spokesman Austin
Mgbolu said. If granted, Mobi Oparaku would take his spot on the
roster and in the starting lineup.
	   Heavy clouds, occasional lightning and sprinkles framed the
team's practice, which started with a moment of silence for Abacha.
	   ``We're trying to take it calmly,'' captain Uche Okechukwu said.
``Of course we are thinking about it.''
	   The leader died in Lagos on Monday and was replaced Tuesday by
another general. Okechukwu said the team may wear black armbands on
their uniforms during the World Cup.
	   ``It was shocking for the team,'' Oliseh said. ``We didn't know
he was sick. It's like if you don't know a team is in the World Cup
and then you find out it has won it.''
	   Milutinovic said he thought Abacha's death might actually help
the players.
	   ``I wouldn't want to say this is special motivation, but we do
need to be united,'' the coach said. ``Death is normally not
positive, but. ...''
	   Practice was less than perfect. Amokachi crumpled to the ground
after catching his cleat in the damp turf when trying to shoot
during a half-field scrimmage. A member of Nigeria's last World Cup
team and the Olympic gold medal team of 1996, Amokachi can provide
power and play-making skills.
	   Milutinovic is fast running out of options in attack, with
Emmanuele Amunike not even here because of a lingering knee injury
and Kanu at less than 100 percent.
	   Kanu has skipped all of the team's workouts at its training
ground, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Paris. He did do
some light jogging and stretching for about 20 minutes with a
trainer.

	   THE Council of Economic Ministers Monday suggested the Bank of
Thailand set up a central body to coordinate debt restructuring
between commercial banks and their borrowers in order to ensure
benefits to small companies, government spokesman Akapol
Sorasuchart said.
	   Akapol said normally banks agree to restructure loans extended
to large companies while ignoring small ones.
	   The BOT Monday submitted the regulations, announced on June 2,
to the council. The regulations are in accordance with the fourth
letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund. Corporate debt
restructuring is to be a means to reduce the liquidity shortage and
insolvencies.
	   Companies restructuring their debts will receive new loans and
their lenders need not reserve against problem loans, thereby
increasing their credit supply. Once credit supply rises, interest
rates will fall.
	   Although the authorities hope the loan restructuring process
will inject liquidity into the market, commercial banks are still
reluctant to lower their lending interest rates.
	   Twatchai Yongkittikul, secretary general of the Thai Bankers'
Association, admitted it is difficult to cut rates as the
repurchase rate is still high.
	   Bangkok Bank president Chartsiri Sophonpanich said the TBA will
soon discuss rate reductions. However, they might not take place
due to the current shaky economic conditions.
	   ''Commercial banks in fact don't want high rates. Yet, we
couldn't cut them and the best we can do is maintain the current
levels. At present, BBL rates are the lowest,'' he said.
	   Thai Farmers Bank president Banthoon Lamsam said his bank is
squeezing credit on fear new loans might turn bad and loan
restructuring might take quite some time after the regulations are
announced. TBA, the Federation of Thai Industries and the Board of
Trade are scheduled to convene on Friday to discuss tax and other
problems concerning the loan restructuring as urged by the
financial authorities, according to a TBA source.
	   Later, they will submit their conclusion to the Bank of
Thailand.
	   The TBA source said the meeting was originally scheduled to take
place Monday, but was delayed as the authorities wanted to hear the
private sector's proposals. Based on the BOT regulations, there are
13 items which must be taxed but the taxation process is rather
complicated, he said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand also discussed tax issues with
the Finance Ministry.
	   Finance Ministry permanent secretary Supachai Phisitvanich said
the ministry is studying what tax privileges will be provided to
commercial banks which agree to restructure problem loans.
	   He said so far, the ministry has finalised 80 per cent of the
adjustment framework, mostly covering transaction tax, income tax
and appraisal tax.
	   ''We're considering some issues, such as the proposal to allow
banks to deduct income tax from the difference between loan
collateral and lending amounts in case the collateral value is
below the lending amount,'' he said.
	   He said the tax privileges could be issued in a Revenue
Department announcement or ministerial regulations. ''Anyway, we
try to fix all things [which will be effective for a few years]
before the end of the 1998 account year [December],'' he said.

World Cup: Injured captain returns to intra-squad practice game
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ Japan's captain is back. For the
first time since last week's injury, defender Masami Ihara
scampered about in the field in a loose intra-squad scrimmage
Tuesday.
	   Whether Ihara would recover by Japan's opener Sunday against
Argentina had been uncertain after a right knee injury prevented
him from playing in two recent warmup matches _ a 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia in Switzerland, and a 1-0 victory over Gueugnon of the
French second division Sunday.
	   But Ihara, the most experienced player on Japan's World Cup
team, appeared back in form. And his return is sure to be a plus
for the tournament newcomers. Japan has been working on a tighter
defense system centered on Ihara.
	   Although he played with the reserves, rather than the starters,
Ihara moved about freely and kicked the ball in afternoon practice
here in this resort turned Japan's training camp.
	   Coach Takeshi Okada appeared satisfied.
	   ``The team doctor had expected him to recover in time,'' he
said. ``I wasn't that worried.''
	   In the morning, the team spent some time on shooting practice.
	   Okada has said repeatedly that his team has serious difficulty
scoring. He has also said he will play a more defensive game
against Argentina, with two defenders marking the opponent strikers
one-on-one, in addition to Ihara.
	   The team also practiced free kicks and corner kicks behind
closed doors, at a separate field surrounded by walls especially
for that purpose. Such set-pieces will be key for Japan's scoring
at the World Cup.
	   The problem is the high-rise housing right by the stadium. Many
people _ presumably residents and not the Argentine team _ can be
seen gazing out of their windows, getting a clear view of all
Japan's secrets.

Companion of slain scion testifies at Milan trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Maurizio Gucci's ex-wife once asked a lawyer
what would happen to her if she had the fashion scion killed, a
witness testified Tuesday at the trial for his slaying.
	   The ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, is being tried here
along with her former psychic and three others for the fatal
shooting of Gucci in 1995.
	   Reggiani Martinelli sat impassively during testimony by Gucci's
companion, Paola Franchi.
	   She a Gucci family lawyer warned that Reggiani Martinelli
contacted a fellow attorney to ask what criminal penalties she
might risk.
	   ``Maurizio didn't give any weight to the matter, even though I
asked him to hire a bodyguard,'' Franchi testified. ``Evidently, he
was used to threats by his wife.''
	   After Franchi testified, Reggiani Martinelli asked to make a
statement to the court, her first words to the tribunal since trial
began two weeks ago.
	   In a low, nervous voice, Reggiani Martinelli reiterated earlier
assertions that she regretted making known that she wanted to see
her husband dead because, she contended, two of the other
defendants then schemed to kill Gucci on their own and hit her up
for hush money.
	   ``It was a desire that they later carried out, and they began to
blackmail me,'' she said of fellow defendants, psychic Giuseppina
Auriemma, and a Milan hotel doorman, Ivano Savioni, who prosecutors
contend found the trigger man.
	   Also on trial is a man who confessed to driving the getaway car
and the alleged hit man.
	   Italian courts allow defendants to make statements during trial.
Reggiani Martinelli is not expected to take the stand for several
weeks.
	   The prosecution says Reggiani Martinelli had Gucci killed
because she was obsessed with gaining control of his estate and he
would cut her alimony in half to dlrs 900,000 a year. She allegedly
paid her co-defendants dlrs 300,000 to carry out the killing.
	   The Guccis were married in 1972 and separated 12 years later.
Their two daughters, Alessandra and Allegra, are 21 and 16,
respectively.
	   Franchi testified that Reggiani Martinelli tried to set the
daughters against their father, and that Gucci wanted to set up a
trust for his daughters while they were still minors so that his
money wouldn't end up ``in the wrong hands.''

viewed as a deal which satisfies the strategic needs of both
parties.
	   Merrill Lynch Phatra Securities will be headed by co-CEOs
Veravat Chutichetpong and Michael Unsworth, a Merrill Lynch
managing director who previously was regional head of research in
Hong Kong.
	   According to Watts, Merrill and Phatra officials, including
Viroj Nualkhair and Banyong Pongpanich, had discussed mutual
strategies in May last year.
	   ''Viroj and Banyong said that in a world where their business
was consolidating locally, they didn't think Phatra could retain
its niche in Thailand without partnering with an international
investment bank,'' Watts said.
	   Watts said Phatra realised the investment business was
consolidating around a limited number of international players who
were becoming more of a factor in local markets like Thailand. He
said Phatra told him they did not believe they had the
profitability to compete against the deep-pocketed global players.
''The UK firms couldn't do it,'' said Watts who is from Great
Britain.
	   At the same time, Watts told the Thai Farmers Bank which
controls Phatra that the difference between Merrill and other
international firms was that Merrill was willing to show an extra
level of commitment. ''Our strategy is to invest in local firms,
because we believe that after the consolidation is over, important
local clients will view the global players differently,'' he said.
	   Watts said US-based Merrill recognises it couldn't provide the
same quality of service it delivers in its home markets by merely
periodically parachuting in experts. ''Our strategy has been to
build up the local expertise in all of our overseas operations,''
he said.
	   While actual takeover discussions didn't commence until July
1997, Watts said a crucial element to the deal's success was
Merrill's understanding of TFB's core strategies prior to the
baht's devaluation and the subsequent economic downturn. Watts said
if the negotiations had commenced after the baht devaluation and
after the economy began going sour it would have been much more
difficult to complete the transaction. Both Merrill and TFB
officials were insisting the premise which cemented the deal had
nothing to do with the financial crisis. ''They believed they
needed to do a transaction for the strategic needs of their
business -- all before the Thai baht was floated. It was the
group's core concept,'' he said.
	   With the faltering Thai economy crushing financial institutions'
balance sheets, TFB's choice to recapitalise Phatra Thanakit Plc
and form a new debt-free Phatra Securities Co Ltd was also crucial
for the deal's success.
	   Watts told The Nation it would have been highly unlikely that
Merrill would have made the deal if Phatra Securities had not been
separated from Phatra Thanakit. ''We're very diversified, but we're
not a lending institution. We're not in that business,'' he said.
	   Several weeks ago, Banthoon Lamsam, TFB's CEO, said his group
put money into recapitalising Phatra Thanakit Plc because it saw
the value of Phatra Securities. The group had been criticised for
letting some of its other faltering finance company affiliates fall
by the wayside.
	   With Merrill paying $68 million, Bt2.72 billion, for the stake
in Merrill Lynch Phatra Securities which new co-CEO Veravat said
will have net assets of Bt2.7 billion, including cash of Bt2
billion deposited in financial institutions, some observers are
saying Banthoon realised value from the deal. The $68 million paid
by Merrill will not go into the new company's coffers. It will be
paid to Phatra Thanakit Plc which is selling 51 per cent of its
shares to Merrill.
	   Watts argues that the $68 billion is only a small part of the
deal.
	   ''I don't think Banthoon is realising value in this deal -- he's
helping it to create more value for the Thai Farmers group,'' he
said.
	   Banthoon, he said, was convinced that to take Phatra forward,
this alliance was needed. ''This is a positive alliance about the
future. Its about creating more value in the 49 per cent they
retain than from their previous 100 per cent holding,'' he said.
	   Watts added that TFB now has the opportunity of participating in
Merrill Lynch's global franchise as its supplier in Thailand.
''It's a very good transaction for the Thai Farmers Bank group,''
he said.

Incongruous alliance in European parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - An incongruous alliance was formed
Tuesday when members of Italian opposition leader Silvio
Berlusconi's party joined a European Parliament group of which
Prime Minister Romano Prodi is a member.
	   The European People's Party, a coalition of center-right
political parties and the second largest faction in the EU
parliament, opened its arms Tuesday to 20 parliamentarians
belonging to Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia party.
	   Altogether 136 of the EPP's 180 members took part in the vote. A
separate vote was issued for each of the 20 applicants, the EPP
group's leader Wilfried Martens told a news conference.
	   ``On average, 92 EPP members voted against the candidates, 37
voted in favor, there were four abstentions and three blank
votes,'' Martens said.
	   ``This was not Forza Italia applying for membership, these were
individual applications. The distinction must be made,'' he added,
in a bid to tone down the uncomfortable rapprochement between Prodi
and Berlusconi.
	   The candidates were told they can join the group if they adhere
to its rules. Martens said the 20 candidates had assured him in a
letter they will ``reject every form of extremism.''
	   ``They clearly underlined the principles of the EPP,'' Martens
said in an interview with the Belgian daily De Standaard.
	   Six EU prime ministers belong to the EPP coalition, including
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar and Prodi.
	   The Socialist Party, the largest grouping in the parliament,
denounced the entry of Forza Italia's members into the EPP.
	   The EPP parties ``are about to take a momentous decision on a
realignment of Christian Democracy to the right of the political
spectrum in Europe,'' the Socialist group's leader Pauline Green
warned before the vote.
	   The ``marriage ... will cause a seismic shift in the political
map of Europe. It will put at risk two decades of agreement between
Socialists and the EPP ... on the core proposals of a developing
European integration.''
	   The entry of the Forza Italia candidates narrowed the gap
between the EPP - which now has 200 members - and the 213-member
Socialist group.
	   Berlusconi leads Italy's right-of-center coalition which is made
up of his Forza Italia party, the rightist National Alliance and
other groups.
	   Prodi heads the center-left Olive Tree coalition.

Cyclone hits India's western coast, at least 75 dead

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A cyclone spun onto India's western Gujarat
state Tuesday, whipping up high winds that toppled homes, trees,
walls and a communication tower, killing at least 75 people.
	   At Kandla, a 4-meter (13-feet)-high tidal wave swept away 20
port workers, said Praveen Lehri, a top official of Gujarat state
government.
	   The storm, the most severe in the past 25 years to batter the
western coast, hit land at Porbunder, 450 kilometers (280 miles)
northwest of Bombay. It gradually moved north, buffeting much of
western India with heavy rain and winds of up 80 kph (50 mph),
snapping power lines and making driving impossible.
	   Most of the other deaths were mainly caused by lightning and
house collapses in Junagadh, Bhuj, Valsad and Jamnagar, rural
districts near Porbunder, Lehri said.
	   Nine people died in Porbunder when a telecommunications tower
came crashing down.
	   Kamaljeet, a meteorologist who uses only one name, said by
telephone from Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat, that the storm
was expected to weaken soon.
	   State officials said the military was asked to stand by for
help, while air force helicopters rescued homeless people.
	   Indian officials moved some 5,000 people in small towns and
villages bordering the Arabian Sea to safety on Monday, state
government officials said.
	   A South American cargo ship, carrying cement to Gulf states from
India, was grounded on the Saurashtra coast, but its 27-member crew
was rescued by port authorities, United News of India news agency
said.

World Cup: Italian striker is sick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli,
suffering from fever and cough, on Tuesday was taken to a hospital
to undergo X-ray examinations to determine if he's suffering from a
bronchitis, team officials said.
	   The sudden illness of the 29-year-old forward of Olympique
Marseille may cause his last-minute exclusion from Italy's World
Cup team and the possible inclusion of Parma's forward Enrico
Chiesa.
	   Chiesa is in France as Italy's 23rd player and still could be
named in Italy's list.
	   World Cup teams can report to FIFA replacement of sick or
injured players through 1530 GMT Wednesday _ the kickoff time of
the World Cup's inaugural match between Brazil and Scotland.
	   ``Team doctors are going to report to Cesare Maldini the outcome
of examinations and the coach will take a decision,'' team
spokesman Antonello Valentini said.
	   Ravanelli's illness was the last bout of misfortune to hit the
Italian team.
	   Star-forward Alessandro Del Piero has only just recovered from a
right thigh strain and is out of Italy's first match against Chile
on Thursday.
	   Defender Moreno Torricelli bruised his right foot in training 10
days ago and resumed practicing on Tuesday.
	   Chiesa had been put on alert as a substitute for Del Piero first
and then Torricelli. Now he had a third chance to stay with the
team.

	   PETALING JAYA, Sat. - A section of Jalan Universiti, from the
International Islamic University to Universiti Hospital, will be
closed to traffic from Monday until Oct 8 for pipe-laying works.
	   The closure would be carried out in three stages, with each
taking up 150 to 200 metres of the road.
	   According to a Press release by Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd, one
side of the road would be closed to traffic.
	   Excavation and pipe-laying works, part of Phase Two of the
Sungai Selangor Water Supply Scheme, would be carried out
round-the-clock, including on Saturdays and Sundays.
	   ``As work will be done in three stages, stretches which are not
affected will be opened to traffic under normal conditions,'' the
statement said.
	   The first stage, from Monday until July 8, would stretch from
the junction of Jalan 17/1 to the university roundabout.
	   For the second stage - from July 9 to 23 - work would centre
around the roundabout.
	   The third stage, between July 24 and Oct 8, would involve work
from the roundabout to the hospital.
	   Signs would be placed along the road to inform the public on
traffic conditions.

	   SEPANG, Sat. - With the opening of the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport less than a month away, advance operation
trials have hit a snag as problems surfaced with its systems and
passenger flow procedures.
	   More than 3,000 Commonwealth Games volunteers today took part in
the largest operation trial so far to test the airport's passenger
and baggage-handling systems, aircraft control, kerbside and
carpark management, public transportation, passenger flow and
communication systems.
	   The trials, the first of which was held on Sept 16, are to
ensure smooth operations of the airport when it opens on June 30.
	   However, some passengers found themselves having to wait over an
hour at the check-in counters as the computers processing passenger
check-in `slowed down', causing a delay in passenger flow.
	   One volunteer, Chan Choon Tsz, from Taiping, said she was still
at the check-in counters when her simulated `flight' was scheduled
to depart in less than an hour.
	   She said several passengers found difficulty locating their
designated check-in counters as the information provided was
inadequate.
	   ``We know that there are Flight Information Display monitors
located all over the airport, but a new passenger who comes to the
airport would still need to be informed that he should look at the
monitors to find his check- in counter.
	   ``There are not enough instructions on this,'' she said.
	   Another passenger, Lee Peng Keong, said there were not enough
signages in the airport to direct passengers to, for example, their
aircraft boarding gates.
	   ``Some of the signages are too small to be seen and it's no
wonder that some people coming to KLIA for the first time get
lost,'' said Lee who has participated in previous trials.
	   Malaysia Airports Berhad general manager Muhammad Adnan Yahya
however said while there may have been some problems, the trial
went smoothly.
	   ``We will be having a post-mortem on Tuesday afternoon and only
then can we assess the success of the trial.''
	   He added that some of the problems were caused by volunteers not
following the instructions and signages properly.
	   On placing more signages for passenger convenience, Muhammad
Adnan said more were being installed.
	   ``But we cannot have signages which are too big, since it may
spoil the beauty of the airport.
	   ``We don't want this airport to be like the one in Subang, which
has been dubbed `The Forest of Signages'.''
	   Five airlines took part in the trial run with 15 departures and
15 arrivals.
	   Each flight carried 150 or more passengers who were left on
their own to find their way to the departure and arrival halls.
	   Adnan said the response from the public was overwhelming.
	   ``We expected about 2,500 people to turn up, but I think more
than twice that participated.''
	   He said more trials would be conducted on June 11, 18 and 25.
	   ``There will also be two rehearsals for the opening day ceremony
and two trials for the commencement of full commercial
operations.''

	   SEPANG, Sat. - Malaysia Airlines will review its fares after it
moves into its new base at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport,
its chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said today.
	   He said currently in Malaysia, airlines generally needed to
increase their fares by as much as 80 per cent to break even.
	   ``This is mainly due to the cost increase on items such as spare
parts and fuel due to factors such as the depreciation of the
ringgit.
	   ``Malaysia Airlines has not made any application to the
Government for an increase, but we will study our cost structure
after moving into KLIA.
	   ``If our study tells us an increase is needed, we will make an
application.''
	   Speaking to the New Sunday Times after hosting a visit of senior
editorial staff of NST Sdn Bhd to the airline's facilities at KLIA,
Tajudin said MAS was ``completely ready'' to begin operations at
the RM10.5 billion airport.
	   The airport will commence full commercial operations on June 30.
	   Asked if Malaysia Airlines would retain some domestic flights in
Subang, he said the airline would operate all its flight from
Sepang as there would be a lot of confusion if flights were
operated simultaneously at two hubs.
	   ``It would be very expensive not only for us but also for
Malaysia Airports Berhad as we would need to have two sets of
employees at the airports.''
	   He added while passengers would need to get used to the idea of
having to travel to get to KLIA, they should also appreciate the
fact that the airport is not too far from the city compared with
major airports elsewhere.
	   ``Narita Airport is about two hours away from Tokyo city and
even the airport in Subang now takes longer than an hour to reach
at peak hours.''
	   On its employees' housing, Tajudin said the airline viewed the
issue as ``crucial''.
	   ``However, the airport is now accessible to our staff living in
Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya with the NSE-Central Link expressway.
So there seems no need for staff to move nearer to KLIA.''
	   The airline will provide a RM200 travel allowance to staff who
have to travel from the capital to the new airport.
	   About 12,000 cabin crew and administrative personnel will be
posted at the KLIA. This constitutes about 95 per cent of the

	   PARIS (AP) _ Pele, Platini and Beckenbauer on the same team.
With Maradona, Garrincha and Cruyff in support.
	   A dream team for the century was unveiled Tuesday when
MasterCard announced the FIFA World Football Team. The group of
all-time all-stars featured four Brazilians, two Argentines, a
German, a Frenchman, a Russian, an Englishman and a Dutchman.
	   ``It is a great honor to be included with such players, the best
of soccer,'' Pele said.
	   The team was chosen by a worldwide panel of journalists, who
first voted for the 11 best players of the century in different
confederations. A total of five confederation teams, from Europe,
Africa, South America, North and Central America and the Caribbean,
and Asia and Oceania, were selected.
	   From those squads, 55 finalists were picked for balloting on the
world team.
	   The team consisted of Brazil's Pele, Garrincha, Nilton Santos
and Carlos Alberto; Argentinas Diego Maradona and Alfredo Di
Stefano; West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer; France's Michel Platini,
the co-chairman of the 1998 World Cup; the Soviet Union's Lev
Yashin; England's Bobby Moore; and the Netherlands' Johan Cruyff.
	   Pele, Garrincha and Maradona were selected as forwards. In
midfield were Cruyff, Di Stefano and Platini. On defense were
Beckenbauer, Moore; Carlos Alberto and Nilton Santos. The
goalkeeper was Yashin.
	   On behalf of the 11 players, MasterCard is making a donation to
the SOC Children's Villages, FIFA's official charity.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite the loss of Romario and coach Mario
Zagallo's worry about his defense, Brazil remained Britain
bookmaker Ladbrokes favorite to win the World Cup.
	   The defending champions were listed as 3-1 favorites, while
France was the second choice at 11-2. Italy was third at 6-1 with
both Argentina and Germany 7-1 picks.
	   England sliped to 9-1, its longest odds since qualifying while
the Netherlands and Spain were 10-1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Exiled Nigerian dissident Wole Soyinka is
asking soccer fans to use the World Cup as a way to protest
Nigeria's military government.
	   Speaking Tuesday regarding the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, the
1986 Nobel Prize winner in literature urged World Cup fans to jeer
the Nigerian flag, wear black arm bands or distribute pictures and
leaflets about the regime's atrocities.
	   Nigeria plays its first match in France '98 Saturday against
Spain in Nantes, France.
	   Soyinka said that ideally Nigeria should be treated the same way
as South Africa was during apartheid, including having its teams
banned from sporting events.
	   Barring that, he said, ``What we ask is at least some gesture of
solidarity with the Nigerian people.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A day after he was elected president of FIFA, Sepp
Blatter kept a low profile Tuesday, quietly helping in preparations
for the start of the World Cup.
	   Blatter, who loves the spotlight, will undoubtedly be more
public as the tournament, which starts Wednesday, progresses. Among
other things, he's expected to make at least one appearance at the
daily news briefings FIFA and French organizers hold _ but not just
yet.
	   ``Mr. Blatter is very busy trying to figure out how to spell
`president,' and just what it means,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian striker Enrico Chiesa was
preparing to return home Tuesday with the health of Alessandro Del
Piero and Moreno Torricelli improving. But then again, he may stick
around to replace Fabrizio Ravanelli.
	   The Parma forward, taken to France as Italy's 23rd player, had
been put on alert as a possible substitute if case either Del Piero
or Torricelli were too hurt to play.
	   Del Piero has recovered from a right thigh strain and is
expected to return to action against Cameroon next week.
	   Torricelli, suffering from a bruised right foot, resumed
training Tuesday.
	   Neither player is expected to be ready for Italy's World Cup
opener against Chile on Thursday.
	   But late in the day, Fabrizio Ravanelli was taken for X-rays to
check for bronchitis. The Olympique Marseille striker was battling
a slight fever and cough earlier in the day. Teams can make changes
to their roster for injuries or illness up to kickoff of the
opening game, 1530 GMT Wednesday.

 &UR; Netanyahu considering referendum on troop withdrawal &QL;

 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
considering taking an American proposal for an Israeli troop
withdraw from the West Bank to the public in a nationwide
referendum, his aide said Tuesday.
	   Palestinians, who have already accepted the American deal,
criticized the move as a stalling tactic.
	   Netanyahu said public input was important on such a crucial
decision.
	   ``It is obligatory, above all, that there be broad public
support so the rifts in the nation will heal, and we have domestic
peace, not just external peace,'' he told Israel Radio.
	   A show of public support for the withdrawal could help Netanyahu
weather the political storm that authorizing it would bring.
Right-wing members of his coalition have threatened to bring down
his government if he goes ahead with a pullback.
	   Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that
a final decision on a referendum would be made in the next few
days.
	   After much wrangling and delay, Israel's Cabinet is expected to
vote by the end of the week on a U.S. initiative for a 13 percent
pullback from the West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Netanyahu was using
the referendum as an excuse not to carry out withdrawals Israel has
committed to completing.
	   ``The peace process, the political process and implementing the
redeployments do not need a referendum. What is needed is a prime
minister that is serious about the implementation of agreements,''
Asfour said.
	   According to Israeli media reports, U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Israel on Monday to quickly overcome internal disputes on the
pullback and move ahead to so-called final-status talks with the
Palestinians, in which thorny issues including Jerusalem's future
are to be decided.
	   Netanyahu said security considerations were holding up a vote.
	   The Palestinians, who have full control over 3 percent of the
West Bank and partial control over another 24 percent, have
accepted the American initiative.
	   Under the American plan _ which has been widely reported but
never formally unveiled _ a second Israeli redeployment would take
place in three stages over 12 weeks. It would bring full and
partial Palestinian control over the West Bank to 40 percent.
	   Peace talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for more
than 15 months. They stalled after groundbreaking on a Jewish
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Palestinians want the city's eastern sector as their future
capital, but Israel claims jurisdiction over all Jerusalem.
	   Bitter disputes have broken out in recent weeks over Jewish
settlers' moves into Arab parts of town, which Palestinians view as
land grabs in advance of any settlement of Jerusalem's status.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Four jolly giants in assorted colors of humanity
strode through Paris like good-guy Godzillas Tuesday to symbolize a
World Cup that France hopes will loom large in history.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the 18-meter (60-foot) robots took separate routes toward
the Place de la Concorde, the heart of a kickoff party for 1
million people.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show. ``The grand theme is universality in a
single world.''
	   Moussa, an African giant, was the first to awake at the Tuesday
evening kickoff, opening his eyes to enthusiastic applause. He was
accompanied by little kids on ostriches _ actually people on stilts
_ and dancing African baobab trees and termite hills.
	   The 38-ton giants were powered by small trucks hidden in their
shoes, which moved back and forth to make the giants look like they
were rocking.
	   Parisians awoke to find the giants at familiar monuments, along
with throngs of strangely dressed tourists from the 31 nations
joining France in the globe's biggest sports tournament.
	   Pablo, the American Indian giant, crouched under the Arc de
Triomphe, ready for his afternoon stroll down the Champs Elysees to
the animated trees and bugs that depict nature.
	   Moussa waited by the Eiffel Tower, to symbolically discover man
and the earth on his wheel-assisted walk past Napoleon's Tomb and
across the ornate Alexandre III bridge.
	   Romeo, the European, snoozed outside the Opera Garnier. His
theme was love, and along his route waited a sculptor's conception
of the Urban Woman, a mere 4.5 meters (15 feet) tall.
	   Ho, the Asian, camped overnight on the Pont Neuf, where he would
encounter flying fish, dragons and whimsical beasts illustrating
his themes of spirituality and fantasy.
	   Heavy overnight rains did not dampen the mood, but they washed
off Ho's loincloth, made of rubberized-plastic, exposing the
midriff of his articulated steel skeleton. Workmen pinned it back
on.
	   Among hard-to-impress Parisians, the four colossi received mixed
reviews. Along the city's grand boulevards, real characters seemed
to attract more attention. Clusters of soccer fans roamed the
streets in outlandish outfits and gaudy colors.
	   For once, passersby paid more attention to skirts on men rather
than women. Perhaps 20,000 Scots came across the Channel for the
opening game with Brazil on Wednesday. Most wore kilts.
	   Scott Wallace, a fishmonger, and his housepainter friend, Gerry
Shiels, sat behind tankards of lager at the Cafe Montecristo, each
with bare knees and Highland feathers towering above their hats.
	   ``I think we'll beat 'em, 2-1,'' Wallace said, a little
hopefully. ``Aye,'' Shiels agreed. ``And if we do, it'll be some
party.''
	   From the looks of things Tuesday, there'll be some party,
anyway. Still, transport strikes by Air France and ticket foulups
have left many fans furious.
	   Crowds pushed their way into the France 98 shop to buy World Cup
paraphernalia: polyster T-shirts, caps, crowd-parting cologne,
fuzzy stuffed versions of the goofy-looking rooster mascot named
Footix.
	   Visitors seemed to show more interest than the French. Jacques
Lambert, head of the organizing committee, complained of an evident
lack of fervor among the general public.
	   A block off the Champs Elysees, Jean-Pierre Arnal sat alone in
his little hardware store, wearing his usual white smock with his
dog at his feet.
	   ``Oouuff,'' he replied when asked about the World Cup, employing
a beloved French nonword that means the same thing as shrugged
shoulders. ``I suppose it's a good thing, economically.''
	   Around the corner, Emmannuel Delhomme painted a banner on the
awning of his bookshop, the Livre Sterling: ``Good news, ladies.
This store will be open during all of the games of the World Cup.''
	   Delhomme, no soccer fan, said he was a little wary of the
snarled traffic, the armed police and boisterous visitors.
	   ``But, after all,'' he concluded, ``it's a good thing. Parisians
are so sad, so stressed, and this is a change. All these people in
colors and a happy mood. It is something new to talk about.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The Drainage and Irrigation Department has
begun taking steps to prevent floods in view of the recent
increased rainfall.
	   Its director-general Keizrul Abdullah said the department's
staff, with the local authorities' co-operation, had carried out
more frequent river inspections and removed all obstructions
immediately.
	   ``Rubbish which gets trapped during the dry spell will obstruct
water flow once the rains come,'' he said in an interview.
	   In the medium term, Keizrul said his department was looking into
installing machines which automatically removed rubbish trapped in
rubbish screens erected in rivers.
	   ``These machines will have to operate automatically because we
cannot afford to have people running all over town to start them
when there is a downpour.''
	   He said several tests had been done but the results were not as
effective as expected.
	   Some of the machines had problems when operating during heavy
thunderstorms.
	   The machines, he said, were necessary because unremoved garbage
from the rubbish traps would cause the water to be dammed up and
the drains to overflow.
	   Besides rubbish, Keizrul explained that the inability of rivers
and drains to handle a high level of run-off also caused floods.
	   ``Although we ensure that the drains are properly designed when
a project is developed, projects are often built next to existing
developed areas.
	   There is no way for rainwater to be drained except through the
drains of the existing housing estates.''
	   Keizrul said it would be unfair to force the developer of the
existing housing estate to enlarge the drains to handle the
increased capacity.
	   In the long term, Keizrul said the DID was looking into managing
water flow rather than increasing the river's capacity.
	   ``Like roads, you cannot continuously widen it.''
	   Keizrul said laws were being drafted to provide for developers
to pay for excessive run-off from project sites.
	   This would encourage developers to look into alternative methods
of managing run-off such as diverting and retaining rainwater.

Chelsea signs French AC Milan star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea on Tuesday completed its second
international signing in 24 hours as French World Cup star Marcel
Desailly joined the Blues in a 4.6 million pound (dlrs 7.5 million)
deal.
	   The deal for the AC Milan defender and midfielder was completed
at the French World Cup training camp, just hours after Chelsea
signed Spanish international and Barcelona right back Albert
Ferrer.
	   The signing brings Gianluca Vialli's Cup Winners' Cup holders'
spending to more than 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.56 million) in the
last two weeks.
	   Lazio's Pierluigi Casiraghi was signed for 5.4 million pounds
(dlrs 8.8 million) two weeks ago, with confirmation of Danish
international Brian Laudrup's transfer from Glasgow Rangers finally
coming Monday.
	   Desailly, who has won 41 caps for France, said he was looking
forward to the challenge of playing in the Premier League after
five years in Serie A.
	   ``I'm happy and it's an important thing in my career to go and
play in England,'' he told the club's telephone hot line. ``It was
a big decision to leave Milan where I've played for five years, but
Chelsea are in the Cup Winners' Cup and they are a club that's
growing.''

	   JOHOR BARU, Sat. - Eight-month-old Chan Woei Sheng has undergone
a successful operation to correct a birth defect which had made it
difficult for him to defecate.
	   The seven-hour operation at the Puteri Specialist Hospital on
Wednesday has enabled him to lead a normal life.
	   The surgery was made possible by generous New Straits Times
readers who helped finance the operation.
	   They included businessman Datuk Sunny Choong of Kuala Lumpur and
his two brothers who donated RM7,500 for the surgery and
hospitalisation, after reading about his plight in the NST last
month.
	   Woei Sheng, due to his birth defect, had to use a catheter bag
to urinate and defecate.
	   ``Since his operation, he has been on drips. But the doctors
said he would be able to eat from tomorrow,'' said his mother, Chew
Sai Lan.
	   Woei Sheng of Senai, had been suffering from the defect,
clinically called Hirschprung's disease since birth.
	   This is his second surgery. He underwent his first surgery when
he was only six days old, to make an opening so that he could
defecate through it.
	   Chew thanked the NST for highlighting her son's plight and to
NST readers for their donations.
	   ``I cannot thank them enough. I can only pray that God will
reward them accordingly,'' she said.

Trustee of Diana memorial fund resigns because of overwork
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trustee of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial
Fund resigned Tuesday, saying the work had proved too demanding.
	   Freelance writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry said when she
was appointed, she was asked to give half a day a week to the fund,
which raises money for the late princess's favorite causes. But the
fund had required more time and energy than was originally planned,
she said in a statement.
	   ``I have managed to juggle my many other commitments ... in
order to help the fund through a particularly difficult time, but
now that it is in calmer waters and has a full-time chief executive
starting shortly, I have asked Anthony Julius, chairman of the
fund, to accept my resignation,'' she said.
	   The fund has been criticized for allowing Diana's name to go on
products like margarine and cuddly toys.
	   Ms. Parry said the new chief executive, Dr. Andrew Purkis, was a
good choice to lead the fund as it continues ``to establish itself,
despite the many challenges ahead, as a highly appropriate and
well-respected memorial'' to Diana, who died in a Paris car wreck
on Aug. 31.
	   Julius said Parry ``has made a tremendously generous
contribution of time and energy to the fund, which I and my fellow
trustees have deeply appreciated.''

	   IN this age of reinventing ourselves to face the uncertainties
of the business climate, one agency has broken the rules and
re-engineered in a new way.
	   Apart from calling itself PDQ (an acronym for Pretty Damn
Quick), it expanded upon the many functions of an ad agency by
going the extra mile to offer other value-added services under one
roof.
	   Citing the realities of today's marketplace where clients demand
the best professional input at every step of their marketing plan,
the PDQ Group is geared to handle advertising and design, public
relations, event management, publishing, premium sourcing and even
production up to printing at its premises in Section 5, Petaling
Jaya.
	   Driven by a taskforce of 20 professionals, it is slowly gaining
momentum as a one-stop centre for clients who don't have the time
to oversee all facets of their business and marketing
communications needs.
	   I managed to track down Tony Heneberry Managing Director of the
PDQ Group for the inside story last week.
	   S: Who are the main players in the PDQ Group and where do their
expertise lie in the grand scheme of things?
	   H: There are four main people. I started my first company in
1985, and have run management consultancy businesses and
entertainment companies in Europe.
	   Errol de Cruz is an experienced journalist, editor, and
published author and has been with the newspapers for a long time.
He now runs the PR and Event Management businesses, under PDQ
Management.
	   Margaret Wing was with the Dunlop Slazenger Group, firstly in
the UK, then Malaysia as Worldwide Purchasing Director. She now
manages the operations of the PDQ Group and runs the Sourcing
division.
	   Finally, we have Y.K. Gan, who has worked in colour separation
and printing for over 10 years. He runs PDQ Production, doing
colour separation and printing.
	   S: Does an all-in-one concept like this demand a heavy capital
outlay?
	   H: The business was established and has subsequently grown on
the basis of the quality of its resources, both in terms of
equipment and people.
	   As a result, the business did require substantial capital
investment to get started.
	   Our current advantage is that all investment has been by way of
shareholders' capital, and no bank borrowings.
	   S: How do you juggle responsibilities on a given project?
	   H: Responsibilities and work load are allocated according to
individual strengths. Our flat company structure, and equity-based
management approach ensure that as a group we are driven to
deliver.
	   S: What sort of clients do you wish to attract in these tough
times?
	   H: We hope to attract clients who can pay on time! Actually, a
weak economy tends to be an opportunity for certain sectors, for
example, beer and cigarettes usually do very well.
	   In addition, low ticket discretionary purchases such as
fast-food, ice cream, and branded soft drinks can maintain good
sales.
	   In Europe and US, DIY and home improvement has always been a
good recession business, but this will probably not be as marked in
Malaysia/Asia. However, the superstores and hypermarkets should
benefit from the discount mentality which prevails in a weak
economy.
	   S: Which type of client will gain from your roster of services
and how?
	   H: A client who has traditionally relied upon advertising as
their main communication tool will certainly find our approach to
be more cost- effective.
	   The PDQ approach is not prejudiced in favour of one `tactic'
over another. We evaluate the most appropriate and cost-effective
use of PR, events, direct marketing, design, collaterals, premiums
and advertising.
	   In this market the client needs to squeeze much higher value out
of their marketing investment, and it is essential therefore for us
to be able to rationalise and recommend the most appropriate
solution.
	   S: Tell us about a recent project that benefited from the value
of all the offerings within the PDQ Group.
	   H: There's ASPAC - Malaysia's leading executive search company.
	   We developed a communications programme and provided a
specialised management resource, both to plan the programme and to
manage its execution.
	   We identified the best tools with which to achieve the
objectives - a low-cost advertising device, corporate events, a
press, radio and TV PR campaign plus a direct marketing effort.
	   After six months, we achieved greater market awareness and
understanding, and an increase in business activity, compared to
their main competitors who are on average experiencing a
contraction of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent.
	   We also have a supportive client! S: How do you manage the
planning and buying of media space for clients wanting such?
	   H: As a medium-sized business we cannot carry a full media
research, planning, and booking resource. As a result we work with
Carat Mediabase which is Malaysia's largest independent media
broker.
	   This ensures that we are able to offer our clients a research
and planning facility equivalent to that of the international
agencies.
	   S: Are you intending expanding your current services or forging
some smart partnerships?
	   H: Yes and yes! We are already in discussion with certain
companies and we would hope to be able to announce further
development of the PDQ Group in the near future.
	   S: With the high cost of media these days, do you see more
clients hoping for free publicity, ie. PR coverage, to compensate
for the drop in advertising exposure?
	   H: The traditional understanding of PR is that it is a cheap way
of getting your company or brand name into the media. And to that
extent there has been a growth in interest in PR as a low-cost
alternative to advertising.
	   However, the correct use of PR as a communications
device/tactic, should not be based on cost. It should be based upon
the particular and unique benefits it can deliver to the
company/brand, when compared to other communication tools.
	   S: Many agencies have been laying off staff recently to brace
for even tougher times. Do you expect any downsizing in your
organisation?
	   H: We are still a relatively small organisation, and we are
actually recruiting. But this should be kept in context. As a small
organisation, the opportunity for growth is enormous.
	   A large agency, on the other hand, can never have the same
opportunity in percentage terms. Unfortunately, in the current
market, retrenching is the only prudent and practical option for
many of them.
	   S: Are you witnessing an upsurge in client spending of late?
	   H: If anything, total spending is dropping on a per client
basis.
	   However, we are seeing a dramatic increase in client enquiries.
	   This is probably because we can help our clients to work through
the issues in a structured and disciplined way, and together
identify solutions which are affordable and which are not
prejudiced in favour of any one specialised service.
	   Even with the best will, this is very difficult for a pure
advertising agency to do for its clients.

	   HOW do you manage your finances if you receive a pay cut, or
worse, lose your job?
	   Although this is a thought most of us would rather not
entertain, it is important to plan if there is a chance you could
end up in this boat. We have narrowed the process down to six
simple steps that you should examine in terms of income crisis
management.
	   Before we get into the steps on how to manage this unfortunate
situation, you have to determine what exactly you may possibly be
facing.
	   Are you a dual income family or a single income family? Are you
looking at pay reduction or job loss?
	   It is a good idea to get a realistic handle on your possible
situation so you can determine potential solutions.
	   Analyse Spending USE the following chart to take a second and
figure out where your pay goes on a monthly basis.
	   Although this is incredibly boring it will determine what your
absolute minimum monthly expenses are. You need to find out what
you, or your family, can scrape by on if need be.
	   This means getting rid of the extras like the fancy meals out or
the weekend shopping sprees for the family. By eliminating the
luxury spending we will get a clear picture of your minimum
financial obligations.
	   This does not mean deferring payments to a later date, we want
to look at the average monthly costs. So if you have some lump sum
expenses, such as an insurance payment, spread it out over a period
to even the cash flow.
	   Defer Major Expenditures AT this point, you will have to behave
like the government in this area and postpone any major purchases.
	   This holds true especially if you are looking at buying a luxury
good that will improve your lifestyle and hurt your finances. What
we are talking about here is the new car or stylish new furniture
for the house.
	   However, if it is a necessary purchase you have to be realistic.
For example, although the roof has a slow leak now may not be the
time to have the entire roof redone.
	   Identify Short-Term Assets NOW to do this properly you really
need to take a quick snapshot of all your assets and determine
which are short term and which are long term.
	   For regular readers this will be very easy. For others we refer
to short term assets as anything that can be converted to cash
within 30 days without a risk of capital depreciation.
	   In other words current accounts, savings, and Fixed Deposit's.
You get the picture?
	   Long-term assets are not that easy to convert and we will
discuss them further down the list.
	   Now that you have figured out-how-much you have in short-term
money you can roughly determine how long you can live off of this
pool if you lose all your income.
	   Some may just be looking to subsidize living costs to a certain
level if you are anticipating a drop in household income, but not
an outright elimination.
	   Obviously, if you think you are going to be out of work in the
near future you will want to cut back on the spending very quickly
and build up short term reserves.
	   It is important to note that you should not be turning
everything possible into cash at this point. That may come later.
	   Career/Income Options NOW, Wise Moves is not a career
counselling column, but we do have a few words of advice when it
comes to planning your finances.
	   If you are out of work, you have to be very realistic about your
chances of regaining employment and at what level. This will help
you to prepare a worse case scenario in terms of financial
management.
	   If you paint a worst case scenario and are able to make your
finances work in that situation, then you will be fine if things
turn out for the better.
	   Once you look at your situation and how long you can last on
your short term reserves it may also affect what type of work you
will take in the future. You may decide that some income is better
than no income until the picture looks brighter in the area where
you used to work.
	   Having said this, this is not an area of black and white
finance. All we are doing is encouraging you to look in advance. We
have seen far too many people who try to ignore the situation and
then are generally left with very few options, of which most are
not that attractive.
	   Restructure Debt THIS is an option that ideally will help reduce
the amount of money flowing out of the house on a monthly basis.
	   As you can well imagine there are many options and
considerations for one to consider. As this is the case we will
devote next week's Wise Moves to the topic of restructuring
personal debts.
	   Long-Term Assets DON'T worry, we are not going to tell you to
start selling your long-term investments! But we are going to tell
you to start realistically looking at the options you have in this
area in case worst comes to worst. It is critical to have an idea
of what you would liquidate if you had no other choice.
	   The reason is that you do not want to be trying to panic sell
long-term assets at the last minute, since you will most likely get
a much lower price than you would like.
	   If you plan in advance at least you will be able to get a fair
price for some of these assets. This whole process is not one of
optimism. But many people are worried these days about the
stability of their future income.
	   Although it may be only a slight possibility being aware of your
options is better than being completely caught off guard.

	   WE have learned that a parent's role has an enormous impact on
developing the problem-solving ability of a child, an ability which
has critical importance for him throughout the rest of his life.
	   This week, we will explore specific ways on how you can exercise
your role as good leaders in problem-solving situations.
	   Few parents would argue the importance of helping children learn
good problem-solving habits, but many do not make the time to do
this.
	   One way to guarantee that you have opportunities to model
problem- solving skills for your children is by scheduling weekly
family meetings.
	   Making attendance mandatory - for parents as well as children -
will give children the message that you take your role as a family
leader seriously and you are committed to helping them develop
emotional and social skills for success.
	   For optimum effect, these meetings should last for half an hour.
As the leader(s) of the meeting, the parent(s) should insist on the
following ground rules.
	   Begin and end on time.
	   Don't interrupt when someone else is talking.
	   Don't criticise someone else's opinions or feelings.
	   Give everyone a chance to participate, but don't force them.
About half of the meeting should be spent on individual concerns
and the other half on problems that affect the family as a group.
	   Each person should have the opportunity to discuss and `think
out' a problem that he or she is having. This is the opportunity
for you to bring up your own issues that are appropriate for
discussion in the family.
	   For example, Fatimah has been coming home every day from work
with a headache and was uncharacteristically snappish with her
children and her husband. In a family meeting the mother of three
explained that pressure at her job was making her stressed and
anxious.
	   She was a paralegal for a large law firm and two of the lawyers
she worked with had given her more work than she could handle. She
didn't want to complain because she was up for a promotion but both
lawyers wanted her to make their work a priority.
	   She tackled the problem using the five-step problem-solving
process.
	   Identify the problem - ``I have more work than I can manage.''
	   Think of alternative solutions - ``I could a) tell both lawyers
that I am overworked, b) bring work home and work weekends, or c)
recommend that they hire a temporary worker and supervise that
person.''
	   Compare each solution - ``The first just puts the problem on the
lawyers, giving them more stress. The second will make things
harder on me and my family. The last acknowledges the problem,
provides a reasonable solution, and doesn't make work harder for me
or anyone else.''
	   Pick the best solution - ``The third. In the short run, it will
cost the firm a little money but in the long run the work will get
done quicker and more effectively.''
	   It is easy to see how Fatimah's children could learn from
watching her solve her problem out loud. They might then apply this
process to their own problems and conflicts.
	   As an added benefit, Fatimah makes the time to reason out her
problem, sharing with her family why she has been irritable and
giving them an opportuity to give her emotional support.
	   Once you have modeled the problem-solving process, your children
should have the opportunity to discuss a problem if they wish.
Younger children will need guidance in going through each of the
steps, but you may be surprised at how quickly even five-year-olds
catch on.
	   Each person in the family may also ask for help from other
family members. Children like to be given the opportunity to help
their parents with important matters and their opinions should be
respected.
	   Remember that problem-solving is a process where there are not
always right or wrong answers. It is also an activity that not only
contributes to the emotional development of your children, but
builds a sense of family cohesiveness and support as well.

Nigerian gloom as the rest of the France celebrates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ravanelli injury; Japan's Ihara returns &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A touch of lightning on a cold, wet morning served
only to make things even gloomier for Nigeria on the eve of the
World Cup.
	   Already battered by injuries, the team had to deal with the
distraction of the death of their country's leader, Gen. San
Abacha, and two more doses of bad news from hobbled players during
the Tuesday morning practice.
	   The team learned that starting defender Jero Shakpoke, who hurt
himself against the Netherlands in a warmup game last week, has a
broken left collarbone and is lost for the tournament. Meanwhile,
striker Daniel Amokachi twisted his right knee and his status will
be evaluated day-to-day.
	   ``Like I always say, I worry about the things I can change,''
coach Bora Milutinovic said. Abacha's death ``is not one of those.
Neither are the injuries.''
	   The players held a moment of silence for Abacha before practice
began, and captain Uche Okechukwu said the team was considering
wearing black armbands on their jerseys during World Cup matches.
In Jerusalem, a prominent Nigerian dissident urged spectators to
show disapproval of Abacha's military regime by jeering the
country's flag during games.
	   ``We didn't know he was sick,'' midfielder Sunday Oliseh said.
``It's like if you don't know a team is in the World Cup and then
you find out it has won it.''
	   There was a distinctly different mood in Paris, where the
arrival of thousands of fans and an opening parade made for a
festive atmosphere ahead of Wednesday's opening games _ defending
champion Brazil vs. Scotland and Morocco vs. Norway.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show that featured four large giants
converging on central Paris from different directions. ``The grand
theme is universality in a single world.''
	   The Nigerians weren't the only team struggling with new
injuries. Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering from fever
and cough, was taken Tuesday to a hospital to undergo X-ray
examinations to determine if he's suffering from a bronchitis.
	   The sudden illness of the 29-year-old forward of Olympique
Marseille may cause his last-minute exclusion from Italy's team and
the possible inclusion of Parma's forward Enrico Chiesa, who has
been in training camp on standby.
	   Ravanelli's illness came as Italian striker Alessandro Del Piero
returned to practice after rehabilitating an injured thigh,
although he won't be ready for the team's opener against Chile on
Thursday. Roberto Baggio will start in Del Piero's place.
	   Elsewhere, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said team captain Frank de
Boer twisted his left ankle in practice and may miss the
Netherlands' first match against Belgium on Saturday.
	   The news was better for host France. Zinedine Zidane, the team's
creative midfielder, juggled the ball without problem Tuesday,
easing fears an ankle injury would keep him out of the opener
against South Africa on Friday.
	   ``I'm OK, I didn't feel any pain,'' Zidane said. ``Now we have
to prepare the match. We're ready.''
	   Also back was Japanese captain Masami Ihara, who scampered
through practice as if barely affected by a knee injury suffered
last week.
	   ``The team doctor had expected him to recover in time,'' said
coach Takeshi Okada, whose team faces Argentina on Sunday. ``I
wasn't that worried.''
	   Germany, which faces the United States on Monday, practiced in
Nice again without wing back Christian Ziege, who had a fever, and
versatile defender Thomas Helmer, who was still dealing with a
thigh injury.
	   Among the teams arriving in France on Tuesday were England and
Yugoslavia. The Yugoslavs tried to focus on soccer as they took up
residence in Saint Galmier, but they were clearly troubled by the
ethnic turmoil back home.
	   ``Of course we cannot ignore what is happening in our county,''
midfielder Vladimir Jugovic said. ``But we'll try to ignore it.''
	   Many see Yugoslavia's June 25 match against the United States as
a grudge match because the Americans were in instrumental in
imposing sanctions against the Balkan country, both in 1992 and
again earlier this week.
	   ``We don't want a political match against the Americans,'' said
Miljan Miljanic, the head of the Yugoslav Football Association.
``We are not politicians but sports friends.''

	   UUNET, a US-based Internet Service Provider, is asking the
Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) for a licence to provide
Internet services to corporate users in Thailand, according to an
executive source at CAT.
	   In the negotiations so far, CAT will hold 32 per cent of shares
while CAT staff will have 3 per cent of total stock. The remainder
will be held by UUNet and Thai partners. Negotiations are expected
to be finalised soon. UUNet will provide Internet services at
speeds of 64 KB to corporate users this year and plans to provide
electronic commerce facilities as well. The pricing strategy is
expected to be its strong point.
	   After UUNet starts operating, the source said, all local
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will be affected. UUNet has own
its international link which helps it to be more competitive than
local ISPs who have to pay massive fees to CAT for international
links.
	   ''The international link represents around 40 per cent of an
ISP's costs and this has increased due to the devaluation of the
baht. Although UUNet will have to pay for a half circuit for
internal links, it will still be more competitive than local
ISPs,'' the source said.
	   Kanokwan Wongwatanasin, president of Internet KSC Group, a local
ISP, said that the influx of international ISPs will certainly
affect local ISPs since international ISPs will be more competitive
than local ISPs in terms of investment and international link
costs.
	   Support from CAT in the form of a reduction of international
link charges and increased internal link speeds are essential to
the survival of local ISPs.
	   Kanokwan suggested that CAT rent its huge bandwidth to local
ISPs. This will help reduce ISP's investment costs by 20 per cent.
In the meantime, it should encourage Internet use in Thailand as
well as increase link capacity by such mean as setting up ATM
technology (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) in telecommunications
infrastructure.
	   ''If CAT ignores the support of local ISPs, the Thai Internet
industry will be dominated by foreign investors, the same as has
happened with other industries,'' he said.
	   Kanokwan said the demand for Internet facilities in business has
fallen by 50 per cent due to the economic turmoil while competition
in the industry is still high. However, the impact of the arrival
of UUNet will depend on its service.

	   ASK anyone where Chenderoh is and they will give you a vague
answer, pointing in the direction of Grik, situated along the Kuala
Kangsar-Grik road.
	   Not much is known about the constituency historically, a
traditionally Barisan Nasional area, that encompasses Lenggong and
Lubok Merbau. Its population of about 40,000 is mainly made up of
farmers and fishermen.
	   Despite having been provided with basic amenities Chenderoh,
located some 90km from Ipoh, has still retained much of its
kampung-look.
	   Rubber trees and oil palm estates line the Kuala Kangsar-Grik
road leading to the constituency, lending a rustic atmosphere to
the area.
	   Upon approaching Lenggong, the road widens and the scenic Tasek
Raban comes into view.
	   Tasek Raban, an artificial lake, was formed when the Sungai
Raban was flooded by the impounding of the Chenderoh Dam along
Sungai Perak over half a century ago.
	   The lake, which covers a vast area on both sides of the main
road, supports a rich supply of quality riverine fish and provides
a livelihood for the full-time fishermen living on the fringes of
the lake.
	   Apart from a becoming a popular tourist destination, the lake is
also the centre of a budding aquaculture industry being tapped by
the State Government, State Fisheries Department and the Farmers'
Organisation Authority.
	   There are over 20 aquaculture projects undertaken by various
individuals and groups, including the ex-servicemen's association.
	   The shores of the lake are dotted with aquaculture platforms and
cages.
	   Among the fish being bred in cages are jelawat, patin, talapia,
lampam jawa and baung.
	   Some of the fish harvested from the lake are being supplied to
restaurants in various parts of the country.
	   Because of the tourism potential, the State Government has
developed Tasik Raban and its vicinity into a resort-like setting
with facilities for anglers and holiday-makers.
	   One of them is the RM1.1 million tourist complex on the shore
along the main road. It was opened two years ago and comprises
restaurants, a tourist information centre and stalls.
	   At the entrance of the complex stands a RM50,000 monument on how
Lenggong got its name. It shows a leaning timber (''terlanggung''
timber) after being felled by using the traditional Orang Asli axe.
	   Elsewhere, not much development seems apparent in the
constituency, though concerted efforts by the State Government have
been taken to promote industrial development.
	   These efforts, some of which have brought a measure of progress
to the more rural areas, are seen as a manifestation of the wakil
rakyats who are determined to bring Chenderoh out from the shadows.
	   Member of Parliament for Chenderoh is Deputy Minister in the
Prime Minister's Department Datuk Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, while
State Assemblyman for Lubok Merbau is Jamal Nasir Rasdi, who is
also Perak Umno Youth chief, and Chenderoh Umno division chairman
Talha Ismail is Lenggong State Assemblyman.
	   A lot is expected to come out of this combination of
intellectual and idealistic trio.
	   For Mohamed Nazri, his goal, among others, is to transform the
constituency into a haven for people from all walks of life, for
Jamal Nasir his plans include setting up a consortium to boost
economic activities while for Talha, education is a priority,
particularly religious education.
	   In more ways than one, many of these goals and aspirations have
had the desired effect.
	   For example, efforts have been made to bring in more economic
activities to prevent the younger people from leaving the area to
seek greener pastures at factories in Ipoh and Penang.
	   The nearby Perak Hanjoong cement factory, for instance, has
provided many job opportunities for the locals, while the
aquaculture industry has managed to rope in young entrepreneurs.
	   Plans are also underway to establish an industrial estate for
small and medium industries which is expected to bring in 10,000
jobs for the constituents.
	   And once the Grik-Kuala Kangsar highway is open more development
and economic activities are expected.
	   To further boost tourism in the constituency, there are plans to
develop Lenggong into an ``archaeo-tourism'' destination because of
the discovery of various pre-historic artifacts, dating back to
more than 30,000 years.
	   An archaeology museum, costing RM1.9 million to be undertaken by
Muzium Negara, will be built on a eight-hectare sight in Kota
Tampan near Lenggong to store and display the artifacts found in
the area and its surroundings.
	   One of the most distinctive artifacts discovered was that of the
Perak Man unearthed in Gua Gunung Runtuh at Lenggong in June 1990.
	   It is said to be the oldest and most complete human fossil ever
found in Southeast Asia. The remains were discovered by an
archaeological team from Universiti Sains Malaysia led by Prof
Datuk Dr Zuraina Abdul Majid and had attracted worldwide attention.
	   Aged between 10,000 and 11,000 years old, the Perak Man was
between 40 and 45 years old. According to archaeological records,
he was buried in a foetal position following a ritual, with some
food and shells.
	   Apparently this was not the only finding. In August 1996,
researchers unearthed 1,500 artifacts in Bukit Jawa, also in
Lenggong, which dated back 50,000 to 100,000 years.
	   The area was believed to be the centre of activity in Peninsular
Malaysia in the palaeolithic (Old Stone Age) times.
	   Chenderoh has a voter population of 32,614, with Malays making
up the majority of 72.4 per cent, Chinese 21.39 per cent, Indian
5.97 per cent and others 5.97 per cent.

	   To boost the Thai software industry, the National Electronics
and Computer Technology Centre (Nectec) plans to set a standard for
object-oriented, game and Thai language programmes developed under
the Small Software project. Sompit Potipattanakorn reports.
	   The Small Software project, started in 1996, aims to encourage
students from secondary to undergraduate level to develop Thai
software. Under the project, Nectec contributes Bt2 million a year
to establish a software development contest every year.
	   ''The major purpose of this project is to encourage Thai
software developers to serve the Thai software industry in the
future,'' said Nectec's chief researcher at the software and
language engineering laboratory, Chonchanok Viravan.
	   Although the major purpose of this project is to boost the
number of Thai software developers to resolve the lack of IT
personnel, the quality of software is the next concern.
	   Chonchanok said even though it was developed by students, some
software which won in the contest last year is of sufficient
quality to use.
	   However, to encourage as much software as possible to meet a
higher standard, the project committee plans to set a benchmark in
next year's event. The types of software which will have to meet
the standards include object-oriented software, game software and
Thai language software.
	   ''These three areas are very important for the Thai software
industry,'' she said.
	   Object-oriented software and game software are considered to
have huge potential in the worldwide market.
	   According to a survey, game software currently dominates the
total software market worldwide, while the global value of
object-oriented software is expected to rise from Bt44 trillion
this year to Bt220 trillion by 2001.
	   ''We don't dream of developing software to compete with big
software developers such as Microsoft, but we hope that Thai
software developers can develop small or object-oriented software
to sell to big developers. Therefore we have to set a standard,''
Chonchanok said.
	   On the other hand, the lack of standardisation of Thai language
software is the major cause of the money wasted in software
development. All Thai software developers have to develop the
entire programme if they want to make software for Thai use. Some
programmes such as word checkers, Thai Optical Character
Recognition, text to speech and Thai structural are essential
components of any Thai software.
	   ''If this software has a set standard, Thai developers will no
longer need to waste time and money duplicating parts of it,'' she
said.
	   The standard for these areas will be introduced for the contest
next year. In addition, the Small Software contest next year will
focus on developing software for educational purposes and for use
by disabled people.
	   ''We try to encourage the development of software for society as
well,'' she said.
	   The software for disabled people in the contest will be
concerned with access to information and support for learning
facilities.
	   This year, Nectec donated around 25 software items which won the
Small Software contest last year to the Office of the National
Primary Education Commission and the Department of General
Education.
	   ''This is the first year that we have donated winning software
to schools for educational purposes. If any school wants this free
software to help in teaching, it can contact both offices directly.
However, distribution of this software for free will be limited to
educational purposes only,'' Chonchanok said.
	   Although the Small Software Project is a minimal project which
contributes only Bt2 million per year, it brings benefit to both
government and private sectors. For examaple, the cost of software
which has been donated to schools works out to only Bt1 to Bt2 per
school.
	   ''We also hope that this project will be the first software
library in Thailand. The software library will help software
developers to develop software which was not completed by other
developers, with no need to start from the beginning,'' she said.
	   Even though it represents only a small move in the development
of IT in Thailand, if supported continually and seriously, it will
result in many advantages to the IT industry in the near and
distant future.

	   To become an international school, Vajiravudh College has set up
a multimedia lab to develop CD-Rom titles while implementing its
own network instead of using traditional paper-based books. Sompit
Potipattanakorn reports.
	   So-called virtual campuses are the centre of attention in the
field of education these days since they are considered to soon be
playing an important role.
	   Apart from establishing electronic networks, CD-Rom lessons are
another aspect of the virtual campus concept.
	   With the hope of becoming an international school next year,
Vajiravudh College, a prestigious government school, plans to
develop CD-Rom titles to replace traditional paper-based books as
well as implementing its own network.
	   ''Our first CD-Rom title, which is to teach English, was
launched early this year,'' said Malcolm Hossick, adviser to the
director.
	   The initiative for developing its own CD-Rom titles was that
most CD-Rom titles available for schools, even from England,
Australia or the United States, are thought to be unsuitable for
Thai students.
	   Therefore the school started to set up the multimedia lab last
year, aimed at developing CD-Rom titles for its students. It was
one year before the lab was finished.
	   The multimedia lab will be responsible for the development of
CD-Rom titles according to guidelines which will be written by
Vajiravut instructors.
	   Its first CD-Rom for teaching English included five titles --
Telling the Time I and II, Calendar, and Opposite I and II, and was
created by the multimedia staff as a trial project.
	   ''Even though the quality of our first CD-Rom is not all that we
would like and it cannot interact with students, it is useful.
However, we plan to develop interactive and animated CD-Roms
soon,'' said Pongpipat Sohsakul, a technician at the multimedia
lab.
	   Hossick added that learning through the CD-Roms will help each
student reach greater objectives. When teaching without CD-Roms, an
instructor cannot concentrate on all students who are at different
levels of skill or intelligence. If the teacher focuses on the less
skilled students, those with higher skills may become bored. On the
other hand, if the teacher concentrates on the students of higher
skills, the others may not be able to catch up.
	   With the CD-Roms, the less skilled students can repeat the
lessons if they fall behind, while the students with higher skills
can go on to the next lesson. Meanwhile, the teacher can monitor
the improvement of each student through a central computer screen.
	   This year the school plans to develop CD-Rom titles about
English for both primary and secondary levels, and then develop
others about different disciplines such as mathematics and science.
	   ''English is our first priority since it is the major problem
for most Thai students and teachers hoping to access information
and communicate with others. If our students have an English
ability, they can access an unlimited amount of information through
the fantastic Internet. If they are not competent in English, they
feel as if they are entering a jungle when going online,'' he said.
	   The company hopes to have CD-Rom titles for all courses in the
next five years. Meanwhile, the school will distribute its CD-Rom
titles to other schools at a discount price, perhaps around Bt30 a
title.
	   ''CD-Rom titles as well as the Internet will play the major role
in education in the future. The Internet is quite simple but
enormously helpful -- anyone can access information from anywhere
around the world almost instantly. The CD-Roms will soon be a
better tool, helping teachers to deal with all students,'' he said.
	   The teacher will continue to play an important role in education
as a facilitator, showing what to learn and how to learn.
	   In the next two years, the school will provide nearly all
lessons through CD-Rom or diskette rather than through traditional
text books.
	   Like many international schools and universities in other
countries, in the future, Vajiravut College students will use only
a laptop computer instead of paper-based books to complete their
courses.
	   ''When that happens, all our students will have to have their
own laptops. All learning processes will be done through laptop
computers,'' he said.
	   Each day, students will carry only their own laptop to their
classes. Any time, anywhere on the school, they will be able to
connect their personal computers to the school's network or the
Internet to access any information they want.
	   Sometimes, students receive assignments from their instructors,
complete the work, and submit it back to the the instructors
through the network or on diskette.
	   In the meantime, lecturers have no paper-based lectures to
deliver since all lessons they plan are stored on the network or a
server.
	   In the class, students just connect their computer to access
that lesson, and learn from the electronic contents while the
lecturer is speaking to the class.
	   With information technology, students are able to learn
independently when ever they want. By just accessing the network,
they find everything at their fingertips.
	   To bring this concept to reality, apart from developing CD-Rom
titles, the school is implementing two protocols to connect with
the Internet as well as servers for recording the CD-Rom titles and
students' information. It plans to provide computer hardware in
every building as well as an e-mail address to all 900 students and
teachers next year.
	   ''Next year our network will be complete. All our classroom
buildings will be linked together. All teachers will use CD-Rom
titles as an aid and they will also write the text to develop their
own lessons,'' Pongpipat said.
	   To encourage teachers to use computers as an aid to teaching,
the school has offered computer training courses to all teachers.
In the meantime, it will encourage students to become familiar with
computers by providing computer courses. The design and technology
department is a trial project.
	   ''The design course using the computer has been available since
early this year. However, it is a sophisticated technology for both
our students and teachers. We have to take time to study to make it
useful,'' he said.
	   However, it is hoped that such courses will help students to use
computers for design work, allowing them to compete other schools,
since computers are a common device for design work these days.

	   THOUGH satisfied with its infrastructures, Chenderoh residents
hope to see more concerted efforts taken by the authorities to
promote tourism and industrial development.
	   By developing the two sectors they think Chenderoh will become
more attractive for young people who have migrated to towns and
other states to return.
	   Many young men and women had left the area where economic
activities are mainly agriculture-based to seek greener pastures.
Most of them work in factories in Ipoh or Penang while a
considerably large number are in the civil service and working in
other states.
	   If either the Government or the private sector capitialised on
existing resources to develop the two sectors, more economic
activities will be spurred.
	   This will provide opportunities for local residents to
participate in development besides becoming an attraction for those
who had migrated to return.
	   MOHD FAUZI MOHD HANAFIAH, 42, who returned to live in Bukit
Nangka a year ago after many years working with a private firm in
Kelantan said Lenggong town and its vicinity had undergone very
little change in the last decade.
	   ``We have good social and healthcare facilities but what we need
most are industries to spur development in other sectors and
provide jobs to the locals,'' he said.
	   Mohd Fauzi who runs a sundry shop in Lenggong town said many
young people, especially women work in factories in Kuala Kangsar
and Ipoh and they travelled daily to work in factory vans.
	   ``We have only a small garment factory here which recruited some
locals,''
	   he added.
	   Coffee-shopowner FONG YEN AUN, 60 said more development is
needed to attract more people to the area besides providing job
opportunities to the locals.
	   He said in view of the lack of development and job prospects,
many young people have left their kampungs in search of work
elsewhere forcing the older generation to continue with their
age-old occupations like tapping rubber and planting padi.
	   ``Few people stop at this town and as a result, business is
badly affected especially during the current economic situation.
	   ``Perhaps, more tourism projects should be developed to
encourage more people to come for a visit,'' he said, adding that
present tourism projects are mostly confined to Tasek Raban which
is quite far from the Lenggong town.
	   ALIAS MISORI, 53, a boat operator from Kampung Beng said what
his village urgently need is a secondary school so that children
from kampungs on the other side of the Sungai Perak, do not need to
cross the river daily.
	   ``After crossing the river by boat, they have to continue the
rest of the journey to three secondary schools in Lenggong in a
crowded van for another 10km.
	   ``There are more than 90 secondary schoolchildren from three
kampungs including Kampung Beng and a small school would be
sufficient to accommodate them so that they do not have to risk
their lives daily in order to go to school,'' he said.
	   Although there were plans to build a bridge across the river,
the children would still have to take the boat ride as it would be
faster.
	   Besides that there is nothing that the town folk have that we
don't have - like clean water supply provided under the rural water
supply project by the Health Department, electricity and
solar-powered public telephones.
	   SADARIAH ABDUL HAMID, 40, said as rural folks, there was not
much the residents of Chenderoh could complain of because they have
all the facilities.
	   ``The only thing we need is more interaction with our wakil
rakyat so problems could be resolved faster,'' said the lady who
sells goreng pisang at Tasik Raban.
	   On the migration of young people to towns, Sadariah said: ``This
is normal, I too was working at a factory in Penang before I got
married and settled down at Kampung Suak, near here.
	   ``Young people want to gain experience outside their villages
but they will come back when they get older,'' she said.
	   Sadariah believed that many of those who had migrated would
return if there are factories operating in their hometown.
	   She also said that tourism-related activities at existing lakes
like Tasik Raban and limestone hills could be further developed to
boost economic activities.
	   Tailor ABDULLAH MD SAMAN, 66, said four of his children migrated
to work in factories in Ipoh because there was no prospects for
them in Chenderoh.
	   ``They are earning good income at the factories, I think they
will come back to work here if there are job opportunities.
	   ``I heard the rubber estates here are also facing worker
shortage problem because there are no young people around,'' he
said.
	   Abdullah who runs a tailoring shop and lives in Chepor not far
from Lenggong town said there was not much physical development.
	   ``This is a rural area with adequate and comfortable basic
facilities.
	   ``We have good water, electricity, telephone and road facilities
and our problems are always attended to promptly by the elected
representatives.''
	   Kampung Beng headman RODI PUTEH, 50, said some 2,000 residents
of his village are comfortable with the facilities provided by the
Government.
	   ``We would appreciate if the Government can provide a secondary
school for our children who now have to make trips on sampans
across the Perak river to school,'' he said.
	   Rodi said tourism potentials of the Perak river could be
capitalised to promote Perak's tourism industries and also to spur
economic activities for the locals.
	   ``The Government or the private sector should capitalise on the
river and carry out tourism activities.
	   ``Most of the head of families in my village work as rubber
tappers and with new opportunities, they could earn some extra
income,'' he added.

No joy for oil producers as OPEC seeks more supply cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Things are looking pretty dismal in the oil
market.
	   Prices have been sinking, even though OPEC surprised traders
this spring by sticking with most of the production cuts its
members promised.
	   Now, some of the big players in OPEC are calling for deeper
reductions in output, and analysts predicted Tuesday they'll
probably miss any new targets. If that's correct, consumers could
continue to enjoy a bargain while producers suffer.
	   ``There's not much out there that looks bullish,'' said Victor
Yu, who follows oil markets in New York for the commodity trader
Refco Inc. ``OPEC _ even though they said they were cutting back
`X' amount of barrels _ they aren't cutting that amount.''
	   Ten of the 11 members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed in an emergency meeting in March to
reduce output by 1.245 million barrels per day.
	   But the International Energy Agency in Paris reported Tuesday
that the actual cuts came up short, at around 1.017 million
barrels, last month.
	   And OPEC member Iraq boosted output modestly. Iraq did not join
the effort to cut production because it can only pump limited
amounts of crude under United Nations sanctions imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   OPEC's dilemma enables U.S. motorists, who are among the world's
biggest energy consumers, to enjoy the benefits of cheap fuel
prices.
	   Retail gasoline in the United States was holding steady at about
dlrs 1.14 per gallon, according to a Lundberg Survey early this
month that said the start of the traditional summer driving season
had failed to push prices higher, thanks to a ``more than ample
supply.''
	   The IEA report cast further gloom over the markets by saying the
demand for crude in Asia was being hit even harder than expected as
a result of the lingering financial crisis.
	   Prices were lower on New York and London futures markets Tuesday
afternoon, extending a sharp decline from Monday.
	   Light sweet crude oil to be delivered in July was off 25 cents,
at dlrs 14.30 per barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Brent crude for July was off 12 cents, at dlrs 14.10 per barrel, on
London's International Petroleum Exchange.
	   OPEC said Tuesday that its average oil price on Monday was dlrs
12.39 per barrel _ not as bad as the low of dlrs 10.75 on March 17,
but still just slightly better than half of the group's official
goal of dlrs 21.
	   Another oil analyst, Geoff Pyne at UBS Ltd. in London, says OPEC
is doing better than expected and would be wise to phase in
additional production cuts over time to let the market ease into a
comfortable level.
	   ``If they decrease half a million barrels in a second round of
cuts, and it sticks in the market, prices could improve, but it
won't be quick,'' Pyne said.
	   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela joined with non-OPEC member Mexico
last week in pledging another 450,000 barrels in daily production
cuts. Those three big exporters were behind the so-called ``Riyadh
agreement'' that led to the first round of cuts.
	   Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi, trying to drum up support for
additional cuts, visited the Kuwaiti oil minister, Sheik Saud
Nasser al-Sabah, on Tuesday.
	   Naimi predicted afterward that more cuts will be forthcoming
from others in OPEC, which meets later this month. Sheik Saud
suggested a good target might be cuts of another 1 million barrels.
	   ``The international markets are now drowning in oil,'' Sheik
Saud told a joint news conference in Kuwait.

	   SELANGOR Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar may be pleased with
himself for having successfully precipitated the cancellation of
the Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations' forum on water
shortage planned for Wednesday in Kuala Lumpur.
	   A letter from Abu Hassan's office to Fomca president Professor
Hamdan Adnan asking for it not to be held had suggested that it
``would confuse the public''.
	   The police seemed to have come to his aid by refusing the permit
for the gathering.
	   But Abu Hassan's victory may be short-lived or even deceiving.
Fomca and its supporters have every reason to be more upset with
Abu Hassan than they already are with the Selangor Waterworks
Department for its poor handling of the crisis.
	   The people who are affected by the water crisis, including Umno
members who were invited to the forum, are more likely to be on the
side of Fomca.
	   One wonders what harm such a public meeting can do to the
already low rating the State Government and the JBA are getting for
their handling of the crisis.
	   Even the Sultan had joined others in criticising the department
for ignoring warnings of the impending shortage.
	   One wonders, too, why Abu Hassan, like so many other
politicians, is so afraid of having their performance reviewed.
	   Isn't it better for them to have their performance reviewed
noisily at a forum than silently, but negatively, in polling
booths?
	   We cannot talk about freedom of expression if people are not
allowed to discuss an everyday issue like water. If we cannot
handle a debate on water shortage, how can we debate the larger and
more sensitive issues like the economy, race, religion, culture and
language?
	   Or is Abu Hassan worried that the forum will set the people
thinking more critically about the efficiency of the State
Government and its machinery?
	   Had the public been told of the precarious water situation, say
six months or a year ago, they would certainly not mind having the
supply reduced in stages.
	   Instead water supply had to be cut from 24 hours a day to
nothing for hundreds of thousands of consumers.
	   With bungles by departments like the JBA and others, it is
questionable if the Malaysian public service will ever receive the
ISO certification.
	   More worrying is the talk that some affected foreign-owned
factories may leave Malaysia for other countries.
	   WITH the economy in an unfavourable condition and the recovery
remaining uncertain, it is imperative that we give some serious
thought to non- economic aspects of life.
	   Employment and education are among them. We need better policies
than merely ensuring that the retrenched workers are appropriately
compensated and more places created in institutions of higher
learning.
	   While Human Resources Minister Datuk Lim Ah Lek is doing a
commendable job ensuring that the interests of the retrenched
workers are safeguarded, a broader and more permanent policy is
needed.
	   Unless the economy recovers quickly, the rate of retrenchment,
and consequently unemployment, will increase. Already the level of
hiring has dropped.
	   With tens of thousands of school-leavers and university
graduates entering the job market, the unemployment rate could jump
suddenly. Yet we are being told that the Government had received
applications from the manufacturing and plantation sectors to
employ more than 76,000 foreign workers.
	   Admittedly, it will be difficult to encourage young Malaysians
to take up all the vacancies in the plantation sector. But surely
there must be plantation jobs which may still be attractive to
local workers if properly publicised.
	   Maybe these young workers are not aware that many plantation
jobs are no longer back-breaking. They are not only highly
mechanised but also well paid.
	   WITH only 78,000 places available in the universities and
colleges for this year's intake as opposed to nearly 455,000
students who sat the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia and Sijil Tinggi
Persekolahan Malaysia last year, the pressure on the job market
will be considerable.
	   Despite the expansion of higher education through the setting up
of more public universities and the introduction of private higher
education institutions, many of the students will still not get a
place despite achieving good grades.
	   While some of those who are offered places may not be able to
take them up due to financial constraints, they will end up in the
job market.
	   A huge number of these school-leavers are more than qualified to
take up jobs in the manufacturing sector which are currently being
offered to foreigners. Maybe a wider publicity by the Government,
industries and employers will attract these young job-seekers.
	   Such a publicity, especially in the Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and
Tamil media, will help. Many of today's manufacturing and
industrial jobs are better-paying than white-collar or clerical
jobs, and the working conditions are just as pleasant.
	   Also it is time the Human Resources Minister spent less time
ensuring that retrenched workers were suitably compensated and more
on finding ways to discourage retrenchment.
	   This he can do by advising and encouraging workers, especially
union members, to think more favourably of salary cuts rather than
forcing employers to resort to retrenchment.
	   There are many employers who would rather resort to salary cuts
and other cost-cutting measures than retrenching workers.
	   With businesses falling, the cost of funds remaining high and
access to loans curtailed by a tight monetary policy, reducing the
operating costs is the only way to stay alive.
	   Maybe it is better for workers to accept salary cuts than to be
unemployed. They may be initially attracted to the compensation
package.
	   But unless they have been working long enough and their salaries
are fairly high, the compensation money may not last very long.
	   Of course, from the management's point of view, it is easier to
retrench workers even though the company has to set aside a hefty
sum to compensate the workers.
	   The Minister may want to help change the mindset of workers and
employers so that we can put to work the productivity-based reward
system.
	   NOBODY in his or her right frame of mind will dispute Dr Chandra
Muzaffar's argument in favour of professionalism and business
ethics in his letter published by the New Straits Times on
Thursday.
	   But in order to achieve a balance between idealism and
practicality, a measure of pragmatism is needed.
	   Since Chandra cited Bank Negara as an example of an institution
in the public realm that cherishes its professional integrity right
through the present situation and one which, in his view, has shown
that it is capable of sound judgment and competent management of
the nation's finances, it may be useful for us to ask the following
questions: What good is professionalism of Bank Negara and the
banking industry if the economy shrinks by the day, companies edge
nearer to bankruptcy and more workers lose jobs?; and What sort of
professionalism is Chandra talking about when bank managers and
officers who have not spent a day managing businesses or risk a
single sen of their own money doing business can dictate terms to
time-tested entrepreneurs and managers?
	   Perhaps Chandra should have suggested that people working for
Bank Negara and other regulatory authorities should be sent for
training with the private sector so that they understand the
workings of business.
	   Yes, there are pseudo-entrepreneurs and managers who are more
concerned with the engine capacity of their cars and the size of
their corporate suites.
	   But in the current tight monetary regime, which hopefully will
end soon following the setting up of the Asset Management Company
to take over the non-performing loans of the banking sector, even
the best and most prudent entrepreneurs and managers are badly
affected.
	   Their credit lines are being squeezed by high interest rates,
single customer limit and shorter NPL period. They are being
treated no better than the wheeler-dealers who had dumped billions
of ringgit of bad debts on the banks.
	   And what professionalism of the banking system can we talk about
when bank managers dispensed billions of ringgit in poorly-secured
loans to shady companies and characters during good times?
	   And what good is a professionally-run banking system if very few
of its customers are left standing?
	   We are all for professionalism, idealism and non-interference by
the Government. But survival of the economy cannot be less
important than the ego and independence of bank managers.
	   FINALLY, I wonder why after more than three decades, Singapore
is still treating the States of Sarawak and Sabah differently from
Peninsular Malaysia.
	   Take, for instance, the case of the republic's Central Provident
Fund.
	   While it allows Malaysians from Sarawak and Sabah to withdraw
their savings immediately upon permanently leaving the republic,
Malaysians from other States have to wait until they are at least
50 years old.
	   For Malaysians from the peninsula, they are allowed to withdraw
their savings in full only upon attaining 55 years of age and after
leaving the republic permanently.
	   One can also withdraw the savings at the age of 50 if one has
not worked in Singapore for two years before making the
application.
	   It is understandable for Singapore to practise this policy in
the early days of its separation from Malaysia in 1965. But for it
to retain the policy after three decades, especially in the current
unfavourable economic conditions, brings its motive into question.
	   Surely Singapore cannot deny that its economy depends more on
workers from Peninsular Malaysia than those from Sabah and Sarawak.
To disallow them from withdrawing their savings upon leaving their
Singapore jobs and returning to Malaysia cannot be fair. This rule
appears to apply only to workers from Peninsular Malaysia.
	   While the point that the changes in the CPF withdrawal
conditions were discussed within the context of wider co-operation
between the two countries by their respective Prime Ministers is
noted, Singapore does not have to wait for an agreement to be
reached on the entire package of co- operation to relax the rules.
	   As for us in Malaysia, serious thought should be given to making
it compulsory for foreign workers to contribute to the Employees'
Provident Fund or other similar funds not only for their future
welfare but also to increase domestic savings.
	   This is only fair because they enjoy many of the public
amenities and services funded by EPF loans.

Hamas: Sheik Yassin to return within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report Israeli security recommends Yassin be
allowed to return &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder and
spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, will return to
Gaza within days, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas spokesman, told The Associated Press that
Yassin _ who has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim countries
raising millions of dollars and drumming up support for Hamas _
will ``most likely'' come back to Gaza on Saturday.
	   Israel's security establishment and political leaders have been
debating for weeks whether the sheik would pose a greater danger
from outside or inside Gaza. Israel, which controls Gaza's borders,
could keep Yassin out if it wished.
	   But by Tuesday, Israeli leaders appeared to be leaning toward
allowing him back into Gaza, in part because keeping him out could
set off an explosion of violence by backers of Hamas.
	   ``The choice is not between what is good and better, but between
what is bad and worse,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   State-owned Israel TV reported that Israel's internal security
agency, Shin Bet, submitted its recommendation to the government
that Yassin's returned be allowed and coordinated with the
Palestinian Authority. Not other details on the recommendation were
available and the secret agency does not have a spokesperson.

	   THE Local Administration Department's move to allow kamnan and
village heads to have ex-officio rights to sit on the board of the
Tambon Administrative Organisation met with resistance Monday from
Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiseth.
	   LAD Director-General Pramual Rujanaseri admitted that the
department accepted the proposal from the Kamnan and Village heads
Association of Thailand to amend the TAO Act in a bid to maintain
the local leaders' automatic right to sit on the TAO's board.
	   Pramual said the department has submitted the proposal to
Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart.
	   Chamni insisted that the LAD's intention to allow local leaders
to wear two hats at the same time would be unconstitutional.
	   ''Although the LAD viewed that the attempt to amend the LAD act
is not unconstitutional, I have a totally different opinion,'' he
said.
	   He said the Local Administration Act stipulated that local
leaders have the responsibility to keep peace, not to manage the
local administration. The new constitution wants members of LAD to
be directly elected from the people.
	   Since the new constitution was being drafted, the local leaders
vowed to fight to maintain their right and threatened mass
demonstration against the move by the draftsmen to deprive their
automatic right to sit on the TAOs' board.
	   Pramual said the department agreed with the local leader'
proposal because it believed allowing them on the board of the TAOs
would improve its operation.
	   ''I am not taking sides but I am concerned about possible
conflicts (between elected TAO board members and kamnan and village
heads). The two need to work closely. If they do not co-operate,
the attempt to reform politics and decentralisation would fail,''
he said.
	   The new constitution gives a 10-year grace period before kamnan
and village heads are required to resign from their posts if they
want to run in the election for the TAO board.

	   THE latest issue of Pemuda, a glossy newsletter circulated among
members of Umno Youth, has a picture of a pensive-looking Tun Daim
Zainuddin.
	   Daim is part of the cover story on the Youth wing's economic
convention held late last year where the former Finance Minister
and now Economic Advisor to the Government spoke frankly on the
economy.
	   The event was just one of a host of activities that have been
organised by Umno Youth under Datuk Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.
	   In fact, even the most casual perusal of the current and
previous issues of Pemuda is enough to convince most people that
Zahid - he answers to his second name - has been anything but idle
since beating three others to the post in party elections two years
ago.
	   An indication of the breadth of activities: Zahid saying mahgrib
prayers in Jelebu with members of Negri Sembilan Umno; Zahid at a
football match organised by the Larut Youth division; Zahid and his
Youth exco calling on the Pahang Menteri Besar; Zahid leading a
clenched-fist demonstration outside the US Embassy; Zahid and his
boys breaking fast with the Perak Menteri Besar; Zahid meeting the
X Generation of Felda Lembah Klau near Raub, and so on.
	   Even those connected to his previous contenders concede to the
energy that Zahid has demonstrated thus far.
	   Says Md Alwi Che Ahmad, political secretary to Rural Development
Minister Datuk Annuar Musa: ``There have been hundreds of courses
and activities ... more than under any other Pemuda leader.''
	   ``Datuk Zahid is very, very hard-working,'' declares the very,
very loyal Youth executive secretary Saifuddin Nasution.
	   Take the past week. Zahid had slotted in back-to-back meetings
with academicians, special interest groups, NGOs, media
practitioners and State Umno Youth representatives to gather
feedback and material for his policy speech at the coming Umno
Youth Assembly.
	   The chubby and good-natured Youth head is said to have picked up
the consultative method from none other than his mentor, Datuk Seri
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Another habit Zahid adopted to great effect - this one was
carried over from his corporate sector days - is delegating work.
	   One of the first things he did on assuming the Youth leadership
was to form councils headed by exco members to deal with virtually
every aspect of Malaysian life.
	   There are 23 such councils and they play a sort of ``shadow
Cabinet''
	   role.
	   ``These councils, they are there to monitor the Malay interest
in government policies and issues. It's all part of our struggle
for the Malay agenda,'' says Saifuddin.
	   Indeed, it is the monitoring efforts of these councils that has
enabled Umno Youth to emerge as one of the most on-the-ball and
vocal bodies around. There are very few issues and policies which
Umno Youth does not have an opinion on.
	   These opinions naturally carry a Malay flavour and, more
importantly, carry clout in a way that few other organisations -
even if they spout the same views - do.
	   For instance, says Dr Abdul Rahim Ghouse, who heads the wing's
economic council, Umno Youth took exception to the proposal by the
National Economic Action Council to open up certain key industries
currently held by Bumiputeras to non-Bumiputeras.
	   ``Our stand is: offer them to Malays who can afford to take them
up.
	   Then, if there are no takers, open them to non-Bumiputera
Malaysians.''
	   Incidentally, the most active councils have been the ones on
economic, consumer, religious, education and social issues.
	   ``We have made substantive contributions on very real issues,
issues close to the hearts and pockets of the rakyat, even to the
point of influencing some government policies,'' says Abdul Rahim.
	   A great deal of emphasis has also been placed on training and
Zahid often tells his rank and file that to be a good leader, one
must be humble enough to allow oneself to be trained.
	   ``To some extent, Zahid has turned Pemuda around,'' says Johor
Baru MP Khaled Nordin who heads the education council.
	   ZAHID took over a Youth wing whose public image had been badly
battered by the problems associated with his predecessor Tan Sri
Rahim Thamby Chik.
	   Now, two years later, loyalists like Saifuddin and Abdul Rahim
insist that the wing's image is ``pro-rakyat'' and, more
importantly, plays an assertive role in the ``Malay struggle''.
	   ``Datuk Zahid sees Pemuda as the link between the grass roots
and government. We have been critical ... we declared a jihad
against corruption,'' says Abdul Rahim.
	   The movement also came out strongly on the Agriculture
Ministry's role in food production.
	   ``But, basically, we support the Government,'' Abdul Rahim adds.
	   They admit that not being appointed to any government posts has
been a bit of a disappointment for Zahid (deputy Youth head Datuk
Hishammuddin Hussein is Deputy Primary Industries Minister).
	   ``He feels it a little bit ... he's only human. But, after two
years, he's accepted the fact. Besides, there are many things he
can do because he does not have a government post and it is akward
only at formal functions where a Deputy Minister takes precedence
over a political head,''
	   says Saifuddin.
	   Then there is the difficult question of idealism, something
considerably lacking among the younger generation, including Umno
Youth.
	   This is something easier talked about than done.
	   ``It's something which Zahid should seriously look into,'' says
Kelantan Youth's Md Alwi, a close friend of the Youth leader.
	   ``There is still a gap between the leaders and the grass roots,
especially the rural grass roots. You have leaders zooming around
in Mercedes Benz, wearing Versace belts, Rolex watches and
expensive silk shirts ... worlds apart from the mass of ordinary
Malay youth,'' says Md Alwi.
	   And even while Zahid is seen as having set the Youth wing back
on- course, he himself is occasionally perceived as being slightly
off-course.
	   ``It's the way he says things ... sometimes unnecessary,'' says
a Youth politician from Penang.
	   Some think that Zahid's somewhat impetuous speaking style is a
hang-up from his years as Youth information chief.
	   The most recent incident involved his comments of a plot to
overthrow Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar. The Umno
fraternity, especially that of Selangor, felt he had spoken out of
turn.
	   Then there was his infamous fiasco over the Lee Kuan Yew
remarks.
	   Many think he should do some homework, even research, before
speaking up. That, as Youth leader, he is among the seven most
important figures in the party and, as such, should be more
thoughtful in his public statements.
	   ``These are things you learn by experience ... thinking before
you speak.
	   But, it won't be held against him,'' says Johor's Khaled.
	   Zahid was also recently embarrassed by the reaction to his
exco's proposal that the two top Youth posts go uncontested next
year although some say the pressure discouraging such a proposal
came from a highly- placed figure within the party.
	   Whatever it was, it did not show up well on him, particularly,
given that he had advocated contests in the Youth wing during the
divisional elections.
	   But, Saifuddin says that the exco proposal, though now aborted,
reflected Zahid's standing in the party.
	   Perhaps one of the most positive impacts of the short-lived
proposal is that it has finally ironed out the last creases in the
relationship between Zahid and his No 2.
	   And according to Saifuddin: ``Hisham(muddin) told me: not even
(President) Clinton will be able to make me do it (challenge
Zahid).''
	   ``They may be on their own when it comes to politics, but
everything is very transparent between them,'' says a Johor
politician.
	   Hishammuddin, on his part, goes out of the way to keep Zahid
informed on his movements and programmes.
	   Since taking over, Zahid has held meetings with close to
two-thirds of the division Youth leadership in the different
States.
	   At every State that he goes to, he meets up with the Menteri
Besar or Chief Minister for breakfast or dinner before a
closed-door session with the division Youth heads. In States where
the opposition is prominent, a ceramah will be thrown in so that
the ordinary Youth members can be involved.
	   Zahid's handling of the Youth wing may not be a roaring success
yet, but it has certainly been impactful and energetic.
	   In the process, he has restored morale for the movement and,
despite holding no government post, established a firm footing for
himself.
	   His supporters say that if he goes on this way, he is heading
for a second term, whether or not he is challenged.

	   APART from being consumer retail outlets, convenience stores in
the future will be community places where people can conduct
various public activities and get information remotely and
electronically, said Phanu Limmanont, the assistant vice president
of Retailink, an IT subsidiary of the Charoen Phokphand
conglomerate.
	   He said convenience stores can take advantage of their
nationwide networks to boost their retail businesses by using
information technology to turn the traditional store into an
electronic outlet, allowing people to use public services such as
paying utility bills or getting access to information about their
local community.
	   He said paying utility bills is the first step for convenience
stores to become electronic outlets. CP's 7-Eleven stores now allow
people to pay water, electricity and telephone bills near their
home.
	   The chain has opened utility service counters in 60 metropolitan
outlets. Phanu said the firm plans to expand this service to 100
outlets this year and eventually to every outlet in the 7-Eleven
network.
	   To provide this new service, 7-Eleven has invested Bt25 million
for computer systems in branches and the central office with links
to each utility's office for electronic bill payments.
	   All transactions are collected and sent electronically to each
utility company for updating at the end of each day. Phanu said
there are now around 90,000 transactions a day from all 7-Eleven
utility counters. It's expected that the figure will reach 150,000
per day soon.
	   He admitted that this new service is a value-added aspect of the
7-Eleven retail business. It helps increase customer traffic in the
stores which also helps increase sales volume in the stores.
	   ''We expect that this new service will help 7-Eleven increase
revenue in the retail business by around 30 per cent,'' he said.
	   He predicted that the average 20-square-metre 7-Eleven store
will eventually be equipped with IT to provide other public
services such as information or Internet access, computing services
or even electronic retail banking services.
	   The integration of IT and the outlet's network will change the
role of convenience stores, making them a public centre for each
community where IT service providers can easily deliver their
services to the public.
	   Phanu said in addition, IT also helps increase working
efficiency at the stores themselves. 7-Eleven plans to invest Bt1
billion to implement new back and front-end computer systems to
improve its internal management next year. The new system will help
manage inventory, control stock on the shelves and deliver sales
results. Executives can know the status of each branch and their
sales volume and use this information for future planning.

	   A RECENT remark that people only perceive the environment as an
issue when it really affects their lives no doubt hits the nail on
the head as regards mankind's attitude towards the state of their
surroundings. It is worrisome that as planet Earth observes yet
another World Environment Day two days ago, it is plagued by loss
of biodiversity, global warming, the ozone hole, land degradation
and pollution of international waters with no immediate solutions
in sight. Recent unexpected weather conditions have painfully
brought home the importance of environmental preservation.
	   While the oceanic phenomenon El Nino is unleashing havoc on the
world's weather, bringing snow in Jordan and Mexico, drought in
Southeast Asia and floods in Somalia, extremely warm temperatures
are being felt around the globe. Scientists said three of the past
eight years have been the warmest in the Northern Hemisphere for at
least 600 years and greenhouse gases are the primary cause. In Asia
of late, temperatures of more than 40 degrees Celsius were recorded
in the Indian subcontinent causing deaths from heatwave. In
Malaysia, the weatherman reported that this year's monthly average
temperatures for January and February were the highest recorded for
the past 30 years. Residents have experienced a maximum sweltering
temperature of as high as 38 degrees in the past couple of months.
	   Mercifully, the temperature has come down a bit.
	   The Malaysian experience in seriously preserving the environment
does not have a long history as the Department of Environment was
created just a little over 20 years ago. Undoubtedly, the setting
up of a ministry to look after this vital area shows the Federal
Government's seriousness in tackling the myriad environmental
problems, which will inevitably mount with the country's rapid
development. Unfortunately, the task turns out to be arduous and
frustrating due largely to the reluctance to change by both
industries and relevant agencies and the fact that the ministry
``has the responsibility but not the authority'', as one leader
aptly puts it.
	   Sadly, it takes a major crisis to jolt all concerned into
realisation that it is imperative that they take effective measures
to take care of the environment before it is too late. Last year's
haze experience was said to have done a world of good for the
ministry's hitherto uphill battle to convince the relevant
authorities that they cannot remain unresponsive to moves for a
better environment. The water crisis in some parts of Peninsular
Malaysia, which is still plaguing the Klang Valley, should make the
people more aware of the importance of protecting natural
resources, said the ministry last week. It hopes the awareness
would remain deeply rooted so that water is not taken for granted.
It should also be ``an eye-opener for us not to pollute our rivers
and destroy our catchment areas which are critical elements in our
water supply''.
	   The question remains: will we ever learn? We better do to save
the country from the disastrous environmental problems as
experienced by some countries. Malaysia's fast pace of development
has already seen degradation and pollution of its land, water
sources, seas and the air.
	   Increasingly, the hand of the ministry has been strengthened
with the introduction of legislation and improved regulations to
deal with wrong- doers as well as policies to safeguard the
environment, particularly its rich flora and fauna. Encouragingly,
the Federal authorities' difficult task in creating greater
environmental awareness has been aided by the active role of the
mass media, particularly the print media.
	   But laws alone are clearly inadequate. The awareness campaign
has to be ongoing and far-reaching, including schools, industries
and the man in the street. There is also a need for a firm guiding
hand at the top. As rightly pointed out at a recent global
environment conference, we need to make environmental conservation
a people's movement.

	   THE US-based computer manufacturer Compaq has repositioned its
PC desktop lines by redesigning its products to cope with the needs
of each market segment.
	   According to the company's research, customers' behaviour in the
Asia Pacific region is changing, with different customers having
different requirements.
	   Compaq Computer (Thailand)'s acting managing director Tan Kok
Hin said small and medium enterprises today want to take advantage
of changes in technology to make the best purchasing decision at
any given time, while large or international enterprises prefer to
buy products that are consistent with their existing systems.
	   The company last week announced a new product repositioning in
Thailand while launching two new desktop PC models -- the Deskpro
EN and EP -- targeted at large or international enterprises and
small and medium organisations respectively.
	   Both models are based on a Pentium II processor at speeds from
266 MHz to 400 MHz with the capability of easily converting from
desktop to minitower.
	   The price for a new Deskpro EN for large enterprises is up to
Bt50,000 while the EP is up to Bt42,000.
	   Hin said the company plans to phase out the previous Deskpro
2000, 4000 and 6000 models. The Deskpro EP will replace the Deskpro
2000 in the small and medium market and the Deskpro EN replaces the
former Deskpro 4000 and 6000 in the large enterprise market.
	   ''We plan to cancel production of the previous Deskpro 2000 to
6000 models in the near future. We hope that we can fully replace
all previous Deskpro models with the new series in the next two
years,'' he added.
	   For the low-end market, Hin said the company last month launched
the Deskpro 1000. This product positioning remains the same.

Kazakstan introduces new capital to the world

<TEXT>
	   ASTANA, Kazakstan (AP) _ Until now, this remote city in northern
Kazakstan has been best known for its inhospitable climate, vicious
mosquitoes and endlessly flat land.
	   On Tuesday, its newly refurbished streets were decorated with
flags and balloons and were full of families celebrating Astana's
new status as capital of the Central Asian country of 17 million
people.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev called Wednesday's formal
dedication of Astana a historic event that would show how far the
former Soviet republic has come since gaining independence in 1991.
	   ``The new center of the country will be new energy for the new
state,'' Nazarbayev said on a national call-in TV show. ``We are
showing the whole world what our capabilities are.''
	   Astana _ previously known as Akmola _ became Kazakstan's capital
in December, replacing Almaty, a city of 1.2 million 1,125
kilometers (700 miles) away. Wednesday is the formal unveiling to
the world, a day scheduled to be full of speech-making,
backslapping and cultural events.
	   The city has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past
two years. New government buildings have been constructed, dull
gray apartment buildings along the main street have been
refurbished and painted bright white, green or orange. Store fronts
have new plate-glass windows and flashy neon signs.
	   ``The service has changed for the better,'' said Galina
Zhernonikova, a 48-year-old hospital administrator who has lived in
Astana for 20 years. ``We now have products we didn't have
before.''
	   For the most part, the transfer of the capital has not been very
popular with the Kazak people. Many grumble that the cost of the
move, which has never been fully made public, is money that could
have been spent on overdue wages and pensions.
	   The reconstruction of government buildings, including the
presidential and government offices, parliament and ministries, has
so far cost dlrs 120 million, Nazarbayev announced this week for
the first time.
	   About dlrs 90 million of that came from a fund for the new
capital to which local and foreign companies have contributed, he
said.
	   In an effort to improve the image of the new capital, it was
renamed last month from Akmola _ which means ``white grave'' in
Kazak _ to Astana, which just means capital.
	   ``I think the name Astana is really plain,'' said 19-year-old
Azamat Akhmetov. ``We should have had a renaming competition to
pick the best one. We were never asked about our opinion.''
	   Astana, a city of 130,000, was selected as the new capital in
1994 because of its central location, and because Almaty is
overcrowded, too close to the Chinese border and prone to
earthquakes.
	   One of the unofficial reasons is that Nazarbayev wants to
counter separatist tendencies in Kazakstan's north, which is
populated mostly by ethnic Russians.

Two hang gliders killed during world cup competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two hang gliders were killed Tuesday
during the Hang Gliding World Cup taking place on Mount Kithairona,
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of Athens, the Greek
National Air Club said.
	   According to initial information, Michalis Theoharis, 52, and
Alexis Patarias, 25, had been flying for about three hours when
they accidentally entered a storm, said Christos Athanassopoulos,
the air club's spokesman.
	   The two Greeks apparently lost consciousness from the intense
cold in the sudden storm and crashed in the mountainous region.
Other athletes who also entered the storm managed to escape
unharmed, the spokesman added.
	   Weather conditions were good at the beginning of the day, the
air club said in an announcement, adding that it had asked experts
to investigate the exact causes of the accident.
	   Competitions were interrupted for the day. But the week-long
meet, which began Sunday with 103 athletes from 12 countries, will
continue to end as scheduled on June 14, Athanassopoulos said.

	   A SMALL hospital can have a big heart. I came across one last
week in the form of the Tanjung Malim Hospital.
	   Its surroundings provide a comforting atmosphere to patients and
visitors alike, and one can rest quite peacefully within its
premises.
	   The hospital is located along the old Kuala Lumpur-Ipoh trunk
road and is not difficult to spot. After passing Tanjung Malim
town, you proceed north and cross the railway gate heading towards
Proton City.
	   Just before the traffic lights, you will see the hospital on the
right.
	   It is sandwiched between a big Hindu temple on its right and the
famous Tanjung Malim teachers training institute on its left.
	   Even as you enter the hospital grounds, you already feel the
serenity of the place.
	   I imagine that the same serenity is found in small hospitals in
other parts of the country.
	   The hospital has a big courtyard in the centre with a
well-manicured lawn. There are two car parks for visitors and they
are seldom full.
	   Motorbikes and bicycles have different sheds, making the
hospital quite user-friendly.
	   Big city hospitals have parking lots, too, but using them is
usually accompanied by a degree of stress.
	   The gardeners were busy trimming the hedges and they went about
with their work efficiently and quietly. This speaks well for the
hospital's general cleanliness and creates a pleasant feeling all
around.
	   The kitchen staff, too, went about their chores speedily and
just as quietly. It gave me the impression that everyone knew
exactly what they were supposed to do with minimum or no
supervision.
	   I spent two days at the hospital visiting a couple of old folks
warded for different ailments. Ward Number One is for male
patients.
	   Visiting hours appear to be quite flexible, but most visitors
come during lunch and tea time.
	   A small signboard hangs on the iron grille at the entrance of
Ward One, advising visitors to refrain from entering the ward when
the doctor is on his rounds, normally in the morning.
	   In a small hospital, the doctor is the most respected figure.
The doctor usually starts his rounds between 8.30 and 9am.
Accompanied by a nurse, whom the kampung folk keep referring to as
`Missy', the doctor goes from patient to patient.
	   I suppose a general practitioner is the most qualified medical
officer to be stationed at a small hospital.
	   His patients are as varied in their ailments as in their ages.
	   At Ward One, a 60-year-old former teacher had just had the
toenails of his left foot removed and had to be warded for a few
days.
	   Next to him was a teenager whose fever had not come down for a
couple of days.
	   At the other end of the roomy ward, an old ustaz had not eaten
solid food for several weeks.
	   His children were very worried as the old man appeared weak and
frail.
	   He had a stream of callers during visiting hours.
	   Visitors to a small town hospital often end up visiting several
patients during a single visit.
	   A village head commonly referred to as Tok Empat walked into the
ward one day and was surprised to see some of his durian-loving
buddies hospitalised.
	   One of them, an old Chinese man clad only in a thin Pagoda
T-shirt and striped boxer shorts, managed a smile and asked Tok
Empat whether his durian trees were fruiting.
	   The old man said he hoped to get out of hospital soon to tend to
his trees.
	   It is normal for a village head to know many people and his
friends thought that he had come to visit them.
	   The fact was, Tok Empat came to visit only one patient, not
knowing that several other friends were also under prolonged
treatment.
	   The patients I spoke to seemed genuinely interested in the
welfare of their fellow mates.
	   After the doctor had finished his morning rounds, the patients
would move about asking each other how they were progressing.
	   The older patients invariably came up with the question: ``Did
the doctor tell you when you could go home?''
	   The doctor spends about 10 minutes with each patient. Taking the
patients' pulse, feeling their stomachs and asking questions about
their ailments, I could sense a certain rapport between them.
	   In a small town hospital, and for folks who cannot afford the
luxury of five-star hospitals and medical homes, a compassionate
general practitioner makes all the difference.
	   Small town hospitals like Tanjung Malim's handle many accident
cases.
	   Seldom does a week pass without its ambulance being called out
to ferry patients from crash sites.
	   One thing I found about the staff of small hospitals is that
they are dedicated, flexible in the administration of wards and
with an ear for their patients.

	   THE Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand (FCCT) is holding a
panel discussion tomorrow at 7 pm on a highly topical issue -- the
future of Indonesia post-Suharto.
	   Although Suharto has stepped down, the dust has yet to settle in
this strife-torn country. His successor may be the only hope at
present, but immediate action must be taken to bring back investor
confidence. This means urgent reforms and tough action against
relatives of Suharto who still control most of the country's
economic sector.
	   The panel members have recently returned from Indonesia and will
be screening scenes of rioting, looting and demonstrations.
	   For more information, call 652 0580-1.

Defending champion Philippoussis upset in first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With his power game and huge serve, Mark
Philippoussis was once considered a potential Wimbledon champion.
Righ now, he's playing so poorly he might not even go to Wimbledon.
	   ``This year's been pathetic for me and I just haven't been there
at all,'' the Australian said Tuesday after losing in the first
round of the Queen's Club tournament to Spain's Jordi Burillo 7-6
(11-9), 7-5.
	   Philippoussis, the defending champion and ninth seed in the
prestigious Wimbledon warmup event, has failed to advance beyond
the opening round in five of his 12 tournaments this year.
	   ``I'm actually deciding whether to play Wimbledon,'' he said.
``At the moment I'm not sure. I'm not sure what's going to happen.
I'll go to Florida and talk with my father about it.
	   ``On the court nothing's there for me. I haven't got the desire,
and I can't afford to go out there and give away matches like that.
It's better not going on the court at all.''
	   In another upset, 11th seeded Todd Martin, who beat Pete Sampras
in the 1994 Queen's Club final, lost 6-4, 6-2 to Swiss qualifier
Ivo Heuberger.
	   Australia's Jason Stoltenberg, seeded No. 16, was the only other
seed to fall, losing to Belgian qualifier Laurence Tieleman 3-6,
7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, the 10th seed and runner-up in 1997, overcame
American David Wheaton 6-1, 7-6 (10-8). Other seeded players to
advance were No. 12 Todd Woodbridge, No. 13 Brett Steven, No. 14
Byron Black and No. 15 Mark Woodforde.
	   American qualifier Doug Flach, ranked 222, surprised the Czech
Republic's Daniel Vacek 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.
	   Philippoussis double-faulted on set point to hand Burillo the
tiebreaker. In the second set, neither player earned a break point
until Burillo broke serve for the match when Philippoussis sent a
wild forehand long.
	   ``I'm just very confused at the moment,'' Philippoussis said.
``I've tried to think about what's wrong, but I don't now what it
is. It's like I'm not hungry any more and it's not a good feeling
at all.''

	   MALACCA, Sat. - Companies must be environmentally conscious in
their day- to-day operations to stay competitive in today's
marketplace.
	   Sirim Berhad president and chief executive Dr Mohd Ariffin Aton
said the companies must strive to implement the MS ISO 14001
standard, an internationally accepted environmental management
standard.
	   With the certification, the public can be assured of a
well-documented system for identifying, monitoring and managing
environmental impact of their operations and products.
	   More importantly, it indicates commitment to continual
improvement in environmental performance and meeting regulatory
requirements, he said.
	   Speaking at the presentation of the standard to Matsushita
Refrigeration Industries (M) Sdn Bhd today, he however cautioned
that certified organisations are just at the beginning of hard
work.
	   ``They must maintain their systems and strive for continuous
improvement.
	   We will withdraw the certification if they failed to adhere to
the requirements.''
	   Also present was Matsushita Refrigeration Industries managing
director Hiroshi Kawai.
	   Mohd Ariffin added that adherence to the standard would enable
organisations to be more efficient in their business operations and
more environmentally responsible.
	   Mohd Ariffin said 3,458 companies worldwide, in particular the
manufacturing sector, had been certified.
	   ``It is estimated that more than 40 companies in Malaysia have
been certified.
	   ``They are from the oil palm industry, paper products, optical
equipment and plastics industry. Another 50 companies are
undergoing the certification process,'' he added.
	   Matsushita Refrigeration Industries is the third in Malacca to
be accorded the certification.
	   Its personnel and general administration manager Kamal Haslin
Karim said RM2 million was spent on upgrading its waste disposal
treatment facility and landscaping this year.
	   He said Sirim officials would inspect the company's premises
every six months to ensure compliance.
	   The company, which produces refrigeration compressors and
accessories for the export market, has also been awarded the
Canadian environmental standard accreditation.

Russian Orthodox patriarch will not participate in czar's burial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPGRADES attribution, UPDATES with details of
funeral, synod decision. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Orthodox Church distanced itself
Tuesday from the lavish state funeral planned for the country's
last czar, deciding that the patriarch will not preside over next
month's ceremony.
	   The church has expressed lingering doubts over the identity of
nine sets of bones recovered in 1991, despite a six-year
investigation and forensic tests in Russia, Britain and the United
States.
	   In light of the doubts, the Holy Synod ruled Tuesday that no
member of the church hierarchy could take part in the solemn burial
service, scheduled for July 17 in St. Petersburg.
	   However, the Synod said in a statement that in accordance with
the church's obligation to officiate over funerals whenever
requested, priests from the St. Petersburg diocese can take part.
	   In an apparent concession to the government, the Synod also said
that on the day of the funeral, Orthodox churches throughout Russia
will hold requiem Masses to ``pray for the repose of the souls'' of
Nicholas II, his family and servants who were executed by a
Bolshevik firing squad in 1918.
	   The announcement brings to an end months of deliberations in
which the government pressured the church to officiate over a
ceremony seen as an act of national repentance for the excesses of
the Russian Revolution.
	   The decision also suggests that President Boris Yeltsin will not
attend, since Russian media have said the president would only take
part alongside the patriarch.
	   The nine skeletons were recovered from a roadside pit in 1991
outside the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, where the victims
were gunned down by Bolsheviks. Repeated DNA testing has confirmed
their identities as Nicholas, his wife, three of their children
children and four servants.
	   Bodies of two other children have never been found. Those who
disposed of the corpses said they burned two bodies and scattered
the ashes in the woods, but many Orthodox believers distrust any
accounts by Soviet officials.
	   Another cause for hesitation is that the church has started
proceedings that could lead to the canonization of the royal
family. Should they be declared saints, their bones would be
revered as holy relics.
	   The funeral service will be held in the Peter and Paul
Cathedral, the traditional burial site of the Romanovs, who ruled
Russia for 300 years. Hundreds of foreign representatives have been
invited to attend.
	   The director of the Peter and Paul Fortress, where the church is
located, said Tuesday that the government has yet to provide the
7.5 million rubles (more than dlrs 1 million) for the ceremony.
	   Director Boris Arakcheyev said the nine coffins will be placed
in the vault in two rows, with the family members above their
servants.
	   He said the ceremony will be shown live on a large TV screen in
a garden outside, since the church cannot accommodate all the
people invited to attend.

	   Training students to be competitive in the ever-changing world
is a vital step, especially for a country like Thailand. To achieve
this end, Thammasat University established College of Innovative
Education last year to cope up with the challenge. Mongkol Sahachue
talks the institute's head Naris Chaiyasoot about their vision of
the future.
	   UNLIKE many of his colleagues in academia, Naris Chaiyasoot is
not content to restrict himself to writing dry, theoretical papers
advocating reform; he believes that actions speaks louder than
words. While dean of the Faculty of Economics at Thammasat
University between 1994 and 1996, he won much praise for his skills
as an administrator and launched a number of successful projects
aimed at improving the quality of lectures offered by teaching
staff there and helping students learn more effectively.
	   Today he is the director of the College of Innovative Education
(CIE), established in Pattaya last year by Thammasat University to
prepare the Thai workforce to compete in the high-tech job market
of the next millennium. The CIE currently offers post-graduate
degree courses and training programmes geared towards the needs of
the telecommunications, high-technology and hospitality industries
as well as research and training programmes in food science and
technology.
	   ''International competitiveness requires us to have a more
highly skilled labour force trained in the use of technology and in
other advanced fields,'' says Naris. ''We need to develop new
concepts in educational philosophy as well as in administration and
management.'' Although his background is in economics (he has a PhD
in economics, with specialisation in money and banking, from the
University of Hawaii) and he currently chairs the National Research
Council on Economics (as well as being vice-president of the
Thammasat Economics Association), Naris is enthusiastic about his
work at CIE believing that education is the key to ensuring a
bright future for the Kingdom.
	   - Why did you choose to get involved in the field of education?
There are many ways that people can serve their country.
Politicians play a more visible role but in Thailand a politician
has a very short life expectancy with the constant changes of
government and political affiliation. It's a cruel life with
tremendous pressures and uncertainties, and it kills many good
people before their time. As an educator there is much more
stability; we have a much longer time to develop sustainable and
innovative programmes that will benefit society for many years to
come.
	   - What do you feel is your role as a Thai academic? The primary
objective of an academician should be to provide high-quality
education and training to strengthen our global competitiveness and
instil traditions of democracy, morality, and ethics in the younger
generation.
	   In addition, a university should be concerned about the real
world. Academicians should use their specialised training and
experience to give direction to society. This is a tremendous
responsibility, requiring wisdom and judgement.
	   It is impossible to be an expert in every field, so I try to be
very careful to limit my comments to areas where I have some
training and experience. I strongly believe that expressing
unfounded opinions and giving wrong advice is a sin.
	   - What do you think of the university system in Thailand at
present? Although there are some relatively weak areas such as
English-language proficiency, postgraduate study and research in
certain fields, the university system in Thailand is not that bad;
but nothing to be cheerful about either.
	   Significant progress has been made in recent years concerning
the quality of instruction and the academic training of lecturers.
Additional effort is needed to bring physical facilities -- such as
laboratories, libraries, classrooms, and computer centres -- up to
international standards and to increase access to university
education.
	   Progress has been made, but there is still a lot of room for
improvement.
	   Representatives from overseas universities report that Thai
students perform very well academically. The greatest weakness is
English-language competence. We need to put greater emphasis on
secondary-school English-language programmes and establish more
university-level international programmes and courses offering
English as the language of instruction. With some effort Thailand
could become a centre for regional education in the near future.
	   Thai universities should serve as leaders in society, providing
advice and moral leadership, in addition to their primary role in
education and research. Universities must reach out to society and
cooperate in promoting democracy and social justice. The goals and
values of the university should be consistent with those of the
nation and Thai society.
	   - You're right in both theory and principle. But many people
feel that universities in Thailand have never carried out that
task. Do you agree? I agree that Thai universities have done very
little to serve Thai society. I think that in a crisis like this,
people want to see what direction the academics think is the best
for our society. We academicians should give this matter serious
thought. We have to realise that thinking is our job. We should
listen to people and synthesize ideas; share our ideas with others
and help create better things for society.
	   I feel that many academics in government-run universities today
are narrow- minded. They think they are the best. They train
students in the same way that they were trained many years before.
They have never listened to or cared about what contemporary
society wants. They never watch what the private universities are
doing. If it were possible I'd really like to organise projects
that would bring lecturers and academics from private and
government-run universities together to discuss what we should and
can do to serve our society.
	   - What can CIE do to help solve Thailand's problems? The CIE is
a semi-private institution, a kind of national project, where
educational institutions join with the private sector and
government in providing programmes and services critical for
national development. By working directly with business and
industry, CIE can develop innovative training courses that will
prepare the Thai workforce to compete on an international level and
get jobs in high-technology industries.
	   - What did you accomplish in your first year as director of CIE?
The first year was primarily a year of planning and programme
design. To provide quality, innovative courses it is important to
carefully evaluate the market and create educational programmes
that will meet the current and future human resource needs of the
nation.
	   The CIE and Thammasat appreciate the seriousness of the current
economic situation and have developed a master plan and related
projects to improve infrastructure and increase the country's
competitiveness; not only to meet immediate needs, but also for
long-term development. The plan is divided into two areas.
	   First, production organisation. To reduce weaknesses in the
research-and-development field and in the transfer of technology,
CIE intends to serve as a technology service provider.
	   Secondly, business and industry. To improve the supply and
quality of personnel, CIE will work as a training service centre to
develop human resource expertise both in technology and in the
management of technology. CIE intends to target the immediate
critical needs of society by providing courses such as technology
management, food science, and hospitality management.

Events in Kosovo unfolding faster than NATO can plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The violence in separatist Kosovo
province has prompted NATO military planners into considering
``more challenging options, which could include intervention,'' a
senior NATO official said Tuesday.
	   Only a few days ago, the generals were focusing on military
exercises and dispatching troops to help neighboring Albania and
Macedonia deal with refugees and patrol borders.
	   In recent days, entire villages in the southern Serbian province
have been flattened and thousands of people driven from their
homes, making the need for action more urgent if the crisis is not
to erupt into a wider Balkan war.
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo since Mar. 1 in
escalating clashes between government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, armed wing of the Albanian independence movement.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the larger of
the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose demands for independence.
	   Earlier, NATO foreign ministers agreed to enhance military
exercises in Albania and Macedonia as a way of increasing the
military presence there. A NATO assessment team is still the region
looking at future options.
	   However, the senior NATO official, speaking anonymously said
that ``with the events of the last week, shoring up the periphery
seems of secondary value.''
	   NATO defense ministers meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday for
discussions certain to be dominated by Kosovo. It is expected they
will order the military to start looking at direct intervention in
Kosovo.
	   The United States and Britain plan to ask the U.N. Security
Council, possibly next week, to approve the use of force against
the Serbs to halt attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Americans were also willing to make a direct appeal to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin if they encounter resistence from the
Russian foreign ministry.
	   The Russians oppose NATO troops in the area but have indicated
that they might support a more robust U.N. role. That would require
approval by the 15-member Security Council, where Russia has a
permanent seat and veto power.
	   Exactly what form such action might take is unclear. Some have
suggested air strikes against Serbian forces, or a no-fly zone. But
military moves that may deter the Serbs may not necessary work
against the insurgents.
	   NATO officials say there are other legal bases for conducting
such an operation, but are vague about exactly what they are.
	   ``If we can't get that resolution, we'll have to find another
legal basis to act, if action is necessary,'' said the senior
official.
	   The 15-nation European Union and the United States have slapped
a ban on all investments in Serbia and frozen Yugoslav assets
abroad, though Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has not
appeared particularly susceptible to sanctions in the past.
	   ``We have learned the Serbs don't respond to pressure unless it
is military pressure,'' said the senior official.

	   ALOR STAR, Sat. - The people must continue to be united and
support the Government to enable it to overcome the economic
downturn, former Deputy Prime Minister Tun Ghafar Baba said today.
	   He said the people must not give up helping the Government to
weather the economic problems.
	   ``My fear is that the people might lose their sense of direction
and allow these economic problems to spread and become a political
problem,''
	   he said when opening the State economic development seminar
organised by the State Umno at Bangunan Tunku.
	   Ghafar said the present situation was vulnerable and could
easily lead to chaos.
	   He said before independence, the Malays had only a two per cent
share of the economy. ``The New Economic Policy changed the fate of
the Malays and increased their holding to 17 per cent.
	   ``That holding has now decreased by between two and five per
cent and we may need another 20 years to bring it back to 17 per
cent,'' he added.
	   Ghafar said he felt obliged to contribute towards the revival of
the economy and had offered his services to the Prime Minister to
explain the economic situation to the people, especially the
low-income group.

	   THE Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) has reduced the
budget for its Y2K Phasell Project from Bt40 million to Bt30
million, according to its deputy governor (business), Kasem
Chaihongsa.
	   The budget will be spent on a new mainframe and upgrading
equipment at its centre on Chidlom Road. In the first phase the
company made an assessment of its inventory and recommended changes
to 40 per cent of its computer tasks including billing and
accounting. Response to the Y2K scare will start in July and the
entire project is expected to be completed in February 1999.
	   ''We guarantee that in January 2000 Bangkok residents will be
able to use electricity as usual, and pay the right bill. The
project will cover all our electronic devices and facilities
including elevators,'' he said.
	   Apart from data tasks, the Y2K problem will not affect other
tasks involved in electricity distribution. Some electricity
sub-stations are controlled manually. The others which are
controlled by computer, called ''Unman Substations'', are said to
be Y2K compliant.
	   He added that the authority had plans to convert more than 100
traditional sub-stations to Unman Substations. However, the idea
has been dropped due to budget cuts.
	   ''This project would have been completed during the Eighth
National Economic and Social Development Plan. However we still
hope to have 30 to 40 sub-stations converted this year,'' he said.
	   Even though the cost of a new substation is high at Bt250
million per station, it will improve the electricity distribution
system.
	   ''If electricity distribution is controlled by computer, there
is less chance of disruption during rain,'' he said.
	   MEA will also implement the Y2K Phasell Project at its internal
hospital. ''Inventory and patients' histories are affected by Y2K
problems, but other medical services will not be affected,'' he
said.
	   MEA's consultant for this project, Pete Galloway, is working
closely with MEA staff and is confident that the project will be on
time.
	   He said several Thai companies don't consider the Y2K scare as a
terrible prospect. However, as a consultant, he hopes that next
year many will be in a panic about the threat of the bug and will
be happy to pay for consulting services.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda hopes to raise 1,600,000,000 francs
(dlrs 5,333,000) for its 1998 budget through divesting, liquidating
or hiring out of state-owned enterprises under a three-year
privatization program, its director said Tuesday.
	   ``From 1998 to 2001, the government expects to have privatized
about 44 public enterprises, sold its shares in six companies and
to have liquidated about five enterprises,'' Director of
Privatization Vianney Shumbusho told the Rwanda News Agency.
	   Among the 44 parastatals to be sold are 25 agrobusinesses,
including nine tea factories and estates and three coffee factories
and estates _ the principal source of Rwandan exports.
	   Through a three-year enhanced structural adjustment facility,
Rwanda is committed to privatizing all state-owned enterprises to
reduce government expenditure and increase revenue through taxation
and sales of parastatals.
	   On May 29, the government earned about 1,003,000,000 francs
(dlrs 3 million) after the cabinet endorsed the sale of two hotels
and two processing factories.

	   SECRET Recipe also serves lunch and dinner. The menu may be
limited but there's a good variety. Just a year ago, when I was
there the first time, there was only sandwiches and pasta. Even so,
I was suitably impressed with their lasagne (RM7.50) and spaghetti
(RM8.50) which was full of meaty sauce with a choice of chicken or
beef). In fact, they have opened two more outlets - at Jaya
Shopping Centre and Amcorp Mall in Petaling Jaya.
	   At Secret Recipe, sandwiches are not made with commercial
loaves. Instead, Nicholas himself bakes saucer-sized buns which can
be filled with corn beef or chicken and egg. For RM5.50, you get a
fresh salad to go with it.
	   The extended menu sounds interesting. Priced at RM8.50, all the
main courses are chicken. ``We only use whole chicken legs which
are deboned and skinned - perfect for today's healthy lifestyle,''
says Nicholas.
	   There's crispy barbecued chicken, grilled chicken kebab, fried
chicken wings, Mexican chicken and their best-seller, black pepper
chicken - done just the way I like it - with a fiery pungent sauce
dark from the specks of black pepper.
	   The sauce for Mexican chicken is also a hot, spicy tomato-based
number with a sliced onions, buttom mushrooms and lethal red
chillies. These are served with a cup of aromatic butter rice and
salad with thousand island dressing.

Despite huge crowd, Becker loses at Gerry Weber Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker, trying to decide if his game
is up to Wimbledon, Tuesday fought off five match points but lost
to Hendrik Dreekmann in three erratic sets at the Gerry Weber Open.
	   Becker, showing his rustiness, was beaten by his fellow German,
the world no. 101, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (11-9) in a first round match at
the dlrs 875,000 Wimbledon grass court tuneup.
	   It was just the sixth tournament this year for Becker, who is
easing into retirement.
	   Many Germans believed it was a last chance to see their star
play, causing a morning run on tickets. Hundreds were turned away
from the 11,400-seat center court.
	   Becker gave away the match with a double fault after two hours
and 18 minutes and was far from the form that made him a former
world No. 1 and three-time Wimbledon champion.
	   But the 30-year-old offered his roaring fans plenty of
entertainment, blowing a 4-0 lead in the final set tie break, then
warding off one match point after another.
	   Becker, now ranked 58th, displayed little of the coolness under
pressure that marked his prime, despite warding off two double
faults with hard serves.
	   He double faulted to set up one match point and babied a sure
overhead winner that cost him a second. Dreekmann also let him
escape several times with easy errors.
	   For Dreekman, once ranked 39th, the win was revenge for being
publicly dismissed by Becker as talented, but unmotivated.
	   ``Becker has said Wimbledon is his bedroom, but this was mine,''
said Dreekman.
	   Becker said earlier he will announce Friday whether he will play
Wimbledon this year, adding it was dependent on how well he fared
at the event.
	   Although five top 10 players are entered in the Wimbledon
tuneup, the day was dominated by the local German players.
	   Australia's Richard Fromberg upset no. 7 seed Nicolas Kiefer,
Germany, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, while Tommy Haas beat Belgium's Filip
Dewulf, 6-3, 6-4.
	   The presence of Becker, perhaps the most idolized German, has so
overwhelmed the event that defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov
was surprised when he was questioned by a reporter.
	   The 1996 French Open champion and world No. 7 had barely
survived a three-set battle Monday with the Ukraine's Andrei
Medvedev.
	   ``Great, someone noticed I'm still in the tournament,''
Kafelnikov said. ``I thought nobody was aware of it.''
	   French Open finalist Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja are scheduled
to play later Tuesday.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Dismissing the proposal as ``nothing new,'' a
Nobel peace laureate on Tuesday rejected Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie's offer of special status for the disputed territory of
East Timor.
	   ``They are rehashing an old position, which requires first that
the United Nations recognize the illegal annexation of East Timor
by Indonesia,'' said Jose Ramos-Horta, a spokesman for
pro-independence forces in the half-island territory.
	   ``Only then might they consider some wishy-washy 'special
status' for East Timor. This is not a serious proposal, and I am
stating unequivocally that we reject it.''
	   Ramos-Horta is co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize and has
close contacts with the underground resistance movement in East
Timor, which Indonesia invaded in 1975 after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration. A year later, then-President
Suharto declared East Timor Indonesia's 27th province _ an act not
recognized by the United Nations.
	   Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation, is often accused
of widespread human rights abuses in predominantly Roman Catholic
East Timor.
	   Ramos-Horta spoke by telephone from Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he was attending a seminar at the
John F. Kennedy School of Government.
	   In East Timor's provincial capital Dili, fellow Nobel
prize-winner Bishop Carlos Belo _ the territory's spiritual leader
_ refused to comment on Habibie's proposal.
	   Habibie, in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.,
offered East Timor an unspecified special status in exchange for
peace with pro-independence forces.
	   Ramos-Horta said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has
argued for years that Indonesia would be prepared to release
certain prisoners and grant some form of ``bogus autonomy'' to East
Timor so long as the United Nations recognizes its control of the
area.
	   ``It is nothing new,'' he said of Habibie's offer.
	   ``The only realistic and honest proposal Indonesia can offer is
that they accept the challenge of an internationally supervised
referendum on the future of the territory,'' said Ramos-Horta, who
resides in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``I am supremely confident that Indonesia can simply not afford
financially, economically and politically to continue the illegal
occupation of East Timor,'' he said.

	   Green Channel tour operator will open a branch office in Sylhet
shortly. This will be the company's third branch office. With its
head office in Chittagong, Green Channel has two other branch
offices in Dhaka and Cox's Bazar.The only deep sea-cruise package
tour operator in Bangladesh, Green Channel operated eleven
sea-cruise package tour programmes last season.Green Channel
operates sea-cruise programmes during October and March when the
sea is calm and quiet. Before every trip to the sea they place
several ads in national dailies so that intending participants can
make advance booking. The charge for a package sea-cruise programme
that lasts for seven to eight hours is Tk 500 per person.
	   The charge is inclusive of breakfast, packet lunch prepared in
the vessel's kitchen and afternoon tea and snacks. It also includes
complimentary soft drinks throughout the sea-cruise programme and
live band show concerts. Besides, Green Channel operates study tour
programmes for college and university students to India, Nepal and
Bhutan by road through Jessore's Benapole border. The charge for
the 14 to 19-day package study tour programme is Tk 8,500 per
person. Domestically Green Channel operates 1 to 5-day package tour
programmes covering all the attractive tourist spots of the
country. The charge for the package tour programme depends on
distance and duration of each of the programmes. At the moment,
Green Channel has four 12-seater micro-buses of which one is
airconditioned.
	   For sea-cruising they hire luxury vessels from the public sector
IWTC (Inland Water Transport Corporation). ``I read a report about
a private inbound package tour operator in weekly Bichitra sometime
in early 1992 and inspired by the tour operator I and my business
associates decided to launch a package tour operating company that
would mostly promote domestic tourism''. said Selim Ahmed, one of
the promoter directors of Green Channel, while talking to this
correspondent at their Chittagong headquarters at the new
Chittagong railway station terminal building on June 3.Accordingly
the company was launched and green channel organised its maiden
sea-cruise voyage on 25 December, 1992.

Hamas: Sheik Yassin to return within days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The founder and spiritual leader of
the radical Islamic group Hamas, will return to Gaza within days, a
spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim
countries raising millions of dollars and drumming up support for
Hamas, will ``most likely'' come back to Gaza on Saturday, Mahmoud
Zahar, a Hamas spokesman, told The Associated Press.
	   Israel's security establishment and political leaders have been
debating for weeks whether Yassin would pose a greater danger
inside or outside of Gaza. Israel, which controls Gaza's borders,
could keep Yassin out if it wished.
	   Israeli leaders appeared Tuesday to be leaning toward allowing
him back, in part because keeping him out could prompt more
violence from backers of Hamas.
	   ``The choice is not between what is good and better, but between
what is bad and worse,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   State-owned Israel TV reported that Israel's internal security
agency, Shin Bet, submitted its recommendation to the government
that Yassin be allowed to returned and coordinated with the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel. Its military wing has killed
more than 100 Israelis in scores of attacks. The group's popularity
in the Palestinian lands, especially Gaza, is seen as a growing
threat to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin's fiery comments on his tour, such as his description of
suicide attacks as ``holy missions,'' have been widely reported in
Israel.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall to buy the
freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt on another Hamas leader.

	   THE old analogy of comparing the eye to a camera is a good way
to explain the process of how we see things. The eye is attached to
muscles which are used to locate and position an image. Then, a
series of lenses bring the image into focus, while a diaphragm
controls the light intensity.
	   The image is then projected onto a screen, which converts the
image by chemical reaction into electrical signals which are sent
by the nerves to the brain for processing.
	   There are six external ocular muscles that move the eye into the
various `positions of gaze'.
	   In a perfect system, both eyes target the desired scene so that
the focused image falls onto the retina at the back of the eyes.
	   An error in the system can indicate a disease affecting the
nerve connections in the eye and the brain. Sometimes, these
defects may indicate a serious pathology, including tumours and
neurological diseases.
	   The mis-positioning of the eyes by the external muscles is
called strabismus. This can occur if: one or more of the external
muscles is too long or too short; one or more of the muscles are
attached to the eyeball at the wrong position; the innervations
(nerve connections) to one or more of the muscles are defective;
the cortical (brain) processing system is sending incorrect signals
to the muscles, causing misalignment there is an uncorrected
hyperopia (farsightedness).
	   Strabismus can result in the wall-eyed or cross-eyed look.
Stereoscopic (3-D) vision is missing or limited, causing the
focusing system to be slow or inappropriate.
	   Limited depth perception also causes incorrect spatial cues and
may result in problems in learning to walk, eye-hand co-ordination
difficulties, general clumsiness and other problems.
	   Surgery and eye muscle exercises can remedy strabismus. The
length and/or position of the eye muscles can be adjusted through
surgery to create proper alignment. If the problem is minor and/or
associated with a poorly developed or incorrectly nervous system
connection, vision training may be used.
	   Focusing: cornea and lens: The optical lenses consist of the
cornea (the clear window at the front of the eyeball) and the
crystalline lens (just inside the eye and behind the iris).
	   The cornea is a rapidly reproducing and repairable transparent
structure with a constant curvature. It is the main focusing
element of the eye.
	   Chemical exposure and burns, deep cuts and some infections can
cause scars on the cornea which can interfere with vision. If you
experience pain, light sensitivity and tearing, immediate medical
attention is crucial.
	   Badly fitted contact lenses can also affect its health and
structure.
	   After the cornea focuses the image, the light passes through the
crystalline lens. This tissue corrects the focal power for viewing
near objects.
	   As we age, this lens becomes less flexible. The ciliary muscle
weakens and the system fails to adequately focus the image. This is
called presbyopia.
	   Treatment for early presbyopia includes exercises to strengthen
the muscle and flexibility of the lens. Reading glasses are also
recommended.
	   Another age-related condition is cataracts, the term for the
loss of light transmission through the lens. They can also be
caused by certain medications (like prolonged use of
cortcosteroids), metabolic disorders such as diabetes, or can
result from trauma to the eye.
	   As the lens becomes less transparent, vision is affected. The
standard treatment is to replace it with a plastic lens implant.
	   Conjunctiva and Lacrimal (tear-producing system): The
conjunctiva is a thin membrane that covers the sclera (the white-
coloured outer shell of the eyeball) and lines the inside of the
eyelids.
	   Inflammation of this tissue is called conjunctivitis. It can
become damaged, callused-appearing (pinguecula, pterigium) or
inflamed from allergy, bacteria, virus or chemical or physical
trauma.
	   Signs include redness, excessive tearing and discharge (mucus or
cell debris and pus from bacteria or virus). Symptoms range from
itching and watering to burning, pain and grittiness. If the
condition persists for more than three days and is accompanied by
fever, pain or blurred vision, medical attention is required.
	   Tears consists of water, oil, mucus and components designed to
disarm invading pathogens like viruses, bacteria and even pollen.
It also provides moisture and lubrication for the cornea,
conjunctiva and sclera.
	   Deficiency of tears cause dryness and tired, heavy lids. If not
treated, the cornea develops dry spots and areas of dying cells,
causing a gritty feeling, pain and blurred vision.
	   Tear drops can be used to relieve the problem but if it
persists, you should seek medical help.
	   Iris and Uvea: The iris is a disk-shaped muscle with a hole (the
pupil) in the centre.
	   It is responsible for adjusting the amount of light entering the
eye.
	   The uvea is the extension of the iris tissue to the lining of
the inside of the eye. The iris is the anterior part of the uveal
tract.
	   Damage to the iris can cause the tissue to swell and/or disrupt
pupil constriction and dilation, causing angle-closure glaucoma.
Treatment requires the use of drugs to force the iris to constrict.
	   Some disorders affecting the iris include inflammatory
non-rheumatoid arthritis conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis,
reiters syndrome, psoriasis and diabetes.
	   Aqueous and Vitreous: The front chamber of the eye, from the
cornea to the lens, is filled with a fluid called aqueous.
	   Over-production or obstruction of the drainage system causes
fluid pressure and can damage the nerves of the retina. This is
called glaucoma.
	   Treatment for glaucoma depends on the causes and may consist of
oral medications, topically applied drugs (eye drops), laser
surgery or combinations of the above.
	   Retina: The retina is the film of the eye and vision system and
transforms light into electrical signals that travel from the optic
nerve to the occipital cortex of the brain where the information is
processed into the sense of sight.

Parliament give extension to Truth Commission to complete work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Parliament on Tuesday gave the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission more time to complete its work,
although the party that ruled during apartheid objected, calling
the commission incompetent.
	   The bill, which passed by 215 votes to 79, will allow the panel
which is probing apartheid-era human rights abuses to submit an
interim report on October 31 this year and enable its amnesty
committee to conduct more than 1,000 outstanding amnesty
application hearings, said Justice Minister Dullah Omar said.
	   Previously, the Truth Commission was to have issued a report in
July. However, the commission has been dealing with a heavy
workload.
	   Once the amnesty committee's work is complete, President Nelson
Mandela will reconvene the Truth Commission so it can complete its
final report.
	   The commission can give amnesty to those who confess fully to
politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.
	   Parliament deputies from the National Party, which ruled during
apartheid until Mandela's African National Congress won the
nation's first all-race elections in 1994, denounced the
legislation, saying Truth Commission officials were inefficient,
arrogant and incompetent.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Rain disrupted the DFS Classic for
the second straight day Tuesday, but Steffi Graf did manage to get
in some practice for her latest comeback.
	   Graf, who has played in only two tournaments since undergoing
knee surgery last year, is looking for as much match play as
possible before Wimbledon.
	   Seeded No. 1 here, the German is scheduled to play either
Australian qualifier Rennae Stubbs or Shi-Ting Wang of Taiwan in a
second-round match Wednesday.
	   Italy's Laura Golarsa, a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon in 1989,
won the first completed match of the grass-court tournament
Tuesday.
	   Her match against Czech Denisa Chladkova was delayed by three
hours, and then again for almost an hour during the second set, but
the rain stopped long enough for Golarsa, ranked 79th in the world,
to win 6-3, 7-5.

	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Monday said India was
committed to a ``path of direct bilateral dialogue'' with Pakistan
and wanted the earliest possible resumption of peace talks.''We
have remained committed to a path of direct bilateral dialogue with
Pakistan...I would again like to reiterate our desire for the
earliest resumption of the official talks with Pakistan,'' Vajpayee
said in a statement to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's
parliament.Vajpayee said ``a secure and prosperous Pakistan is in
India's interest'' and added he had written to Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in this regard.
	   ``And I say to him today, let us put the past behind us, let us
think of the welfare of our children and grandchildren.''Vajpayee
said India was ready for multilateral negotiations on a Fissile
Material Cut-off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
``We cannot, however, be expected to commit ourselves in advance of
these negotiations to unilaterally restrain production of fissile
materials.''Vajpayee said the resolution adopted on June 6 by the
United Nations Security Council on the nuclear tests conducted last
month by India and Pakistan was ``completely unhelpful'' and added
that India maintained the ``strictest controls'' over exports of
nuclear materials and technologies.''However, the call made in the
Resolution that we should stop our nuclear programmes or missile
programmes is unacceptable,'' Vajpayee said.
	   ``Decisions in this regard will be taken by the government on
the basis of our own assessments and national security
requirements, in a reasonable and responsible manner.''

	   IN SPITE of the economic woes, Linksys has established a
representative office in Thailand as its second office in the Asia
Pacific region after Singapore, to sell its networking products.
	   ''Thailand is the greatest potential market among those in Asia
Pacific. Even though it is facing economic turmoil, it will recover
soon,'' Victor Tsao, president and CEO of Linksys, says.
	   He said although China is a huge market, it comes with high
risk. Meanwhile Hong Kong and Taiwan are reaching saturation point.
	   After establishing the Thai representative office, the company
plans to set up offices in Malaysia and Australia. Three branch
offices will report directly to the head office in Singapore. The
head office in Singapore will provide regional sales, marketing,
logistics and technical support to each office.
	   For distribution in Thailand, Surachet Chaikaew, general manager
of Linksys (Thailand) Ltd, said the firm plans to appoint several
distributors in July. One will act as system integrator to focus on
the government market. Another will concentrate on the retail
market while a third will be a value added retailer to cover small
office and home office users as well as small, medium and
enterprise customers.
	   ''We will offer lower prices to customers,'' he insisted.

	   IN the past, an injury to your front teeth was often the result
of fights and probably occurred more often among men. But today,
tooth fractures occur even among toddlers.
	   Often, they are due to falls on hard surfaces. In the process of
learning to walk, they trip and bump into tables, chairs etc. If
they fall face down on hard concrete, chances are their front teeth
gets broken.
	   Studies since the 1970s have shown that tooth injury is on the
increase, ranging from 16 to 40 per cent among five- to
six-year-olds, and about 20 per cent in 12-year-olds. Boys were
twice as prone to tooth injury than girls.
	   Protruding upper front teeth were also found to be at a higher
risk of tooth injury. Most of these were suspected to be due to
falls, fights, domestic violence and child abuse.
	   World wide, the figures seem to imply that in the future, about
every second child will be susceptible to getting an injured tooth
before the age of 12. Local studies also indicate an increase of
tooth injury among teenagers, from two per cent in the 12-year-olds
to six per cent in the 16-year-olds.
	   With the increase in domestic violence and child abuse
incidents, the figures presented may, for all purposes, be an
underestimation.
	   The cost of tooth injury.
	   For many young people, an injured front tooth can pose a
psychological and aesthetic problem.
	   A poor job done on a fractured tooth can affect their self
esteem and confidence. Depending on the nature and extent of the
injury, the age of the child and availability of treatment, the
total cost of immediate and later care of tooth injury can be quite
substantial.
	   Clinically, an injured baby or primary front tooth before the
age of three can have serious implications. In severe cases, it may
cause the loss of the permanent successor located somewhere beneath
the baby teeth.
	   In cases where the tooth is either avulsed or twisted in
position, or came out in toto, dentists will make an effort to
reimplant it. But the success rate of such a procedure in primary
teeth is questionable.
	   Often, to protect damaging the permanent buds, the intruded
tooth is instead extracted. This procedure can be an added trauma
to the child who is already in pain, scared and confused! Before
the age of nine, injuries to the nerves of permanent front teeth
can create complications. Root canal treatment is often difficult
because the root is not fully formed. Complete root formation
usually occurs about three years after the tooth has erupted.
	   Even a slight blow to the tooth can cause nerve degeneration
although it might look normal initially. This can be seen when the
tooth changes colour from yellowish to brownish and black. This is
often accompanied by a tingling, sensitive feeling which can flare
up into persistent pain as the inflammation spreads throughout the
tooth pulp.
	   Prevention is better than cure.
	   Fortunately, the majority of tooth injury can be prevented. Here
are some tips.
	   Make sure you practise home safety to prevent your child from
falling and breaking his front teeth. Do not allow him to jump on
the bed.
	   Supervise his interests in climbing up and down the stairs.
	   Protruded upper front teeth has the highest risk of tooth
fracture when hit. Often, unless genetically influenced, protruded
teeth are associated with detrimental habits like thumb-sucking,
and breathing through the mouth for a long period.
	   Such habits can be controlled if your child felt loved and
secure.
	   Make sure that your child is protected adequately when roller
skating, on skating boards and the like. By wearing safety gears
they are not only protecting their body but also their teeth.
	   Children who play more aggressive games like hockey, rugby,
boxing, martial arts and the like should be encouraged to wear
custom-made mouthguards. Schools should make this compulsory.
	   What do you do when your tooth is injured?
	   After a direct blow or hit - Our teeth are relatively fragile as
compared to other body parts. This is especially true for the four
upper front teeth.
	   Therefore, they may be injured even if they look normal after
being hit because the injury process may be gradual.
	   Many complain of blackened or black-stained teeth several months
and even years after the injury. Others develop a nagging or
excruciating pain around or at the injured teeth long after the
accident has been forgotten.
	   This is because the blood capillaries inside the tooth pulp have
degenerated. These `dead' pulp will then undergo the process of
inflammation at some point in time.
	   Although `dead' pulp can be treated with a root canal procedure,
it is always better to try and save the tooth. Always visit your
dentist immediately after an accident for X-rays and a meticulous
examination.
	   Immediate and appropriate action, which is less costly, can then
be taken.
	   If your tooth fractures - Often your tooth either chips off at
the end or fractures midway after a hit or fall. Visit your dentist
immediately.
	   Your tooth need not be extracted. Instead, your dentist will
have a series of treatment options that will make your teeth look
as good as new.
	   If your tooth is dangling by the root or has dropped out
completely, do not despair. Your dentist can try to reimplant the
tooth. The success of such a procedure, however, depends on the
age, time of injury, your overall oral tissue status, and general
health.
	   Whenever possible, emergency dental treatment should be rendered
at the scene of the accident as soon as possible.
	   If your tooth is severely displaced: Try to reposition it in the
correct position.
	   Hold it in place with your finger, and Rush the child to the
nearest dental clinic as soon as possible.
	   If the tooth is knocked out of the mouth: Ideally, it should be
immediately reimplanted into the socket and proceed as above.
	   If it is dirty, rinse it in water or saline solution. Better
still, immerse it in a cup of milk. DO NOT SCRUB the tooth clean!
Rush the child to the nearest dental clinic.
	   Sometimes it is not possible or practical to reimplant the tooth
back into the socket due to other body injuries. But if the child
can co- operate, ask him to hold the tooth inside the mouth next to
the cheek while he is being transported to the dental clinic.
	   Every school and home should have a First Aid Guideline for
Tooth Injury. The faster you seek dental help, the higher your
chance of saving your tooth/teeth.

Israel says it wants Middle East to remain nuclear-free
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Israeli official expressed concern over
Tehran's efforts to acquire nuclear technology during a visit
Tuesday to Russia, which is building a nuclear power plant in Iran.
	   Eitan Ben Tsur, director general of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry, raised the concerns during a meeting with Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Israel and the United States have also accused Iran of trying to
develop a long-range missile with the help of Russian companies and
scientists. Russia acknowledges overtures were made, but said all
were repelled.
	   Ben Tsur said Russian officials reported on their efforts to
crack down on the export of ``dual-use'' technology that can be
used for both military and civilian purposes, Interfax reported.
	   The news agency also quoted Ben Tsur as saying Israel will not
be the first country in the Middle East to acquire nuclear weapons.
	   Former Israeli Minister Shimon Peres last week edged close to
acknowledging that Israel already is a nuclear power, saying the
country pursued a nuclear option to prevent war.

	   Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has slammed the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council for their double
standards on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), saying the
world body has been sued as an instrument for achieving narrow
strategic objectives of some countries. Describing the NPT as
discriminatory, Sharif, in an interview to Emirates News, said some
nuclear weapon states have sought to justify their retention of
nuclear weapons on the basis of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence,
when none of them is threatened, directly or indirectly, in the
post cold-war era. Sharif's comments came a day after the security
council condemned the nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan last
month asking them to stop testing and sign NPT and CTBT. Sharif,
who is presently in the UAE, also said despite confessing
commitment to non-proliferation, the major powers have failed to
honour these obligations under the NPT.
	   Sharif reiterated his offer for the resumption of dialogue
process with India and said it is upto India...to agree to a
serious, substantive and meaningful dialogue on all outstanding
issues, including Kashmir, in accordance with the UN resolutions.
When asked about the possible agenda for such a dialogue, he said
agenda has already been finalised while referring to an agreement
between India and Pakistan in June last year when eight outstanding
issues had been identified. AFP Adds: Pakistan yesterday rejected
the United Nations call to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), saying the security council approach had been
``unjust and unrealistic.'' It also regretted that the security
council failed to deal ``adequately'' with its dispute with India
over Kashmir which has endangered peace and security in the region.
'The council has ignored the reality on the ground'' a foreign
office spokesman here said, after an overnight UN resolution urged
India and Pakistan to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) as non-nuclear states.
	   'Treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties,'' the
spokesman said in a statement, adding that treaty provisions could
only be assumed only on a ``voluntary basis.'' 'Any attempts at
imposition of treaty obligations is by its very nature unequal and
unsustainable,'' he added. Pakistan exploded six nuclear devices
last month ``to correct (the) strategic imbalance'' triggered by
five underground nuclear tests by its rival India on May 11 and 13.
Pakistan said the explosions were imperative to ensure its security
which had been threatened by the Indian action. The two south Asian
neighbours, who have squared off in three wars since independence
50 years ago, with two of them fought over the festering Kashmir
problem, earlier refused to join the NPT. The foreign office
spokesman also 'regretted'' that the council resolution did not
deal ``adequately and effectively with the urgent and core issues
that have endangered peace and security in South Asia.''

	   ELECTRONIC commerce in Thailand should be built from market
access, unlike in other countries, according to Department of
Business Economics deputy director-general Thawatchai
Sophastienpong.
	   Worldwide, electronic commerce began with finance, consisting of
customs, taxation and electronic payment; law, comprising a uniform
commercial code, privacy and security; and market access, related
to telecommunications, information technology, content and
technical standards.
	   Meanwhile, he said, market access will be the first step for
Thailand, followed by finance and law.
	   ''Several companies now provide shopping through the Internet,
even though not all the processes are done electronically,'' he
said.
	   However, the department plans to establish a trial
electronic-commerce project this October which is expected to
become a complete electronic commerce project.
	   To achieve this goal, it has set up a committee to set standards
for electronic commerce, including registration and communication,
marketing, consumer protection, taxation, transport and insurance,
as well as payment.
	   In the meantime it hopes to have 100,000 Web sites providing
services and products on the Internet.
	   ''This will help boost the electronic-commerce market in
Thailand,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile the National Electronics and Computer Technology
Centre (Nectec) has set up a committee to draft six laws on
electronic commerce and the Internet, covering data protection,
computer crime, electronic data interchange (EDI), digital
signatures, electronic fund transfers and a law to dovetail with
Article 78 of the Telecommunications Act.
	   The drafting will take around 10 months before it is submitted
to the government.
	   These drafts will be based on a model drafted by the United
Nations and on laws in Germany, the United States, Singapore and
Malaysia.
	   ''We expect that these six laws will be completed and effective
within one year. Then Thailand will be the third country in the
Asia Pacific region with an e-commerce law, after Singapore and
Malaysia,'' said Nectec's director, Pirash Thajchayapong.
	   Apart from Nectec, the Justice Ministry and Police Department
are jointly drafting laws on computer- and information-technology
crime, embracing electronic commerce.
	   ''The final electronic-commerce law may come from both sources.
Electronic-commerce law is vital for every country, since we run
business not only domestically but also internationally,'' he said.

Spice Girls share stage with Pavarotti in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MODENA, Italy (AP) _ It was a taste of Pavarotti both spicey and
spiked, with a touch of soul.
	   The tenor of his times arranged a live televised song-fest
Tuesday night directed by Spike Lee and co-starring pop performers
like the Spice Girls, Stevie Wonder and Jon Bon Jovi.
	   The Ginger-less Spice group were giving their first performance
since their split with ``Ginger Spice,'' Geri Halliwell, was
announced.
	   The four and Pavarotti joined forces on the program for the song
``Viva Forever.''
	   Proceeds of the fifth annual ``Pavarotti and Friends'' charity
concert were destined to help poor children in the African nation
of Liberia. The show in this northern city was broadcast live on
Italy's flagship state television channel, RAI-1.
	   As the 62-year-old Pavarotti has been making fewer opera
appearances in recent years, his pop career is on the upswing.
	   Also on the roster were Vanessa Williams, Celine Dion, Natalie
Cole, Trisha Yearwood and Italian stars Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero
and Pino Daniele.
	   At a news conference Monday, Lee was asked whether the group
would be as good without Ms. Halliwell.
	   ``I'm not an expert on the Spice Girls so I don't know if I can
answer that,'' he answered.
	   The other Spice Girls declined to talk about the matter.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - For staff nurse Solhah Mat Sarin, the
posthumous award of Bintang Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa which Yang
di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar conferred on her husband, police
corporal Mohd Nosruddin Che Yeop, brought back sad memories.
	   Talking to reporters after the investiture, she expressed her
gratitude for the award and also her grief that ``the award will
not bring back my husband''.
	   Mohd Nosruddin, 36, was killed during a riot at the Semenyih
immigration detention camp when a group of Indonesian illegal
immigrants resisted deportation on March 26.
	   Solhah, a nurse of Teluk Intan Hospital and mother of three
children aged between 18 months and 10 years, said: ``I am very
thankful to the Government, the police and the Federal Reserve
Unit, Central Brigade, for the help extended to my family and me.''
	   She was the first to accept the award at the investiture on the
occasion of the King's 76th birthday at Balai Rong Seri at Istana
Negara.
	   The citation traced the events leading to Mohd Nosruddin's
death.
	   It stated that Mohd Nosruddin was assigned together with his
colleagues to calm the situation at the camp but they were pelted
with stones by the illegal immigrants who also torched the
buildings.
	   Mohd Nosruddin and others who were in the frontline were
attacked by the rioters with wood, iron pipes, sharpened fencing
posts and knives.
	   He helped his injured colleagues to retreat and faced the
rioters alone only with a cane and a shield. He was stabbed to
death.
	   The citation stated that by rescuing his colleagues and facing
the rioters without considering his own interest and safety, Mohd
Nosruddin made the ultimate sacrifice.
	   Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Zahir Ismail, who headed the
honours list, received the Seri Setia Mahkota Malaysia which
carried the title ``Tun''.
	   Sixteen of the 21 recipients of the Panglima Setia Mahkota,
which carries the title ``Tan Sri'', also received their awards
today.
	   Among them were the King's daugther Tunku Dara Naquiah, Deputy
Inspector-General of Police Datuk Norian Mai, DRB-Hicom Group
chairman Datuk Wira Saleh Sulong and Umno veteran Abdul Aziz Tapa.
	   Thirteen of the recipients of the Panglima Jasa Negara, one of
the recipient of the Panglima Setia di-Raja, five of the recipient
of the Johan Mangku Negara and four of the recipients of the Johan
Setia Mahkota also received their awards.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Ministers and
members of the diplomatic corps also attended the ceremony.

	   Congress President Sonia Gandhi yesterday asked Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee to assure the country that his government is
prepared to uphold the sanctity of the judicial process in She
Ayodhya dispute and stop Gangh Parivar' controlled organisations
from going ahead with the construction of a Ram Temple at the
disputed site. In a letter to Vajpayee, she asked him whether the
whole issue relating to the dispute had to be resolved through the
judicial process which was already under way and was continuing
with the endorsement of the Supreme Court or was it open to any
party to take recourse to actions which had no judicial sanction.
	   Gandhi said the second point was whether the government was
aware that the Vishaw Hindu Parishad or some other organisations
controlled by the Sangh Parivar' were engaged in activities with
the objective of constructing the Ram Temple at Ayodhya even before
the judicial processes already set in motion was concluded. If so
what steps were being contemplated to stop these activities she
queried. The Congress president said 'The country would like to be
reassured that your government is prepared to uphold the sanctity
of the judicial processes and deal firmly with anyone who may
choose to violate the basic tenets that govern the judicial
determination of any issue before a court of law. ``I do hop that
you will take cognisance of this matter which deals with an
extremely serious and sensitive issue having a direct bearing on
the well being of our country .
	   I shall be grateful for an early reply, Gandhi said. In her
letter she referred to media reports about preparations being made
in various part of the country to construct a Ram Temple at the
site where the Babri Masjid structure stood before it was
demolished. Gandhi also recalled the statements made by VHP leaders
that they were ready to go ahead with the building of the temple
within a specified time frame. She said the tragic trail of events
leading to the ``shocking' incident on December 6, 1992, and is
bloody aftermath were still fresh in the memory of the nation. I am
sure you will agree with us that every right thinking citizen in
our country would never like a repetition of these unfortunate
events.'' Gandhi said her party had been raising questions in this
regard in parliament and outside but no satisfactory answer came
from the government.
	   Keeping in mind the recent developments in our country it is
imperative not to allow such divisive issue to come to the fore to
the detriment of the larger national interests she said seeking
government's explanation so that all apprehensions and suspicions
are laid to rest.Meanwhile, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) yesterday
said no temple construction activity was being carried out anywhere
near the disputed site at Ayodhya. In a statement here VHP
secretary general Acharya Artraj Kishore said the Ayodhya temple
construction work could begin only in amicable and congenial'
atmosphere. Ayodhya temple construction work would go ahead only if
the court gives favourable judgement or the government makes
suitable laws, he said hoping for a favourable court verdict in
this regard. Acharya said my statement regarding Ayodhya temple is
being misquoted every time.

	   HEWLETT-PACKARD (Thailand) Ltd is committed to Unix and NT
integration, selling software to run on both platforms, with the
focus on development of software for networks instead of for PCs.
The firm is avoiding competing directly with Microsoft.
	   ''We are committed to endorsing Wolfpack instead of pushing our
Mcserver Guard in order to avoid an overlap in the market.
Microsoft will concentrate on software for offices while we focus
on software management,'' said Kanya Tanphiphat, country manager
professional services organisation.
	   Wolfpack is cluster technology for the Microsoft Windows NT
Server operating system and is based on open specifications and
industry-standard hardware. Openview is the first software that can
run on both platforms. The company also plans to release other
software that runs on two platforms such as Virtual Volt and Smart
Contact.
	   ''These software items are in our lab and they will gradually be
launched in Thai editions,'' she said.
	   The company's managing director, Kim Yu, said integration is a
huge market, and the firm has leasing services. ''The revenue
generated from leasing this year increased 30 per cent over that of
last year. Leasing is usually approved for projects worth
US$100,000 or more,'' he said.
	   Not only does the company offer leasing arrangements to the
private sector, but it also sells assistance to government sectors
as well as state enterprises in terms of training and operational
concepts, as well as consultations on existing computer management.
	   ''The government sector and state enterprises have many older
model computers. We will train their staff to use those computers
instead of purchasing new computers due to budget limits,'' he
said.

	   ASKED by Malaysian journalists in Sydney last week about Pauline
Hanson and the seemingly confident march of her One Nation party,
an Australian businessman replied jokingly: ``Pauline who?''
	   His reluctance to acknowledge her was not without reason.
Pauline Hanson is back in the news and that's bad for business.
	   So is the march of her One Nation party which is gathering great
support, giving Prime Minister John Howard's Government the chills
well ahead of next Saturday's Queensland election.
	   The election will be watched with great interest - and concern -
because of Hanson's controversial pronouncements in 1996 on
Aborigines, Asians and migrants whom she blamed for introducing
crime and diseases into Australia.
	   The remarks, made in her maiden speech as an independent MP, had
been labelled as ``racist, deranged and irresponsible''. Not only
did they divide Australia, they also embarrassed Howard who has
been criticised for not rejecting and repudiating her views earlier
and more forcefully.
	   Speaking to Malaysian journalists who were on a special visit to
Australia last week, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett were quick to dismiss Hanson and her
racist policies ``as a challenge to be defeated by intellectual
debate and the ballot box rather than anything else''.
	   Downer described her as Australia's wildest political maverick
who should not be taken too seriously.
	   ``Every country in the world has political mavericks - people
who are outspoken with unfortunate remarks, people who are bigots,
people who try to live in the 1930s instead of in the 1990s.
	   ``I make no apology for the fact that Australia is no exception.
We don't judge a country on the basis of its wildest maverick.''
	   Kennett was vitriolic in his criticism of ``that woman in
Queensland'' and said the Asian media was giving her the kind of
prominence she did not deserve.
	   ``By giving her the prominence, you have either ignored or
downplayed the views of the vast majority of Australians,
particularly those of us who have close ties with the Asian
community.''
	   Dr Larry Strange, director of the Asia Australia Institute in
Sydney, does not believe that Hanson and One Nation would pose a
major foreign policy problem for Australia in Asia.
	   ``But she is a vivid example of the negative side of Australia.
While we continue to be unconditionally accepted in the region, she
will always be used against us and we can understand why,'' he
said.
	   ``She is ignorant, she is poorly educated, she is poorly
informed, she does not represent Australian society. In any
society, we have, unfortunately, a small number of people who have
extremely conservative and xenophobic, inward-looking views based
on fear, anger and a dislike of difference.''
	   No matter what, Hanson has already caused a lot of damage to
Australia in terms of internal and external perceptions, said
Michael Wesley a research fellow at the Institute.
	   ``In relation to Asia, the perceptions are particularly crucial
to trade,'' he said.
	   The external perception of Australia is that it is a Western
country, with the White Australian policy still rankling in the
minds of many Asians. The internal perception is on the way the
Government presents the country's relationship with its neighbours.
It is also the way the rest of Australian society feels about how
the country is going.
	   ``Hanson is damaging to both perceptions.''
	   The sudden surge in support for Hanson and One Nation,
especially among the poorly educated blue-collar workers, is
already causing tremors among the ranks of Howard's Government.
	   It was just a year ago that Howard confidently predicted that
the One Nation party, which celebrated its first anniversary in
April, would close shop in the next Queensland election. But he is
not so sure now as recent polls have shown it to be making inroads
in Queensland, and nationally.
	   Said Strange: ``The point about Hanson is if you put a hand in
her crazy shopping bag of policies, you'll pull out every bit of
difficulty in the Australian political system.''
	   For instance, Hanson has been riding high on the back of race
and gun control issues. This week, she continued her assault on
Aborigines with a statement that Australia faced the creation of
Aboriginal States and that a proposed UN declaration on indigenous
rights would spell disintegration for Australia.
	   LAST month, Hanson said her One Nation would relax gun laws,
which were put in place after the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania
which left 35 people dead.
	   She has also pledged to scrap the registration of rifles and to
re- instate access to self-loading rifles, shotguns and
military-style rifles for gun club members.
	   ``In her bag, she has managed to capture every fear that this
very insecure, conservative, inward-looking part of Australian
society worries about and this is where the Prime Minister's
response, from our point of view, has been so frustrating.
	   ``For example, she has extremely ill-informed views about the
whole reconciliation issue with our indigenous people.
	   ``These views are nonsense and in the current environment, they
are extremely irresponsible and distressing. She actually plays to
groups of disadvantaged Australians who think that as they are
going through hard times, why should Aboriginal people get any
special treatment?
	   ``She plays well on the issue and then you get the Prime
Minister on a talkback radio programme saying he does not subscribe
to the black armband view of Australian history. Howard should have
looked at the experience of the indigenous people squarely in the
face and decide on what to do policy-wise and symbolically, namely
an apology.
	   ``For example, the report on the stolen children - the
experience of Aboriginal children taken from their parents and
often raised by white families and institutions in Australia ...
it's a very distressing document.
	   ``Many political leaders, NGOs and even the governor-general had
very strong views that this required strong symbolic action by
Australian leaders.
	   ``The Prime Minister is very uncomfortable about that sort of
strong symbolic action, so he's saying, `Yes, it's a legitimate
issue but we must make a very measured response to it'.
	   ``This is a perfectly appropriate political option for him but
when these issues are played on Australian talk-radio, it can
actually perpetuate the negative stereotypes in Hanson's shopping
bag when what was needed was comprehensive political leadership.
Talk about it at every turn and bury the misrepresentation at the
root of her party's policy platform.''
	   Wesley feels that Howard was too dismissive towards Hanson in
Parliament.
	   ``When Hanson stands up to ask a question - remember she has
constituents out there who vote for her - Howard's response is so
personally dismissive that it's almost like saying 'I'm not going
to bother to take your opinion seriously'.
	   ``That is not the right way to deal with the problem. A leader
worth his salt, would actually take what she is saying seriously
and attempt to rebutt it. Howard has not attempted to do so when it
is so rebuttable. The things that she said are so stupid.''
	   The upshot to the Hanson episode is that greater emphasis is now
being placed on multi-culturalism in the respective States, with
Kennett saying it was an ``unwarranted political correctness''.
	   It has been reported that ethnic jokes would soon be outlawed in
Victoria under tough anti-racism policy to be introduced in State
schools this year. At present, jokes are exempted under federal
anti- discrimination laws.
	   The policy will ban the voicing of stereotypical views of people
based on national identity.
	   It also covers children picking on others because of differences
such as skin colour or ethno-religious clothing. Teachers and
students accused of racial discrimination will face disciplinary
action under new grievance procedures.
	   The downside is, Australian business, already feeling the
effects of the Asian economic problem, cannot afford further
setbacks.
	   Tourist arrivals from Asia have dipped by as much as 13 per cent
from Southeast Asia and eight per cent from Northeast Asia in the
three months to December 1997 as opposed to the corresponding
period the previous year.
	   No wonder Pauline Hanson is a name most hope would soon
disappear from the Australian political landscape. The sooner the
better.

Russian star gets Wimbledon wild card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Russian teenager Marat Safin, who
reached the French Open quarterfinals as a qualifier, has been
granted a wild card for Wimbledon.
	   The 18-year-old Safin, who had wins over Andre Agassi and
defending champion Gustavo Kuerten in Paris, was the only
non-British player to receive one of the five wild cards announced
Tuesday.
	   Three more wild cards are available for the men's singles, with
Boris Becker among those who could benefit. Becker, who had
announced his retirement from Grand Slam tennis at last year's
Wimbledon, has said he will decide by Friday whether to enter
Wimbledon again.
	   The other four players given wild cards Tuesday were Britain's
Chris Wilkinson, Andrew Richardson, Mark Petchey and Danny
Sapsford.
	   Five of the eight wild cards for the women's singles were also
awarded, all to Britons _ Samantha Smith, Karen Cross, Lorna
Woodroffe, Julie Pullin and Jo Ward.

World Cup: Dutch captain may miss first game after injuring ankle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch captain Frank de Boer may
miss the Netherlands' first World Cup qualifying match after
injuring his ankle in training, Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said
Tuesday.
	   De Boer, 27, twisted his left ankle Monday. He stood on the
sidelines during Tuesday's practice, his injured ankle bandaged.
	   ``We will see how he reacts today and tomorrow,'' Hiddink said.
``He is receiving treatment.'' No decision will be made until
Friday on whether De Boer can play in the Netherlands' opening
World Cup Group E match Saturday against Belgium in St. Denis.
	   A left-footed defender, De Boer missed the Euro 96 tournament in
England with a similar injury. He hobbled off the field at
Amsterdam's Arena Stadium on Monday after falling during training.
	   Barcelona defender Winston Bogarde is De Boer's most likely
replacement alongside Jaap Stam in the center of the Dutch defense.
	   Another injured Dutch player, Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp,
went through light training Tuesday as he fought to regain fitness
in the wake of a six-week layoff caused by a hamstring injury.
	   Hiddink said the prognosis for Bergkamp was improving. It had
been feared that Bergkamp would miss not only the Belgium match,
but also the Netherlands' second match, against South Korea June 20
in Marseille.
	   ``I don't have a great deal of faith he will be fit (for
Belgium) but before Korea we have another week so I think it should
be OK,'' Hiddink said.

	   THEY were the underdogs or so they thought. Thus it was hardly
surprising that when they were approached to take part in a
cheescake competition, the Sim brothers - Nicholas, Michael and
Desmond - of Secret Recipe weren't terribly enthusiastic. Nicholas
simply sent one of their regular cheesecakes off the shelf to the
New World Hotel where the 12 judges waited in cosy comfort at the
presidential suite.
	   Secret Recipe was not the only entry and the team was pitted
against 15 other pastry chefs from big, five-star hotels in Kuala
Lumpur. Never dreaming that they would win, the team didn't even
hang around to wait.
	   But win the homeboys did. Yes, it was a case of Malaysia Boleh
and the Sims' Marble Marvel cheesecake took back the Best Overall
Cheesecake award in the competition organised by the Vision Kuala
Lumpur magazine.
	   The judges had a task most of us would die for, devoting a whole
morning to the cream of KL cheesecakes. They `judged blind', not
knowing which cake came from where. But when they were through, you
can bet none of the judges could not look at another cheesecake for
a long time to come.
	   For there were cheesecakes and cheesecakes and more cheesecakes
from establishments like the JW Marriot, Regent KL, Cocomo, Cafe
Citron, Concorde, Sunway Resort, Carcosa Seri Negara, New World,
Istana, Ritz- Carlton, Shangri La, Pan Pacific, KL Hilton and of
course, Secret Recipe.
	   Some had outlandish names too, like Garden of Eden, Lemon Tree,
Strawberry Towers, Little Mermaid and even Gotham City. There were
different categories of awards including the Best Dressed
Cheesecake (New World Hotel), the Most Glamorous (The Regent), the
Most Fun (Shangri La), the Most Sociable (Ritz-Carlton `everyone
loved it'), The Cutest (Cafe Citron), The Most Sinful (Pan
Pacific), Most Authentic Appearance (JW Marriot).
	   ``We really, REALLY didn't think we had a chance,'' says a
modest Steven Sim. ``We didn't even know it was going to be such a
big event. Now we feel so proud that we had beaten the big boys,
namely the big chefs backed by big establishments.When the
organisers called to tell us we had won, we were totally surprised.
	   ``Our 1kg cake is one of the smallest entries. Some of the
others weighed well over 5kg,'' he adds. ``The fact that we sent in
such a plain cake just goes to show that the proof is in the
eating.''
	   No fancy fresh fruit or chocolate figures for Secret Recipe. The
cake they sent was exactly what customers ordered would get at nay
of their outlets. In fact, despite its name Marble Marvel, the only
marbling is merely cosmetic, apologetically skimping the surface of
the cake. The mild chocolate lacework only hints at the flavour.
	   Cut into the cake and you'd find a smooth journey till you reach
the pastry base. There is no side crust. Unlike most cheescakes
which use plain biscuit or cake base, Secret Recipe uses its own
special recipe - made with oatmeal.
	   This gives a nutty flavour to the cake and is lovely to chew on
as it offers a totally contrasting texture to the smooth creaminess
of the cheesecake topping.
	   ``Ordinary biscuit bases are not good enough,'' says Nicholas.
``I feel it would be a waste to have a plain base when we use such
high quality cheese. So we created the oatmeal base (which simply
bowled the judges over).''
	   Baked or chilled? ``All our cheesecakes are baked,'' says
Michael. ``The Marble Marvel is one of our best-sellers.''
	   Nicholas frowns. ``Baked is better,'' he says with all
seriousness.
	   ``Chilled cheesecakes aren't as moist and don't keep well, so it
would be difficult to display it for customers to select.''
	   Not that the Sims worry about how long cakes can keep as they
have yet to ponder over cakes leftover from the day before.
	   ``Keeping the quality of our cakes is very important. Our cakes
are freshly baked daily and we use fresh cream.''
	   The most surprising revelation is that none of the Sims have
been trained overseas. Leader of the pack Nicholas is not saying
but would only let on that he had taken his brothers under his
wing, making them learn the hard hands-on way. The three of them
experiment and continually come up with new recipes to keep
customers happy. Not only that, but the Sims like to keep their
recipes close to the family too.
	   How did they feel about the competition cakes which were
decorated with all manner of fruit from strawberries to mango and
blueberries?
	   Steven laughs (a little sardonically) and says he thinks a good
cheesecake does not need dressing up. ``Cheesecakes with fruit like
raisins etc, especially in the cheese filling, are not true
cheesecakes. Somehow, I feel it spoils the taste,'' he says but
he's not telling what goes into the Marble Marvel except that
there's eggs and cream.
	   Besides the Marble Marvel, new cakes include Chocolate Banana,
Chocolate Chip and Cheesy Chocolate. ``Yes,'' says Steven with a
laugh. ``It's obvious Malaysians like chocolate and we use good
quality Suchard chocolate.''

Official: France's motion on genocide not aimed against modern
</HEADLINE>
Turkey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of the French National Assembly said
Tuesday that a motion to recognize the 1915 killings of ethnic
Armenians in Turkey as a genocide was not aimed at modern Turkey.
	   The motion, unanimously passed by the assembly last month,
reflected a wish to show respect to the Armenian people, speaker
Laurent Fabius told a news conference in St. Petersburg.
	   His comments were reported by the Interfax news agency.
	   If also passed by the French Senate, the motion would make
France the first major European country to use the term
``genocide'' to describe the deaths of about 1.5 million Armenians
in Ottoman Turkey between 1915 and 1923.
	   Turkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, insisting they
were the result of a civil war, and strongly criticized the passing
of the motion.
	   Genocide is defined as the systematic killing of, or a program
of action intended to destroy, a whole national or ethnic group.

	   JUST about the lowest of the low in parts of India are those
pariahs who function as undertakers -- laying corpses on top of
funeral pyres, setting them ablaze, and helping them burn.
	   The writers, film-makers, artists and photographers of the
macabre are the same kind of outcasts in the parallel universes of
art and entertainment today.
	   An odd turnabout considering that the blood-line of such morbid
works is the jugular vein in what is the oldest body of
mythological, theatrical and fictional creations on Earth. From
this tradition has sprung Greek tragedy, epics like the Ramayana,
Beowulf , the Bard's Hamlet and Edgar Allen Poe's invention of the
detective story, an early dabbling in science fiction, along with
magical realism and a whole other slew of new authors like Brian
Hodge and Robert Devereaux.
	   So in this monthly column, we will be examining this tradition,
its viral influence, and modern mutations in movies, myths, music
and books.
	   The origins of these stories are shrouded in myth.
	   One of the darkest deities in the world pantheon is the Hindu
goddess of death and destruction, Kali. This black figure's
marrow-freezing appearance (she wears a garland of severed heads or
skulls; her mouth is smeared with blood) is the personification of
death and decay. In fact, her name is derived from a Sanskrit word
for ''time'' which is still used in Thai ( gala ), while galee
denotes something that is particularly odious.
	   In his second ''killer'' novel, Walking Wounded (Dell, 1996),
Robert Devereaux taps into this primal myth of the female as both
nurturer and destroyer (the reason, no doubt, that storms and
hurricanes are still given female names).
	   An energy vortex deep in the womb of Mother Earth, beneath the
home that her friends have built in the Rocky Mountains of
Colorado, has given part-time masseuse Katt a kind of ''magic
touch'' which she can use to cure or bring about the onset of
dormant diseases.
	   The undertow of the novel may be primarily mythical but its
concerns are profoundly contemporary.
	   Even though her 14-year-long marriage to a college professor has
gone flat, Katt comes from an old-fashioned family that does not
believe in divorce. To add fuel to her ire she has discovered that
her husband has been carrying on an affair with a campus colleague
of his.
	   What to do?
	   ''Morality as touted in public was always so black and white,
grey shaded in infinite gradations between them,'' the author
writes. ''She needed her freedom from Marcus or she would die in
spirit. It was that simple.'' What has really reanimated the
moribund corpus of horror is this move away from a
good-against-evil/man-tackles-monster kind of dichotomy, as
evidenced by the books of Devereaux, Kathe Koja ( Kink ) and Poppy
Z Brite ( Exquisite Corpse ).
	   Well, there's that philosophical shift, some inventive prose,
and the injection of a full-bodied sexuality. Gosh, the novels of
Devereaux and Brite are so charged with erotic electricity and
saturated with poetically-wrought sensuality, that they would
probably have made Henry Miller and Anais Nin blush.
	   On a more immediate, gut level, the most frightening bits in
Walking Wounded deal with the omnipotent male violence against
women. In particular, the American author's depiction of the
misogynistic, drill-wielding, serial slayer and his sickening deeds
are very extreme, but so deftly done and relevant they don't seem
gratuitous. Perhaps the novel's most indelible image, however, is
the way that the ex-husband of Marcus' lover branded ''MINE'' on
her back -- shades of what the modern-day troubador Leonard Cohen
called ''man's most ignoble form of real estate.'' Early forms of
drama date back to ancient tribal societies with shamans and
magicians often taking the lead roles. The historical hangover of
such ceremonies, held in praise of various deities, or in order to
ward off their wrath, or bring about a bountiful harvest, can still
be seen every day in Thailand.
	   Down at the Erawan Hotel shrine here in Bangkok traditional
dancers and musicians are paid to perform in honour of the Hindu
god Brahma by grateful supplicants who believe he granted their
wishes. And in parts of Isaan and Laos an ancient fertility rite is
acted out every year at the Bang Fai festival, where wildly
colourful bamboo rockets are launched into the sky so the presiding
deity will bring about a decent deluge for the rice crop.
	   In the West, the Olympic games and early dramas were staged to
honour gods like Zeus and Apollo. The followers of Dionysus, in
particular, were artistic zealots who would get together to drink,
sing songs, and recite folk tales together; until one day in BC 600
when a man named Thespis came out of the crowd to take on the role
of a character. He became the first actor and playwright.
	   The action in the old Greek dramas is frequently horrific. In
what is perhaps the most widely known of all Greek tragedies,
Oedipus Rex , written by Sophocles (BC 496-BC 409), an oracle tells
Laius, the King of Thebes, that the child born to his queen Jocasta
will grow up to kill him and wed his mother. Although the child is
saved and raised by a shepherd, he unwittingly does slay his own
father and then becomes the new ruler of Thebes by solving the
riddle of the Sphinx. In retaliation, the gods bring down a plague
on the city. But what do these vengeful deities really want? For
the murderer to be banished, or, ''the shedding of blood for
blood''.
	   When Oedipus finally begins to realise that he is the actual
slayer being sought, he laments: ''O Zeus. What hast thou willed me
to do?'' And then, near the tragic conclusion of the play, he cuts
out his own eyes and goes into exile.

Indonesia prepared to grant special status to East Timor: report

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said
Tuesday he's ready to grant special status within Indonesia to East
Timor in exchange for peace in the disputed territory.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. Habibie said
he had also signed a decree to release 10 Timorese fighters jailed
by Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975.
	   But Habibie made it clear that imprisoned East Timorese rebel
leader Xanana Gusmao would remain behind bars.
	   East Timorese activists contacted by The Associated Press said
Habibie's gesture is not enough for them to end their long-running
guerrilla war against Indonesian rule.
	   Nevertheless Habibie's comments appear to be a significant
change in policy toward East Timor following the resignation last
month of ex-President Suharto, who steadfastly refused to make any
concessions.
	   It's not clear what form the East Timor's special status might
take, although it is certain to fall short of a self-determination
referendum demanded by separatists.
	   In the interview, Habibie said East Timor would remain an
integrated part of Indonesia and special status would not lead to
political autonomy.
	   ``If you want to discuss it in that direction, there is no way
you can discuss that with me. No, we will not let that happen,'' he
said of autonomy or independence for East Timor.
	   A presidential aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that mainly Muslim Indonesia would grant some form of recognition
to the territory's culture and Roman Catholic religion.
	   Other parts of Indonesia with special status include the capital
Jakarta, the deeply Muslim province of Aceh in north Sumatra Island
and the sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java.
	   Their local governments enjoy a few, most symbolic, privileges
and powers.
	   East Timor leader Jose Ramos-Horta, the co-winner of the 1996
Nobel peace prize, rejected Habibie's offer as ambiguous and
arrogant after 25 years of annexation and human rights abuse.
	   ``They are rehashing an old position, which requires first that
the United Nations recognize the illegal annexation of East Timor
by Indonesia,'' Ramos-Horta said in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
	   ``Only then might they consider some wishy-washy 'special
status' for East Timor. This is not a serious proposal, and I am
stating unequivocally that we reject it.''
	   In Dili, Bishop Carlos Belo, who won the peace prize in
partnership with Ramos-Horta, refused to comment.
	   Ramos-Horta welcomed the planned released of 10 Timorese
prisoners, but added that all should be freed, including Gusmao.
	   Indonesia regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has committed
violent acts in his fight against Indonesian rule. Gusmao is
currently serving a 20-year prison term in Jakarta's Cipinang
Prison.
	   Fernando Araujo, an East Timorese activist and former political
prisoner who is in regular contact with Gusmao, said the withdrawal
of Indonesia troops and the release of Gusmao were basic demands
for any peaceful solution.
	   ``If Habibie won't release Xanana, we will continue fight and
die for the independence of our country all out,'' Araujo said.
	   Indonesian troops, under Suharto's orders, invaded the former
East Timor in 1975 after the Portuguese withdrew, ending about 400
years of colonial rule.
	   In 1976 Suharto declared East Timor the 27th province of
Indonesia _ an act not recognized by the United Nations. The U.N.
has been sponsoring talks between Indonesia and Portugal over the
territory's future, but with little progress.
	   Under Suharto, Indonesia steadfastly refused to consider the
granting any special status or any form of local autonomy to East
Timor.
	   Last week U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to Habibie
asking that Gusmao be released.
	   Earlier on Tuesday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Suharto's departure from politics has provided an opportunity for
Portugal, East Timorese separatists and Indonesia to resolve
conflicts over the disputed territory.
	   ``I think now is a good time to resolve our disagreement under
the auspices of the United Nations secretary general who has taken
the initiative over the years,'' Alatas said.
	   In the past, Alatas has accused Portugal and the East Timorese
separatists, led by Ramos-Horta, of being inflexible.

	   Wisetpong Wongtip finds out what is the latest on offer from two
leading fashion houses.
	   ON Wednesday, The Nation carried a news item headlined ''Crisis
hits fashion-conscious.'' According to the article, a survey of 391
professional women undertaken by the Thai Farmers Bank's research
centre, revealed that 35.2 per cent of the respondents had stopped
buying new dresses as the effects of the recession begin to bite.
	   Fortunately for both local and international fashion houses,
there is still some money around and connoisseuses of the Hermes
and Les Copains lines turned out in force for the showings of the
Spring/Summer '98 collections.
	   In keeping with budget cutbacks, both houses chose to showcase
their latest offerings at their respective retails outlets in The
Emporium shopping complex. Gone, it seems -- at least for the time
being -- are the days when fashion extravaganzas were held at
city's top hotels.
	   Despite the limited space for both guests and photographers
(most of whom good-naturedly positioned themselves around the
narrow catwalks and clicked away from awkward angles), the two
shows were an outstanding success and proved that when it comes to
imported lines, it can pay to spend on clothes and accessories that
will not only stay in style but also add long-lasting glamour to
your wardrobe.
	   Hermes has declared 1998 as the ''year of the tree'' and the
concept behind the look is the wonders of Mother Nature. The
Spring/Summer collection offers ten designs under the themes
''Beyond the Five Seas''; ''Back to the Land''; ''In the Heart of
the Woods''; ''The Floating Market of Lake Lane''; ''The Tree of
Silk''; ''Three Legends''; ''Silken Sun''; ''Railing''; ''Parasols
and Umbrellas''; and ''Paridaiza''.
	   Perhaps wisely given the current economic climate, Hermes chose
to showcase its flagship product -- the scarf -- and offered a
splendid variety of patterns, colours, sizes and styles.
	   The Hermes silk scarf has an interesting history. It was born in
1937, the fruit of a happy marriage between the Paris-based design
house and the silk merchants of Lyon. It comes in several sizes,
but it is always square. The 35 inch (87.5 cm) square is the
classic; the 18 inch (45 cm) square is known as the ''gavroche''
and the 55 inch (137 cm) square is essentially a shawl.
	   Jean-Louis Demas-Hermes, president of the group and creative
director for the scarf collection, personally reviews each scarf
and a new design is created every three weeks. To date, more than
900 designs have hit the market, many of which have never gone out
of print. The most famous are ''Cles' and ''Brides de Gala''.
	   Before the show, guests were treated to a demonstration of how
to use this classic accessory to its maximum potential. It is, as
Hermes has always emphasised, much more than something that is
simply tied round the neck.
	   The square may be worn under a jacket in place of a blouse or as
a sleeveless body wrap that looks great with casual pants. The
trick is knowing how to mix and match the tones and colours of the
separates. Hermes recommends choosing tones and colours that will
match your existing wardrobe of jackets, shirt and pants.
	   Over the years and to meet the demands of overseas markets,
Hermes has moved away from pure silk and introduced a mix of
quality silk and cotton. These are comfortable in any climate --
including humid Bangkok -- and have the added advantage of being
totally wrinkle-free.
	   As this year's theme is nature, the scarves are patterned with
trees, fruits and leaves. The primary colours in the new collection
are yellow, blue, orange, green, cream, and brown.
	   The second segment of the show featured formal wear for
professional women -- numbers that are suitable for both a day in
the office and evening business functions. The formal black and
dark blue dresses which contrasted sharply with the vivid colours
of the small but eclectic line of casual holiday wear.
	   The simplicity of the cuts and the quality of the fabrics are
such that the buyer knows that she will be able to wear the outfits
from this collection next year and into the next century. Hermes
not only makes clothes to last, but it also retains a sense of
classic modernity.
	   The French label has also introduced a new collection of leather
bags under new line name, Herbag. These offer the added advantage
of being easily adaptable to suit any occasion. Designed in two
modular parts, the Herbag can be taken apart and put back together
in a matter of seconds. It may serve as a briefcase or as a
suitcase for a weekend jaunt. What's more, it easy to modify. Just
slip the nickel framework bar to free the straps -- ditto to put it
back together again. For an extra touch of class, add a polished
padlock.
	   Leading Italian contemporary ready-to-wear label, Les Copains,
also captured hearts and wallets with more than 40 designs in its
new Spring &AMP; Summer Collection.
	   The label has long boasted that it understands the varied tastes
and styles of its customers. Like Hermes, the focus is on
dependability and understated glamour -- a balance between form and
substance that transcends mere fashion.
	   The Italian brand's favourite material -- pure cashmere knit --
was very much in evidence in all the lines on show. But no matter
what the design, it's reassuring to note that all outfits share the
same standard of quality and cut.
	   The ''Classic'' lines weds elegance and luxury through
meticulous design, fine tailoring and high-quality fabrics and is
the ideal companion this season for the fashion-conscious female
aged between 25 and 50.
	   ''Couture'' offers perfect choices for a dress-to-impress
occasion, with stunning long and short evening dresses and delicate
see-through knitted trousers. Gold sequin-embroidered shirts add
the glamour.
	   ''Trend'' is suitable for fashion lovers aged from 18 to 50.
From casual wear and knits to formal suits and evening dresses,
these outfits are light and comfortable.
	   Les Copains' lines for the young were even more interesting and
are likely to be a hit with Thai teens who can afford to spend a
bit more on outfits that last.
	   ''Miss Elleci'' is suited to both energetic teenagers and the
young career women. It is best described as chic and lively, with
the fine cut and tailoring evident in both casual and formal suits.
Also available in this line are T-shirts, dresses, jackets and
trousers.
	   For vacationing or just relaxing, Les Copains suggests ''Blue
Eagle'' -- T-shirts, shirts, trousers and other casuals that boast
a sportier look than ''Miss Elleci.'' The jeans, mostly worn with
sleeveless T-shirts and a casual jacket, received a well deserved
round of applause. The look is elegant but sporty, with colours
ranging from grey, beige, blue through brown and black and
exquisite embroidery on collars and pockets.

Pan-African body opposes blockade against Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Heads of state at a pan-African
summit Tuesday rejected a United Nations travel ban on Libya and
asked the United States and Britain to relax an economic blockade
against the North African country.
	   Organization of African Unity spokesman Pascal Gayama said the
29 heads of state at the summit in Burkina Faso's capital had
jointly appealed to the United States and Britain to allow
shipments of humanitarian and religious goods to Libya.
	   The economic blockade was imposed by the two Western powers
after Libya refused to extradite two suspects linked to the 1988
bombing of a Pan-Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The attack
killed 270 people.
	   The OAU further decided to support Ghadafi if he breaks the U.N.
flight ban imposed at the same time. Gayama said Libyan leader
Moammar Ghadafi would be welcome if he flew to Burkina Faso for the
summit's closing ceremonies Wednesday.
	   ``As far as the OAU is concerned, there is no travel ban,''
Gayama said. ``He is welcome.''
	   Speculation has persisted that Ghadafi would attend the summit
for the first time in more than a decade.

American, other ambassadors resist Belarus eviction orders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comments from Belarus foreign
minister. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The foreign minister of Belarus warned
ambassadors Tuesday that unless they vacate a diplomatic complex,
the facility could wind up ``floating in its own sewage.''
	   The U.S. ambassador and others have refused to leave the
compound, which is home to 22 diplomats and their families, saying
the government's eviction orders are a violation of international
law.
	   The Foreign Ministry of the former Soviet republic expressed
regret for the ``inconvenience,'' but insisted the officials must
leave their homes in the 50-year-old Drozdy housing complex on the
outskirts of Minsk to permit urgent repairs.
	   ``There is a danger that Drozdy will float in its own sewage,''
Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said Tuesday on Belarusian state
radio. ``We can't endanger diplomats' lives''
	   The ambassadors say that under international law, their
residences are considered sovereign territory and governments have
no right to enter without permission or insist that diplomats
leave.
	   ``These measures are unacceptable and inadmissible,'' French
Foreign Minister spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said in Paris.
``They are contrary to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
privileges and immunity.''
	   The United States, Russia, France, Germany and Lithuania have
formally protested the planned eviction. France and Lithuania said
they will recall their ambassadors for consultations if Belarus
persists.
	   But Antonovich said the issue is not political, it's practical.
And he suggested that foreign countries are overreacting because
they are biased against Belarus, whose authoritarian president has
been criticized in the West.
	   ``There is a tendency to render political coloring to this on
the part of those who are ready to view all events in Belarus only
from political side,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it is a double
standard.''
	   The dispute began in April when the government served notice
that the ambassadors would have to vacate their homes in the
rambling, wooded housing compound by Wednesday.
	   Belarus says that the complex's water supply is no longer safe
and the sewage system is polluting the environment. The Foreign
Ministry has offered the ambassadors apartments in downtown Minsk
or plots on which to build new residences.
	   But U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard said Monday that envoys
would prefer to make arrangements to remain in the complex during
the repairs. He noted that the government's decision appeared to
have been sudden, and that some embassies had signed new multi-year
leases the month before.
	   The diplomatic compound was built after World War II as dachas
for the Communist Party elite. Since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the spacious homes inside the walled complex have been the
primary residences of ambassadors from 22 countries. Most have been
extensively renovated, with expansive grounds and reception
facilities.
	   After discussing the dispute at a news conference Monday,
Speckhard returned home to find workers and a policeman trying to
weld shut the side gate.

	   SINGAPORE -- The broadcasting industry is in a period of
transition, shifting from analogue systems to digital, said IBM
Global Telecommunications and Media Industries vice president of
broadcasting, cable and sports William Moses.
	   He said that to cope with this change, IBM is offering the
broadcasting industry new digital technologies for production,
distribution and service provision to help them keep pace.
	   IBM has divided digital technologies for broadcasting into three
areas -- content management, content distribution and content
security.
	   Content management uses digital technology to help media and
entertainment executives store and quickly retrieve broadcasting
content in a digital format.
	   An IBM official said that with the IBM digital library and news
archive product, media staff can manage an entire broadcast
archive. With this system, they can quickly store, retrieve, view
and order broadcast content online through a computer system and
can view digital video images remotely, without having to
physically order numerous videotapes. This system will help
increase working efficiency and reduce the time involved in
spooling through videotapes searching for programme content.
	   CBS News now uses this application to manage its broadcast
material. The system helps CBS reduce production and inventory
management costs by increasing the efficiency of its archive
storage and retrieval system.
	   Moses said content distribution is another area which has been
transformed by digital technology. The Warner Brothers network
recently adopted a content distribution system to help expand its
coverage to smaller television sites. With this application,
broadcasters have a digital server to receive video content from a
variety of sources, store it digitally, rearrange the content and
provide multi-stream analogue and digital playback. The official
said the system allows Warner Brothers to manage, distribute and
insert local content and advertisements digitally for its cable
affiliates in more than 100 markets. The system also integrates the
entire broadcast process of sales, traffic, digital encoding,
content storage, data transmission, local insertion, account
reconciliation and billing.
	   Moses added that while the broadcasting industry is going
digital, copyright of their broadcasts is another big issue.
Recently, IBM's research lab in Tokyo succeeded in developing a new
video copy protection technology called Data Hiding. With Data
Hiding, copyright owners can protect their material against
unauthorised copying. The system is designed with special codes
embedded directly in a digital motion picture before distribution
occurs, just like the watermark embedded in a banknote. The special
code allows a digital receiving device to determine whether the
content is authorised for playback or copying. If not, it disables
the device from playing back, copying or both.
	   The official said when someone attempts to make a copy, special
circuits in video recording devices detect the codes to find out
whether the action is permitted by the copyright owners. If not,
the process is stopped. If an unauthorised copy is made, the
circuitry in DVD players detect the original code and prevents
playback.
	   Digital technology is taking the broadcasting industry to the
next level, Moses said. It will help broadcasting production become
more flexible and effective while providing more interesting
interactive services.
	   Broadcasters can create new broadcasting services and deliver
them interactively and digitally. Many new entertainment services
such as interactive television, pay TV, video-on-demand,
information services and home shopping could be provided through
the familiar television set, allowing people to choose programmes
or services whenever they want.

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ An explosion, possibly from a gas leak,
shattered a shelter for homeless people in Montreal on Tuesday,
injuring about 30 people as they were about to eat lunch.
	   One person was in critical condition and five others were in
serious condition, police said. Two staff members _ a nun and a
volunteer cook _ were reported missing.
	   The explosion sheared off one entire wall of the three-story
stone building, spilling rubble into the street in historic Old
Montreal. Firefighters were searching through the debris, unsure if
anyone was trapped underneath.
	   Witnesses said there was a strong smell of gas before the
explosion, which occurred about 12:15 p.m. (1615 GMT).
	   No one lived in the shelter _ it was used to provide meals and
shelter for homeless people during the day.

Becker loses at Gerry Weber Open; won't play Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES, RECASTS thruout with Becker saying he won't play
Wimbledon, ADDS Byline.
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker Tuesday was beaten by fellow
German Hendrik Dreekmann in three erratic sets at the Gerry Weber
Open, then announced he won't play Wimbledon.
	   Becker fought off five match points, but handed the world No.
101 the first-round match on a double fault, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (11-9)
at the dlrs 875,000 grass court event.
	   ``A Wimbledon start would have made sense with a good
performance in Halle, but not with a first-round loss,'' said
Becker.
	   ``This way, the pressure of Wimbledon would be too much for
me,'' added Becker, a three-time champion of the grand slam event.
	   Becker, who is easing into retirement and has played just six
tournaments this year, had changed his mind several times after
announcing last year that his 14th Wimbledon was his last.
	   Many Germans believed it was a last chance to see their star
play, causing a morning run on tickets for his match. Hundreds were
turned away from the 11,400-seat center court.
	   Becker gave away the match with a double fault after two hours
and 18 minutes and was far from the form that made him a former
world No. 1 and a Wimbledon finalist seven times.
	   But the 30-year-old offered his fans, who cheered his every
move, plenty of entertainment. He blew a 4-0 lead in the final set
tie break, then warded off one match point after another.
	   Becker, now ranked 58th, displayed little of the coolness under
pressure that marked his prime, despite warding off two double
faults with powerful serves.
	   A double fault led to one match point, babying a sure overhead
winner cost Becker a second. Dreekmann also let several final
points slip away behind easy errors.
	   For Dreekman, once ranked 39th, the win was revenge for being
publicly dismissed by Becker as talented, but unmotivated.
	   ``Becker has said Wimbledon is his bedroom, but this was mine,''
said Dreekman.
	   Although five top 10 players are entered in the Wimbledon
tuneup, the day was dominated by the local German players.
	   Australia's Richard Fromberg upset no. 7 seed Nicolas Kiefer,
Germany, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, while Tommy Haas beat Belgium's Filip
Dewulf, 6-3, 6-4.
	   The presence of Becker, perhaps the most idolized German, has so
overwhelmed the event that defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov
was surprised when he was questioned by a reporter.
	   The 1996 French Open champion and world No. 7 had barely
survived a three-set battle Monday with the Ukraine's Andrei
Medvedev.
	   ``Great, someone noticed I'm still in the tournament,''
Kafelnikov said. ``I thought nobody was aware of it.''
	   French Open finalist Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja are scheduled
to play later Tuesday.

Pan-African body opposes blockade against Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Heads of state at a pan-African
summit Tuesday rejected a United Nations travel ban on Libya and
asked the United States and Britain to relax an economic blockade
against the North African country.
	   Organization of African Unity spokesman Pascal Gayama said the
29 heads of state at the summit in Burkina Faso's capital jointly
appealed to the United States and Britain to allow shipments of
humanitarian and religious goods to Libya.
	   The economic blockade was imposed after Libya refused to
extradite two suspects linked to the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am
Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The OAU further decided to support Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi
if he broke the U.N. flight ban imposed at the same time. Gayama
said Ghadafi would be welcome if he flew to Burkina Faso for the
summit's closing ceremonies Wednesday.
	   Speculation has persisted that Ghadafi would attend the summit
for the first time in more than a decade.

	   AS a way of supporting the export sector, the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) said it had approved a long-term
loan of YEN 187.5 million, or about Bt60 million, to President Agri
Trading Co Ltd to set up a new factory.
	   The IFCT said the loan was sourced from the Export-Import Bank
of Japan and consists of funds which the IFCT has secured and
allocated to domestic industries in order to alleviate liquidity
tightness and assist in project expansion.
	   The business of President Agri emphasises quality selection in
rice sales for both domestic and overseas markets in a
joint-venture with the Chansakulporn family and President Rice
Products Plc.
	   President Agri's business consists of rice milling and sales
while President Rice Products manufactures instant food under the
''Mama'' brand name. The registered capital of President Agri
totals Bt120 million, of which paid-up capital amounts to Bt52.5
million.
	   The company's operational performance in 1997 resulted in income
of Bt1.5 billion and net profit of Bt25 million.
	   New identity for Asia Securities ASIA Securities Trading Plc
(AST) has changed its name to ABN AMRO Asia Securities Plc.
	   But the company's stock code listing on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand remains unchanged as AST.
	   In August 1997, ABN AMRO Asia Holdings Ltd acquired a 35.5-per
cent stake in AST through a public tender offer. In March of this
year, ABN AMRO Asia Investment Research Ltd closed its Thailand
representative office and transferred its staff to AST. According
to George Morgan, managing director of ABN AMRO Asia Securities
Plc, the name change represents the culmination of ABN AMRO's
strategy to integrate its Thai equities business with AST. It also
signifies ABN AMRO's strong commitment to its investment in AST and
a determination to support and develop AST's business.
	   TFAM enjoys successful sale of open-ended fund ONGOING economic
problems have not prevented Thai Farmers Asset Management Co (TFAM)
from enjoying a successful sale of its latest open-ended fund
called Ruang Kao Thanarat I.
	   TFAM said in a statement that the fund, worth Bt1 billion, had
been fully subscribed by May 25 to May 29. The fund marked the
highest sale of unit trusts which invest mainly in government
bonds.
	   The company's deputy managing director Poonpipat Angyureekul
said the fund was very attractive to the public because its planned
investment was well-suited given the current economic situation.
	   Managing director Dayana Bunnag noted that investment risks for
government or state enterprise bonds were relatively low because
they are fully guaranteed, both in principal and interest rates, by
the Finance Ministry.
	   GSB to 'bank for society' THE Government Savings Bank (GSB) has
announced a plan to launch a new project called ''Banking for
Society''.
	   A statement from the bank said the project aims to teach
participants the basics of how banks can help a community, as well
as the responsibility that banks have in society.
	   They will be given on-the-job training to design a project for
the bank. The training project will take 35 days and start on July
13.
	   GSB said applicants have to be under 35 years of age and should
have a bachelors degree with a grade point average of up to 2.5.
Good health and an interest in rural living standards are also
needed. Applications have to be submitted to the bank by Wednesday.
	   Finance Ministry to sell Esso stake by Sept 22 THE Finance
Ministry is expected to finish the sale of its 12.5-per-cent stake
in Esso (Thailand) Plc by Sept 22, according to a ministry source.
	   Krungthai Thanakij Plc, J F Thanakom Finance and Securities Co,
National Finance and Securities Plc and Nava Finance and Securities
Co have been appointed as the ministry's advisers for the planned
Esso share sales.
	   The four financial advisers will appoint four companies to
appraise the value of Esso shares for proposing to Esso's parent
firm Exxon Corp.
	   BOT appoints Ratanakorn THE Bank of Thailand Monday appointed
Ratanakorn Nimwattana, a senior attorney from the office of the
Thai Attorney General, assistant governor responsible for filing
charges against violators of laws governing financial institutions
and monetary policy.
	   Ratanakorn becomes the first central-bank outsider to hold the
rank of assistant governor in eight years. The appointment is part
of a broad reorganisation of the bank's hierarchy undertaken by BOT
governor M R Chatu Mongol Sonakul.
	   Top positions at the Bank of Thailand have generally gone to
officials spending entire careers at the central bank.
	   Meanwhile the Thai Bankers' Association officials will meet a
delegation of the Foreign Bankers Association on tomorrow to
discuss regulations on debt restructuring.
	   It's an ill wind ...
	   FIRST-QUARTER sales of medicine for relief from hyperacidity
have increased by 20 per cent because of the economic recession and
unemployment, according to phamarceutical firm Hoechst Marion
Roussel.
	   Many Thai people have obviously been hit by the economic
malaise, helping to boost the demand for the medicine, according to
the firm's marketing manager, Sakol Damrong Palasit.
	   He said the market was worth about Bt400 million per year with
annual growth of five per cent but sales in the first quarter had
risen 20 per cent from the same period last year.
	   S'pore delegation on its way THE Singapore Confederation of
Industries will lead a business mission to negotiate trades and
study opportunities in joint investment and trade cooperations with
Thai businessmen from June 21 to 24.
	   According to a statement from Thailand's Board of Investment,
the Singapore delegation will comprise executives from more than 20
trade and investment companies as well as financial institutions
that are looking to expand their production bases in Thailand.
	   The Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand will host a meeting
between the Singapore delegates and Thai businessmen at the Laem
Chabang Industrial Estate on June 23.
	   Three state firms face closure A COMMITTEE on state-enterprise
policy, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, has
reaffirmed that three old state enterprises will be shut down, the
Government Cold Storage Organisation, the Preserved Food
Organisation and the Textile Organisation.
	   Meanwhile the Glass Organisation and the Battery Organisation
are to be reorganised as joint ventures with the private sector.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Hours after emerging as the latest in a
long line of army rulers in Nigeria, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was
confronted with calls from at home and abroad Tuesday for democracy
to replace military autocracy.
	   Abubakar replaced Gen. Sani Abacha, whose five-year military
dictatorship came to an end Monday when he died of a heart attack
at 54.
	   Many hope Abubakar will honor a long-promised but habitually
ignored pledge to return Nigeria to an elected civilian government.
	   Air Vice Marshal Mohammed Alfa, a senior military junta aide,
told reporters that Abubakar would honor plans to hand over power
to a civilian government by Oct. 1.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' exiled
Nigerian playwright and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka said in
Jerusalem. ``So it's up to the military to recognize this.''
	   Abacha seized power in a 1993 coup and went on to become one of
Nigeria's harshest dictators. About 7,000 government critics and
dissidents have been locked up during his rule.
	   He was unmoved by international appeals, the threat of sanctions
and condemnation for his internal security policies, which human
rights groups say included torture and killings.
	   His successor is a 55-year-old career soldier who trained in the
United States early in his career and in 1981 served with Nigerian
troops assigned to a U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon. Abacha
appointed him chief of defense staff in 1993.
	   One after another, members of the international community
acknowledged Abacha's death, but more poignantly called it an
opportunity for democracy for Nigeria.
	   In the United States, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
the Clinton administration was interested in Abubakar surrendering
power to democratic rule.
	   ``Our hope, among others, would be, at this moment of
transition, that an accountable civilian government ... will emerge
from what has been a very horrific episode,'' McCurry said.
	   Overshadowing condolences for Abacha, similar calls for
democracy in Nigeria came from France, Britain and members of the
British Commonwealth of nations.
	   Abubakar, meanwhile, faced the daunting task of rebuilding a
country eroded by years of corruption and economic mismanagement.
	   Up to 80 percent of the population lives in poverty, government
figures indicate.
	   From the sprawling commercial hub of Lagos to countless
countryside shanties, most Nigerians live without clean water,
reliable electricity or even basic health care.
	   The world's sixth-largest oil exporter, Nigeria can't even fill
its own gas tanks. Corruption and bureaucracy have put the
country's refineries out of business.
	   ``Do you see people crying in the streets?'' said government
clerk Musiniu Bakare after Abacha's death. ``People are rejoicing
now that he is gone, this man who ruined the economy.''
	   At home, leaders of various groups in Nigeria's pro-democracy
movement _ the political opposition, civil rights activists,
journalists and clergy _ were meeting Tuesday in hope of forging a
unified coalition to give strength to their demands for democracy.
	   Few were willing to speak on the record about their discussions,
saying they first wanted to hear from Abubakar, a career soldier
and close ally of Abacha.
	   But Edetaen Ojo, who runs the watchdog group Media Rights
Agenda, said he had few hopes for the new government.
	   ``I really don't think we're going to have much of a change,''
he said. ``He must have maneuvered himself in some way to get into
that position, so he must also want a taste of power.''
	   But like the world leaders who called for the transition to go
forward, Ojo said the sudden change was an opportunity that should
not be wasted.
	   ``This is a crucial moment,'' he said.
	   He also called for the release of jailed politician Moshood
Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections.
	   But opposition leaders and diplomats say they doubt the
transition can proceed as scheduled: with Aug. 1 presidential
elections and an Oct. 1 handover to civilian rule.
	   Most obviously, there aren't even any presidential candidates
left. Abacha, who never committed to running, was the only legal
candidate _ nominated by all five state-approved parties.
	   Amid many unknowns in post-Abacha Nigeria, one thing is clear:
Opponents are glad Abacha is gone.
	   ``Thank God that he's gone,'' said radical Lagos lawyer Gani
Fawehinmi.

	   JOHOR BARU, Sun. - The Grand BlueWave Hotel is confident of
weathering the economice storm better than others in the industry,
because it is different.
	   Partly owned by the Japan Asean Investment Company of Japan, it
is an all-suite hotel, reputedly the first in the country, targeted
mainly at long-staying guests.
	   At present, Japanese businessmen who stay for more than a year
have taken up about 20 suites, said general manager Fumio Okazaki.
	   The RM90 million hotel opened last year, has 184 apartment-like
guestrooms equipped with kitchenettes.
	   Okazaki said the hotel, which had about 60 per cent occupancy,
anticipated a slight drop this year, but it would be manageable.
	   Besides its all-suite concept which made the hotel relatively
easier to manage, Okazaki said steps had also been taken to reduce
costs.
	   ``For example, we have stopped importing food and have turned to
local supplies.''
	   In addition, the hotel's proximity to Singapore should help
cushion the effects of the slowdown.
	   ``Johor Baru is different from other parts of the country such
as Kuala Lumpur. We have the `Singapore factor' helping our food
and retail business.
	   ``Our restaurant business is doing all right. For example, we
were fully booked during the last Valentine Day,'' Okazaki said.
	   ``Overall, I am a bit optimistic that we will be able to
maintain and survive. Although we do not know if the worst is
here.''
	   Grand BlueWave is managed by Orix Hotels International
headquartered in Hong Kong and owned by Skyline Tower Sdn Bhd,
which is 50 per cent owned by Vikay Development Sdn Bhd. The other
shareholders are the JAIC and a local company.

Siberian teachers take official hostage to demand back wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Teachers in Siberia are holding a local
administration chief in his office to demand months of unpaid
wages, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Teachers from the Maiminsk region said they would not allow the
administration chief, Pyotr Burlakov, to leave until their wages
and child subsidies are paid, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   It said the teachers have barricaded the office for two days.
	   Earlier this year, workers from a Siberian coal mine held the
mine's director and other officials hostage for several days to
demand years of unpaid wages.
	   Neither protest involved violence. During the miners' protest,
several supposed hostages stayed with the workers voluntarily, even
after they were told they were free to leave.

	   REPUTATION AT STAKE ... Way back in 1993 Malacca town was known
as the cleanest town in Malaysia.
	   Such a recognition from the Housing and Local Government
Ministry will not last long if this picture is anything to go by.
	   Residents of Taman Ayer Molek do not seem to appreciate efforts
by the Malacca Municipal Council to maintain cleanliness within the
town area.
	   Although a large rubbish bin is available, it is left empty. The
residents prefer to throw rubbish at an undesignated spot next to
the bin.
	   A warning sign at the spot goes unheeded.
	   The residents' attitude seems to be at odds with the council's
slogan ``Malacca Boleh dan Bersih Indah''.
	   If such an attitude prevails, the town's image will go down the
drain.

Two hang gliders killed during world cup competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Two hang gliders were killed Tuesday
during the Hang Gliding World Cup taking place on Mount Kithairona,
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of Athens, the Greek
National Air Club said.
	   According to initial information, Michalis Theoharis, 52, and
Alexis Patarias, 25, had been flying for about three hours when
they accidentally entered a storm, said Christos Athanassopoulos,
the air club's spokesman.
	   The two Greeks apparently lost consciousness from the intense
cold in the sudden storm and crashed in the mountainous region.
Other athletes who also entered the storm managed to escape
unharmed, the spokesman added.
	   Weather conditions were good at the beginning of the day, the
air club said in an announcement, adding that it had asked experts
to investigate the exact causes of the accident.
	   Competitions were interrupted for the day. But the week-long
meet, which began Sunday with 103 athletes from 12 countries, will
continue to end as scheduled on June 14, Athanassopoulos said.

Qatari court acquits two convicted of spying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ An appeals court Tuesday overturned the
conviction of two Qataris for spying and reduced the sentence of
another from 10 years in prison to three years.
	   The three-judge court acquitted Khamis Muftah al-Najrani, a
42-year-old army colonel who had been convicted and jailed for 10
years by another court in February for disclosing military secrets.
	   Also acquitted was Mohammed Majid Aman Eid, an army colonel who
was given a one-year prison term in February for failing to report
the crime and failure to prevent it. He never served jail time,
though, because he had already spent more than a year in custody.
	   The court reduced the prison term of Aman Majid Aman Eid, a
relative of Mohammed, from 10 years to three years.
	   The three men were part of a group of seven Qataris accused of
collecting and selling information to alleged plotters of a failed
coup in 1996. The other four were acquitted in February.
	   The emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, ousted his father,
Sheik Khalifa, in a bloodless coup in 1995. The government has
suggested Sheik Khalifa, 65, was behind the coup attempt.

Italy awards third mobile phone license to consortium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The government on Tuesday awarded Italy's third
mobile phone license to the state electric utility and French and
German phone companies.
	   The consortium of ENEL, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom,
called Wind, beat out two other groups, led by British Telecom and
Bell Canada International, in the hugely lucrative cell phone
market.
	   Europe's largest market for mobiles is Italy, where there are
some 13.5 million mobile phone users. Some analysts say that market
will be worth about 18 trillion lire (dlrs 10.32 billion) by the
end of next year, and that the third operator can expect to hold
some 2 percent of it by then.
	   Recently privatized Telecom Italia has around 75 percent of the
Italian cell phone market, while Omnitel, controlled by Olivetti
SpA and Germany's Mannesmann AG, has the rest.
	   Wind is 51 percent owned by ENEL, although that stake will come
down when other Italian investors are brought in. Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom split the other 49 percent.
	   Before the license was awarded, telecommunications minister
Antonio Maccanico told reporters that increased competition would
lead to lower prices and better service.
	   He declined to say whether there would be a fourth license
awarded before the end of the year, as some in the industry have
demanded. The government has only pledged to look into awarding a
fourth license.

	   MALACCA, Sun. - Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Wira Mohd Ali
Rustam said today all systems at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Subang were in place for full commercial operations end
of this month.
	   ``There should be no technical hitches as everything is in
order. There are of course some minor hiccups but on the whole, the
airport is ready.
	   ``We do not anticipate any major problem for this
state-of-the-art airport to go into full-scale commercial
operations,'' Mohd Ali said when met today.
	   He said weaknesses, if any, would be overcome before the
Commonwealth Games in September.
	   ``We have about two months to identify weaknesses before the
start of this world-class event. This should give us ample time to
address the problems.''
	   Mohd Ali said the ongoing trials had also enabled the airport
management to gauge its operations performance and overcome
weaknesses.
	   The first flight trial at the airport was conducted last month
when 340 pilgrims on flight KT35 arrived at 2.25pm.
	   The airport was originally scheduled to begin operation in early
June but this was deferred due to several reasons, including the
recent forest fires near the airport.
	   The Transport Ministry has formed a special committee,
comprising KL International Airport Bhd Malaysia Airports Bhd,
Department of Civil Aviation and the ministry's top officials to
organise the ceremonial opening by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on
June 27.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad is expected to
deliver the keynote address at the ceremony.
	   Mohd Ali said 100 personnel would man KLIA's control tower.
	   Of this number, 76 are experienced staff and the rest new
recruits.
	   He said 40 control tower personnel underwent a two-week training
at Munich Airport, Germany, recently.

Mowlam seeks police hunt for `sneaky' leaker of government secrets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam on Tuesday asked detectives to try to identify
the government aides responsible for leaking sensitive, restricted
documents about peacemaking efforts.
	   ``Leaks are bad for government. It's damaging. We will make
every effort we can to find out who is responsible,'' said Mowlam,
who has had several confidential documents revealed since she
became Northern Ireland's governor in mid-1997.
	   The latest document, passed on Monday to Protestant lawmaker
Jeffrey Donaldson and the British Broadcasting Corp., detailed
conversations Mowlam had with Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews
and the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party about this month's formation of
commission to reform Northern Ireland's police force.
	   Andrews, who had privately complained to Mowlam about her
appointments to the commission, said she was being victimized by
civil servants opposed to the general direction of the Northern
Ireland peace process.
	   ``Sneaky little people in the Northern Ireland Office are not
going to obstruct us in the pursuit of what we all seek to achieve,
a permanent peace on the island of Ireland,'' Andrews said.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams called for British authorities to
identify the leakers and fire them.
	   ``Those who have leaked those documents are surely in breach of
their vocation, and need to be dealt with and need to be given
their notice,'' Adams said.
	   Also Tuesday, Ulster Unionist chief David Trimble, leader of
Northern Ireland's biggest pro-British Protestant party, launched
his campaign for seats in the province's new legislative Assembly,
the cornerstone of the Belfast peace agreement.
	   The April 10 agreement among eight parties, ratified by voters
in both parts of Ireland on May 22, specified a June 25 election
for the 108-seat Assembly. Its members are supposed to select a
multi-party administration, with Trimble as its most likely head.
	   Trimble urged Protestant voters to back him rather than
hard-liners opposed to the compromise package, which would include
Sinn Fein in the new government and give early paroles to Irish
Republican Army prisoners.
	   ``We must take the opportunity to move into a new era,'' Trimble
said at Belfast's glass-fronted Waterfront concert hall.
	   ``It is absolutely crucial that we elect members dedicated to
progress, not ones who will sit on the sidelines complaining about
everything,'' he said, referring to supporters of the Rev. Ian
Paisley, Trimble's most stubborn competitor for Protestant votes.

	   DUBBED the Queen of Vegetables, the white asparagus is being
promoted at the California Grill Restaurant, JW Marriott Kuala
Lumpur.
	   The white asparagus, a delicacy that is highly sought after by
the world's discerning gourmets, is the pride of the Dutch province
of Limburg.
	   In conjuction with the promotion, which will be held till June
26, Dutch master chef Herman Van Ham, who has a vast experience in
preparing and promoting this speciality, also demonstrated his
spectacular creations.
	   Van Ham, who has spent 32 years at the De Hamert, has been
awarded the prestigious Michellin star for 27 consecutive years.
	   He created and introduced the white asparagus cocktail Prince
William Alexander using with chicken meat, orange and light curry
cream.
	   This creation has gained popularity and it is said that most
Dutch would have the cocktail served when they order meals.
	   According to Van Ham, asparagus is prepared the old fashioned
way and should be accompanied by melted butter, hard boiled eggs
and a flaky potato.
	   It can also be served with goose liver sauce with truffles in
salad with crab, shrimp or smoked salmon.
	   Van Ham said the edible part of the vegetable was the sprout
that grew out of the rootstock.
	   ``The sprouts grow in banked sandbeds to keep out the sunlight
so that the asparagus can stay nice and white. It prefers sandy
woodland soil and requires care,'' he explained.
	   ``The seeds alone are costly and no harvest is made until the
third year of cultivation.''

Ukraine plans to initiate creation of oil industry consortium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine wants to form an international
consortium to complete a pipeline and Black Sea oil terminal, and
to modernize four refining plants, a top oil industry official said
Tuesday.
	   Such a consortium is necessary if Ukraine is to take part in
transporting Caspian Sea or Iranian oil to Europe, said Valery
Shuliko, deputy head of the State Gas and Oil Industry Committee.
	   Shuliko said several international companies have expressed
interest in joining such a consortium. A plan might be approved by
Cabinet later in the week, and details worked out by the end of the
year, he said.
	   Shuliko said the government should keep 51 percent of shares in
any consortium, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Ukraine, along with Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran, is eager
to transport Caspian Sea oil from huge Azerbaijani deposits to the
West.
	   Azerbaijan late last month formally invited Ukraine, along with
Russia, Turkey and Georgia, to join negotiations to establish the
export route.
	   Ukraine has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers to
the Black Sea port of Odessa, and from there via a pipeline to the
western Ukrainian town of Brody for export onward.
	   However, Azerbaijan has repeatedly indicated it favors a Turkish
proposal.
	   According to Shuliko, Ukraine has completed 256 kilometers (159
miles) of the 670-kilometer (415-mile) pipeline to Brody, which
would eventually be capable of carrying 30 million tons (201
million barrels) of oil a year.
	   The Yuzhny oil terminal, with a planned capacity of about 40
million tons (268 million barrels) a year, is about 15 percent
ready, he said.
	   Shuliko said Ukraine would need dlrs 600 million to dlrs 800
million to complete the Odessa-Brody pipeline and the Yuzhny oil
terminal. About dlrs 400 million of that is needed to modernize
four refineries in southern Ukraine.
	   Meanwhile, Ukraine's own oil output was slightly down so far
this year, Shuliko's committee reported.
	   It said oil and gas condensate production totaled 1.64 million
tons (11 million barrels) in January-May 1998, 4.8 percent lower
than the same period in 1997. Natural gas production was up 0.8
percent over the same period, the report said.

	   The Larry J. Cruz (LJC) restaurant group is never at a loss for
new ideas.
	   This time, they wish to take their patrons to a very unique
destination Havana, Cuba. Cafe Havana is the newest restaurant/bar
to open in the revived Malate Scene.
	   The interior is done in that unique Tropical '50s style that is
so distinctly Cuban -- sunny colors of yellow and green with
elegant wicker chairs, huge wooden fans, and photos of old cars.
	   A special feature of the place is a room where one can purchase
and smoke cigars, named aptly enough as the Hemingway Room, the
author being Havana's most famous resident apart from Fidel Castro.
There is more Hemingway memorabilia at this cafe than Castro, who
nonetheless has a drink named after him -- the Fidel (P125) -- but
then, so does Hemingway, and his is named the Ernest Hemingway
Special (P95).
	   The refreshing Mojito (P85) -- a mix of Bacardi white rhum, soda
water, syrup, and crushed mint leaves on crushed ice -- could be
Cuba's national drink, if there is any. This writer also tried the
aptly named Periodista (P95), made of apricot brandy, Bacardi, and
lime. Of course, the list of drinks would not be complete without a
Banana Daiquiri.
	   The Hemingway Room offers authentic cigars from Havana (as
expected) along with the less notorious (no trade embargoes?)
Mexican, Honduran, nd Manila cigars. Not being a cigar connoisseur,
I chose to evaluate them by price (which I had ignorantly assumed
was by the box until someone more knowledgeable said it was per
cigar!). The most expensive ones on the list include the
Montecristo (P737) and the Punch Punch (P704). At the other end of
the spectrum is the affordable Belinda Coronas (P154), also Cuban.
But the appelatively interesting include the Manila Cigars with
names such as the Double Happiness Sublime (P319) and the Double
Happiness Ecstasy (P286), which sound as if they contain illegal
substances. And for those who can't get rid of the Centennial
fever, there's always the Rizal (P193).
	   Cuban cuisine shares the characteristics of many of its regional
neighbors; it is, in fact, described as a mixture of Spanish and
Carribean. Black beans, plantain bananas, yuca, and garlic are just
some of the common ingredients to be found in many of the dishes.
Banana chips replace the more traditional tortillas as an
appetizer.
	   Cafe Havana, aside from Cuban food, serves nuevo Latino cuisine
as well as an innovation of Spanish and American dishes. Their
pizzas, for instance, have ingredients like chorizo, black beans,
corn, olives, and quail eggs.
	   One of their bestsellers is the Carribean Salmon and Mango Mambo
in Black Rice (P295), an interesting dish which has squid ink. The
salmon is tender and the squid ink rice tastefully complements the
fish's delicate flavor.
	   The blackbean soup has a very distinct flavor which you may or
may not like. The Spareribs Habanera (P285) offers a unique twist
with guava, honey, and pepper glaze on the side.
	   Pleasing both to the eye and the palette is the Smokeless Cigar
(P150), dessert made of chocolate and served with a scoop of
vanilla ice cream on the side.
	   The night scene of Cafe Havana is very much alive because of the
presence of live rhythms during the weekend. Acoustic guitar and
conga drums will be playing Cuban Salsa.
	   Cafe Havana opened last June 3 with a very loud bang (that
fizzled when the crowd couldn't quite jive with the mood that the
affair was supposed to have had). The streets were closed for a
grand celebration, entitled El Carnaval Afrocubano, and there was
Afrocuban music, street dancing, and tropical drinks. The air
smelled of mint and tobacco.
	   There was a cool party crowd, composed mostly of Malate
night-scene revelers, cigar enthusiasts, and celebrities. Among
those who dropped in to join the festivities included all-smiles
Edu Manzano (whose fate as Makati vice mayor is still in limbo -
how are his ties with the American Embassy?); controvery-magnet
Ruffa Gutierrez (who is currently very busy with her
``Roof-A-Child'' Foundation); Ramon Jacinto (hey, thanks for the
free drinks!); noted actress Chin-Chin Gutierrez (resplendent
despite a simple get-up); former Bb. Pilipinas Charlene Gonzales
(who ballroom danced with an almost-violent frenzy during the
latter part of the revelries); singer/public relations officer
Joanne Lorenzana; Indio I band members; writers Danton Remoto and
Joyce Fernandez; chic broadcast journalist Ces Drilon; television
host Franco Laurel (the night may have been too humid for this poor
guy; he was really perspiring); the VIP dancers with their high
priestess Maribeth Bichara; choreographer Eric Edralin; PR whiz kid
Tim Yap and his cohorts; Warp's Ronald Pasyon; scene-stealing,
towering beauty Troy (who almost won the limbo rock contest by
sheer crowd popularity alone); several commercial and ramp models;
businessmen; and (huffing and puffing) expatriates.
	   Acrobats (who were quite short that we had to strain getting a
look at their stunts since everyone in front was standing) in their
colorful, butterfly-like suits, jugglers, and dancers in exotic
Carribean costumes entertained guests - or, so it seemed. (After
they performed, we were like, ``So that was it?'') The main program
of the evening's celebration ended quite abruptly - at around 11
p.m. - but quite a number extended their tropical night in early
June mixing with Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro - or, at least,
people who dressed and smoked like them.
	   [Cafe Havana is located on Remedios St. corner Adriatico where
Bistro Remedios, which has moved next door, used to be located.]

Study: Drastically lowering blood pressure cuts heart attack risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 0200 GMT. Time set by source. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ By aiming for a blood pressure
even lower than what doctors traditionally prescribe, hypertension
patients can significantly reduce their risk of heart attack, a
landmark new study reported Wednesday.
	   The five-year international study, led by the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor, was conducted to help doctors determine just
how low they need to go in treating patients with high blood
pressure and reducing cardiovascular diseases and deaths.
	   Among diabetics, the results were even more promising _
researchers said drastically lowering their blood pressure can cut
in half their risk of major cardiovascular trouble.
	   ``What we've learned is that lowering blood pressure just to the
point where it isn't `high' isn't enough,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Jamerson, associate professor of internal medicine at the
University of Michigan.
	   Doctors estimate 20 percent of people worldwide suffer from the
condition.
	   Results from the study, which involved 18,790 patients ages
50-80 in 26 countries, were being presented at the annual meeting
in Amsterdam of the International Society of Hypertension. The
study was funded by U.S.-Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra
Merck.
	   Researchers said that by lowering patients' diastolic blood
pressure _ the second and smaller number in blood pressure readings
_ to a level even lower than what doctors have been aiming for can
significantly reduce the risk of heart attack.
	   In the past, doctors have generally accepted a diastolic
pressure of 90 as the limit for hypertensive patients. The study
suggests doctors could aim as low as 80.
	   ``People were worried that by reducing blood pressure too much,
there might be adverse effects,'' said Dr. John Hall, chairman of
the American Heart Association's Council on High Blood Pressure
Research. He was not involved in the research.
	   Some doctors feared that pushing blood pressure further could
slow the blood supply to the heart and brain and perhaps even cause
heart attacks or strokes, said Dag Elmseldt, a Swedish professor on
the executive committee of the study.
	   But the study concludes that lowering patients' diastolic blood
pressure further is safe. It found that patients who cut their
diastolic pressure from 105 to 83 can reduce the incidence of heart
attack by 37 percent.
	   Blood pressure is generally considered healthy if the systolic
level _ which measures the pressure of the blood flow when the
heart beats _ is 120 and the diastolic level _ the pressure between
heart beats _ is 80.
	   The study did not specifically examine systolic blood pressure.
Some experts say the systolic level is at least as important, if
not more so, in determining risk of cardiovascular disease.
	   During the study, patients were assigned to diastolic pressure
targets of 80, 85 and 90. Investigators then followed their
progress to see how many strokes, heart attacks or similar deaths
occurred in each group.
	   Among patients whose diastolic pressure was reduced to 90, there
were 84 cases of heart attack, while there were 64 heart attacks
among those in the 85-level group and 61 in the 80-level group.
	   The results, if proven accurate, should encourage doctors to be
even more strict in managing patients' blood pressure, said Dr.
Peter de Leeuw, a hypertension specialist at the University of
Maastricht in the Netherlands.
	   ``We always want to reduce patients' blood pressure as much as
possible, but they don't always reach their goals and they are not
pressured hard enough,'' said De Leeuw, who did not participate in
the study.
	   Getting people's blood pressure to around 80 ``is ambitious, but
not impossible,'' he said.
	   During the study, patients received felodipine, better known as
Plendil, and other blood pressure medications to reach their target
blood pressure level. The therapy is called hypertension optimal
treatment. Plendil is produced by Astra Merck.
	   The study included 1,501 patients with diabetes and found that
the risk of a major cardiovascular incident was halved for those
who reduced their blood pressure to 80.
	   The American Heart Association said the results confirmed what
it has often said: Management of high blood pressure can save
lives.
	   While drug therapy can lower blood pressure, the association
noted that many patients can reduce it through diet, exercise and
restricted salt intake.

	   FOURTEEN students who received bursaries from the Lion-ASM
Foundation Scholarship or educational loans can now stop worrying
about their finances.
	   The four students who were offered scholarships will receive
RM5,000 per annum while the others will get loans of RM4,000 per
annum.
	   The presentation was held at Menara Lion in Jalan Ampang.
	   Lion Group director Datuk Murad Hashim and group human resources
assistant general manager Herbert Lobo presented the scholarships
and loans to the students.
	   The scholarship recipients were Shirleen Ng Shook Yin, K.
Savaranan, Lim Chin Ling and Noraliza Abdul Halim. Among the loan
recipients were Margaret Tang Siew Peng, Yap Choon Seng, Loh Wern
Chern, Yew Poh Leong, Pho Jin Lian and Swa Beng Wei.
	   Nine other students who are doing their pre-university courses
also received awards worth RM500 each for two years.
	   Meanwhile, 17 children of employees who excelled in last year's
Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia and Peperiksaan Menengah Rendah
examinations were not forgotten as they each received a book prize
worth RM500.
	   Murad said it was the eighth year running that the foundation
presented awards to deserving students since it was launched in
1985.
	   He said to date Lion had sponsored 229 students through various
sponsorships worth RM4.1 million.
	   ``We received about 800 applications for the scholarships. We
had a tough time selecting the deserving applicants,'' he said.
	   He added that it had been the Lion Group's aspiration to
continue contributing to the country's educational and human
resources development in line with Vision 2020.
	   Murad said the group hoped to build a highly qualified corps of
young professionals.

	   GEAC Computers (M) Sdn Bhd is teaming up with NeuConcept
Business Development (M) Sdn Bhd to deliver a turnkey solution for
the local insurance market.
	   Through the partnership, NeuConcept will deliver Geac's
Insurance FastApps which, among others, will help users simplify
annual insurance regulatory reporting requirements and provide
rapid general ledger system deployment for Year 2000 (Y2K)
compliance.
	   Geac's country manager Lana Chan said the combined SmartStream
Ledger and SmartStream Decision Support client-server applications
within Insurance FastApps will provide cost-effective and
dependable results in a mission-critical environment.
	   ``We are targeting to provide a `pre-packaged' solution that is
low in cost and able to give fast returns on investment. This was
previously not available as insurance companies needed to go to
consultancy houses and painfully develop such solutions from
scratch,'' Chan said at the Geac and NeuConcept's joint Press
announcement in Petaling Jaya last week.
	   NeuConcept's senior consultant G.S. Teo said he was optimistic
about the market's acceptance on the product.
	   ``Insurance FastApps not only allows companies to use data
derived from existing systems, it also takes on independent
functions that allow the companies' main systems to run its daily
operations. As it helps prioritise functions, Insurance FastApps is
the key for companies pursuing ISO 9000 certification,'' he said.
	   For companies needing to move their financial applications from
a mainframe to a client-server infrastructure to handle Y2K
compliance, Insurance FastApps can do so without chart of accounts
changes or vendor or customer master file coding, he added.
	   Teo said the solution is especially suitable for insurance
companies whose annual turnover are in the range of RM100 million
to RM150 million, and constitute some 40 per cent of the market.
``With a start-up price of RM250,000, we are confident of closing
at least four deals by year-end for Insurance Fast-Apps,'' he said.
	   According to Teo, the implementation period for Insurance
FastApps could span from three to six months before going live.
	   The solution runs on IBM's reduced instruction set computer
(RISC) and NT servers with either Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server
database.
	   As the turnkey solution uses the IBM platforms, NeuConcept has
struck up a partnership with IBM RS/6000 and personal system group
products distributor Azure Technologies (M) Sdn Bhd to deliver a
total solution.

	   Tax Reform Act of 1997
	   Revenue Memorandum Circular 17-98
	   During the latter part of April 1998, a fellow practitioner,
Benjamin S. of Caloocan, called me to inquire about the new
deadline set under the CTRP for the filing of first-quarter income
tax returns for self-employed people and professionals.
	   Under the old tax law, the deadline for filing was every May 15.
This deadline was changed under the new tax law to April 15.
	   Precisely because of poor dissemination of information regarding
the measure, many self-employed and professionals learned about the
deadline only on April 15, 1998, when they filed their 1997 Annual
Income Tax Return (ITR). You will remember that this date was also
the deadline for the filing of the 1997 annual return.
	   Due to many complaint-letters sent to the BIR, particularly on
concerns of taxpayers about the imposition of penalties and
interests, the BIR issued Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) 17-98
dated May 15, 1998.
	   RMC 17-98 provides for the waiver of penalties and interest
payments for self-employed individuals and professionals who had
failed to submit their first-quarter ITR for 1998 by April 15,
1998, provided they filed their returns on or before May 15, 1998,
the deadline under the old tax law.
	   The professionals and self-employed welcome the BIR-issued RMC.
Even then, I personally think that the matter of the date should be
studied carefully. Think about it this way. If an accountant
finished recording and closing the books for 1998 just in time for
the filing of the 1998 annual income tax return on April 15, 1999,
how on earth could he finish recording for the first quarter of
1999 also on the same date? Remember that there are quite some
adjustments to be done.
	   Revenue Memorandum Circular 14-98 -- BREAKER Just in passing,
the BIR also issued RMC 14-98, dated April 21, 1998, clarifying the
deadlines for the filing of the quarterly value-added and
percentage tax returns within 25 days following the close of each
taxable quarter.
	   Revenue Memorandum Circular 21-98 -- BREAKER Dated May 25, 1998,
RMC 21-98 extends the grace period for compliance with Revenue
Regulations (RR) 2-98 to May 15, 1998.
	   RR 2-98, dated April 17, 1998, about 74 pages of short bond
paper, is a partial implementation of the rules and regulations of
the CTRP. It confined its coverage, however, only to the
withholding tax provisions of the said Code.
	   Revenue Regulations 2-98 -- BREAKER The important provision of
this RR is the determination of who is required to deduct and
withhold taxes, and what nature or type of payments are subject to
withholding tax.
	   The time of withholding is also vital. Thus, the obligation to
deduct arises at the time the income is paid or payable, whichever
comes first.
	   This might be a lot of work, coordination, and monitoring, as
there are departmental billings which are already due for payment,
but somehow, the processing of the payments has not been made or
forwarded to the accounting department due to lack of, or
questionable, support documents. Sometimes, there are instances
where the Company still does not know the amount of the final bill,
as is the case when the contract is on a per-hour billing basis.
	   The time of filing and payment is still set at the 10th of each
month, except for the month of December, for which the deadline
shall be on Jan.
	   25.
	   In cases of employees whose income does not exceed the statutory
minimum wage or P5,000 monthly, employers are not required to
withhold any monthly taxes.
	   An employee whose annual income will not exceed P60,000, is
given two options - either pay his annual income tax himself (thus
his monthly salary will not be subjected to withholding taxes), or
request that his employer continue to withhold the monthly taxes
(thus he is not required to file any annual income tax ). This is a
new provision. Under the old law, all employers were mandated to
withhold taxes on behalf of their employees, who were given no
options at all.

	   THERE seems to be an endless string of problems besetting our
youth, and to a certain extent our students, in the last few years.
	   Besides drug addiction, there are social ills such as loafing,
bohsia, illegal motorcycle racing, pre-marital sex, HIV/AIDS,
prostitution, abandoning of newborns, pornography, vandalism and
hooliganism.
	   Discipline has also taken a battering in schools. A group of
Kedah secondary and matriculation teachers who attended a workshop
recently called for tough punishment to check gangsterism in
schools as they felt that mere counselling would be ineffective.
	   In Johor Baru last month, a Form Five male student manhandled
and kicked a woman teacher in the groin when she questioned him for
coming late to school.
	   In Penang, gang fights among students in schools are not only
rampant among boys but also among girls. In April a schoolgirl in
Georgetown, who is believed to be a gang leader, threatened her
teacher with a knife after being reprimanded for being inattentive
in class.
	   Deputy Education Minister Datuk Dr Fong Chan Onn said the
ministry had instructed its State departments to work closely with
the police in curbing gangsterism among students.
	   He said police help was necessary as the problem of
student-gangsterism was linked with ``outside elements''. Many of
these students, he said, frequented entertainment outlets like
snooker centres or nightclubs and are influenced by gangs
controlling these places.
	   Acts of misconduct include students beating up teachers,
fighting, vandalism, smoking, truancy, sexual acts, theft,
extortion and involvement with drugs.
	   National Unity and Social Development Minister Datin Paduka
Zaleha Ismail said children as young as nine years old were getting
involved in house-breaking and other offences such as theft and
gambling.
	   Between 1990 and 1996, an average of 4,000 juvenile delinquents
a year were sent for rehabilitation and development. In 1996, a
total of 4,045 boys and 166 girls between the ages of 13 and 16
were charged in the Juvenile Court for various offences and found
guilty under the Juvenile Act 1947.
	   Zaleha said lack of parental supervision contributed to the rise
in juvenile cases. There have also been cases of girls as young as
12 being forced into prostitution.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the
Government was worried over serious social problems especially
among Malay youths. He said Malay youths made up 70 per cent of the
200,000 drug addicts while most of those affected by other social
problems are also Malays.
	   According to the National Narcotics Agency, 30 new addicts are
detected each day and more than 10,000 addicts are undergoing
rehabilitation at 27 rehabilitation centres (Pusat Serenti)
nationwide.
	   Many may still remember the furore caused by the circulation of
a videotape showing two youngsters having sex at Kompleks Peruda in
Alor Star in December 1996.
	   In early April this year Kedah police arrested 15 youths
including five girls at a house in Lorong Bayam, Alor Star. The
house was believed to be used for sex orgies and drug abuse
sessions.
	   ``The fact that 2,000 used and unused condoms were seized at
least showed that the culprits believed in safe sex,'' said a local
wag.
	   Less than a week later Kedah police picked up six teenagers -
five boys aged between 18 and 19 and a 15-year-old girl - who were
engaged in group sex at a rented house in Lorong Keriang, Alor
Star, about 4am.
	   Official figures show that the majority of those infected with
the HIV virus in Kedah are between the ages of 15 and 30.
	   Alarmed at the increase in such social ills, the State
Government has directed the State youth and sports department to
set up youth associations in every kampung, and Menteri Besar Tan
Sri Sanusi Junid has asked police to pick up youths found loitering
at shopping complexes in Alor Star to be sent to pick up skills in
canoeing.
	   ``Maybe this is a good way of making use of their time. The
proposal is to help tackle social ills in the State which normally
starts with loafing,'' he said.
	   Penang antique dealer Mohamad Mastan Abdul Rahman, 80, who had a
strict upbringing, described today's youngsters as ``birds leaving
their cages''.
	   ``The old ways of instilling discipline will no longer work in
the present situation and new solutions will have to be found,'' he
said.
	   Trader Mohamad Fadzil Kadir Shah, 36, of Air Itam in Penang,
said the easy availability of hard-core pornographic video tapes
had corrupted the minds of the young.
	   ``Unscrupulous video tape dealers are just out to make a fast
buck and will not think twice about selling pornographic tapes to
underaged schoolchildren,'' he said.
	   Umno Kampung Manggis deputy leader Ramlan Raji welcomed the
tougher enforcement on illegal motorcycle racers and also called
for harsher measures against drug pushers and dealers of
pornographic material.
	   ``Everyone knows that the source of pornographic tapes are the
video tape dealers. Schoolchildren often pool their pocket money to
buy such tapes.
	   Writer Kassim Ahmad called on the authorities to ensure that
adequate library and recreational facilities were provided at
highrise flats to encourage youngsters to spend their time nearer
home instead of loitering at shopping malls.
	   Consumers Association of Penang president S.M. Mohamad Idris
said perhaps the single biggest loss he could see emerging in
modern Malaysia was the weakening of the family institution where
both parents were now going out to work.
	   ``The extended family system which used to provide good support
is also disappearing. If both parents are out working, who brings
up the children?''
	   Idris supported the call to institute compulsory national
service which he said should be constructive and based on
developing and instilling a sense of commitment to society.
	   As MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said: ``If a
nation cannot control social decay, it will lose control of its
economic power. If we want our country to progress we must face our
moral and social ills and find solutions.''

	   SEREMBAN, Sun. - State DAP chairman Wong Zee Nyok said members
in the State respected the decision to suspend national
vice-chairman Liew Ah Kim and treasurer Fung Ket Wing, and remove
national publicity secretary Wee Choo Keong from his post.
	   He said members believed the move by the Central Executive
Committee was in the party's interest and were confident the
decision was taken only after having considered all consequences.
	   ``Every political party in the country has its share of problems
and we must respect any decision by our party leaders in the faith

	   He said all programmes and activities organised by the State
party would continue as scheduled and that there were no grievances

	   Continuing his battle for control over Batangas Laguna-Tayabas
Bus Co. Inc.
	   (BLTB), BMB Property Holdings Inc. owner Benjamin Bitanga
yesterday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to
stop the Potenciano family from running the bus firm.
	   In an 11-page petition for a temporary restraining order (TRO)
before the SEC, Bitanga said the Potenciano family had
misrepresented themselves as owners of the company, claiming the
stockholders meeting held last May 19 was ``null and void.''
	   During the said stockholders meeting, the Potenciano family
reclaimed the 47.90% shares supposedly sold to Bitanga and secured
control of the BLTB.
	   ``There was absolutely no quorum during the scheduled meeting
since BMB, the shareholder owning the majority 50.26% of the total
outstanding shares of stock of BLTB had not been not represented,''
the businessman said.
	   The petition stated that only Bitanga could have legally
presided and convened the annual stockholders meeting.
	   ``There could be no one else because no vice chair had been duly
elected and the BLTB board of directors had not designated anyone
else to preside,'' the petition said.
	   Bitanga argued that the ``illegal misrepresentation of the
Potenciano family to BLTB employees, creditors, stockholders and to
the general public will cause irreparable damage and ruin the bus
firm.''
	   Currently, BLTB owes Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co., Allied
Bank, Solid Bank, Bank of Commerce and several other financing
firms some P1.3 billion.
	   As this developed, Lorna Potenciano Navarro, chief financial
officer of BLTB, filed an estafa case against Bitanga for allegedly
issuing checks amounting to P33.28 million without supporting
invoices.
	   Among those being questioned were the P20-million representation
expenses by Bitanga; P7.45 million for payment-lease of BLTB's
Sucat property; P2.35 million for the Sucat warehouse; and another
P3.48 million as advance lease of the Sucat property.
	   The Potencianos also claimed that last month's stockholders
meeting was legal as Bitanga was not able to abide by the
memorandum of agreement (MOA) signed by the two parties on the
supposed transfer of 47.90% of BLTB to Bitanga.
	   Currently there are two different claims with both sides
accusing each other usurping the assets of the company.
	   Bitanga claimed the Potenciano family had forcibly taken over
the properties and operations of BLTB.
	   The Potencianos, on the other hand, claimed that Bitanga used
BLTB as a ``cash cow'' as it gave him at least P2 million a day
since December last year.
	   The BLTB minority shareholders control 14% of the company and
both the Potencianos and Bitanga have claimed their support.
	   Bitanga said minority shareholders led by Delfin Yorro had given
their full support to his group, while the Potenciano family
claimed that Yorro talked to them and denied that he had sided with
Bitanga.
	   In a statement, Bitanga said Dolores Potenciano had sold to BMB
the entire holdings of the Potenciano family, representing 47.98%
of the bus company's stocks and that the sale was perfected through
a Deed of Absolute Sale executed on Oct. 28, 1997.
	   He pointed out that Potenciano had even issued a Declaration of
Trust, acknowledging the actual and beneficial ownership of the
shares in question by BMB and summarily waived her right, title,
and interests to the said shares of stocks.
	   Bitanga said Potenciano cannot just rescind a perfected Deed of
Absolute Sale without due process, especially after money has
changed hands as he claimed that Potenciano herself received some
P11 million which was part of the P34,743,364 which was to be
remitted by BMB to Allied Bank to retire some of BLTB's outstanding
debts.
	   He said that BLTB was wallowing in huge financial losses with
debts reaching more than P1 billion at the time BMB was invited to
invest in the bus company.
	   Bitanga said he saw a potential to rehabilitate what was once
the leading passenger bus company in the country through a
restructuring of the firm's financial position and an aggressive
refleeting program to replace the company's dilapidated buses.
	   He said that the credit worthiness of BLTB was restored after
BMB took over the management of the company, adding that Columbian
Motors Corp. had agreed to deliver an initial batch of 30
air-conditioned buses merely on the guaranty of BMB.

	   IPOH, Sun. - The three DAP leaders who were suspended and
removed from their posts last Wednesday said they had not objected
to the ``Save Lim Guan Eng'' campaign and had attended several
meetings of the campaign in the Federal Territory.
	   At a joint Press conference today they said they wanted to go on
record on the matter.
	   Liew Ah Kim who was suspended as party vice-chairman said: ``It
is incorrect of (party secretary-general Lim) Kit Siang to accuse
us of sabotaging the campaign and there is no basis for his
allegations.''
	   He said Wee Choo Keong who was removed as national publicity
secretary had openly asked the people of Tangkak, Johor, to support
Guan Eng and fight for justice.
	   Liew, who acted as spokesman for Wee and Fung Ket Wing who was
suspended as treasurer, said the party leaders, including chairman
Dr Chen Man Hin and Kit Siang were confusing members more by
issuing contradicting and misleading statements over their case.
	   ``Their statements create confusion not only for us but also
party members,''he said.
	   The action taken against the three party stalwarts based on
reports by Perak and Malacca DAP, was said to be for ``undermining
party morale, creating confusion, disharmony and disunity among
members.''
	   Despite their case pending an inquiry, the three leaders were
invited to attend a party gathering organised by the Perak DAP in
Manjung last night where they also spoke.
	   The gathering was organised a month ago and were attended by
several national party leaders.
	   Expressing fear of a biased inquiry by the party diciplinary
committee, Liew, Fung and Wee reiterated their request to be
investigated by an independent and impartial committee.
	   ``We demand for an independant and impartial committee to
investigate the allegations,'' he said.
	   ``If we are guilty as alleged by Kit Siang after a fair and
impartial hearing, we are prepared to face the consequences.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Silvio Berlusconi's main ally in the center-right
opposition said Tuesday that the alliance won't bail out Premier
Romano Prodi's government on a crucial vote later this month on
NATO.
	   Without the support of the media mogul's Freedom Alliance,
Prodi's center-left coalition risks losing the vote and thus facing
a vote of confidence.
	   While Berlusconi and his allies support NATO's eastward
expansion, they have announced their refusal to come to the rescue
of the government yet again in the face of the governing
coalition's difficulties with its troublesome Communist allies.
	   Fausto Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party which Prodi
counts on for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, where a vote
on NATO is planned the week of June 22, on Tuesday reiterated its
intention to vote against the military alliance's expansion.
	   ``There have been numerous attempts to convince us to change our
stance,'' said the party's foreign policy chief, Ramon Mantovani.
``But our `no' vote isn't under discussion.''
	   Boosted by a strong showing for the center-right in scattered
local elections last weekend, Berlusconi said Monday he wanted to
``send Prodi and his government home.''
	   ``We don't want to bail Prodi out in any way,'' Gianfranco Fini,
leader of the rightwing National Alliance, a key ally in
Berlusconi's coalition, told reporters.
	   However, it is unlikely the opposition will ultimately stop
Italy from approving the addition of new countries, and a
compromise is likely.
	   During a visit to Germany Tuesday, Prodi said his government's
stability will not be shaken by the vote.
	   ``We can't forget that the NATO proposal has passed in one
chamber of parliament,'' said Prodi.
	   Bertinotti pushed the government to the brink of collapse last
year when it voted against Italy's plans to send peacekeeping
troops to Albania, but Berlusconi's coalition bailed out Prodi
then.
	   Prodi's coalition suffered a setback Tuesday with the formal end
to parliamentary efforts on political reform, a key plank of the
government.
	   Refusal by Berlusconi to back the government's proposal for
changing the powers of the Italian president brought collapse of
the reforms.
	   Separately, the No. 2 in Sicily for Berlusconi's Forza Italia
party, Parliament Deputy Gaspare Giudici, was charged Tuesday with
Mafia association and money-laundering.

	   Israel and the European Union are holding secret talks with
Israel making substantial concessions to the Palestinian authority,
Newsweek International reports in its latest edition. The magazine
without citing sources said Israel had agreed to give Palestinians
a seaport and a working airport to prevent the imposition of EU
sanctions on products manufactured in Jewish settlements. Israel
has reacted with outrage at the European Commission's
recommendation last month that products made in Jewish settlements
in the occupied West Bank Gaza Strip and Golan Heights be denied
tariff benefits. Newsweek says Europe is Israel's biggest market
accounting for more than one third of the Jewish state's 15.7
billion dollars in annual exports.
	   Nearly all the exports are duty free. The US Ambassador to
Israel hosted surprise talks on Sunday between senior Israeli and
Palestinian peace negotiators, Israeli political sources said. The
meeting at the Ambassador Edwrd Walker's home near Tel Aviv focused
on the opening of an airport and industrial zone in Gaza, issues
auxiliary to the handover of more West Bank land to the
Palestinians under interim peace deals, the sources said. The talks
between Israeli Cabinet Secretary Dany Naveh and the Palestinians
Saeb Erekat coincided with media speculation that a deal on further
Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank an accord that would
break a 15-month deadlock was near.
	   Naveh and Erekat last met for discussions on the opening of a
Palestinian airport in Gaza and other so-called.Walker said last
week that Washington would decide within days rather than weeks
--whether to press ahead with its Middle East peace initiative. In
remarks to reporters earlier in the day, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu played down speculation that he was on the verge
of ceding land. We are working towards reaching an agreement. We
are not there yet, Netanyahu said, apparently hoping to ease ferris
of some right wing cabinet members. Invoking biblical names for the
West Bank a statement said he told his cabinet that the territory
of Judea and Samaria is no more dear to anyone than to him and
(Jewish) settlement is no more dear to anyone than it is to him...
Ultra Nationalists in Netanyahu's coalition have threatened to
topple the Israeli leader should be go through with plans to give
Palestinians self rule in the West Bank in keeping with Israeli
peace promises starting in 1993.
	   More than 150,000 Israelis live in Jewish settlements scattered
among more than 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank captured
by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. The Israeli
Cabinet statement described negotiations as being at a delicate
stage. The Prime Minster said he could not say we are on the verge
of an agreement, it said. In Jerusalem posters depicting Netanyahu
wearing an Arab scarf under the slogan ``the liar'' appeared on
Sunday, recalling a hate campaign that preceded the 1995 killing of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. A Jew shot Rabin dead in
November 1995 to try to stop him from carrying out land-for-peace
deals with Palestinians.
	   Israel's Haaretz newspaper said last week an US draft proposal
envisaged a three-stage Israeli handover of a further 13 per cent
of West Bank land to Palestinians over 12 weeks linked to a
Palestinian security clampodown.Netanyahu has rejected the US
proposals on security grounds. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
has accepted them. Public security minister Avigdor Kehalani, head
of Israel's Centrist Third Way party was due to meet US peace envoy
Denis Ross in New York on Monday for talks coordinated with
Netanyahu Kahalani's office said.

	   RECENTLY, Bank Negara Malaysia announced that in the first
quarter of 1998, Malaysia's Gross Domestic Product contracted by
1.8 per cent.
	   This is the first quarterly contraction the country has
experienced since the 1985 recession, which was 13 years ago.
	   Although economists and analysts braced for a bad GDP figure, a
1.8 per cent contraction was beyond expectations.
	   Upon the release of this news, the ringgit slipped against the
US dollar in early trading last Monday.
	   The futures began the week on a weaker note, reacting to the
bearish news released by BNM, as well as a weaker ringgit.
	   Against this backdrop, the steep decline in the regional
markets, sparked off by the declining Japanese yen also spooked
players.
	   Amidst this, BNM issued a statement on interest rates policy
late on Monday afternoon.
	   BNMasaid interest rates will remain at current levels to defend
the currency and assist the economic and financial recovery.
	   This announcement was well received by investors. In addition,
the Deputy Prime Minister also announced details of the Asset
Management Company.
	   Investors bought futures in anticipation of the announcement,
resulting in the futures staging a mild recovery in mid-week.
	   However, when the AMC details were announced by the Deputy Prime
Minister, the market gave up most of its gains as the announcement
did not meet the high investor expectations.
	   The selling activity continued, resulting in the futures
finishing the week below the 500.0 level.
	   The June futures ended at 499.5, down 31.5 index points from
Friday's close, with a total of 14,638 contracts traded.
	   The July futures traded 1845 contracts to finish at 492.5. In
addition, the September futures traded 5 contracts to finish at
495.0.
	   The December futures were not traded.
	   The underlying composite index ended at 505.05, down 33.19 index
points from Friday's close.
	   Due to the considerable decline in the futures over the course
of trading last week, we do not rule out the possibility of some
bargain buying this week.

Becker loses at Gerry Weber Open; won't play Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Moya winning, Corretja losing &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALLE, Germany (AP) _ Boris Becker was beaten by fellow German
Hendrik Dreekmann in three erratic sets Tuesday at the Gerry Weber
Open, then announced he won't play Wimbledon.
	   Becker fought off five match points, but handed the world No.
101 the match with a double fault, 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (11-9) at the dlrs
875,000 grass court event.
	   ``A Wimbledon start would have made sense with a good
performance in Halle, but not with a first-round loss,'' said
Becker.
	   ``This way, the pressure would be too much for me,'' added
Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion.
	   Becker, who is easing into retirement and has played just six
tournaments this year, had changed his mind several times after
announcing last year that his 14th Wimbledon was his final one.
	   In his first match since winning the French Open, Spain's Carlos
Moya coasted past France's Guillaume Raoux, 6-4, 6-4.
	   But the man he beat in the Roland Garros final, fellow Spaniard
Alex Corretja, was ousted by another Frenchman, Nicolas Escude,
6-2, 7-5.
	   With many Germans believing it was a last chance to see Becker
play, there was a morning run on tickets for his match. Hundreds
were turned away from the 11,400-seat center court.
	   Becker fought for two hours and 18 minutes against Dreekmann,
but was far from the form that made him a former world No. 1 and a
Wimbledon finalist seven times.
	   But the 30-year-old offered his fans, cheering his every move
wildly, plenty of entertainment. He blew a 4-0 lead in the final
set tie break, then warded off one match point after another.
	   Becker, now ranked 58th, displayed little of the coolness under
pressure that marked his prime, despite warding off two match
points with powerful serves.
	   A double fault led to one match point, babying a sure overhead
winner cost Becker a second. Dreekmann also let several final
points slip away behind easy errors.
	   For Dreekman, once ranked 39th, the win was revenge for being
publicly dismissed by Becker as talented, but unmotivated.
	   ``Becker has said Wimbledon is his bedroom, but this was mine,''
said Dreekman.
	   Although five top 10 players are entered in the Wimbledon
tuneup, the day was dominated by the local German players.
	   Australia's Richard Fromberg upset no. 7 seed Nicolas Kiefer,
Germany, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, while Tommy Haas beat Belgium's Filip
Dewulf, 6-3, 6-4.
	   The presence of Becker, perhaps the most idolized personality in
his homeland, has so overwhelmed the event that defending champion
Yevgeny Kafelnikov was surprised to be questioned by a reporter.
	   The 1996 French Open champion and world No. 7 Russian had just
survived a three-set battle Monday with the Ukraine's Andrei
Medvedev.
	   ``Great, someone noticed I'm still in the tournament,''
Kafelnikov said. ``I thought nobody was aware of it.''

	   The Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) will develop
another housing community in Tagig for members of Sprinxville
Neighborhood Association Inc. (SNAI) on a 4.3-hectare portion of
the eight-hectare land allocated for the former residents of Fort
Bonifacio.
	   In a memorandum of agreement (MOA) signed recently between BCDA
and SNAI, BCDA will provide electricity, potable water supply,
road, networks, drainage system and an access road that would link
it to the C-5 Road.
	   The new housing site is located on a prime land near the two
major housing communities -- Centennial Village and Diego Silang --
along the C-5 Road in Taguig.
	   The project is part of BCDA's ongoing shelter program under the
Ramos administration as a commitment to provide affordable and
decent housing units to members of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP).
	   BCDA, through the Public Estates Authority (PEA), would pay the
qualified member-beneficiaries of SNAI of the assessed value of
their temporary structure at Fort Bonifacio but not to exceed
P500,000 net of tax and the cost of land in two installments.
	   The firsts installment will be 70% of the amount to be released
immediately when the relocation site has been developed or ready
for housing construction. The remaining 30% will be released
immediately upon vacating their present structures.
	   BCDA will sell the developed lots to qualified SNAI
member-beneficiaries.
	   The total area will be determined based on the homelots each
member-beneficiary is entitled in accordance with the BCDA-approved
guidelines as follows: 36 square meters (sq.m.) for owners of
structures valued up to P100,000; 60 sq.m. for owners of structures
valued above P100,000 up to P300,000; and 72 sq.m. for owner of
structures valued above P300,000.
	   SNAI will pay the cost of home at a subsidized rate of P500 per
square meter through automatic deductions from the payment of the
structures of member-beneficiaries.

Hamas: Sheik Yassin to return within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israel barring family of another Hamas official
from entering Gaza; TRIMS; ADDS Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder and
spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, will return to
Gaza within days, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas spokesman, told The Associated Press that
Yassin _ who has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim countries
raising millions of dollars and drumming up support for Hamas _
will ``most likely'' come back to Gaza on Saturday.
	   Israel's security establishment and political leaders have been
debating for weeks whether the sheik would pose a greater danger
from outside or inside Gaza. Israel, which controls Gaza's borders,
could keep Yassin out if it wished.
	   Meanwhile Israel barred the wife and children of another Hamas
official, Mousa Abu Marzouk, from entering the Gaza Strip from
Egypt Tuesday.
	   Abu Marzouk was released last summer from a U.S. jail and sent
to Jordan where he lives now, after promising not to get involved
in terrorism.
	   ``This morning, my brother's wife Nadia and her five children
were refused entry into Gaza by the Israeli border police, even
though they traveled on American passports'' Abu Marzouk's brother
Mahmoud said.
	   He said it was the first time Israel had ever refused her
permission to visit and that the family had asked the Palestinian
Authority to intervene on their behalf. Mrs. Abu Marzouk returned
to Cairo, her brother-in-law said.
	   Regarding Yassin's return to Gaza, Israeli leaders Tuesday
appeared to be leaning toward allowing him back, in part because
keeping him out could set off an explosion of violence by backers
of Hamas.
	   ``The choice is not between what is good and better, but between
what is bad and worse,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   State-owned Israel TV reported that Israel's internal security
agency, Shin Bet, submitted its recommendation to the government
that Yassin's returned be allowed and coordinated with the
Palestinian Authority. Not other details on the recommendation were
available and the secret agency does not have a spokesperson.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel, and its military wing has
killed more than 100 Israelis in scores of attacks in recent years.
	   The group's popularity in the Palestinian lands, especially
Gaza, is seen as a growing threat to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin's fiery comments on his tour, such as his description of
suicide attacks as ``holy missions,'' have been widely reported in
Israel.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall to buy the
freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt on another Hamas leader.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu's inner security Cabinet debated the Yassin
question, but did not reach any decision. Politicians and security
figures have been airing sharply conflicting views, though.

	   The financial industry is now too ``overcrowded'' to accommodate
the operations of small-scale banks, according to a foreign banker.
	   In a press briefing yesterday, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Lawrence noted that the stiff
rivalry among commercial banks have displaced smaller thrift banks.
	   ``There are a lot of big banks competing for the market and this
overcrowds the smaller banks,'' Lawrence said.
	   Currently, there are 55 commercial banks and 800 thrift banks
nationwide.
	   Earlier, investment houses had predicted that thrift banks would
likely be the first casualties of the regional crisis given their
limited resources.
	   The prediction is now seemingly an accurate one after the
Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas (BSP), ordered the closure of Commonwealth Savings Bank
due to insolvency last Friday.
	   Richmond Savings Bank and Unified Savings Bank were also
reported to be in financial trouble. Aklan Savings Bank was also
shut down secondary to bankruptcy while Orient Commercial Banking
Corp. which was formerly a thrift bank is still on a holiday up to
now.
	   Meanwhile, Lawrence said Hongkong Bank has yet to find an
investment-worthy financial institution which could become its
subsidiary.
	   Hongkong Bank has applied for a universal bank license with the
BSP but was deferred after the economic crunch took place in the
middle of last year.
	   One major focus of Hongkong Bank, should the BSP grant its
petition, would be the acquisition of a local bank.
	   ``We can go into commercial or retail banking which would be
just like any other business decision. The granting of the license
just raises our options but so far, we have not seen one (bank)
that is attractive,''
	   Lawrence said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Umno Youth chief Datuk Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
today described as ``nepotism'' the practice of big corporations
sub-contracting privatisation projects to related companies or
firms in which they had a personal interest.
	   He said evidence of such practice was available from the
statistics of companies getting such contracts.
	   Asked if the companies referred to were those held by leaders,
he said: ``It depends, but we believe that transparency should
prevail at all times.
	   ``We do not want political connection to be used. We must show
that we are truly transparent in our actions, not only in the
rhetorical sense when implementing a policy.''
	   Ahmad Zahid was speaking to reporters after a congress on
``Strengthening the National Economy'' organised by the Umno Youth
at the Putra World Trade Centre.
	   He said it would be difficult to maintain the nation's economic
and political stability if the interests of the people were
ignored.
	   ``If given an opportunity to profitable business ventures, I
believe even an ordinary Bumiputera entrepreneur can play a
similar, if not better role.
	   ``Like their bigger counterparts, I am sure they will not only
pay their corporate tax, but also not forget their social
obligation like tithe and charity to the less fortunate.''
	   An all-round effort should be made to prevent favourtism.
	   ``By letting such situations continue the ill-practice will
simply mean that we have to sideline justice.
	   ``When we speak of equality, we have to think of, for example,
contractors at the lower level.
	   ``By right, they should be given priority. This is simply
because when a big construction firm faces financial hardship, its
smaller counterparts are likely to be shut down first''.
	   In his speech, Ahmad Zahid said positive elements like a new
management code was needed to fight corruption, nepotism and abuse
of power.
	   ``The current economic hardship is the best period for
self-criticism and re-evaluation of the strength and weaknesses of
our system.''
	   ``The question of wealth distribution can easily trigger
dissatisfaction among the people.
	   ``We are not asking for the Bumiputera entrepreneurs to be
spoon-fed with all sorts of assistance, but only suggesting they
should be given opportunities and priority,'' he added.
	   At the half-day congress which was opened by Ahmad Zahid, a
proposed blueprint titled ``Strategies for the Strengthening of the
National Economy'' was presented by the movement's Economic Council
chairman Dr Abdul Rahim Mohd Ghouse.
	   This was followed by a panel discussion by prominent leaders and
economic experts which included Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul
Ghani Othman, the Bumiputera Manufacturers Association chairman and
MP for Rompin Datuk Dr Jamaluddin Jarjis, L&AMP;G Twintech Sdn Bhd
executive chief director Prof Dr Ismail Salleh and Kompleks
Metrowangsa Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Dr Ghazali Atan.
	   The congress was later closed by the movement's deputy chief
Datuk Hishammuddin Tun Hussein.

	   How much do you, the average healthy eater, know about
asparagus? Aside from the fact that it makes a great soup, perhaps
not a lot.
	   Asparagus has quite an illustrious history. Everyone from
practically everywhere, from south central Europe to western and
central Asia and northern Africa, has something to say about it.
The Greeks and Romans may disagree on a few things but they share
an opinion when it comes to the fine flavor of asparagus. Old
bas-reliefs also prove the herb was used in Ancient Egypt.
	   Two hundred years before Christianity, Cato described how
asparagus was cultivated, which was not very different from the way
it's done today. It is derived from a wild form still commonly
found in sandy places, woods, and along river banks. There's the
white Argenteuil from France, the purple asparagus from Holland,
the green Bassano del Gappa from Italy, the purple asparagus from
Genoa, the Mary Washington from the Americas, and the White
Asparagus of Baden Wurtemberg, Germany.
	   The White Asparagus, as well as other varieties, is quite well
known as an aphrodisiac. It's an excellent source of Vitamin A and
C, a good source of minerals, potassium, phosphorus, and iron. It
is also suitable for renal, low-sodium, diabetic, weight control,
low-fat, and low cholesterol diet.
	   In Baden Wurtemberg, around Heidelberg in Germany, harvest
season for White Asparagus has started and will end on the 21st of
June. To pay tribute to this ancient delicacy, the Werdenberg
Corp., known for its chain of fine-dining continental restaurants
in Manila, has brought in White German asparagus for local diners
to sample exquisite asparagus preparations.
	   Beginning June 5 until supply lasts, diners can enjoy asparagus
served cold with a choice of vinaigrette dressing; garlic
mayonnaise, chopped egg, herbs, and air-dried ham; or radish cream
dressing and smoked salmon slices, perfect for an appetizer or as
the main course.
	   If you prefer your asparagus warm, you can ask for asparagus
boiled in its own stock with a choice of Hollandaise sauce, Creamy
Cheese sauce, or Herb-Tomato sauce topped with Parmesan cheese.
Should you prefer any of the dishes as appetizers, the chef
recommends you follow them up with these top main courses -
Asparagus and Grilled Salmon with Champignons and Almond-Herb sauce
served with rice or Asparagus and Rump Steak with an
Orange-Flavored Hollandaise sauce and potato crust.
	   Epicureans, as well as the ``epicurious'', can have the best of
asparagus and other prime dishes at Carpaccio's Ristorante Italiano
and Bianca's Cafe &AMP; Vinotek, both located at 7431 Yakal St., Makati
City; Nathalie's Cafe and Vinotek at Unit B Sycamore Bldg., Alabang
Zapote Road corner Buencamino St., Alabang, Muntinlupa; Zucchini's
Grill &AMP; Vinotek at 66 Timog Avenue, Bgy. Sacred Heart, Quezon City;
and The Gold Ranch Steakhouse at 822 Arnaiz Ave., Makati City.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Department of Environment will no
longer issue contravention licences for open burning under
amendments to the clean air regulations.
	   Instead, it will come up with a prescribed list stating clearly
the type of activities for which open burning will be allowed.
	   Even then the exemption will only be given when open burning is
absolutely necessary including for religious and training purposes,
disease control and traditional agricultural practices.
	   Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng
Ding told the New Straits Times that plantation companies would no
longer be allowed to carry out open burning for land clearing.
	   This is because the technology for zero burning is available and
plantation companies can afford to use it to get rid of biomass for
replanting purposes.
	   The proposed amendments to the Environmental Quality (Clean Air)
Regulations 1978 are the second stage of DOE's plan to ensure
stringent enforcement to curb local sources of haze.
	   The first step was amending the Environmental Quality
(Amendment) Act 1996 which, among others, saw the introduction of
stiffer penalties for open burning.
	   The Bill was tabled in the Dewan Rakyat on May 13 and passed a
few days later. The Dewan Negara passed the Bill on Thursday and
the DOE is currently gazetting it.
	   Amendments to the regulations do not have to go through
Parliament but the DOE's legal adviser, who is currently drafting
the amendments, will have to submit the draft to the
Attorney-General's Chambers for approval.
	   At present, the regulations allow for contravention licences to
be issued for agricultural practices. There are also clauses which
allow the use of fire for disease or pest control on agriculture
land; research or fire-fighting training purposes; and burning of
garden refuse.
	   Law said all these clauses would be removed and contravention
licences would no longer be issued.
	   ``This means those who carry out open burning for activities
which are not in the prescribed list will be violating the law,''
he said.
	   DOE director-general Rosnani Ibarahim said the amendments would
also remove ambiguities which obstructed effective enforcement.
	   ``The prescribed list will be very specific on types of
activities. For instance, the plantation sector is now lumped under
agricultural activities.
	   ``What we are doing is to come up with the descriptions of
activities for which open burning is allowed,'' she said.
	   Law said traditional agricultural practices including shifting
cultivation would be exempted because they were carried out by
small-scale farmers.
	   ``There is no technology which they can use. Even if there was,
they could not afford it. Moreover, the size of land involved is
not significant,'' he said.
	   When debating the Environmental Quality Bill in Parliament last
month, a few Members of Parliament had urged the ministry to
consider the plight of padi farmers.
	   They said it was common for farmers to burn padi husks and
straws for easy disposal or to destroy pests.

	   Ayala Life Assurance Inc., one of the leading insurance
companies in the country, is set to inaugurate this June its
business offices at the new 14-storey Ayala Life-FGU Center
Alabang. The building serves as an elegant gateway to the fastest
growing Central Business District south of Makati, the Madrigal
Business Park. It sits on a 1,600-square meter lot strategically
located at the corner of Acacia Ave. and the Alabang-Zapote Road.
	   The new building, developed by Ayala Land, is equipped with
state of the art advanced building systems for mechanical,
plumbing, fire detection, alarm and protection, electrical and
emergency power. After full testing and commissioning, the Ayala
Life-FGU Center Alabang is now fully operational and ready for
occupancy. Its first occupant at present is the Makati Development
Corp. By end of July, Globalbank, an affiliate of Metrobank, will
occupy one of its ground floor banking halls.

	   ALOR STAR, Sun. - The Kedah Umno liaison committee decided
unanimously last night to ask all divisions in the State to ensure
there is no contest for the president's and deputy president's
posts in next year's party elections.
	   State Umno liaison chief Tan Sri Sanusi Junid said the committee
decided that Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim should not be challenged to enable them to concentrate on
overcoming the nation's economic problems.
	   ``We will ask all divisions in Kedah to propose the posts are
not contested,'' he told a Press conference today.
	   Sanusi said the divisional chiefs agreed time and efforts should
be spent on solving the economic problems.
	   Asked why the committee had made such a decision now when the
party elections were only next year, he said: ``Because we found
that some campaigning has started.
	   ``If the campaign continues, we will not be able to focus on
other important matters.''

	   A local newspaper poll published on Monday found 66 percent of
Thais surveyed said they were satisfied with the way Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai's administration was handling the nation's economic
crisis.The Nation reported 33 percent of 881 voters conducted last
week via the Internet said they were not satisfied with the
government's efforts and 0.4 percent were undecided.But reviewing
Chuan's six months Chuan, it said there was an ``intriguing mixture
of faith and scepticism'' about the way the government was handling
the economic turmoil.
	   Chuan's six-party coalition took power last December after
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's administration resigned under pressure for
alleged mishandling of the economy.Chuan's administration has been
popular with the markets, given his strong economic team, and
enjoys broad public support.''Sympathisers and supporters still
outnumber detractors as recent polls show,'' the daily said.''But
the gap has narrowed somehow, and whatever remains of his status as
a saviour has been eclipsed by the we-have-no-choice observation
that recognises his indispensability but underlines doubts as to
whether he really has what it takes to solve the country's
worsening problems. ``Gone is the shining armour. After six months
at the helm of a country in its worst economic crisis, Chuan
Lekpai, confounded and politically wounded, looks like anything but
a white knight, depending on one's point of view.''Everyone agrees
on one thing: Chuan's task is not easy,'' it added.
	   The daily said critics complained of the government's failure to
instigate tax reform or establish a fund to help farmer's pay debts
owed the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives.Critics
also hoped the government would prevent the funnelling of loans for
social programmes from the World Bank and Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund into what they said was a corrupt and inefficient
bureaucracy.They sought proper management of the financial sector
debt so repayment would not fall on taxpayers, and wanted the
government to open to public scrutiny the International Monetary
Fund's $17.2 billion bail-out programme for Thailand.The newspaper
said the government's defence was the relative stability of the
baht lately and that it had adhered strictly to the IMF's economic
reform programme. Inflation has been lower than expected with the
average for all of 1998 seen at around 10.5 percent from 11.6
percent projected earlier. Plans to issue $18 billion in global and
domestic bonds would help end severe domestic liquidity, it added.
	   The government also said it had begun reforming the Bank of
Thailand, blamed for the baht's fall by more than 50 percent after
it was floated last July.It said 50 billion baht in funds would be
spent on social programmes and a significant portion of defence and
security spending had been diverted to the farm sector.

Hamas: Sheik Yassin to return within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yassin comment &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder and
spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, will return to
Gaza within days, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas spokesman, told The Associated Press that
Yassin _ who has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim countries
raising millions of dollars and drumming up support for Hamas _
will ``most likely'' come back to Gaza on Saturday.
	   Israel's security establishment and political leaders have been
debating for weeks whether the sheik would pose a greater danger
from outside or inside Gaza. Israel, which controls Gaza's borders,
could keep Yassin out if it wished.
	   Meanwhile Israel barred the wife and children of another Hamas
official, Mousa Abu Marzouk, from entering the Gaza Strip from
Egypt Tuesday.
	   Abu Marzouk was released last summer from a U.S. jail and sent
to Jordan where he lives now, after promising not to get involved
in terrorism.
	   ``This morning, my brother's wife Nadia and her five children
were refused entry into Gaza by the Israeli border police, even
though they traveled on American passports'' Abu Marzouk's brother
Mahmoud said.
	   He said it was the first time Israel had ever refused her
permission to visit and that the family had asked the Palestinian
Authority to intervene on their behalf. Mrs. Abu Marzouk returned
to Cairo, her brother-in-law said.
	   Regarding Yassin's return to Gaza, Israeli leaders Tuesday
appeared to be leaning toward allowing him back, in part because
keeping him out could set off an explosion of violence by backers
of Hamas.
	   ``The choice is not between what is good and better, but between
what is bad and worse,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   Yassin was quoted by the Sudan News Agency in Khartoum where he
is visiting, as saying he would return.
	   ``I did not sneak out through a window and I am going back home
through the door sooner or later. i am going to live among my
people leading the jihad there,'' Yassin was quoted as saying.

	   JOHOR BARU, Sun.- The third Johor Umno Convention will be held
over two days from tomorrow in Sibu Island, off Mersing.
	   The convention, to be held at the Johor Corporation-owned Pulau
Sibu Island Resort, will be officially opened by deputy Umno
president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Some 350 delegates from the 20 Johor Umno divisions will attend
the convention which will have the theme `National Economic Agenda:
Reformation, Social Justice and Balanced Development'.
	   Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman, who is also Johor Umno
chief, will deliver a keynote address.
	   Meanwhile Anwar, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, in his
foreword in the convention souvenir magazine, stressed the need to
rid nepotism, corruption and crony capitalism in Umno based on its
founding principles and to strengthen the party.
	   He said Umno should not only continue to protect the interests
of the people, but also strive to achieve social justice.
	   Ghani, in his message, called for solid and responsible leaders
to bring the party to greater heights, adding they should be
sincere, fair and balanced for the benefit of the people.
	   He said Umno should also stress on spiritual and social
development and a strong family institution.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Even as Paris put on the most festive show it could
muster to welcome the world's soccer fans, Air France pilots
decided Tuesday to go ahead with a 9-day-old strike that's left a
threatening cloud over the World Cup.
	   Four unions representing the striking pilots met at Charles de
Gaulle airport for several hours Tuesday evening, and agreed to
continue their walkout.
	   One union, the SNPL-Air Inter, accused Air France management of
``an obvious desire to worsen the strike.'' It called the airline's
``passivity'' since negotiations broke down last Saturday
``stunning and scandalous.''
	   Some union members, meanwhile, said they expected the company's
board to meet in a special session Saturday to consider new
proposals, but management refused to confirm that date.
	   The pilots increasingly are being seen as spoilers of France's
effort to put its best face forward for the World Cup, the gigantic
international soccer fest that begins Wednesday.
	   As the pilots met Tuesday evening, acrobats, dancers, and four
jolly giants filled the capital's streets for a festive World Cup
kickoff. Fans were everywhere, many in kilts; thousands of Scots
have come for the opening game between Scotland and Brazil.
	   But many of the fans who've descended on the capital had to take
alternate means of transport when their Air France flights were
canceled.
	   Only one in four Air France planes was flying Tuesday, and other
carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it is bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) daily as a result of the Air
France strike.
	   Air France is the official carrier of the World Cup, and the
airline has arranged special flights to transport teams to their
destinations.
	   The French transport minister, meanwhile, urged pilots and
management to return to the negotiating table.
	   ``Each moment, each hour, each minute must be used for
discussion and for negotiation,'' Jean-Claude Gayssot told the
French parliament. ``Finding a solution to the conflict is
essential,'' Gayssot said.
	   The pilots are protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million)
in salary cuts. Air France says the cuts are needed to modernize
the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported
profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   The airline has offered to compensate the pilots by giving them
stock in exchange for the pay cuts.
	   Meanwhile, bus and subway service was reduced in Lyon, a World
Cup venue, on Tuesday following a drivers' strike there.
	   Another World Cup venue, Bordeaux, may also be hit with a
walkout by bus drivers on Thursday.

Wiesenthal Center: extreme right `saturated' WWII Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BALZ BRUPPACHER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Pro-Nazi and other extreme right-wing
groups ``saturated'' neutral Switzerland while Adolf Hitler ruled
neighboring Germany, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
	   A copy of a center report to be released Wednesday in New York
was obtained by The Associated Press in Switzerland.
	   ``The extraordinary variety and number of associations and
societies in Switzerland representing the extreme-right _
patriotic, fascist or both _ during the Hitlerian era is most
striking,'' said the 128-page study by the Los Angeles-based
center.
	   He said there were ``well in excess of three dozen'' such groups
and that some ``had cells or chapters in more than 160 cities,
towns and villages.''
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti reacted heatedly. ``These
representations are untenable and perfidious,'' he said.
	   A Swiss government statement conceded the presence of ``a
variety of small rightist radical groups of all shades,'' but said
they ``never totaled more than 1.5 percent of the voters'' and were
already seriously depleted by the time World War II began in 1939.
	   ``Probably no other country in the whole of Europe was so
thoroughly infested with similar groups in proportion to its
population and geographical area,'' said the report.
	   It was written by Alan Morris Schom, an American specialist in
French history.
	   Last January the center, named after the famed Nazi hunter,
released another report by Schom accusing the Swiss of running
camps where Jewish refugees were used as slave labor and told they
would be handed over to Germany's Gestapo if they complained.
	   Switzerland conceded that some camp commanders had treated
refugees badly, but prominent Swiss Jews and a number of Jews who
lived in the camps said that by and large the country was a safe
haven for many on a hostile continent.
	   The latest Wiesenthal report said the right-wing groups had tens
of thousands of members, most of them working or lower-middle
class.
	   ``These groups thoroughly saturated every one of the country's
21 cantons and the core of Swiss society,'' said Schom.
	   One organization, the Swiss Fatherland Association, ``was
comprised largely of the ruling elite of Switzerland, notably the
officer corps and the political, financial and industrial leaders
of the country.''
	   He described the association as a semi-secret club that pushed
for government discrimination against Jewish refugees and backed
the requirement implemented by the government that the Swiss Jewish
community pay for the care of Jewish refugees, the report said.
	   It said the anti-Jewish sentiment grew out of centuries of
anti-Semitism, including the teachings of Protestant Reformation
leaders Jean Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther.
	   Rolf Bloch, head of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew
Congregations, said he thought Schom had overstated the influence
of the association.
	   Bloch said Switzerland's treatment of some Jewish refugees was
``a dark chapter'' in its history, but that the report appeared
``one-sided and exaggerated.''
	   A U.S. government report on World War II issued last week said
Switzerland had a ``mixed record on refugees,'' including its
request to Germany to mark Jewish passports with a ``J'' _ ``which
helped officials turn back thousands.''
	   But, said the report by Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat, the record ``also included admission of over 50,000
refugees from 1933 until the end of the War, of whom some 30,000
remained and survived in Switzerland during the War.''
	   Eizenstat noted that a Swiss diplomat in Hungary, Vice Consul
Carl Lutz, ``acted on his own initiative to provide letters of
protection that saved the lives of 62,000 Jews and other targets of
Nazi persecution.''
	   Thomas Borer, who heads the Swiss government's task force
reexamining the country's past, said of the report, ``It is so
absurd and wrong.''
	   ``No serious historian will dispute the fact that the great
majority of the Swiss were outspoken democrats and antifascists,''
he said.
	   He quoted Eizenstat as saying, ``The Swiss people were
overwhelmingly sympathetic to the Allies.''

	   The elaborately prepared long march by the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party and its allies materialises today. The programme
is organised to oppose the enactment of laws making provision for a
Regional Council and Hill District Council in line with the
Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord. Under the two-day programme
BNP chairperson and Leader of the Opposition Begum Khaleda Zia will
lead the march (automobile procession) from the capital to
Chittagong while the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Professor
Badruddoza Chowdhury will lead the procession from Chittagong to
Khagrachhari.Long march is just another way of staging protest,
though it is an extraordinary way.
	   If it is peaceful and ends peacefully one can find nothing wrong
with it but apprehensions of violence are based on the fact that a
programme like this one has the spirit of mobilisation with the
consequent overheated tempers and frayed nerves. The fears were
somewhat allayed by government announcement that the long march
will not be resisted. The Opposition has also said the long march
will be peaceful but warned of serious consequences if the march is
obstructed. The ruling Awami League is organising peace rallies
during the two days. When both sides make loud protestations of
peace, there should be no cause for anxiety.
	   However, when the mood is one of confrontation and bellicosity,
perception of behavioural line dividing peace from violence is apt
to be blurred. Such a mammoth programme has to rely on
wide-stretched logistics and enlistment with referral links and
activated network over a wide geographical area which as a whole
will remain vulnerable to any provocation. Therefore the whole
nation will have to remain vigilant against any disruption of the
peace. Some irresponsible quarters have given a call for joining
the long march with licensed arms, and we hope the leadership among
organisers of the long march will lose no time to restrain them.
Police have also said that participation in political programme
even with licensed arms is an offence under law. Sabre-rattling and
language of weapons must be discarded at all cost.

Sudan claims it recaptured garrison town in east
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese army recaptured a garrison
town in eastern Sudan in fierce fighting that displaced thousands
of people, a government newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said last week that it
had captured Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Khartoum,
after a daylong battle in a region that borders Ethiopia.
	   The town is considered strategic because it is located near the
Roseires Dam, which provides 80 percent of Khartoum's electricity.
	   Government troops retook the town, but clashes continued in the
area, the daily Al-Anba newspaper reported. It did not say when the
town fell, and there was no immediate rebel comment.
	   The fighting forced thousands of families to flee, it said.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
from the Muslim-dominated government for the mainly Christian and
animist south. More than 1.3 million Sudanese have died in the war
and famines caused by the fighting.

	   When you next look at the Manila skyline and see all the
high-rise buildings which are under construction, you may well ask
yourself two questions: 1) ``Who will be able to occupy all this
space?'' and; 2) ``Who will pay the bill for this creation of
excess capacity?''
	   Only God knows the answer to the first question and He is not
telling! The horrible truth about the second question is that you
and I will have to pay for all this folly through an accelerated
loss of the purchasing value of our currency.
	   The developers deserve to go into bankruptcy and many of them
probably will, but that does nothing to help pay for the wastage of
resources which they have inflicted on the community.
	   The real cost of all this excess capacity will ultimately have
to be born by every member of our community. We will be made to pay
for this by the simple means of a loss in the purchasing power of
our money, which includes but is not limited to, a decline in the
rate of exchange between our currency and the currencies of other
nations which are less guilty of such wastage of resources.
	   We may well ask if there was ever any attempt by those elected
to be entrusted with the management of our economy to see any
relation between the granting of building permits with any sort of
plan of future needs.
	   Even the least educated housewife is aware of the need to
allocate her financial resources to the actual needs of her family,
but this simple logic appears to be a non-existent within the
realms of government and its huge bureaucratic empire of
certificate and license producers.
	   What is the purpose of requiring a building permit if there is
not going to be some effort to allocate resources to foreseeable
needs?
	   We already have far too much traffic on our roads, but can you
imagine the horrible traffic jams which will develop if ever all
these high-rise buildings are eventually completed and occupied! It
is very difficult to determine that there has been any serious
attempt to allocate the use of land to the available resources of
transportation, wour forests to
the point of extinction, and now we are permitting the equally
senseless construction of bunches of high-rise buildings with
little regard for the services which they require. These are such
things as transportation, water supply, power supply, fire-fighting
capabilities or anything else.
	   Who wants to work in a 31st-floor office in an earthquake or,
for that matter, during a strong typhoon?
	   I don't know about you but I find myself suffering from vertigo
when I look out of the window of my ninth floor office, and I
positively dread the prospects of having to move to a 26th-floor
office as do most of the other people in our office. But I am not
aware of any attempt to measure the general public's attitude to
either living in or working in a high-rise building. No doubt we
shall hear more about that after the next strong earthquake, or
when someone is careless enough to leave a window open during a
typhoon! Imagine being on the 25th floor when a major fire breaks
out on the 15th floor. One day something like that will happen!

	   MULTIMEDIA Development Corporation Sdn Bhd (MDC), the one-stop
agency for the Multimedia Super Corridor project, plans to create
an ``MSC virtual degree'' that will allow students to study various
components of a degree via the electronic media.
	   Its executive chairman Tan Sri Dr Othman Yeop Abdullah said the
effort will go a long way towards creating a Web of potential
knowledge workers spanning the globe.
	   ``We hope that many of these knowledge workers will eventually
make their homes in the MSC,'' he said at a briefing last week.
	   According to Othman, the initiative is part of the Government's
long- term plan to create an adequate skilled workforce for the MSC
which requires about 17,000 knowledge workers over the next five
years.
	   He said besides giving MSC-status companies the flexibility to
recruit knowledge workers from abroad, the Government also aims to
develop local skills for the MSC.
	   Towards this end, Othman said the group enrolment ratio in
tertiary educational institutions would be raised from the current
13 per cent to 20 per cent by the year 2000.
	   ``The higher educational policy has been adjusted to encourage
the growth of private education, and we will see the total number
of universities doubling by the year 2000 with new private
universities set up,'' he said, adding that the Government has
extended benefits under the MSC Bill of Guarantees to qualifying
institutions of higher education.

	   The Third National Vitamin A Week began nation-wide last Sunday
to educate guardians about the hazards children face if there is a
Vitamin A deficiency. Lack of this vitamin is responsible for night
blindness. In 1981-82, a country-wide study found night blindness
was prevalent among nearly 3.76 per cent of the total population.
Efforts to improve the imbalance has brought down the incidence of
this eye deficiency to less than one per cent, according to a
number of recent surveys.
	   There is no need to be complacent, however, and this week's
programme highlights that disseminating knowledge of this vitamin's
curative ability especially among the landless poor is essential
for removing the blight of night blindness. Radio has been one of
the most successful means of mass communication in our country. And
NGOs have reached where even the radio is not a constant feature in
the recreational sphere of rural life This is a curable condition,
however. Vitamin A pills or natural food which is rich in that
vitamin can restore normal vision. Among the various dietary
procedures recommended, one is the intake of little Mola fish to
correct the deficiency.
	   Another source is Spirulina, which is a health food.Green
vegetables and green fruits are yet other sources of the vitamin.
There are many plots, small and of veritable minuscule size, which
may be utilised by urban dwellers, even in the capital city for
growing fresh vegetables. In fact, the fear of disproportionate use
of both artificial fertilisers and pesticides by vegetable farmers
has led a number of city dwellers to opt for home-grown fresh
vegetables according to the season.As green vegetables, fruits,
Mola fish and other sources of Vitamin A are available, children
can be fortified against night blindness from the very beginning of
their life. Breast-feeding can also prevent Vitamin A deficiencies.

	   The International Shipping Federation (ISF), the international
employers' organization for shipowners, has opposed the plan of the
International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) to raise the
benchmark pay for able seaman to $1,400.
	   The ITF Council instead reiterated its hardline position that
salary rates should relate to the seafarers' home country and that
the ITF-dictated international wage scales were unacceptable.
	   The current benchmark of $1,200 took effect only last January
this year.
	   The rapid increase in officers' salaries and the continuing
shortage of qualified crews had been major topics during the ISF's
annual meeting held in London last April.
	   ``Pay rates of officers from India, the Philippines and Poland
are catching up with Western pay rates,'' IFS President Juan Kelly
noted. He said the question now is ``where the next generation of
senior officers and shore-based technical managers would be coming
from.''
	   According to Filipino seafarers, some manning agents offer the
higher ITF rates, while others offer Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) rates which are much lower.
	   The ISF meeting also focused on new regulations concerning hours
of work.
	   There is still a lot of uncertainty about the subject because of
the discrepancies between the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) requirements now in place and the new International Labor
Organization (ILO) Convention No. 180 which allow various
exceptions to the exact work hour limits.
	   Kelly said: ``It is unclear how port state control inspectors
will establish the actual work or rest regimes applied on
particular ships. Much will depend on the outcome of discussions
taking place in the European Union (EU) which intends to
incorporate the ILO standards into EU law and apply them to non-EU
flag ships visiting EU ports.
	   The ISF is a maritime organization concerned with labor affairs
and manning and training issues at the international level. Its
membership comprises national shipowners' associations from 30
countries representing more than half the world's merchant tonnage.

	   A simmering border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, whose
veterans fought together to bring down the former military dictator
in Addis Ababa, Mengitsu Haile Mariam in 1991, has escalated into
bloody war on three fronts along their 1000 kilometre frontiers and
air-raids that have taken civilian tolls. After thirty-one years of
guerilla war, Eritrea was allowed by Mengitsu's successor
government in Addis Ababa to secede from Ethiopia by a referendum
in 1993.
	   Peaceful talks have been going on all these years about a 400
sq. km. of disputed border territory, which was included in Eritrea
in the maps of colonial administration under Italy, but merged with
Tigre province of Ethiopia under post-colonial administration of
Haile Selassie.As a border war broke out last month, Eritrean
forces repulsed an Ethiopian attack by a counter-attack that pushed
at least 10 kilometres into Ethiopian territory at Zala Ambessa
before declaring the operation nearly over and ``it could be time
to leave.
	   `` Then on Friday last Ethiopia sent four of its warplanes to
bomb the airport of Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, hitting both
civilian and military parts of the complex. One Ethiopian plane was
downed and the pilot captured. A Zambian cargo plane parked on the
ground was damaged. Ethiopia claimed heavy damage has been
inflicted on two planes and infrastructure of the Asmara military
base, and the raid was in retaliation of Eritrean air-attack on
Mekele airport (and a school) in the Tigre state of Ethiopia. The
air-raids took place after diplomats from United States and Rwanda
left Asmara the same day for Burkina Faso to report on the crisis
to a summit meeting of the Organisation of African Unity countries,
and obtain support for their five-point peace plan requiring
demilitarisation of the disputed territory and a third party
observer force pending negotiations.
	   Ethiopia had accepted the plan. Eritrea had declared acceptance
in principle saying ``there are still serious issues of detail and
implementation that need to be worked out.''The USA protested that
the attack on Asmara airport endangered foreign nationals trying to
flee the unsafe capital. The OAU meeting had a stormy session
finding it difficult to reach consensus, but called on both the
belligerents to cooperate with the facilitators, namely, USA and
Rwanda. The UN Security Council has called for ``an immediate
ceasefire,'' which hopefully the parties will honour.

	   Department of Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello III yesterday
said the DOJ was confident the high court would accept government's
appeal to withdraw the petition filed by ousted Solicitor General
Romeo de la Cruz before the Supreme Court seeking the acquittal of
former first lady Imelda Marcos in a graft charge against her.

the place of De la Cruz, said the DOJ has filed a petition seeking
to quash the ex-solicitor general's appeal.
	   ``Under the rules, we can still withdraw....as any litigant can
always withdraw pleadings,'' said Bello, who added that one of
DOJ's main arguments was De la Cruz's petition was not consistent
with government's ''institutional policy'' on the case.
	   Bello, who is set to step down from office at the end of Ramos'
term on June 30, is not discounting the possibility of seeing
Marcos' lawyers oppose the solicitor general's move to have the
petition withdrawn.
	   ``Anything is possible,'' he noted.
	   Earlier, De la Cruz stood pat on his decision to seek the
acquittal of the former first lady on a graft case.
	   He also remained confident that the Supreme Court would sustain
his plea.
	   ''Since when are cases decided by state policies?'' he asked.
	   Cases, he continued, should be decided on the basis of evidence,
laws and applicable decisions.
	   He added that it was government's option to withdraw his
petition.
	   Civil rights group Philippine Constitutional Association
yesterday criticized Ramos' move to accept the courtesy resignation
of De la Cruz for ''taking Marcos' side in a pending case.''

	   KEPALA BATAS, Sun. - Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said although Asean countries might take different
approaches in tackling their economic problems, all member
countries were still working closely in many areas including trade.
	   ``Unlike our country, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines
are getting assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Our approach may be different, but we continue to enjoy a
close relationship,'' Abdullah said today after closing a
traditional cooking and kuih-making contest organised by Kepala
Batas Wanita Umno.
	   Abdullah, who is MP for Kepala Batas, was asked if some Asean
countries affected by the regional financial crisis had diverged in
dealing with domestic problems.
	   ``We are not going about it separately. Malaysia, on its part,
has already given RM250 million in financial aid to Indonesia, and
all Asean members have agreed to carry out trading among themselves
using their respective currencies.''
	   Asked about Cambodia's entry into Asean, he said the matter
would be decided after the country held its general election next
month.
	   ``I foresee no problems. I hope the political situation would
enable the country to carry out its elections smoothly.''
	   He said Malaysia would send eight observers to the elections
which would be held on July 26.

World Cup: Italian striker is sick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with spokesman saying results ``not serious''; status
to be determined tomorrow &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, suffering from
fever and cough, was taken to a hospital for X-rays Tuesday and
could be dropped from Italy's World Cup team.
	   The 29-year-old Olympique Marseille forward was examined at a
nearby hospital in Creil. Italian federation spokesman Stefano
Balducci said results ``were not serious.'' While not elaborating,
Balducci suggested the X-rays were intended to check for pneumonia.
	   Balducci said Ravanelli's fever and cough persisted, and that
the player was under treatment of antibiotics.
	   Italian officials said a final decision about Ravanelli's status
would be taken by coach Cesare Maldini early Wednesday shortly
before the team's departure for Bordeaux, where Italy plays Chile
in a Group B match on Thursday.
	   Ravanelli's sudden illness could lead to the inclusion of Parma
forward Enrico Chiesa, who has been in camp as a 23rd player.
	   World Cup teams can report to FIFA the replacement of a sick or
injured player up to 1530 GMT Wednesday _ the kickoff time of the
World Cup inaugural match between Brazil and Scotland.
	   Ravanelli's illness was the last bout of misfortune to hit the
Italian team.
	   Forward Alessandro Del Piero has just recovered from a right
thigh strain and is out of the Chile match.
	   Defender Moreno Torricelli bruised his right foot in training 10
days ago and resumed practicing only Tuesday.
	   Chiesa had been put on alert as a substitute for Del Piero first
and then Torricelli. Now he had a third chance to stay with the
team.

Events in Kosovo unfolding faster than NATO can plan

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with U.S. and Britain planning

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Military events in Kosovo are unfolding
almost faster than NATO military planners can plan.
	   Just a few days ago, the generals were focusing on military
exercises and dispatching troops to help Albania and Macedonia deal
with refugees and patrol borders. Now, as one senior NATO official
put it Tuesday, ``We are contemplating more challenging options,
which could include intervention.''
	   More than 250 people have died in Kosovo since Mar. 1 in
escalating clashes between government forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army, armed wing of the Albanian independence movement.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population, are demanding independence from Serbia, the larger of
the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and its allies support autonomy for Kosovo but
oppose the rebels' demands for independence and condemn violence on
both sides.
	   In recent days entire villages in Kosovo have been flattened and
thousands of people driven from their homes, making the need for
action more urgent if the crisis is not to erupt into a wider
Balkan war.
	   Twelve days ago, NATO foreign ministers agreed to enhance
military exercises in Albania and Macedonia as a way of increasing
the military presence there. A NATO assessment team is still the
region looking at future options. But as a senior NATO official
said, speaking anonymously: ``With the events of the last week,
shoring up the periphery seems of secondary value.''
	   NATO defense ministers meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday for
discussions certain to be dominated by Kosovo. It is expected they
will order the military to start looking at direct intervention in
Kosovo.
	   The United States and Britain plan to ask the U.N. Security
Council, possibly next week, to approve the use of force against
the Serbs to halt attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Americans were also willing to make a direct appeal to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin if they encounter resistance from the
Russian foreign ministry.
	   The Russians oppose NATO troops in the area but have indicated
that they might support a more robust U.N. role. That would require
approval by the 15-member Security Council, where Russia has a
permanent seat and veto power.

	   Long march is attributed to the historic march staged by the
great leader and founder of modern China, Chairman Mao, which
continued for decades and traversed thousand of miles of territory.
The purpose was to gain control of territories, consolidate popular
support for the struggle for freedom from feudal and autocratic
rulers and to establish people's rule in China. In our national
context, the term long march was used for the one which, in 1976,
under the leadership of the highly respected octogenarian national
leader Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, went upto the
India-Bangladesh borders at Kanshat near Farakka. It was aimed to
demonstrate the anguish and helplessness of the people of
Bangladesh consequent upon the construction and commissioning of
the Farakka barrage by India on the Ganges, and was purported to
mark as a vehement protest against India's actions.
	   The purpose and rationale of the so-called long march being
staged by the BNP on the 9th and 10th of this month is more akin to
that of Bhashani than of Mao Ze Dong. It is scheduled to start from
Dhaka today, on the 9th, and will go to Chittagong. After
nightfall, it will continue tomorrow morning, on the 10th, and end
its journey in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. People from different
parts of the country will join on the way at different parts of the
rally. The principal objectives are two-fold. Firstly, it would
represent a strong and unequivocal protest against the Chittagong
Hill Tracts Accord and the passing of the 4 acts in Parliament that
are necessary to implement the Accord. Secondly, this would allow
people from different walks of life and regions of the country to
demonstrate their solidarity with the cause through participation
in or support for the march.
	   Finally, this will help provide an awareness in the minds of
many other people of the great harm that would result through
implementation of the accord and its enabling acts.The BNP
forcefully claims that they were not consulted in the conclusion of
the Accord and were not allowed to speak on the relevant bills. The
ruling party stated that in the negotiating team two BNP members
had been incorporated but they did not participate. The BNP
retorted that the two members were taken arbitrarily without
consultation with the Party and could not be accepted as its
representatives. For this purpose the Awami League refused to
formally approach the BNP, which in turn did not suggest any names
on its own.The BNP, on the other hand, pointed out that out of the
9 members of their National Committee, 4 were taken from the
opposition. There was absolute transparency, openness and trust
among political parties in the matter of negotiations during the
BNP time which held three times more sessions with the PCJSS than
during the Awami League rule. But the BNP refused to concede
grounds that harmed national interests and refused to sign an
agreement merely for the sake of signing one.
	   The Awami League acted in haste and signed an accord at any cost
and, in the process, sacrificed vital national interests.National
interests have been curbed in many ways, according to BNP
advocates. The constitution of the newly constituted CHT Parishad
vested with extraordinary authority and marked by undemocratic
composition is not in conformity with the Constitution of the land.
The provision of the Parishad to send a legislative bill back to
Parliament for reconsideration itself impinges on the sovereignty
of Parliament itself. The accord was concluded with the
representatives of the Chakma tribe, which constitutes only 28 per
cent of the CHT population. The Bengali community, which is
composed of 48 per cent of the entire population as well as the 13
other tribes were neither represented at the negotiations nor were
consulted. This is unfair, discriminatory and, therefore, highly
undemocratic.
	   That too is for 0.6 per cent of people for 10 per cent of the
entire land of the nation.Again, it is absurd to assume that we, as
a sovereign nation, have to withdraw our troops, Ansars and even
ill-armed or unarmed village defence corps into far-away
cantonments and towns, leaving the entire countryside vulnerable at
the mercy of local authorities and law enforcing agencies. It is
also interesting to note that the Parishad is empowered to recruit
police and officers, with obligatory preference from among the
tribals many of whom might have been former insurgents. The entire
region being an impassable terrain is likely to go out of the
effective control of the government. If the country adjacent to the
CHT being the traditional patron saint of the tribal insurgents
turns real hostile, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
nation would be in jeopardy. This would be a matter of the deepest
concern for every patriotic Bangladeshi. All arms, specially the
sophisticated arms, have not been deposited, nor the entire armed
cadre of the PCJSS or Shanti Bahini surrendered themselves.
	   This would pose a dangerous situation and portends ill omen for
the future. It also sounds ridiculous to accept that any tribal can
buy any amount of land anywhere in Bangladesh, but no Bangladeshi
can buy a piece of land in the CHT nor a Bangladeshi can ever be
Chairman of the Parishad. The provision of payment of royalty on
the mineral and natural resources of the CHT to the people in the
region, is discriminatory. It is not illogical to assume that this
and the many other undue concessions granted under the Accord would
only encourage similar demands form other tribal and different
sections of population in Bangladesh.People have often asked if the
accord and the acts are Constitutional, if so, why does not the BNP
send the case to the Supreme Court for consideration and decision.
The answer is that whenever a grave doubt is expressed in many
quarters, it devolves upon the government to seek advisory opinion
of the Supreme Court, lest the Act gets scrapped and this does not
speak well of the government. The country's President has a role to
play in this regard. Such advice has not been sought by the
government.
	   Yet, there is time for some-one to challenge these Acts in the
Supreme Court. Moreover, the issue is fraught with great political
import and should preferably be settled as such.Some people also
ask, and legitimately they do, as to why then this accord got
almost universal acclaim from the international community. The
answer is not difficult to trace. They view that insurgency in the
Chittagong Hill Tracts has cost Bangladesh enormously in terms of
human and material resources over a quarter of century and that any
agreement that pledges restoration of peace would be normally
welcomed by them. The international community, on the other hand,
does not generally possess the requisite information some of which
have been outlined above. As the CHT Accord and the Acts do not
safeguard national interests and even the interests of the majority
of the people in that area who feel discriminated against, it
cannot bring about lasting peace.
	   And, if there is no lasting peace, there could be no final or
decisive settlement.Evidently, many of these points and even more
have been stated by different quarters. Why then the BNP decided to
hold the extraordinary measure of a Long March? It is primarily
because the ruling party quashed a series of BNP demands at every
stage and steamrolled the agreement and the legislation without
allowing others to be heard formally on this vitally important
national issue. BNP demanded that the principal provisions of the
accord be circulated before signing in order to elicit public and
political opinion. This demand was not accepted. Secondly, the BNP
Chairperson led a march of a hundred legislators to the President
to seek his good offices to arrange a dialogue with the ruling
party. The Prime Minister vetoed the move and asked the Opposition
to return to Parliament to hold discussions on the subject.
Accordingly, the Opposition, which so long abstained from sessions
in Parliament for alleged violation by the ruling party of a
previous accord with the opposition party, returned to Parliament
and demanded a general discussion on the Accord.
	   This was also denied by the Speaker, obviously at the behest of
the government.It was then suggested that the discussion would take
place at the time of introduction of the 4 bills relevant to the
Accord. Then, the two BNP members of the parliamentary committee
were not allowed to give their right to dissent on the bills or to
register objections. These were denied on technical grounds of
having been received late, though the Speaker had the discretion to
accommodate. For some strange and inexplicable reasons, the BNP
members had received copies of the bills late.Then came the crux of
the problem. To emphasise paramount importance of the issue, the
Opposition legislators proposed an unprecedented, though an
unreasonable number, several thousand amendments to the 4 bills,
and evidently wanted to speak on them. The Speaker ruled that it
would take several years for holding proper discussions on these
amendments which, by any calculation, is incorrect. He allowed the
Opposition the ridiculous time of a total of only 11 minutes to
speak on these bills.
	   BNP members were allotted only 8 minutes for 8 of its members.
It was estimated that if all the Opposition members were allowed 10
minutes each, it would not have taken more than 3 days to hold a
respectable debate on these bills. But the government retracted its
promises at every stage to the Opposition to allow it to speak.The
very decision of the government to deny the Opposition to talk on
this issue in Parliament prompted the Opposition, the seven party
alliance, to resort to other peaceful means of protests. These
included demonstrations, street rallies, public meetings, hartals
and even fasting. The Long March is being organised as another
means to register public protest. It has been repeatedly stated
that it is a peaceful march and the government should be prudent
enough not to obstruct it, for the sake of avoiding possible
violence and in the greater interest of the nation.Views expressed
in the article are the writer's own. The writer is a member of
Advisory Council, BNP.

	   Everyone seems to have his or her own idea about what
``Generation X'' means.
	   Is it: A) the name of the so-so punk band Billy Idol led over a
decade and a half go?
	   B) the title of the 1991 ``groundbreaking'' novel by Douglas
Coupland?
	   C) the title of the exploitative Marvel comic book series?
	   D) the buzzword of the decade (after ``information
superhighway'') misused to describe anyone between 20 and 29 years
old?
	   The answer is, of course, all of the above, but the definition
we're most concerned with here is ``D''. In the '90s, ``Generation
X'' is a fashionable synonym for twentysomethings like ``baby
boomers'' was for thirtysomethings in the '80s. The problem is
``Gen X'' also comes with plenty of connotational baggage, giving
rise to conflicting interpretations and semantic confusion.
	   Some have taken Generation X to mean the ``jilted generation''
(from the 1995 Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation) --
``jilted'' in the economic sense. If it were as simple as that,
this article would end right here, right now -- but it isn't and
this article doesn't.
	   For a crash course on popular Gen X mythos, rent the Winona
Ryder-Ethan Hawke flick Reality Bites and overdose on all the
color-by-numbers Gen X cliches. He's a slacker! She's an aspiring
filmmaker! He's gay! Their parents are divorced! They're dancing to
``My Sharona''! By the time of its release in 1994, the movie's
stereotypical Gen X characters were just that -- stereotypes.
	   According to Generation Ecch!, the definitive 1994 satirical
tome on the Gen X phenom by Jason Cohen and Michael Krugman, it all
started with a 1990 Time cover story that christened the
post-boomer generation the ``twentysomething'' generation, an echo
of thirtysomething, that dreary TV show about angst-ridden boomers
who dressed incredibly well.
	   ``Baby buster'' was the catchphrase for a while, as was ``13th
generation,''
	   before stumbling out of vogue and allowing ``Generation X'' to
seize the buzzword throne. If ``Gen X'' is the king of buzzwords,
then ``slacker'' is prince, bestowed staying power by Richard
Linklater's 1991 cult hit film of that name.
	   To further complicate matters, according to 13th Gen: Abort,
Retry, Ignore, Fail, the definitive 1993 non-satirical tome on the
Gen X phenom by Neil Howe and Bill Strauss, Gen X is a mere subset
of the ``13ers'', the authors' own coinage. The number comes from
Howe and Strauss' thesis that ``Counting back to the peers of
Benjamin Franklin, this generation is the 13th to know the American
nation, flag, and Constitution.'' If you're born between 1961 and
1981, you're a 13er, say the authors. Note, however, that by their
definition, 13ers -- and by implication, Gen Xers -- are inherently
American.
	   But thanks to the global hegemony of American media and popular
culture, certain Gen X affectations engendered by America's
particular socioscape have also taken root abroad, infecting the
youths as distant and discrete as those in Singapore.
	   Some quirks travel better than others. Sexual paranoia,
political correctness, and the trauma of having to live with your
parents even though you're over 18 remain exotic notions on our
happy, shiny island republic.
	   Other American Gen X idiosyncrasies take on peculiar mutations.
For instance: In America, you're pessimistic about your financial
future because you're stuck at a minimum-wage, dead-end job. In
Singapore, you're pessimistic about your financial future because
you haven't made your first million by the time you're 25. Life's a
bitch.
	   The nexus that unites so-called Gen Xers around the world (apart
from being born around the same time) is their common pop cultural
experience. A stoner in Austin, Texas, and a yuppie in Zouk,
Singapore, may come from different political processes, different
educational systems, different social frameworks, different ethnic
upbringing, different economic class, different climate zones; yet
put the two together and they'll probably bond over an intense
discussion whether Madonna is a slut.
	   But don't let the label define the generation. Let the
generation define itself. -- Excerpted from Internet article by
S.M. Ong of Singapore

	   KOTA BARU, Sun. - Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk
Mustapa Mohamed has called on former students of Sultan Ismail
College to contribute to the Datuk Johan Ariff education fund.
	   He said the fund, incepted early this year to provide financial
aid to deserving students studying at the school, only managed to
collect RM13,200.
	   ``I am not satisfied with the amount collected so far as the
number of former students is large,'' he said at the scholarship
presentation at the school recently.
	   The fund is in recognition of the late Ray Hall, the school's
former English teacher who contributed significantly to the
development of education particularly in the improvement of the
English language among Kelantan students.
	   Hall, an Irishman who embraced Islam and took the name Johan
Ariff, had played a tremendous role in spuring the college students
to achieve academic excellence during his 15-year teaching career
at the school.
	   Mustapa, who studied under Johan Ariff between 1968 and 1969,
said the fund sponsorship committee had been formed to organise
events to raise more money for the fund.
	   ``We intend to award the scholarship to four deserving students
each year,'' said Mustapa, who is also the committee chairman.
	   Mohd Azmi Ariffin and Nik Suzairin Nik Zahib, both Form Four
students, received the scholarship from Mustapa at the ceremony.

	   The United States has offered to extend only half of the $50
million garments quota to local garments manufacturers in 1998.
	   The additional quota was part of the settlement with the US
whose earlier decision to change its rules of origin (ROO) left
local garments manufacturers with heavy losses.
	   US offered only 5% increase in quota instead of 10% given in
1997, triggering protests from local garments manufacturers.
	   ``We cannot settle for that.....we lost that market forever. We
have to have a continuity of that (additional quota),'' said Donald
Dee, president of the Confederation of Garments Exporters of the
Philippines.
	   The United States will be taking back the additional quota in
categories 338, 339, 638, 639, 347, 348, and 847. These categories
include jeans, pants and T-shirts.
	   Philippine garments officials are expected to take the case to
the dispute settlement body of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
	   The row over the ROO started in 1996. US government offered to
settle by giving the Philippines an additional 15% quota in wool
items.
	   The agreement was contained in a memorandum of understanding
signed in 1997.
	   US wanted to take back the additional quota, convinced that
Philippine manufacturers have already adjusted to the changes in
the ROO, The changes made in the ROO were said to have displaced 50
medium-sized enterprises in the country.

	   KUANTAN, Sun. - The Public Service Department is taking
bankruptcy action against 89 students, whom it sponsored, for
breaking the terms of their contract, Deputy Minister in the Prime
Minister's Department Datuk Fauzi Abdul Rahman said today.
	   He said the bankruptcy action was the last resort as they had
repeatedly ignored warnings.
	   Fauzi said PSD-sponsored students not undertaking professional
courses were required to work in the public sector for two to five
years. It would be four to 10 years for those taking professional
courses.
	   In default, PSD had to be paid between RM35,000 and RM90,000 for
those who studied in a local university, and RM67,000 to RM160,000
for students who went abroad.
	   Overall, action has been taken against 1,500 PSD scholarship
holders.
	   Fauzi was speaking to reporters after officiating at the
district Hawkers Day.

	   Bangladesh - a country of more than 120 million, does not have
much resources. Agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy and
contributes a major share to the country's GDP. The population
growth has put tremendous pressure on limited land. So it is
imperative to diversify the country's economy to avoid depending
wholly on agriculture. Jute, known as the country's golden fibre,
is facing stiff competition from the synthetics. The country's
fairly successful ready-made garments' (RMG) industry, that is yet
to build up the necessary backward linkages, would be faced with a
more severe and ruthless competition in the global market as the
new World Trade Organisation(WTO) regime comes into effect, and the
quotas and other preferential systems are done away with. But every
cloud has also its silver linings.
	   Under the earth and off-shore water in the Bay of Bengal, there
is a hidden resource - natural gas, that augurs well for the
resource-hungry nation struggling to cope with overriding poverty
and aspiring for a steady economic development. Indeed, there could
not be any other resource other than oil and gas which could
quickly energise the economy of any nation. Gas is a basic and
versatile energy, it could be used to produce electricity at a
cheaper cost which is a vital factor in industrial production. In
recent years, gas has emerged as the most precious vis-a-vis all
fossil fuels, because of its comparative cleanliness in terms of
toxic emissions. That is probably why it has become the present day
craze for the world's giant hydrocarbon prospectors. Currently,
Bangladesh economy is heavily dependent on its indigenous natural
gas. Today, as much as 72 per cent of the commercial energy
consumption is derived from natural gas. This a positive
development, but without sustained effort to replenish the national
natural gas consumption and reserves, future development in the
sector may suffer stagnation, with wide national implications.
	   At present the national demand for natural gas is about 900
million cft. per day, when the system can supply about 800 MCFD.
According to present projections, demand for natural gas will
increase to about 1225 MCFD in the year 2000, with a supply gap of
about 225 MCFD . The estimated demand-supply gap by the year 2005,
2010 and 2015 are expected to be in the order of 600 MCFD, 1300
MCFD and 2300 MCFD respectively. This indicates the magnitude of
activities required in the sector from upstream exploration to
downstream transmission and conversion to power and other
products.At present, the country has 20 discovered gas fields ,with
total in place gas reserve of around 23 trillion cubic feet, of
which around 13 TCF gas, leaving a net recoverable reserve of about
10 TCF, may sustain the system at current level of consumption till
the year 2015.
	   National gas production has seen an increase from 83 billion CFT
in 1983-84 to about 265 BCF in 1996-97, indicating sharp increase
in consumption. In this perspective, there is no alternative other
than expanding the exploration activities to discover new reserves
of gas and to confirm additional reserves in the discovered fields.
Oil and gas exploration is a capital intensive venture, and risk
capital is now unavoidable mode of investment in the sector. For a
country like Bangladesh with a limited public sector resources such
investment is best bypassed and some effective alternative found.
Bangladesh is following the trend of inviting international risk
capital in the sector through production-sharing contracts. So far,
the response we have received is more than encouraging. To expedite
exploration activities through systematic geological evaluation,
seismic surveys and drilling operations both in known and frontier
areas and to make the environment here investor-friendly,
Bangladesh introduced a new Petroleum Policy in 1993.
	   This policy provided facilities for the international investors
to explore hydrocarbons under competitive terms. To facilitate the
promotional efforts simultaneously with the new policy introduced,
Petrobangla completed compilation of all exploration data available
upto 1992 that relate to occurrence of petroleum in Bangladesh. The
entire Bangladesh territory has been divided into 23 exploration
blocks and offered for PSC. By 1995, 8 such blocks were taken up by
4 companies since then, the PSC terms and conditions were further
liberalised and promotional seminars were held at international
venues to attract foreign oil and gas companies for exploration in
Bangladesh. By July, 1997, 12 of the remaining 15 blocks were
eagerly being sought after by 21 international oil companies (IOC).
In the past, the IOCs were not very keen to explore in Bangladesh
considering it to be a mostly a gas-prone areas.
	   Now with the increased interest in gas, especially, in the Asian
context, and the guarantees of fair gas price paid in US$, the IOCs
now find investment environment in Bangladesh good enough to
explore even for smaller fields. The tremendous interests being
shown for exploration has been unprecedented and certainly we
should give it due welcome and a fair chance. A major participant
in the on-going activities in the gas sector is the Cairn Energ
which is operating two blocks(15-16) under PSC. Cairn was the first
international prospector to start work under the 1993 PSC bidding
round and has already succeeded in discovering the second off-shore
gas field of Bangladesh. They plan to commission this off-shore
field in the mid-June, 1998. It has also identified a number of
other prospective structures in their PSC blocks currently working
at the Halda off-shore structure.
	   In Bangladesh ,the private sector seems to be firm in the
natural gas related activities. A ongoing project is already there
for setting up natural gas fractionation plant in association with
the private sector under the name and style of Ashuganj NGL
Defructionation Plant. It would use NG byproducts and other
unexplored wastes. Additional private sector investments could also
be mobilized in areas such as: bottling ,marketing and distribution
of the LPG produced by this upcoming plant. The private-public
joint ventures should accrue some spin-off benefits to the other
sectors of economic growth. Natural gas - the only indigenous
energy source to date contributes 70 percent to the production of
electricity and chemical fertilizers and could be the base for
promising Petro-chemical industries. Natural gas though a nature's
gifted boon, is not inexhaustible, its use has to be regulated and
new finds have to be mobilized. So, sectoral domestic utilisation
has to be allocated in a planned manner.
	   As we have mentioned already, the power and fertilizer by far
remain and shall remain in the near future the largest gas
consumers accounting for 52 per cent and 26 per cent respectively
of estimated demand by the year 2004/2005.The growing role of
Bangladesh's gas resource makes it imperative for the sectoral
authorities to put it on a solid base and this would require in
turn setting up of a Gas Regulatory Authority with strengthened PSC
division and a Hydrocarbon Unit in the concerned ministry.

Wiesenthal Center: extreme right `saturated' WWII Switzerland

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Pro-Nazi and other extreme right-wing
groups ``saturated'' neutral Switzerland while Adolf Hitler ruled
neighboring Germany, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
	   A copy of a center report to be released Wednesday in New York
was obtained by The Associated Press in Switzerland.
	   ``The extraordinary variety and number of associations and
societies in Switzerland representing the extreme-right _
patriotic, fascist or both _ during the Hitlerian era is most
striking,'' said the 128-page study by the Los Angeles-based
center.
	   He said there were ``well in excess of three dozen'' such groups
and that some ``had cells or chapters in more than 160 cities,
towns and villages.''
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti reacted heatedly. ``These
representations are untenable and perfidious,'' he said.
	   A Swiss government statement conceded the presence of ``a
variety of small rightist radical groups of all shades,'' but said
they ``never totaled more than 1.5 percent of the voters'' and were
already seriously depleted by the time World War II began in 1939.
	   ``Probably no other country in the whole of Europe was so
thoroughly infested with similar groups in proportion to its
population and geographical area,'' said the report.
	   It was written by Alan Morris Schom, an American specialist in
French history.
	   Last January the center, named after the famed Nazi hunter,
released another report by Schom accusing the Swiss of running
camps where Jewish refugees were used as slave labor and told they
would be handed over to Germany's Gestapo if they complained.
	   Switzerland conceded that some camp commanders had treated
refugees badly, but prominent Swiss Jews and a number of Jews who
lived in the camps said that by and large the country was a safe
haven for many on a hostile continent.
	   The latest Wiesenthal report said the right-wing groups had tens
of thousands of members, most of them working or lower-middle
class.
	   ``These groups thoroughly saturated every one of the country's
21 cantons and the core of Swiss society,'' said Schom.
	   One organization, the Swiss Fatherland Association, ``was
comprised largely of the ruling elite of Switzerland, notably the
officer corps and the political, financial and industrial leaders
of the country.''
	   He described the association as a semi-secret club that pushed
for government discrimination against Jewish refugees and backed
the requirement implemented by the government that the Swiss Jewish
community pay for the care of Jewish refugees, the report said.
	   It said the anti-Jewish sentiment grew out of centuries of
anti-Semitism, including the teachings of Protestant Reformation
leaders Jean Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther.
	   Rolf Bloch, head of the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew
Congregations, said he thought Schom had overstated the influence
of the association.
	   Bloch said Switzerland's treatment of some Jewish refugees was
``a dark chapter'' in its history, but that the report appeared
``one-sided and exaggerated.''
	   A U.S. government report on World War II issued last week said
Switzerland had a ``mixed record on refugees,'' including its
request to Germany to mark Jewish passports with a ``J'' _ ``which
helped officials turn back thousands.''
	   But, said the report by Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat, the record ``also included admission of over 50,000
refugees from 1933 until the end of the War, of whom some 30,000
remained and survived in Switzerland during the War.''
	   Eizenstat noted that a Swiss diplomat in Hungary, Vice Consul
Carl Lutz, ``acted on his own initiative to provide letters of
protection that saved the lives of 62,000 Jews and other targets of
Nazi persecution.''
	   Thomas Borer, who heads the Swiss government's task force
reexamining the country's past, said of the report, ``It is so
absurd and wrong.''
	   ``No serious historian will dispute the fact that the great
majority of the Swiss were outspoken democrats and antifascists,''
he said.
	   He quoted Eizenstat as saying, ``The Swiss people were
overwhelmingly sympathetic to the Allies.''

	   KUALA LIPIS, Sun. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim has called on the people to continue giving their support
to leaders who have their welfare at heart.
	   ``We have to train and give support to leaders who always think
about how to resolve the problems of the people,'' he said at a
meet-the-people session in Kampung Tanjung Gahai.
	   He said Umno had always emphasised this and elected
representatives from the party had also been subscribing to this
principle.
	   Anwar said this was a positive sign in Umno and in the
leadership of the country.
	   In jest, he said he was ``reluctant'' to come to Lipis as
divisional chief Datuk Omar Othman would enquire a lot about
projects for the people.
	   ``This is not for himself but for the masses such as public
projects and rural developments like schools and bridges,'' he
said.
	   Anwar said he had known Omar ``for a long time'' and he (Omar)
had never asked something for himself. Anwar added that this was
the attitude that should be emulated.
	   He said the Government would continue with efforts to eradicate
poverty and provide development in rural areas despite the lean
times.
	   On a request by community leaders that a bridge be built across
Sungai Jelai, Anwar, who is Finance Minister, assured the villagers
that the Government would implement the project.
	   ``However, we may not be able to build a proper bridge due to
the high cost. I have asked the State Government to come up with a
plan for a medium-cost bridge,'' he said.
	   Sungai Jelai cuts across Kampung Tanjung Gahai and 80 primary
schoolchildren have to use boats to get to their school located
across the river.
	   Also present were Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Khalil Yaakob, his
deputy Datuk Hasan Arifin, State Executive Councillors, State
Secretary Datuk Abdul Ghani Sulaiman and community leaders.
	   Anwar had earlier launched the Cameron Descent '98 Whitewater
Race at Jeram Musuh Karam.

	   Full-blast development of the first golf course-residential
community in the Bicol region formally started on June 6 on a
120-hectare property in Naga City, Camarines Sur.
	   Top officials of giant property developer Fil-Estate Land Inc.,
chaired by lawyer Ferdinand T. Santos will lead the groundbreaking
rites for Isarong Hills Residential Estates and Golf &AMP; Country Club
which is a joint project with the landowner families of Antonio
Austria and Rogelio Tormes.
	   Nestled at the foot of cloud-draped Mt. Isarog, the newest
Fil-Estate multi-billion peso flagship project will have the
biggest and most exclusive village clubhouse in Bicol designed to
be the focal point of Naga City's life, and an 18-hole championship
course designed by Golden Bear International owned by golfing
legend Jack Nicklaus.
	   Exclusive to residents, the village clubhouse will be equipped
with a lanai, multi-purpose function rooms, lounge, Olympic-type
swimming pool, tennis court, basketball court, children's pool and
picnic grounds.
	   The golf course amenities will also include a driving range, and
a grand clubhouse with a 120-seat golfer's veranda with dining
facilities, bar, pro shop, men's and ladies' custom-built locker
rooms, and shower rooms.
	   Santos said that Isarog Hills was a major part of the company's
aggressive nationwide expansion program, especially in high-growth
areas where the conglomerate is now concentrating on projects with
high revenue potential.
	   ''We are now giving top priority to projects that are less
capital-intensive but yield more revenues such as residential
subdivisions, as well as golf and country clubs and resorts,''
Santos said.
	   The Fil-Estate chair, however, emphasized that all horizontal
and vertical projects that have been started by the conglomerate
will be completed.
	   ''This is Fil-Estate's commitment to all our buyers and
investors,'' Santos stressed.
	   The Fil-Estate Group recently obtained key government permits
for most of its multi-billion peso projects which should allow the
property giant to start marketing and development of these
township, leisure estates, and tourism centers.
	   Among them are: Harbor Town in Nasugbu, Batangas; Caliraya;
Newport Hills in Lian, Batangas; the Tagaytay tourism estate; the
commercial complex at Pioneer St., Mandaluyong City; and Camp John
Hay in Baguio City.

	   A top UN official who is armed with a mandate to seek the
protection of children caught in war zones worldwide, has reported
some success in Sri Lanka. Olara Otunnu, UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan's special representative on children in armed conflict, who
was on a week-long visit to Sri Lanka, said both the warring
government forces and Tamil rebels have agreed children should not
be victims of war. 'I hope we can send a message to the world that
children in Sri Lanka, ... (will) not be abused and brutalised in
the manner that conflicts (used to) affect their lives,'' he said
in Colombo, recently, before he left. Otunnu, a former Ugandan
foreign minister and once his country's permanent representative to
the UN, held meeting with President Chandrika Kumaratunga and
parliamentarians from both ruling and opposition parties.
	   In addition, making use of a two-day ceasefire brokered by the
UN children's agency UNICEF, he visited the war zones and talked
with government military commanders, Tamil rebel leaders, community
representatives and children. 'I have seen and heard a tremendous
yearning for peace on the part of everybody in this country and
that has impressed me,'' he told an audience in Colombo of UN
officials, foreign donor agencies, parliamentarians,
non-governmental organisation (NGOs) and child rights activists
before he left. Otunnu said that more than two million children
have died in wars worldwide in the decade up to 1997. In addition,
one million children were orphaned, more than five million disabled
and more than 250,000 children under 18 years used in armed combat.
He said more than 90 percent of the casualties in the big wars this
decade, were civilians.
	   'This is a world upside down. It is a situation where warfare is
being conducted specifically for the purpose of targetting,
humiliating, destroying and annihilating civilian populations,'' he
noted. The UN official said the impact of war on children should be
addressed urgently, and steps taken for their protection like the
creation of fire-free zones in localities where there are
hospitals, schools, school buses and playgrounds. 'We must do
everything in our power to ameliorate the suffering and conditions
of children even as war is raging within a particular zone,'' he
said, adding that women and children would continue to suffer the
psychological and emotional scars of war for many years after the
conflict ends. 'Healing is critical. Healing is important to
reintegrate those who have suffered and make them productive. But
healing is also important because it is the only way to break the
cycle of violence, for those who are abused today could well be the
abusers of tomorrow,'' Otunnu said.
	   The UN official said he was deeply moved by the spirit and the
fortitude of Sri Lankans living amongst difficult conditions in
conflict areas and said he was amazed at 'the incredible courage of
those residents.'' But he stressed that his mandate was purely
humanitarian and ruled out UN intervention in seeking an end to the
15-year war in which Tamil rebels claiming to represent Sri Lanka's
minority Tamil population are fighting for an independent homeland.
'My concern is for the protection and welfare of all children, to
whatever community they belong to, whatever party or whatever side
of the dividing zone,'' Otunnu said in response to reports brought
back by local aid workers that many ordinary people who met the top
U.N official in the war zone had pleaded for U.N or third party
intervention to end the prolonged war. A sudden flurry of visits,
earlier of US ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson,
the Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku, have sparked
speculation that the government and rebels may now be open to
foreign mediation.
	   Both the previous rounds of peace talks were initiated by the
government, but they collapsed before they made any serious
headway. An estimated 50,000 combatants and civilians have died in
the fighting that has devastated Sri Lanka's north and east. At a
news conference that followed his speech, Otunnu said the rebels
had agreed not to recruit children below 18 years in combat, to
allow the free movement of displaced people to areas under
government control, and not to interfere in the distribution of
humanitarian supplies to civilians in war zones. They had also
promised to take review strategies to take care to prevent
civilians from getting caught in the conflict.
	   The Tiger rebels, the world's best trained guerrilla group, has
with chilling results launched several attacks in the capital
Colombo. 'There can be no defence, no justification, no cause that
can justify the deliberate targetting of civilian populations
anywhere within this island,'' the UN official said he told the
government and Tiger political leader Thamilselvan and top
ideologue Anton Balasingham during his talks.Sri Lanka's military
doubts if the rebels could be trusted to keep the pledges made to
Otunnu. Even before the UN official had left, the military had
accused the Tigers of breaking the truce by attacking government
forces in two incidents.

	   KOTA BARU, Sun.- Mara is prepared to provide counselling to its
sponsored student detained with three other Malaysians by British
police for alleged involvement in Internet fraud involving
thousands of British pounds, said Entrepreneur Development Minister
Datuk Mustapa Mohamed.
	   ``We assume they are still innocent until the court decides
otherwise,''
	   he said when asked about the arrest of the four Malaysian
students.
	   He said he had yet to receive the full report of the incident.
	   The four were produced before a magistrate's court in Stoke on
Trent, about 240km north-west of London, on Thursday and charged
with conspiracy to defraud.
	   They were identified as Shafiq Rizal Shaaba, 24, Cek Norlie Md
Shah, 23, Riza Musauwir, 23, and Khairul Anwar Ariffin, 24.
	   The three male students are studying at the University of
Staffordshire while the lone female student, who police alleged was
their accomplice, is a student of the University of Liverpool.
	   Shafiq and Norlie are Mara and Public Service
Department-sponsored students while the others are privately
sponsored.

	   A prominent economists has proposed the conversion of existing
condominiums units into condotels, medical and health care service
units, and offices to ease the glut facing the local condominium
market.
	   In a paper titled Plunge into the Hard Times, Marcelo de la
Cruz, president of the Summit Research and Consultancy Inc., said
that in doing so, the cost of transfer or conversion of existing
buildings will be low and assets will not be highly specialized.
	   De la Cruz cited that the local condominium market faces severe
glut in the coming years, saying that condominium developers will
be affected most since there is a huge number of units that will be
completed in the next few years.
	   ''We predict that close to 8,500 condominium units will be
unoccupied between 1998 and 2000,'' he said. The market demand per
annum is currently anemic at 1,760 units, and market supply is
growing on the average at 3,160 units.
	   De la Cruz explained that the supply of condominium units is
about 61% of what the market can absorb. Absorption rate is
expected to deteriorate below 5% in 1998 when large supply will be
made available. And further deterioration is expected in 1999 and
2000.
	   ''Now that the pace of growth has faltered, the sprouting
skyscrapers seem a symptom less of success than of pain to come,''
he said.
	   Official statistics show that the construction industry's real
gross national product registered a negative 4.4% growth for the
first quarter of this year, a far cry compared to 21.3% growth in
the same period last year.
	   De la Cruz pointed out that fierce competition and price war are
anticipated in this sector. The construction of at least 21
buildings has already been postponed, shelved or stopped, with more
than 4,500 planned units disappearing.
	   About 14,000 condominiums units will be available from 1998 to
2000. Almost three quarters of the units will be located in the
Makati central business district and its adjacent places.
	   ''If developers continue with their plans, the condominium
market will have a tremendous glut. By the turn of the century, the
number of units will total to 32,057,'' he said.
	   Since the second quarter of 1997, De la Cruz noted, the
transaction volumes on this sector have been minimal. The renewed
buying activity on this segment cannot be seen until the interest
rates drop below 20%.
	   With so many condominium units in the market, they will be
choosy.
	   Affordability, quality and right financing facilities are the
crucial factors in pushing the demand higher in the years to come.
	   ''What is happening to the condominium market must serve as a
wake-up call for developers. We would like to bring to their
attention to switch strategy now before its too late,'' he said.
	   De la Cruz stressed that the adage, ''think twice before you
leap'' must be modified for real estate developers. They must not
only think twice, but thrice or even four times before they decide
to pursue a project.
	   Oftentimes, he said, what happens is that developers get caught
up in the euphoria and optimism surrounding the initial phase of a
new construction that they fail to take an objective step
backwards.
	   In this case, the best strategy would be to enlist the support
of the third-party whose opinions of the market and the feasibility
of the project are unbiased.
	   Because the property sector now demands nerve of steel from its
players, this steel might as well be tempered with a healthy dose
of prudence, De la Cruz said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The credit tightening measure by Bank
Negara in addition to high interest rates have threatened the
survival of small and medium scale enterprises.
	   Umno Youth Economic Council chairman Dr Abdul Rahim Mohd Ghouse
said today, the current interest rate level had not only made it
more difficult for SMIs to obtain loans but had also impeded the
nation's growth.
	   ``We urge the Government to take quick measures to reduce the
current high interest rate which is leaving behind an array of
problems to the various industrial sectors, entrepreneurs and the
public at large.
	   ``About 25,000 small and medium scale enterprises are in
diffcult financial situation due to limited cash flow resulting
from an escalation cost of raw material, labour delay in obtaining
payment and capital restriction,'' he said when tabling a proposed
blueprint entitled the Strategies for the Strengthening of the
National Economy at the Putra World Trade Centre.
	   The blueprint was presented in conjunction with the half-day
Strengthening of the National Economy Congress organised by the
Umno Youth.
	   Apart from underlining the movement's views and proposals on the
roles of the private and public sectors in facing the current
economic difficulties, it also highlights the various means for the
Government to carry out its policy to protect the interest of the
people.
	   Abdul Rahim said while external factors like globalisation,
liberalisation and deregulation were not within the nation's
control, the proposed blueprint recognised the importance of a fair
distribution of the nation's wealth.
	   ``Although non-Bumiputeras can be allowed to acquire the
majority stake at company level, the equity at the industry level
should be clearly spelt out among Bumiputeras, non-Bumiputeras and
foreign investors.
	   In addition to foreign direct investment, the blueprint also
supported the introduction of bonds similar to the one introduced
by Syarikat Perumahan Negara for strategic fields like education,
agriculture and infrastructure.
	   It also called on the Government to fix a benchmark to reduce
the expenditure on the short and long term import of food products.

	   The Monetary Board, the central bank's policy-making body, has
closed Commonwealth Savings Bank, the fourth bank to run into
financial problems since Asia's currency crisis hit in July last
year.
	   Another bank - Fortune Savings and Loans Bank - was reported to
be experiencing financial difficulties but monetary officials
refused to comment.
	   Commonwealth Savings, a small thrift bank, was taken over by the
Monetary Board last Friday, said Aurora Baldos, vice president for
claims, receivership and liquidation of the Philippine Deposit
Insurance Corp.(PDIC).
	   Baldos said the takeover team was now conducting an inventory of
the bank's assets and liabilities.
	   PDIC acts as receiver of banks closed by the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas.
	   As a receiver, it gathers, controls and takes charge of the
assets and liabilities of insolvent banks.
	   Commonwealth Savings is the fourth bank in the country to close
its doors since Asia's currencies tumbled, triggering high interest
rates across the region.
	   Orient Commercial Banking Corp., Richmond Bank and Mindanao
Development Bank went on holiday after failing to recover from a
string of bad loans.
	   A central bank official said Commonwealth Savings had been in
the red over the past three years due to a high level of past due
loans that eroded its portfolio.
	   As of the first quarter of the year, the bank's deposit
liabilities have reached P14 million.
	   PDIC has 90 days to come up with a rehabilitation plan before
Commonwealth Savings is offered to potential investors.
	   BSP Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said the closure of
Commonwealth Savings would have little effect on the local banking
industry.
	   ``The situation is not alarming... The problems were identified
as early as last year,'' said Reyes.
	   Commonwealth Savings is owned by the Yutingco family, majority
owner of the Eyco group of companies. The Eyco group, a
manufacturer of electric fans, has also been declared insolvent by
government regulators.
	   Commonwealth Savings has only two branches in Metro Manila.
	   A company source said the bank's owners had a hard time meeting
the central bank's required capital build-up for thrift banks.
	   The central bank has required thrift banks to put up P200
million worth of capital as of February this year and P250 million
by the end of the year.

	   Cagayan Electric Power &AMP; Light Co. Inc. (Cepalco) has reduced
its power systems loss to 7.47%, lower than the maximum level
imposed by law at 13.25%.
	   Cepalco said its interruption frequency rate (IFR) was 55.6%
lower than the standard rate, while its cumulative interruption
time (CIT) was 48.76% lower than the standard rate.
	   The company's average time to restore power due to outages was
3.33% faster than the standard.
	   Cepalco is one of the few power utilities with a reserve
capacity supplied by a producer other than the state-owned National
Power Corp. (Napocor).
	   A stand-by power of 25% has helped consumers to avoid the
equivalence of 33 days of the total blackout since the middle of
1995.
	   The power company has also exceeded all reliability and
technical standards prescribed by the Department of Energy (DOE).
Its performances is among the best offered by any power utility in
the country.
	   Records of the technical performances of Cepalco showed that its
interruption frequency rate (IFR) in 1997 was much better that the
national standard set by the DOE.
	   The DOE standard for IFR is five frequencies per annum, while
Cepalco's actual performances last year was only 2.22 times or
55.6% lower that the national standard.
	   Its performance is passed on to all its customers in terms of
quality service, yet its average weighted rate per kilowatt hour
(kwh) of P2.75 is lower than those of the rest of the existing
power utilities in Mindanao.
	   Cepalco's performances has consistently been among the best in
the country, always surpassing all reliability standards prescribed
by the DOE for all electric utilities in the country.
	   The company gets its power supply from the Mindanao Energy
Systems (Minergy) which became operational in July 1995 and
Napocor.

	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army killed
13 Hutu rebels in a clash in southern Burundi. One government
soldier also died, an army spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The weekend fighting took place in Makamba province, 120
kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital, Bujumbura, Lt. Col.
Isaie Nibizi said.
	   The army and rebels have been battling since late 1993, when
Tutsi soldiers assassinated Melchoir Ndadaye, Burundi's first
democratically elected president and a Hutu.
	   At least 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
fighting.
	   On Monday, another round of peace talks was scheduled to begin
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha under the mediation of
former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.
	   President Pierre Buyoya, who overthrew a Hutu-Tutsi coalition
government in July 1996, is expected to take part in the talks for
the first time.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Young people must be taught compassion and
empathy and a sensitivity to values if the country wanted a more
caring society, said Action for the Betterment of Community
co-chairman Datuk J.
	   Jagadeesan.
	   He said success in instilling these three qualities would be of
great help in human values development among the youth. The end
result would be a more caring citizen.
	   With that in mind, ABC and youth from the San Peng Zone 2 area
co- organised an outing today for 25 children from Rumah Hope, 27
from the Community Rehabilitation Centre and 10 from the Kuala
Lumpur Deaf Society.
	   They were taken to Zoo Negara.
	   The project, it is hoped, will help young people to become
better aware of the presence of others who are less privileged.
	   The San Peng Zone 2 area is identified as one of the most
problematic areas in the city, where drugs and other social
problems run rampant.
	   Project chairman Anthony Arulananthan said the outing was a much
awaited trip for the youth as it ``gives them a reason to go out''
and meet others.
	   He said the experience would give these young people an exposure
to others who were less fortunate, thus helping them to feel more
positive about themselves and their own surroundings.
	   Volunteer Asrul Nizam, 17, from the Sri Selangor Flats said that
to him the outing was an eye-opener as he had never met any
handicapped children before this.
	   ``It is fun to actually get to know the children, exchange
greetings and play with them.
	   ``It gives me a deeper feeling of understanding and caring for
another human being, though they may be strangers at first,'' he
said.
	   Volunteer Zulkifli Nazri, 16, also from the Sri Selangor Flats
said the chance to meet the handicapped and less fortunate children
``touched my heart''.
	   ``Instead of always complaining about the way I live and the
quality of my life, the trip has now changed the way I look at
things,'' he said.
	   The outing was co-organised under the auspices of the Sathya Sai
Central Council of Malaysia, fully supported by the Friendship
Group for Human Values and A Caring Society, the City Hall and the
Social Action Initiative Foundation.
	   The Action for the Betterment of Community is designed as an
experimental programme to see if non-governmental organisations
working wth relevant authorities can help create greater value
consciousness and thus check the decline in negative behaviour in
an area identified as being among the most problem-ridden in the
city.
	   Zone 2 of the San Peng Flats includes the City Hall flats in
Jalan Loke Yew, Jalan Hang Tuah, Sri Selangor, Sri Sarawak, Sri
Pahang, Bukit Kerinchi, Bukit Bangsar, Bukit Kiara, Razak Mansion
and Kampung Muhibbah, Puchong.

	   More than 150,000 Indonesians and foreigners fled the country
during last month's riots which led to the downfall of Soeharto,
according to the Ministry of Justice.
	   Pranowo, the director general of immigration, told a media
briefing yesterday that 152,363 Indonesians and foreigners from at
least 47 countries left the country from May 14 to May 20.
	   In a report made available to the press, the ministry said that
70,837 Indonesians and 81,526 foreigners left the country from
airports and seaports in Java, Bali and Sumatra.
	   They were Soekarno-Hatta and Halim Perdanakusuma airports in
Jakarta, Adisumarmo airport in the Central Java town of Surakarta,
Juanda airport in Surabaya in East Java, Ngurah Rai airport in
Bali, Polonia airport and Belawan seaport in Medan, and Batam and
Tanjung Pinang in Riau.
	   The report said that most -- 67,299 people -- left the country
from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, 20 kilometers west of
Jakarta.
	   ``The number of people leaving the country from Soekarno-Hatta
peaked on May 19, namely 17,212 people,'' the report said.
	   The report said that of the 4,039 people who left the country
from Halim Perdanakusuma from May 14 to May 18, the three largest
groups were Americans, French and Malaysians.
	   Pranowo also said that from May 23 to May 26, 51,160 Indonesians
and foreigners arrived in the country.
	   They were 27,616 Indonesian citizens and 23,544 foreigners.
	   Pranowo did not say whether these people were the same as those
who left the country some days earlier.
	   As reported earlier, foreign airlines were even forced to beef
up their Indonesian services due to the sudden passenger upsurge.
	   Many foreign governments were also forced to charter dozens of
special flights to fly their respective citizens out of the
country.
	   Minister of Justice Muladi expressed concern that Indonesians of
Chinese descent -- accounting for only 4 percent of the country's
202 million population -- were always targeted during riots.
	   He said that the ministry has also received hundreds of
complaints from citizens of Chinese descent about their lost or
burned personal documents, such as passports and proof of
citizenship, due the riots.
	   Muladi said he had instructed ministry staff throughout the
country to facilitate the replacement of these people's documents.
	   ``There will not be any additional charges,'' Muladi promised,
adding he would not hesitate to take action against ministry
officials who took advantage of the situation by extorting money
from those who were in applying for the documents.
	   The National Commission on Human Rights said last week that at
least 1,188 people died in the riots with thousands of shops,
vehicles and private homes being attacked, burned or looted.
	   It also said that much of violence had been the work of
``well-organized group who started the rioting and burning''.

Italy awards third mobile phone license to consortium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with criticism by opposition, Berlusconi

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The government on Tuesday awarded Italy's third
mobile phone license to the state electric utility and French and
German phone companies.
	   The consortium of ENEL, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom,
called Wind, beat out two other groups, led by British Telecom and
Bell Canada International, in the hugely lucrative cell phone
market.
	   Europe's largest market for mobiles is Italy, where there are
some 13.5 million mobile phone users. Some analysts say that market
will be worth about 18 trillion lire (dlrs 10.32 billion) by the
end of next year, and that the third operator can expect to hold
some 2 percent of it by then.
	   The choice drew criticism from opposition politicians, who said
it amounted to expanding government control over the economy.
	   Wind is 51 percent owned by ENEL, which itself is controlled by
the Treasury, although that stake will come down when other Italian
investors are brought in. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom split
the other 49 percent.
	   The decision is ``the latest demonstration of the (center-left)
government's partisanship,'' said Italo Bocchino, a Parliament
deputy for the right-wing National Alliance party.
	   ``After years of talking about privatization, it is taking the
first good opportunity to put a strategic sector under state
control,'' he said.
	   Wind set goals of more than 8 million clients and revenues of 10
trillion lire (dlrs 5.73 billion) by 2007.
	   Telecom Italia has around 75 percent of the Italian cell phone
market, while Omnitel, controlled by Olivetti SpA and Germany's
Mannesmann AG, has the rest.
	   One of the losers in the decision was Silvio Berlusconi, the
media magnate, former premier and now leader of the center-right
opposition in Parliament.
	   Berlusconi's Mediaset group was part of the British Telecom
consortium, and has long been trying to crack the cell phone
market.
	   Before the license was awarded, telecommunications minister
Antonio Maccanico told reporters that increased competition would
lead to lower prices and better service.
	   He declined to say whether there would be a fourth license
awarded before the end of the year, as some in the industry have
demanded. The government has only pledged to look into awarding a
fourth license.

	   MUAR, Sun. - In view of the current economic situation, the
Health Ministry has suspended the recruitment of foreign nurses
except those for the critical services.
	   Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the 300 foreign nurses
from India, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia
currently attached to various hospitals were also likely to be sent
home once their contracts expired.
	   He, however, said the ministry would make an exception for
highly qualified and capable nurses.
	   ``The ministry is evaluating their performance to ascertain if
there is a need to retain them,'' he told reporters after opening
the RM400,000 three- storey Zhongtian Temple today.
	   Chua said to ease the shortage of nursing staff in critical
medical services with the departure of foreign staff, the ministry
planned to engage Malaysian nurses working abroad and those serving
with private hospitals in the country on contract basis.
	   ``We are cutting down the hiring of foreign nurses. We have
already sent many of them back. But we will consider extending the
contracts of those whose service records have been excellent.''
	   Chua said the ministry had set up many nurses' training colleges
and centres to cope with the increasing demand for nursing care.
	   He said with some 3,000 nurses graduating every year, the
country would have enough nurses by the year 2003 to fill all
vacancies in hospitals, clinics, and health centres.
	   The ministry, he said, would also continue to promote assistant
nurses to staff nurses once they had completed their conversion
courses.
	   Chua stressed that the Government's austerity drive had not
affected the quality of medical services and nursing care provided
by hospitals and clinics.
	   ``Though the number of patients seeking treatment at hospitals
and clinics is increasing, we will continue to find ways to meet
their needs and provide quality services to all, especially the
low-income wage earners.''

	   Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan Hamid advised government
officials yesterday to heed people's aspirations and work hard to
win their trust, as hundreds of students protested nearby against
the reappointment of the West Java governor.
	   Syarwan endorsed dialog between officials and the public in an
address at the reinstallation ceremony for Maj. Gen. (ret.) R.
Nuriana at the legislative council here.
	   The students accused Nuriana of practicing corruption and
collusion, although they did not cite specific instances during
their hour-long rally at Gasibu Square.
	   ``If officials absorbed and heeded the people's aspirations,
there would not be any gap between government policy and the
people's wishes,'' Syarwan said.
	   He said officials needed to hold dialogs so they could get
firsthand information from the public. ``The people's trust is an
important factor in order to make the government a legitimate
one.''
	   Nuriana ended his first gubernatorial term on May 22. He was
reelected earlier last month and had been scheduled to be
reinstalled concurrently on May 22.
	   The installment was delayed because of the appointment of a new
Cabinet following former president Soeharto's resignation a day
earlier.
	   Upon the completion of the installment ceremony, about 300
students marched around the West Java governor's office under the
surveillance of an estimated 300 riot police and Army troops. The
rally ended peacefully an hour later.
	   An hour before the ceremony, a delegation of the Bandung Reform
Movement (GRB) met with secretary-general of the home affairs
ministry, Feisal Tamin, to file a petition against Nuriana's
reinstallment.
	   The delegation demanded that the ceremony he postponed until
Nuriana was cleared of allegations of corruption and collusion.
	   They alleged Nuriana was involved in a dubious residential
project on 30,000 hectares in Jonggol subdistrict in Bogor regency,
about 40 kilometer southeast of Jakarta.
	   ``I told the delegation not to interfere with the ceremony as
(the election) has been held constitutionally and was free from any
political engineering,'' Feisal said.
	   He also suggested the activists should meet with Nuriana to
clarify the matter.
	   Syarwan said there was no problem with Nuriana's installment
because he was elected fairly by the West Java provincial
legislative council.
	   ``There has been no constitutional violation in the West Java
provincial legislative council. We cannot nullify the result of the
election,'' he told reporters.
	   Feisal said the activists should not relent in their commitment
for a better West Java province.
	   ``They should proceed with legal action if they have evidence
for the allegations.
	   ``Both parties should develop transparency while discussing the
issue. And I'll be willing to act as mediator for them.''
	   Separately, Nuriana challenged activists to back up their
accusations with facts.
	   ``They are free to come and seek clarification about the Jonggol
issue,'' he told reporters after the installment.
	   He argued he was merely following orders in approving the huge
project, involving four West Java subdistricts.
	   ``The residential project was decided upon by then president
Soeharto's instruction. I only followed his order,'' he said.
	   ``I ask you, was there any governor who dared not carry out the
president's instructions?''
	   He refuted the allegation that a 5 percent fee from the project
was siphoned off into his personal account.
	   ``If the project continues, the fee will be added to the West
Java administration's treasury.'' he said.

	   TANAH MERAH, Sun. - Police arrested two people in connection
with the seizure of 68 litres of cough mixture during a raid at a
house near Taman Sinaran, two days ago.
	   A police party picked up the men, aged 30 and 33, in a 2am raid.
	   Tanah Merah police chief Deputy Superintendent Roslan Ahmad said
today that one of them was wanted by police to assist in
investigations into illegal distribution of cough mixture in the
State.
	   He added that the cough mixture was believed to have been
brought in from other States for distribution in the district.
	   Roslan added that the men would be charged under Section 12(2)
of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1986.

	   The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) will hold an
extraordinary session only to revoke decrees on elections, and not,
as many have demanded, to question former president Soeharto over
his leadership.
	   MPR deputy chairman Poedjono Pranyoto made it clear yesterday
that the Assembly would not revoke its decrees appointing Soeharto
president and B.J. Habibie vice president for the 1998/2003 term.
	   ``We won't go that far. But it's possible that the issue will be
discussed in the MPR working committee,'' Poedjono was quoted by
Antara as saying after attending a meeting of MPR and House of
Representatives leaders presided over by Speaker Harmoko.
	   The working committee is a small group consisting of
representatives from the five MPR factions: Golkar, the United
Development Party, the Indonesian Democratic Party, the Armed
Forces and regional representatives.
	   Poedjono revealed yesterday that a meeting between MPR leaders
and faction leaders took place last Friday to discuss various
alternatives on how they were to go about holding the extraordinary
session.
	   The meeting was a ``consultation'', said Poedjono, and was not
meant to make any decisions. But faction leaders agreed to move up
the general election from 2002, and to call on the Assembly to
revoke or review election decrees.
	   Poedjono did not say when the extraordinary session would be
held, but an earlier commitment by House Speaker Harmoko and
President B.J. Habibie put it at end of this year or early 1999.
	   Habibie said last week his government ``has been rushing'' to
implement various reform agendas, including the preparation of new
political laws which would open the door for a fair general
election to be held as early as May next year.
	   He also said his government intended to complete the laws on
elections and political parties by August, and have them enacted by
December.
	   Once enacted, the MPR could meet in December to set a date for a
general election, Habibie said. ``They (Assembly members) will need
only one day to decide.''
	   He argued that the country would then need a few months to
prepare for the elections. A new assembly formed as a result of the
elections could then meet in December to elect a new president and
vice president.
	   Habibie has estimated the election would cost Rp 3 trillion to
organize. Last year's election cost Rp 1.4 trillion because it was
only contested by three parties, he said.

	   THESE days, we are seeing a number of words with an ``E''
prefix, such as e- commerce and e-business, mesmerising the world
with promises of erasing geographical boundaries and defining new
ways of doing businesses.
	   However, with the Asia-Pacific region more concerned with
economic stability, is this the right time to talk about building
the E-world?
	   ``It is true we are seeing weaker markets around the region.
Consumer spending have clearly been impacted by the economic
downturn,'' said Hewlett-Packard's corporate vice president, and
Asia-Pacific operations president and managing director Dick
Warmington.
	   He added the region is also experiencing delays in major
information technology (IT) infrastructure projects, but the good
news is that the information age is not going to come to a
standstill because of the economic turmoil. ``The digital economy
is going ahead at full speed - crisis or no crisis. We simply
cannot afford to ignore the trend,''
	   Warmington said at the HP Builds the Electronic World
Asia-Pacific Press Symposium in Sydney.
	   He said some of the driving forces behind the implementation of
IT, even in times of crisis, are fundamental factors in wealth
creation, namely intellectual capital and digitised network
knowledge.
	   Some experts predicted that intellectual capital will be equal
to, if not greater than, traditional factors such as money, goods
and land.
	   Businesses and governments across the world are redefining their
organisations and core competencies to be successful in this new
world.
	   ``If you look around the region, countries like Australia,
Singapore, Malaysia, China, and Taiwan are doing the right thing by
not backing down from major or national IT initiatives,'' said
Warmington.
	   In fact, these countries recognise that if there is a time to
push ahead with IT, this is the time. They see IT as necessary for
pushing national and organisational competitiveness and improving
productivity. At these levels, IT is not a discretionary expense
even though it may come under increased expense control measures.
	   In Australia, the budget that was unveiled just a few weeks ago
provides a generous tax concession for companies to upgrade or buy
new software systems to fix the millennium bug. The package will
cost the Australian government millions in foregone revenue. But
they have recognised the need for businesses to protect and upgrade
their IT environments.
	   In Singapore, there is a strong government commitment towards IT
projects. The Singapore government recognises this period as an
opportunity to differentiate the country as an IT powerhouse in the
region.
	   ``HP, for instance, is providing the infrastructure, products
and services to manage the Singapore government's One Call Project.
HP's solutions integrate knowledge-based systems with interactive
voice response so that the public will always get their phone
answered and a government officer handling enquiries will be able
to access information online and deal efficiently with the call,''
said Warmington.
	   This, he added, is the first step the country is taking to
realising the future vision where members of the public need only
to remember one number to reach any government department.
	   ``Dealing with the civil servants in Singapore will be very easy
and a pleasant experience. This is leadership by example,'' he
said.''Even in Malaysia, a country in the thick of the crisis,
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad has reiterated his
commitment to continue with the development of the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC).''
	   Warmington said Malaysia is taking a bold step by offering an
open testbed, unencumbered by existing legislation and regulations
that plagued old environments.
	   ``The Prime Minister realised if Malaysia put the MSC on the
backburner, it will negatively impact the country's future economic
competitiveness.
	   All of these are clear examples where governments are harnessing
the power of IT to help improve the nations' productivity and
competitiveness,'' he said.

Amnesty urges release of Nigerian political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Reacting to the death of military
leader Gen. Sani Abacha, Amnesty International on Tuesday urged
Nigeria's new leader to release political prisoners and improve the
country's human rights records.
	   ``Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar should break with the
country's legacy of repression and give the Nigerian people hope
for the future,'' London-based Amnesty said in a statement received
in the West African country of the Ivory Coast.
	   Among others, the group called for the release of Moshood
Abiola, a leading Nigerian businessman and presumed winner of
aborted 1993 presidential elections.
	   Abiola has been jailed and charged with treason since 1994, when
he declared himself president.
	   Abiola is the most prominent political prisoner in Nigeria.
	   ``Africa's most populous nation cannot fulfill its economic and
political potential if military governments continue blocking the
momentum for reform,'' Amnesty said.
	   The group's call for respect of human rights and democracy
echoed a message from leaders around the world who said Tuesday
they hope Abubakar would honor a transition program aimed at
handing power over to a civilian government.
	   Nigeria's ruling military junta has been accused of widespread
human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture and
extrajudicial killings.
	   Outspoken journalists and pro-democracy activists are frequently
detained without trials or forced into exile, Amnesty says.

	   SURAKARTA, Central Java: Material damages in Surakarta from the
two days of widespread unrest on May 14 and May 15 are estimated to
total Rp 457.5 billion.
	   Rahmadi Wahyudi, head of the team assessing the damage, said
much of the losses were from the 10 shopping plazas and 23
showrooms torched during the riots.
	   The damage to shopping plazas, showrooms and major supermarkets
alone are estimated at Rp 189.6 billion.
	   Another 58 individual shops and 14 factories were also burned in
the anarchy, while dozens of other buildings were severely damaged.
	   ``The material damages are very high, but the greater loss comes
from the trauma of the riots which might affect the business
climate in Surakarta,'' Rahmadi said here yesterday.
	   He feared businesspeople might be less inclined to invest here
in the future, causing commercial activity in Surakarta to come to
a complete standstill.
	   ``The security apparatus must provide assurances that the city
is again safe for business so any fears which may be lingering can
be dispelled,'' he said.

	   PURWOKERTO, Central Java: Villagers in Cikakak, Wangon
subdistrict in Banyumas regency, yesterday found two
15-centimeter-tall golden Buddha statues weighing 1.5 kilograms.
	   The finding was not an accident.
	   Michayat, a local prayer leader from the ancient Saka Tunggal
mosque in the village, told The Jakarta Post that he received a
premonition about the existence of the statues which were buried in
the forest about 200 meters from the mosque.
	   He instructed villagers to search for the items and after 40
days of continuous digging, the statues were unearthed.
	   The statues were buried 2.5 meters underground along with four
golden crowns and three golden coins 10 centimeters in diameter.
	   Michayat believes the artifacts could be as old as the mosque,
which was built in 1205.
	   He said the quest was a tiring exercise and that it almost ended
in failure as villagers digging for the items began to tire and
doubt Michayat's vision after three weeks.
	   The religious leader claims his premonitions tell him that there
are still two more statues buried somewhere in the vicinity. One of
the statues, he said, is 75 centimeters in length.
	   The artifacts are currently being kept at Michayat's house.
	   He said he would keep them for the benefit of Cikakak's
villagers, and would not allow any government officials to
confiscate them.

Parisians catch the spirit at ``Festival of Soccer''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Four jolly giants _ an African, American Indian, an
Asian and a European _ strode through Paris like good-guy Godzillas
on Tuesday, symbolizing the spirit of a World Cup that France hopes
will loom large in history.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the 18-meter (60-foot) robots took separate routes toward
the Place de la Concorde, the heart of a citywide tournament
kickoff party.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show. ``The grand theme is universality in a
single world.''
	   Parisians awoke Tuesday to find the dozing giants at familiar
monuments, along with throngs of strangely dressed tourists from
the 31 nations joining France in the planet's biggest sports
tournament.
	   Moussa, the African, was the first to stir late Tuesday, near
the Eiffel Tower, standing up and opening huge eyes to wild
applause.
	   He symbolized the man in a new world, and he rose up to see
dancing odd-shaped baobab trees and termite hills. Six ostriches _
actually men on stilts _ bobbed among women dressed as stylized
giraffes.
	   ``Amazing,'' said Florence Farriaux, as she hurried her three
kids home so their father could take them to Concorde, where Moussa
would meet the three others. ``I loved it.''
	   On the Pont Neuf over the Seine, Ho, the Asian, stood up in a
fantasy world of balloons shaped like flying fish and dancers
dressed as tropical sea creatures.
	   Pablo, the Indian, rose from a crouch under the Arc de Triomphe
and strolled down the Champs-Elysees to see the animated trees,
snakes and bugs that depict nature.
	   Romeo, the European, had been snoozing outside the Opera
Garnier. His theme was love, and along his route he bowed to a
sculptor's conception of the Urban Woman, a mere 4.5 meters (15
feet) tall.
	   David Quill, a Scottish engineer who came for no-nonsense
football, found himself carried away by the spectacle. ``This
brings together the four worlds,'' he said. ``I really liked it.''
	   Heavy overnight rains did not dampen the mood, but they washed
off Ho's loincloth, made of rubberized-plastic, exposing the
midriff of his articulated steel skeleton. Workmen pinned it back
on.
	   The 38-ton giants were powered by small trucks hidden in their
feet. They moved one after the other, as if the giants were
walking. Huge heads moved, eyes rolled, and fingers wiggled.
	   During the day, Parisians paid less attention to the four
colossi than the real characters in their midst. Clusters of soccer
fans roamed the streets in outlandish outfits and gaudy colors.
	   For once, passersby paid more attention to skirts on men rather
than women. Perhaps 20,000 Scots came across the Channel for the
opening game with Brazil on Wednesday. Most wore kilts.
	   Scott Wallace, a fishmonger, and his housepainter friend, Gerry
Shiels, sat behind tankards of lager at the Cafe Montecristo, each
with bare knees and Highland feathers towering above their hats.
	   ``I think we'll beat 'em, 2-1,'' Wallace said, a little
hopefully. ``Aye,'' Shiels agreed. ``And if we do, it'll be some
party.''
	   From the looks of things Tuesday, there'll be some party,
anyway.
	   Still, an Air France strike and soccer ticket foulups have left
many fans furious.
	   Crowds pushed their way into the France 98 shop to buy World Cup
paraphernalia: polyster T-shirts, caps, crowd-parting cologne,
fuzzy stuffed versions of the goofy-looking rooster mascot named
Footix.
	   Visitors seemed to show more interest than the French. Jacques
Lambert, head of the organizing committee, complained of an evident
lack of fervor among the general public.
	   A block off the Champs-Elysees, Jean-Pierre Arnal sat alone in
his little hardware store, wearing his usual white smock with his
dog at his feet.
	   ``Oouuff,'' he replied when asked about the World Cup, employing
a beloved French nonword that means the same thing as shrugged
shoulders.
	   ``I suppose it's a good thing, economically.''
	   Around the corner, Emmannuel Delhomme painted a banner on the
awning of his bookshop, the Livre Sterling: ``Good news, ladies.
This store will be open during all of the games of the World Cup.''
	   Delhomme, no soccer fan, said he was a little wary of the
snarled traffic, the armed police and boisterous visitors.
	   ``But, after all,'' he concluded, ``it's a good thing. Parisians
are so sad, so stressed, and this is a change. All these people in
colors and a happy mood. It is something new to talk about.''

	   Former president Soeharto celebrated his 77th birthday yesterday
with a cheerful, albeit simple ceremony attended by his six
children and spouses, 12 grandchildren and great-grandchild at his
residence on Jl. Cendana, Central Jakarta.
	   Security officials politely asked journalists not to cover the
party, saying that Soeharto wanted to have an intimate dinner with
his family.
	   The officials said the former president cut a tumpeng
(traditional yellow rice cone) and presented the first serving to
his eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana.
	   The widowed Soeharto -- his wife Tien died in 1996 -- received
bouquets of flowers from close friends and top government
officials, including a bouquet of white jasmine sent by
Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung.
	   It was not known whether President B.J. Habibie sent flowers to
the man he once called his ``political professor''. Habibie was
previously among the most regular visitors to Soeharto's birthday
celebrations.
	   ``I am sorry,'' an official told journalists at the gate. ``Pak
Harto appreciates your attention, but he really wants to have a
family gathering.''
	   For the first time in years, state-owned TVRI did not feature a
report from the birthday party on its 9 p.m. World News bulletin.
	   Since retiring last month, Soeharto has not played golf, his
favorite sport, and keeps himself amused by walking around his
house every morning.
	   Officials confirmed Soeharto's plan to counter allegations that
he amassed a huge fortune through abuses of power during his 32
year rule in a press conference today, but added that it might be
delayed at the request of his children.
	   ``His children would prefer him to remain quiet until people
calm down,'' they said.

American, other ambassadors resist Belarus eviction orders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with State Dept. saying deadline extended. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The foreign minister of Belarus warned
ambassadors Tuesday that unless they vacate a diplomatic complex,
the facility could wind up ``floating in its own sewage.''
	   The U.S. ambassador and others have refused to leave the
compound, which is home to 22 diplomats and their families, saying
the government's eviction orders are a violation of international
law.
	   The Foreign Ministry of the former Soviet republic expressed
regret for the ``inconvenience,'' but insisted the officials must
leave their homes in the 50-year-old Drozdy housing complex on the
outskirts of Minsk to permit urgent repairs.
	   ``There is a danger that Drozdy will float in its own sewage,''
Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich said Tuesday on Belarusian state
radio. ``We can't endanger diplomats' lives''
	   The ambassadors say that under international law, their
residences are considered sovereign territory and governments have
no right to enter without permission or insist that diplomats
leave.
	   ``These measures are unacceptable and inadmissible,'' French
Foreign Minister spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said in Paris.
``They are contrary to the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
privileges and immunity.''
	   The United States, Russia, France, Germany and Lithuania have
formally protested the planned eviction. France and Lithuania said
they will recall their ambassadors for consultations if Belarus
persists, and Washington has said it will also take some action in
response.
	   But Antonovich said the issue is not political, it's practical.
And he suggested that foreign countries are overreacting because
they are biased against Belarus, whose authoritarian president has
been criticized in the West.
	   ``There is a tendency to render political coloring to this on
the part of those who are ready to view all events in Belarus only
from political side,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it is a double
standard.''
	   The dispute began in April when the government served notice
that the ambassadors would have to vacate their homes in the
rambling, wooded housing compound by Wednesday.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
Belarusian authorities had extended the deadline by one week, to
June 17. He said Ambassador-at-large Steve Sestanovich summoned the
Belarusian charge d'affaires to protest the eviction notices.
	   ``We have pointed out very clearly at a variety of levels to
Belarus that it is not too late to reverse the self-destructive
course the government has chosen,'' Rubin said.

	   The Indonesian Importers Association (Ginsi) said yesterday that
import activities had dropped more than 80 percent over the last
few months.
	   Association chairman Amirudin Saud said the sharp drop in
imports, which totaled US$41.67 billion last year, was caused by
the refusal of most Indonesian letters of credit (L/C) by foreign
banks.
	   Moreover, most local banks, which are suffering from a liquidity
crisis, require importers to pay up front the full amount of the
L/Cs they want to open, Amiruddin added.
	   ``Most of the remaining import activities now are based on the
trust built from long-term relationships between buyers and their
foreign partners, which allow transactions without L/Cs,'' Amirudin
told reporters at his office.
	   Latest official data showed total imports declined by 35.2
percent in March to US$2.37 billion compared to those in the same
month of last year.
	   Since the monetary crisis hit the country and shook the banking
sector, most L/Cs issued by local banks have been turned down by
overseas banks.
	   Amirudin said some companies, which have had business
relationships with foreign companies for as long as 20 years, were
allowed to import goods without L/Cs under credit payments of up to
six months.
	   ``In some cases, foreign partners deal in raw materials which
cannot be kept for too long so that they often don't have much of a
choice but to sell to the Indonesian importers, even without an
L/C,'' he said.
	   Commodities which are still being imported include chemical
materials, textiles and medicines.
	   Importers unable to continue their activities have simply
deposited their funds at local banks to earn high interests for
paying order to pay their workers, he said.
	   A foreign businessman, whose company supplies iron and steel to
Indonesia, complained yesterday that he had yet to receive payments
from Bank Danamon, which issued the L/Cs for his goods.
	   Since Danamon's management was taken over by the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA), the agency has not paid any of its
debts, said the businessman, who asked for anonymity.
	   IBRA is supposed to meet all business obligations of the banks
put under its supervision.
	   ``IBRA has made promises but has given no solid dates.
Meanwhile, nobody who has claims on IBRA has been paid,'' he said.
	   ``How do you expect creditors to supply more goods, if we do not
even know when we'll get paid?'' he said.
	   Commenting Soehardjo's resignation last week as the director
general of customs and excise, Amirudin called on the government to
appoint a new head from the ranks within customs and excise office.
	   ``We heard that Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto will
appoint someone from outside the customs service to replace
Soehardjo,'' Amirudin said, referring to reports that Martiono
Hadianto, former director general of state-owned companies, would
replace Soehardjo.
	   Amirudin warned the government against repeating its past
mistakes of placing an ``outsider'' to the top position at the
customs and excise office.
	   From 1970 to 1991, all the directors general were appointed from
outside, causing disorder in the system, he said.
	   Soehardjo, a brother-in-law of former president Soeharto,
resigned Friday, saying he was not capable of speeding up reform
and modernization in the customs and excise office.

Drug producers point finger at U.S. and its drug users
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, LEADS with Myanmar and Colombia urging funds to stamp
out illicit crop production &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Officials from two of the world's leading
sources of narcotics told the U.N. drug conference Tuesday that
programs to wipe out illicit crops will fail without money to help
farmers grow alternative crops.
	   The United States has been non-committal to a U.N. proposal,
under discussion at the three-day General Assembly special session
on drugs, to provide financial incentives to Third World farmers to
stop growing cannabis, opium poppies and coca, the raw ingredient
of cocaine.
	   President Ernesto Samper of Colombia told reporters that his
country's experience showed that ``forced eradication'' will fail
in the longterm ``if not accompanied by crop substitution
programs.''
	   ``Once the field has been fumigated, if there is no program to
offer the peasant crop substitution, he has no other choice but to
resow coca,'' Samper added. He said Colombian farmers can earn 10
times as much growing coca as selling corn.
	   In a speech to the second day session, the interior minister of
Myanmar, Col. Tin Hlaing, said lack of funds could be the
``Achilles' heel for the plan'' to eliminate ``illicit narcotic
crops during the coming 10 years.
	   He said Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, ``attaches great
importance'' to eradicating opium poppies but needs ``sufficient
funds on a sustained and predictable basis'' for ``alternative
development projects.''
	   Colombia is the world's leading producer of cocaine, and its
traffickers bring home an estimated dlrs 5 billion a year from
selling the drug in the United States. Myanmar is the world's
largest source of illicit opium and heroin.
	   U.S. officials have shown little enthusiasm for the U.N. crop
substitution program, apparently because funds could go to
countries such as Afghanistan and Myanmar which have not been
formally certified as a U.S. drug-fighting ally.
	   Afghanistan and Myanmar have been decertified. Countries that
fail certification are denied aid, unless the president waives
penalties in the national interest.
	   The United States waived the sanctions against Colombia last
February, citing improved counternarcotics performance and Samper's
departure from office in August.
	   Samper was viewed as an ally of drug lords based on a dlrs 6
million contribution he received during his 1994 presidential
campaign.
	   During his speech to the opening session Monday, President
Clinton announced a dlrs 2 billion, five-year media campaign
against drugs. Afterward, U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey criticized
crop substitution programs for certain countries.
	   McCaffrey would not say whether the United States would support
a global crop substitution program. ``It's a problem for regional
community solutions, not just funding for alternative economic
development,'' he said.
	   The United Nations conference ends Wednesday.

 &UR; Eds: Adds quotes Stubbs in 5th graf, updates result

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Rain disrupted the DFS Classic for
the second straight day Tuesday, but Steffi Graf did manage to get
in some practice for her latest comeback.
	   Graf, who has played in only two tournaments since undergoing
knee surgery last year, is looking for as much match play as
possible before Wimbledon.
	   Seeded No. 1 here, the German is scheduled to play Australian
qualifier Rennae Stubbs in a second-round match Wednesday.
	   Stubbs, who is coming back from eight months out with a wrist
injury, said she would be nervous playing the former World number
one.
	   ``It'll be a big occasion and there will be a lot of interest in
Steffi coming back _ but I hope we'll have some fun,'' Stubbs said
after beating Shi-Ting Wang of Chinese Taipei in a first round
match Tuesday.
	   ``I've practised a lot against her, so I'm used to running
around picking up the balls and giving her lots of confidence. I
really hope she makes a successful comeback but I hope she's not
too successful just yet.''
	   Italy's Laura Golarsa, a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon in 1989,
won the first completed match of the grass-court tournament
Tuesday.
	   Her match against Czech Denisa Chladkova was delayed by three
hours, and then again for almost an hour during the second set, but
the rain stopped long enough for Golarsa, ranked 79th in the world,
to win 6-3, 7-5.

	   Indonesia's private sector foreign debt due this fiscal year,
including that owed by commercial banks, totals US$29.2 billion,
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said yesterday.
	   Speaking to journalists after meeting President B.J. Habibie,
Ginandjar said external corporate debt stood at US$20 billion and
the non-trade liabilities of commercial banks at $9.2 billion.
	   ``Hence, last week's agreement to reschedule the foreign debts
for up to eight years, including three years of grace period, would
be quite a relief.
	   ``If we (our companies) have to repay entirely these $30 billion
debts, it would be quite a pressure on our balance of payments
because that amount is more than twice as large as our foreign
exchange reserves'', Ginandjar added.
	   Ginandjar, along with Director General of Financial Institutions
Glenn Yusuf, Bank Indonesia Director Dono Iskandar and Indonesian
debt settlement team chairman Radius Prawiro, met with Habibie to
report about an agreement with creditors to restructure the
country's mounting private foreign debt.
	   Indonesia and its creditor banks agreed in Frankfurt last week
on a program relating to private corporate debt, external credits
to the Indonesian banking system and trade finance.
	   The corporate debt arrangements envisaged the creation of the
Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency (INDRA), fully backed by the
Indonesian government and administered by the central bank, Bank
Indonesia.
	   INDRA will provide exchange-rate risk protection and assurances
as to the availability of foreign exchange to private debtors that
agree with their creditors to restructure their external debt for a
period of eight years, with three years of grace during which no
principle will be payable.
	   ``The immediate benefit from the debt rescheduling agreement is
that our balance of payments, which has been under severe pressure
so far, will be given a chance to breathe,'' Ginandjar said.
	   However, he could not predict how many debtors and creditors
would join the INDRA program as participation in INDRA was
voluntary and would require the consent of both debtors and
creditors.
	   Debtors and creditors could still negotiate to find the best
solutions for them. But if they could not reach an agreement, they
could join INDRA. The creditors could also demand the debtors be
liquidated.
	   ``So, if they can get a better deal, please go ahead. They could
work it out outside INDRA. But if not, they should join INDRA
arrangement,'' Ginandjar said.
	   Radius explained that participants in INDRA will be entitled to
purchase U.S. dollars at the best real 20-day average market
exchange rate from August 1 until June 30, 1999.
	   The debtors would be able to repay their debt in rupiah to INDRA
at a set interest rate for eight years and Indra would repay the
debt to the lenders.
	   Dono predicted that the rupiah would start to strengthen when
the program becomes operational on August 1 as demand for dollars
should drop.
	   ``The current (dollar-rupiah) exchange rate is still too high
because demand for dollars and other foreign exchange are still
increasing due to our huge debts.
	   ``But when debtors and creditors agree to restructure their
debts, according to the INDRA scheme, the demand for dollars will
drop, and the rupiah should strengthen,'' Dono added. Copyright

	   FANS of Rohana Jalil brace yourself. One of Malaysia's
longest-serving singers (since the Seventies) is recording a new
album which will include some of her best-loved hits.
	   According to a Press release from her recording company NSR, the
album may include hit songs such as Rintik Rintik Hujan, Cinta Yang
Terbiar, Rayuanku and Perjalananku, all of which will be given new
arrangements and perspectives.
	   The album, expected out by year end, will be produced by Jimmy
Ali.
	   HOW would you like to win prizes lying down, while listening to
the radio? Of course it's possible, especially if you're a metal
maniac who listens to Time Highway Radio (THR).
	   Pony Canyon's bands - Pilgrims, F.T.G and Necromanicide - and
THR invite you to be with them between 1pm and 5pm daily from today
until June 19.
	   If you're lucky to get a line and the right answers to the quiz,
you will win compact discs by your favourite groups. For more info,
tune in to the station.
	   REVIEWS KARMA - Karma (Warner Music): It took seven years for
Azman Warren and his friends, otherwise known as Karma, come out
with this album, but it's worth the wait.
	   The band, once under Roslan Aziz Productions (RAP), took quite a
while to select suitable material. Apparently, the years also saw
several line- up changes, hence the delay.
	   Karma's self-titled debut effort is a mature and rather
unconventional (if you compare it with other Malay rock bands)
effort. All the songs are engaging with meaningful lyrics
(including those by Mukhlis Noor), while the uncluttered and
sophisticated arrangements make the album a winner.
	   Nothing hard-rocking here but who cares? Azman's voice and
singing style is the main strength of the album. Just listen to the
first two tracks and you'll know you're in for a good time.
	   Performance: REDANG - Qasidah Nuraisha (Ambang Klasik): As the
title suggests, expect a lot of fusion work all the genres you
could think of that make up Malaysian music. From traditional
instruments to ethnic sounds, combined with modern sensibility,
this album represents a form of unity.
	   Redang's music has that rather attractive ``dark undertone'',
especially with the overlapping of wails, chants and drones that
create a rather sombre ambience. If you're not into conventional
straight-forward lyrics, this album could be for you. The songs are
laced with ``artistic expressions'' and poetic metaphors.
Occasionally, they do come out rather blur, though. Still, Redang's
debut is a good start for a ``different'' kind of music movement.
	   Performance: VARIOUS ARTISTES - Kenangan Abadi Ilham Seni
Seniman Agung P. Ramlee (Life Records): This is proof that P.
Ramlee's songs are as versatile as he was. These numbers could be
performed by almost any self-respecting singer in different ways.
	   In this album, for instance, we have Hetty Koes Endang's version
of Jangan Tinggal Daku with that certain bossa nova touch, Noraniza
Idris' traditional-feel Jari Jariku Sakit Semua, and Imam S.
Arifin's dangdut version of Engkau Laksana Bulan. The more
``contemporary'' sounds can be heard in Iis Sugianto's light and
jazzy Azizah as well as Domino's a capella version of Ku Rindu
Padamu.
	   Most of the songs are lifted from albums recorded over the years
by a variety of singers. For sentimentalists, this is definitely a
good listen.

	   PETALING JAYA, Sun. - Media baron Rupert Murdoch who flew in for
a short visit today held talks with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad and his deputy Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The chairman of News Corp - a global film, publishing and
television group - saying he ``was just passsing through'' also
visited the Astro station in Sungei Besi. Astro has a collaboration
with Murdoch's Hong Kong-based Star channel.
	   Met at the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang before his
departure to China, Murdoch said he did not discuss anything about
his business interest or the region's economic problems with Dr
Mahathir and Anwar.
	   ``I was just passing through. We talked on world affairs,'' he
said.
	   Asked whether his visit could be a prelude to him acquiring
stakes in local companies to expand his media empire, he reiterated
that this was not the case.
	   Present at the airport to see him off was Tan Sri T. Ananda
Krishnan, head of Measat Broadcasting Sdn Bhd which runs Astro. He
said Murdoch was very helpful and supportive of Malaysia.
	   ``He (Murdoch) says Malaysia is a wonderful place to do business
and invest.''
	   He added that Murdoch also expressed his confidence in the
country's economy, adding that it would recover from the existing
downturn. However, Ananda said Murdoch did not indicate if he was
interested to invest here.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - Consumers have every right to complain of
poor utility services arising out of negligence.
	   National Consumer Protection Council chairman Datuk Moehamed
Izat Emir today said consumers must be well-informed and
articulate.
	   Alluding to the water crisis affecting parts of Klang Valley, he
said besides creating awareness, consumer associations could play a
significant role in evaluating the efficiency of services like
roads, electricity, telephone and water supply.
	   Consumer understanding of their rights and protection must be
improved in all areas, and the associations must play a bigger role
than fighting price increases.
	   Commenting on the public forum on water which was cancelled
following police refusal to issue a permit to its organiser, Fomca,
he said: ``It is good and healthy to discuss it so that the service
can improve but if the police cancelled it, they must have a good
reason for doing so.''
	   He felt media coverage on consumer associations gave the
impression that their role was confined to prices of goods and
services.
	   The associations should emulate their counterparts in some
developed nations, which had managed to raise the level of
awareness on consumer rights.
	   ``Take road crashes as an example. Road users, who are
consumers, must be made to realise that are many factors which
could lead to accidents.
	   ``Carelessness or negligence is often cited as the cause; but
there is also the possibility that poor road design or lack of
safety measures could have contributed to the crash.''
	   In developed nations, consumers know their rights better. They
might sue supermarkets for negligence if they fell while shopping
because the floor was wet.
	   Moehamed Izat reckoned the level of consumer protection in
Malaysia was still far from satisfactory, partly because many
consumers left the task of pursuing the matter to consumer leaders.
	   ``Many never bothered to become members. To be strong, consumer
associations not only need a large membership, but also moral
support from society.''
	   Moehamed Izat said the downturn demonstrated how consumer rights
had been neglected.
	   ``Take banks for example. During good times, customers were
regarded as partners. But when times are bad, even the innocent
clients were affected as they are denied funds.''

Israeli generals visit Temple Mount 31 years after Old City's
</HEADLINE>
capture &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister and army generals
past and present toured areas of Jerusalem captured by Israel 31
years ago this week and made a rare visit Tuesday to the Temple
Mount, the site of Islam's third holiest shrine.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai participated in the tour led
by chief of staff Lt. Gen Amnon Shakak. The group also toured parts
of the West Bank which Israel captured during the June 1967 Mideast
war from Jordan.
	   The Temple Mount complex houses the al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock
mosques which are holy to Islam and is believed to sit atop the
site of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed in A.D. 70. Groups of
right-wing religious Jews who want to rebuilt the Temple often try
to enter the Temple Mount but are turned back by police who fear
their presence will touch of riots with Arab worshipers on the
site.
	   Ibrahim al Sabri, Jerusalem's highest Muslim cleric, said the
generals presence was not viewed as a threat. ``There is no need
for any coordination. The al Aqsa is of course open for the public
and people of all religions,'' Sabri said.
	   Jerusalem is at the center of the Israeli-Arab conflict. Israel
annexed the eastern half shortly after its capture and the
Palestinians want it as the capital of their future state. The
city's future is slated for talks on a final peace agreement
between the two sides.

World Cup: Paraguayan goalie bent on scoring in France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUAN ZAMORANO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAPIERS, France (AP) - Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis
Chilavert has made it clear he's determined to help his team in the
World Cup anyway he can, even if it means scoring a few goals
himself.
	   Chilavert, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, worked hard
under the crossbar in Tuesday's practice session. Then he switched
roles and fired left-footed free kicks from outside the area,
showing off his power and precision for the benefit of about a
hundred cheering fans.
	   Not only a defensive force, seemingly able to blocks incoming
shots at will, he can also score. Chilavert, of Argentina's Velez
Sarsfield, frequently rushes up the field to take free kicks and
penalty shots, and holds the world record for goals scored by a
goalkeeper.
	   ``Everything's possible in soccer,'' Chilavert said. ``Many used
to think a goalkeeper couldn't score goals and I've tallied 35 in
my 17-year career.''
	   He displays the same competitive attitude when talking about
Paraguay's chances of advancing to the second round of the World
Cup, even though it is clearly the weakest team in a group that
includes favorite Spain, Nigeria and Bulgaria. Paraguay and
Bulgaria open Group D play Thursday in Montpellier.
	   ``Many take it for granted that Spain is the favorite, but we
don't think so. Soccer has levelled throughout and Paraguay is not
below anybody,'' he said.
	   Chilavert shrugs away press criticism following Paraguay's
losses in pre-Cup matches to the Cezch Republic, Romania, Belgium
and the Netherlands, the last one a 5-1 rout.
	   ``There are many jealous people in my country, especially
journalists,'' said the outspoken Chilavert, who refuses to speak
to Paraguayan reporters.
	   His relationship with Brazilian-born coach Paulo Cesar
Carpegiani has also been rocky.
	   Chilavert was not called for several friendly matches this year
after he made disparaging comments about Paraguayan president Juan
Carlos Wasmosy. He will undoubtedly set the tone for the team.

Corp. under the Asean industrial cooperation (Aico) scheme.
	   Emmanuel Velasco, chair of the commission, said government might
retain the 50% margin of preference or discount on existing rates,
set specific rates for different products that would be entered
under Aico or peg a flat 1.5% tariff under the brand-to-brand
complementation scheme and 3.5% on new products that would be
covered by Aico.
	   Velasco said the interagency tariff and related matters
committee would pick out one option that would apply to Toyota
Philippines.
	   Aico is a pan-Asean cooperation scheme that extends preferential
tariffs of between 0% and 5% to joint-venture projects of at least
two firms each in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and
Thailand.
	   The scheme is aimed at encouraging manufacturers in southeast
Asia to join forces and take advantage of each other's strengths to
come up with a product that can be sold in the region. All imports
under the scheme will be levied duties of between 0% and 5%. It is
considered as the ``accelerated'' version of the common effective
preferential tariff scheme under the Asean free trade area.
	   Aico replaced the brand-to-brand complementation scheme under
the Asean industrial joint venture, which grants a minimum 50%
margin of preference or tariff rate discounts.
	   Toyota wants the 1.5% tariff it enjoyed under the brand-to-brand
complementation scheme restored instead of 3.5% under Aico.

	   A South Korean shoe firm ground to an abrupt standstill
yesterday when all 2,500 workers went on strike to protest alleged
intimidation by two police officers hired by the company as
executives.
	   About 100 of their colleagues lodged their grievance with the
National Commission on Human Rights, demanding the body insist PT
Bosaeng Jaya immediately fire the two officers.
	   ``We cannot work in comfort and always feel afraid since the two
wear their police uniforms in the factory all the time and never
want to listen to our complaints,'' said workers' spokesman
Pratigto.
	   He claimed that the two, whom he identified as Maj. Gatot
Budisutopo and Maj. Budyono from the National Police headquarters,
often forced employees to resign without receiving proper
compensation.
	   According to Pratigto, the officers -- employed at the firm for
seven years as factory manager and personnel manager respectively
-- were used by the South Korean owners as the ``shield'' in their
interactions with local employees.
	   None of the Korean executives showed up to discuss the problem
with workers yesterday, he said.
	   ``We'll continue to strike until the two police officers are
dismissed from our company,'' Pratigto said. Workers are also
seeking annual bonuses and proper work-safety equipment.
	   The executives were unavailable for comment.
	   In May, several representatives of the workers lodged a similar
complaint with the commission.
	   According to commission member B.N. Marbun, who received the
protesters yesterday, his institution had sent letters for
confirmation to the National Police and City Police but had not
received a reply.
	   Marbun promised to send another letter to the National Police
Headquarters soon to ask for help to clarify the matter and the
status of the officers.
	   When asked to comment, National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Da'i
Bachtiar said: ``We'll double check on the case soon and trace the
names of the two officers before we come out with our final
judgment.
	   ``The two might have picked up the police uniforms off the
street.''
	   After visiting the commission, the employees headed to the
Jakarta Legal Aid Institute to seek legal advice.

Saudi Arabia denies U.S. asked for delay of Arab summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia denied Tuesday that the
United States had pressured it to delay a proposed Arab summit on
the stalled Middle East peace talks.
	   ``There is no truth at all that the United States has asked
Saudi Arabia to delay (holding) any Arab summit,'' the Saudi royal
court said in a statement.
	   Hopes for holding the conference have faded after several Arab
countries expressed doubts about its outcome.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had pushed for the summit to
put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept
a compromise of a further 13 percent pullback in the West Bank.
	   But the United States had reportedly asked Arab leaders to
postpone the summit, arguing that it needed more time to persuade
Netanyahu to accept its suggestions.

	   Winners Restaurant. Founded on the elements of inspiration,
faith in people, and old-fashioned values, this new restaurant
along Arnaiz Ave.
	   (Pasay Road) is the brainchild of the young and dynamic
entrepreneurs from new company World's Best Food International. The
group has come up with the first thematic restaurant in honor the
world's greatest achievers.
	   Unlike other themed restaurants, Winners goes beyond coordinated
decor. It highlights world-class greats like bowling wunderkind
Paeng Nepomuceno, pool wizard Efren ``Bata'' Reyes, and golf
prodigy Tiger Woods. Winners restaurant also celebrates Lea
Salonga's broadway triumph, the victorious EDSA Revolution, and
Nelson Mandela's movement in South Africa.
	   The Winners menu specializes in Fusion Cuisine. It mixes
influences of Hispanic, Californian, Continental, and Filipino
culinary cultures. The list of entrees include New Zealand Mussels
Baked in Butter, Crispy Fried Mongo and Shrimps Wrapped in Sweet
Potato Chips, Broiled Eggplant Soup Garnished with Pork Crackling,
and Fresh Pasta Stuffed with Cheese and Smothered in Meaty Sauce.
	   TRATTORIA GOURMET'S. An innovative restaurant idea
conceptualized a year and a half ago by entrepreneurs Paolo Nesi of
L'Opera Restaurant and Ernest Escaler of the Gourmet's Cafe group,
Trattoria Gourmet's has opened another branch at the ground level
of Robinson's Place in Ermita. The cozy, attractive restaurant
combines the best of both L'Opera and Gourmet's Cafe, achieved
through a healthful, authentic Italian menu. Crisp-crusted pizzas,
organically grown salad greens, fresh pasta, and a delectable
selection of entrees done in the light Mediterranean fashion are
offered daily. A new addition is its coffee and grappa bar
featuring the popular Gourmet Coffee and a choice selection of
plain and flavored grappas. This pleasant addition to the
reinvigorated Ermita-Malate scene promises to be a pleasant stop
for both the dining and late night crowds.
	   MARIO'S. Sumptuous ``Breakfast Buffet,'' featuring a wide
assortment of breakfast delights, is offered every Tuesday and
Thursday at Mario's Ayala (P195++) and Ortigas (P255++). Both
branches also offer ``Dine and Wine on Us,'' which features beef
dishes that may come with a complimentary glass or bottle of house
wine; and ``Lunch Smorgasbord'' for only P245++ (Monday-Saturday at
Ortigas; until Friday at Ayala). The Mario's Quezon City outlet,
meanwhile, serves the affordable ``Executive Lunch Express,''
	   featuring the chef's special with soup and dessert, during
weekdays.
	   Mario's also offers the ``Early Bird Promo,'' which gives
discounts of 20% on food and beverages from 5-7 p.m. Try the
restaurant's Truly Fruities, thirst-quenching fresh fruit juices,
as well as its revved up function rooms, for both business and
pleasure.
	   BENNIGAN's. From its interesting menu, Bennigan's in Glorietta,
Makati unveils Shrimp Fan-tastic. One serving consists of five
jumbo tempura shrimps, garnished with a lemon wedge, a scoop of
cole slaw, seasoned french fries, Jalapeno tartar sauce, and
cocktail sauce.
	   BEVERLY HILLS DELI. At its Boni branch, lunchtime is ``All You
Can Eat''
	   time, every weekday, for only P195++. At the Boni and Greenbelt
Delis, unique burger selections with thick, oven-roasted fries are
also offered.
	   Affordable ``Dinner Sizzlers'' with free bottomless softdrinks
are available in all Delis.
	   STUDEBAKER'S. The Top Down presents ``Wall Street Lunch,''
featuring small board lunch variations: salad buffet of choice
fillings and dressings (P100++); pasta buffet corner featuring
pasta prepared according to a customer's preference (P130++); and
chef's special - main courses of beef, pork, fish, and fowl
(P160++). Also included in the food promo: par value lunch: salad
and pasta bar only (P160++); big board lunch: salad, pasta, and
chef's special (P250++).
	   Kenny Rogers Roasters. Serving more than just its trademark
roasted chicken, Kenny Rogers introduces its latest sure winner:
Honey Bourbon Baby Back Ribs. Coming from the leanest back portion
of suckling pigs, the baby back is baked until tender - the meat
practically falls off the bone.
	   Selecta Collection. In line with the Centennial celebration,
Selecta Dairy Products Inc. celebrates the uniqueness of Filipino
taste with the Selecta Collection Flavors of the Islands featuring
favorite specialties from different parts of country, namely, Cebu
Mangga Espesyal, Bohol Ube Leche Flan, Batangas Tsokolate at Kasuy,
Laguna Buco Pandan Cake, and Quezon Coco Fiesta.
	   The attractive can designs for the new Selecta collection is
designed by noted cartoonist Larry Alcala. They are hinged on
Alcala's whimsical portrayal of the average Filipino. The cans
exhibit famous landmarks in history and, as always, Alcala's
self-caricature is hidden in the picture.
	   Alcala admits having to do some brushing up on his History. He
also had to gather photographs of historical places and monuments,
choose which to feature, and chronologically fit them into a
lay-out that would create a good design.
	   photo captions: 1. Winners Manager Reginald Miniano and Chef
Gillete Garcia with some of the restaurant's winning specialties.
	   2. Kenny Rogers' Honey Bourbon Baby Back Ribs.
	   3. Trattoria Gourmet's country-style setting.

	   The government urged Governor Sutiyoso yesterday to insist that
the owners of Hotel Mulia immediately pay their Rp 20.5 billion
(US$1.7 million) fine for building the hotel two-and-a-half times
higher than their permits allowed.
	   The City municipality, if necessary, could take legal action
against the hotel's owners, which include former president
Soeharto's second son Bambang Trihatmodjo, Minister of Sports and
Youth Affairs Agung Laksono told reporters.
	   ``It's the Hotel Mulia management's moral responsibility. I
believe they knew that they violated the rules but they just
ignored it,'' Agung said.
	   He suggested the governor and his city administration set a firm
deadline, or, if necessary, require payment without delay.
	   The city administration could endorse immediate and transparent
measures against the hotel's management without any hesitation,
Agung said.
	   Since Soeharto resigned demands have mounted for all covert
cases to be resolved and not be allowed to pile up, he added.
	   ``They're (the ownership of the hotel) all well-educated people,
they must have known their rights and their duties,'' Agung
stressed.
	   The management and contractor of the five-star hotel, the Mulia
Group, was fined last year for violating 1975 bylaw No. 4 on
high-rise buildings and 1985 bylaw No. 9 on building height
regulations.
	   Based on the block plan approved for the hotel project, signed
jointly by former Jakarta governor Surjadi Soedirja and the then
state secretary/minister Moerdiono, the owners were allowed to
construct a 16-story structure.
	   The owners -- the Jakarta Country Club and the Mulia Group --
however, proceeded to construct a 40-story tower.
	   The Jakarta Country Club is a subsidiary of the 1997 Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games Consortium, chaired by Bambang, that financed the
biannual regional sporting extravaganza. Another major shareholder
is National Sports Council Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar.
	   None of the hotel's owners were available for comment yesterday
and the management refused to discuss the issue.
	   Former governor Surjadi at first warned the group over the
violation but subsequently backtracked by letting the construction
proceed on the grounds that the hotel was badly required to
accommodate participants of the 19th SEA Games held last October.
	   Added to the scorn, the hotel was also said to have been
constructed on a plot owned by the Gelora Senayan Management Board,
according to the board's executive director Yasidi Hambali.
	   The hotel has a permit to build and use the construction but
still has to pay the ground rent to the board, Yasidi said
yesterday.
	   He, however, admitted the board had never reminded the hotel's
owners about the long-delayed rent fees as the board thought the
issue could be settled later.
	   Yasidi could not reveal the total rent owed by the hotel, which
occupies part of the board's 260-hectare plot in the Senayan area.
	   Round-the-clock construction ensured completion of the tower
before the Games' opening. Soeharto himself inaugurated the
1,008-room hotel before the athletes arrived for the Games.

	   President-elect Joseph Estrada took up the cudgels yesterday for
17 farmers protesting what they termed as government's illegal
takeover of their property in Sumilao, Bukidnon.
	   Estrada, a popular actor known for his pro-poor semantics, had
lunch with the protesters in front of the Department of Agrarian
Reform in Quezon City.
	   The gesture was interpreted as a signal from the incoming Chief
Executive that he wanted a Supreme Court ruling on the Sumilao case
reversed in favor of the protesting farmers.
	   The high court determined in a recent ruling that the farmers
``are not real parties in interest,'' and ruled in favor of another
group of claimants.
	   Estrada said he disagreed with the court's decision, and vowed
to mobilize a legal team to help the farmers in their appeal.
	   He asked the Supreme Court to prioritize the case.
	   Estrada said the appointment of former leftist leader Horacio
Morales should work in favor of Sumilao's farmers.

	   A group of 50 members of the United Development Party (PPP) have
asked the party's Jakarta chapter chairman Rusjdi Hamka and his
brother Affif Hamka to leave their posts at the City Council.
	   The group coordinator, Andy M. Sholeh, accused Rusjdi, who is
deputy council speaker, of acting nepotistically in recruiting
Affif as a councilor for the 1998/2003 term.
	   His brother is now deputy chairman of Council Commission E for
social welfare.
	   ``Our move is in reaction to the council's recent promise to
bring an end to collusion, corruption and nepotism in their
affairs.
	   ``For that reason we urge Rusjdi and Affif to step down,''
Sholeh told council speaker Edy Waluyo.
	   Rusjdi and Affif are sons of the late Hamka, one of the
country's most respected ulemas.
	   According to Edy, the council had earlier received a similar
request from the PPP Central Jakarta branch office demanding three
of the parties' councilors -- Affif, Ali Imran Husein and Azwar
Abbas -- resign for the same reasons.
	   However, the chapter gave no further details, Edy said.
	   ``Principally, it's the party's responsibility to take action
against their members,'' he said.
	   Rusjdi and Affif were not available to comment yesterday, but
colleagues Ali and Azwar denied the accusations and said they were
recruited through a legal process.
	   ``I was brought onto the council because of my experience in the
party since 1982,'' said Ali.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Photographs taken by Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto will be displayed at the Tretyakov Art Gallery in
Moscow, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Hashimoto's wife, Kumiko, will open the display on Thursday,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting the Japanese Embassy.
	   Japanese Ambassador Takehiro Togo said the photographs show
Japanese landscapes, sights in other countries and three
photographs taken by the prime minister during a meeting with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the Siberian city of
Krasnoyarsk.
	   The ambassador said Hashimoto has long been interested in
photography and has had other personal exhibitions in San Francisco
and Singapore.

	   The first rice strawboard plant in the country, capable of
manufacturing construction panel boards using rice straw as raw
materials, was inaugurated recently in Sta. Barbara, Iloilo by
President Fidel V. Ramos.
	   Landbank officer-in-charge Jesus F. Diaz said locating the
strawboard plant in Iloilo was consistent with the policy of the
Ramos administration to put up processing plants in the countryside
to boost rural industrialization and decongest urban centers.
	   The construction of the P63-million plant was made possible
through the pooled funds of Landbank, the First Iloilo Area
Marketing Co-op, Cooperative Development Authority, and Cooperative
Union of the Philippines, among others.
	   The strawboard technology was provided by the Department of
Science and Technology. Aside from the funding the construction of
the plant, Landbank, the CDA, FIAMCI and CUP likewise extended
institutional assistance to farmer cooperatives involved in the
rice straw project.
	   The project, aside from providing extra income to rice farmers,
will also supply building materials for the housing industry. A
model house using rice straw with a floor area of 36 square meters
costs only about P136,000.
	   The plant has a daily production capacity equivalent to five
housing units of this size.
	   Rice farmers in Central Panay are expected to earn an extra P2
for every kilo of rice straw which they otherwise burn or discard
as waste. With an annual requirement of at least 5,040 tons of rice
straw, farmers will earn P10.1 million from the annual procurements
of the plant. The plant will need at least 2,520 to 5,040 hectares
of ricelands to fill in the requirement.
	   Initially, the project will supply construction materials for
the housing project of the provincial government of Iloilo. A
similar proposal is being considered for the school buildings of
the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.

	   The city administration will soon merge about 200 state
elementary schools which have a scarcity of students, an official
said yesterday.
	   Deputy head of the city's teaching and education office, Gito
Poernomo, said the decision to merge the schools was taken because
they failed to meet the official requirement for a school to
accommodate at least 100 students.
	   Under the plan, which is aimed at improving efficiency in the
teaching and learning process, students and teachers of schools to
be merged will be transferred to the nearest state school in their
area, he said.
	   He said the schools to be most affected by the mergers would be
schools with afternoon classes.
	   ``The students and teachers will not lose anything. They instead
will be able to intensify the learning process and materials given
in morning classes,'' he said.
	   Gito said the students would be expected to spend a couple of
hours after school on vocational studies, which were unavailable at
schools with afternoon classes.
	   The 200 elementary schools to be merged included 60 schools in
Central Jakarta, 65 in South Jakarta, 40 in East Jakarta, 30 in
West Jakarta and one in North Jakarta, said Gito.
	   He said some of the 200 schools might not be merged if there was
only one school in an area.
	   The 200 schools used to accommodate over 100 students each, but
the number dropped when the effects of the economic crisis started
to set in.
	   Many students quit school because their parents could not afford
the tuition fees, said Gito without giving data.
	   He said that after the mergers, several school buildings would
be left empty and therefore demolished to make way for other
buildings.
	   Gito gave no details on what buildings would be built, only that
the land would be used for other purposes.
	   Some of the school buildings to be affected by the plan are
currently used by two different school managements in the morning
and afternoon respectively, he said.
	   The administration merged 35 schools in the first five months of
this year, he said. They consist of six in East Jakarta, nine in
South Jakarta and 10 in each Central and West Jakarta.
	   Gito also said his office had suggested that the governor
eliminate the collection of levies on state elementary school
entrance fees.
	   ``We hope that the governor will agree to eliminate the fees
because it would help parents, especially during this time of
crisis,'' he said.

	   Religious scholars and a political observer voiced concern
yesterday over possible adverse repercussions if people established
religion-affiliated political parties.
	   Moslem scholar Nurcholish Madjid, Jakarta Bishop Julius Kardinal
Darmaatmadja and political observer Mochtar Pabottingi spoke in a
discussion on the emergence of religion-linked political parties at
the Institute of Islamic Studies.
	   Nurcholish said it would be better if political parties did not
carry any religious banners.
	   ``We have had traumatic experiences with religion-based
political parties,'' he said, while referring to a plan by hundreds
of leaders of the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) Moslem organization to set
up a political party. Other organizations, such as Syarikat Islam
and Satuan Karya Ulama, have either declared or expressed their
readiness to become political parties.
	   ``Religion-based political parties would only confuse their
members,'' Nurcholish said, adding that such parties were
irrelevant in a culture as diverse as Indonesia.
	   He said that should NU leaders have a plan to establish a party,
they should avoid names which carry the acronym of NU such as
Nahdlatul Ulama or Nahdlatul Ummat.
	   ``If NU leaders want to set up a political party, they can use
Partai Adil Makmur (Just and Prosperous Party) instead of using
names that remind people of NU,'' he said.
	   Disappointment
	   A political party from the 1950s until the early 1970s, NU
merged with three other Islam-based parties and formed the United
Development Party (PPP). However, it then broke away from PPP out
of disappointment over party executives' policies and decided to
quit politics.
	   Speaking about the recent establishment of the
Chinese-Indonesians for Reform Party (Parti), Nurcholish said it
was their right to set up such a race-based political party.
	   ``However, it should have been avoided as it will only
strengthen the exclusive image of the Chinese-Indonesians,'' he
said.
	   ``In the end, it will become the target of brutal actions of
other major elements of the nation (during unrest) as has happened
in the past,'' he added.
	   Indonesians of Chinese origin have been the victims of various
outbreaks of social unrest in many parts of country over many
years.
	   Nurcholish called on Indonesians not to rush to jump on the
bandwagon and establish political parties of their own without
careful thought.
	   Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan Hamid said yesterday that all
Indonesians now had the freedom to establish political parties of
their own.
	   ``The legality of the three existing political parties and the
newly established parties will depend on the imminent political
laws (currently being drafted by the government),'' Syarwan said
yesterday.
	   Several political parties have been established recently. They
include the Indonesian Women's Party (PP), the Indonesian Workers
Party (PPI), the Musyawarah Kekeluargaan Gotong Royong (MKGR), and
the Parti.
	   Existing laws say only the dominant Golkar, PPP and the
Christian-nationalist alliance Indonesian Democratic Party are
allowed to contest general elections.

	   Lawmakers are still determined to make President-elect Joseph
Estrada soften his stand against the so-called pork barrel funds.
	   Outgoing Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves said that instead
of abolishing pork, government should come up with safeguards to
prevent abuses on the use of pork barrel funds, the derisive term
for the Congressional Initiative Allocation and Countrywide
Development Fund.
	   CDF and CIA were seen by many as source of corruption among
legislators.
	   The incoming President has been very vocal against the
allocation of pork barrel funds in the national budget. He bared
plans to adopt a ``line item''
	   budgeting scheme wherein lawmakers would not anymore be involved
in the implementation of their projects but would only identify
them.
	   But the scheme, according to Teves, would not make any
difference because ``temptation to commit abuses in the use of
these funds will only be transferred from the lawmakers to the
agencies.'' Teves said legislators believed the funds should be
channeled through local executives who were ''more transparent,
effective, and accountable.'' In a memorandum to President Fidel V.
Ramos dated June 3, Teves also proposed that reputable
organizations like the Social Weather Station be tapped to conduct
a survey on the people's sentiments on CDF and CIA.
	   The survey results would guide the incoming administration in
its decision on the pork issue.
	   ``We believe that with the safeguards, congressmen and senators
should still be given the responsibility and opportunity to
identify projects to be funded by the CDF and CIA,'' he stated in
the memorandum.
	   Teves also proposed that lawmakers be required to submit a
periodic report to their constituents on how their respective pork
allocations were used.
	   The report would include name of the projects, location, amount,
names of the contractors, date completed, and the standard cost of
each project as certified by the Pre-qualification Bidding and
Awards Committee (PBAC), District Engineer, and Commission on
Audit.
	   ``This will provide the entire nation with a clearer picture on
how Congress as a whole spent the people's money on physical and
social infrastructure projects,'' he explained.
	   Teves likewise lamented that CDFs and CIAs had been used for
projects and expenses that were ``personal'' in nature like
underwriting luncheon or dinner expenses for civic organizations;
channeling funds to privately owned foundations.
	   A periodic report submitted by each congressman, he said, would
show which projects or expenses were personal in nature.
	   The outgoing lawmaker stressed that CDFs and CIAs should be used
exclusively for physical and social infrastructure projects like
irrigation, farm-to-market roads, school buildings, and
scholarships.
	   Meanwhile, outgoing Bukidnon Rep. Jose Zubiri reiterated his
proposal for Estrada to designate a resident ombudsman to oversee
the projects funded through the pork barrel.
	   The ombudsman, according to Zubiri, would prosecute lawmakers
involved in anomalous projects.
	   ``Some congress members, who are honest, are paying for the
indiscretions of some of their colleagues,'' he noted.
	   He also batted for the junking of the present ``lump sum''
approach to budgeting in favor of the more transparent ``line
item'' budgeting which, he said, would make the pork barrel
obsolete.

	   The three recognized political groupings -- Golkar, the United
Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
-- which have monopolized the political scene for over 25 years,
are facing growing internal dissent which is boiling over into
public rows.
	   Demonstrations and public statements of discontent plagued the
three major political groups yesterday.
	   The PPP headquarters on Jl. Diponegoro, Central Jakarta, was
besieged by 300 party members yesterday.
	   They demanded party leaders hold an extraordinary congress to
elect a new chairman to replace the incumbent Ismail Hasan
Metareum, no later than June 30. The congress is currently
scheduled for August 1999.
	   The PPP Reform Committee, as they called themselves, asked
Ismail to step down and accused him of manipulating the party into
supporting the renomination of Soeharto for president in March.
	   Emron Pangkapi, spokesman for the committee, said that Ismail
had manipulated the decision not to support Soeharto reached by 20
out of 27 provincial councils across the nation during the PPP
leadership meeting in January.
	   ``This manipulative and collusive political act caused the
nation to fall into a crisis of confidence and has hampered the
process of smooth and peaceful reform,'' he said.
	   Emron said that he and his committee would continue to
``occupy'' the headquarters until their demands were met.
	   Next door, 200 members of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
calling themselves the Committee of Megawati Supporters (KPM)
staged a separate rally in front of the PDI office.
	   The protesters demanded that Panangian Siregar, a PDI legislator
loyal to Soerjadi, resign from his new position as State Minister
of Environment because of his involvement in the notorious July 27
incident.
	   They also demanded that Coordinating Minister for Defense and
Security Feisal Tanjung and Minister of Home Affairs Lt. Gen.
Syarwan Hamid step down for their alleged involvement in the same
incident.
	   Followers of the government backed Soerjadi faction forcibly
took over the PDI headquarters on July 27, 1996, which was at the
time occupied by supporters loyal to the ousted chairman Megawati
Soekarnoputri.
	   The protesters, lead by Ribka Tjiptaning from the Tangerang PDI
office, later marched to the nearby Legal Aid Foundation office to
hold a press conference.
	   Meanwhile, in the grounds of the Ministry of Home Affairs, a
group of students staged a demonstration demanding the dissolution
of the ruling Golkar grouping and reform of the other two
authorized parties.
	   The ministry oversees the activities of the three recognized
political groupings.
	   Thirty fully-armed soldiers watched the demonstration closely
but did not intervene.
	   Sundani Abadi of the group calling themselves the Student Action
Front for the Purification of Reform said: ``The people now no
longer trust Golkar. I believe it is logical to say that Golkar,
who have been in power, should take responsibility for bringing the
nation into the current crisis.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports that Senegal and the Republic of Guinea
have sent troops to back government &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The leader of renegade soldiers locked
in battle Tuesday with government troops in the West African nation
of Guinea-Bissau called on President Joao Bernardo Vieira to step
down, while neighboring states sent forces to back the government.
	   Former armed forces chief Brig. Gen. Ansumane Mane, in a
handwritten statement sent to the Portuguese news agency Lusa, said
a transition government should be installed to prepare for
elections in July.
	   Mane, describing himself as head of the self-proclaimed Military
Junta for the Consolidation of Democracy, Peace and Justice, said
he had no intention of seizing power himself.
	   In a later message to Lusa, Mane offered negotiations if
government forces ended their siege of rebel troops holed up at
military installations in the suburbs of the capital.
	   Without talks, the fighting will degenerate into ``a
bloodbath,'' Lusa quoted Mane's message as saying.
	   Mane's statements came after the government had launched an
unsuccessful pre-dawn attack aimed at dislodging an unknown number
of rebel soldiers from positions they held.
	   Later Tuesday the Portuguese Secretary of State for Foreign
Communities said forces from neighboring Senegal and the Republic
of Guinea had arrived in Guinea-Bissau to back the government
troops.
	   Jose Lello told reporters in Lisbon that the foreign troops had
artillery and armored vehicles.
	   Lusa reported that 1,300 soldiers had arrived from Senegal and
400 from the Republic of Guinea.
	   The general, fired six months ago during an investigation into
arms trafficking with the separatist rebels of Casamance, a
Senegalese region that borders Guinea-Bissau to the north, had
waited until Saturday to officially step down.
	   In his written statement, Mane accused Vieira of corruption and
abuse of power by meddling in parliamentary affairs.
	   Verification of the statements was not immediately possible.
Diplomats said Mane was illiterate and spoke no Portuguese, only
local tribal languages.
	   There was no immediate reaction available from the president,
who had vowed Sunday to ``use all possible means'' to quash the
revolt swiftly.
	   Foreign Minister Fernando Delfim da Silva called Mane's appeal
for July elections ``a joke.'' Delfim da Silva was interviewed by
phone in Lisbon, where he was stuck because of flight cancellations
to Guinea-Bissau.
	   ``Legislative elections are scheduled for this year and
presidential elections are scheduled for next year,'' he said.
``That is when the mandates for Parliament and the president end
and that's when the ballots will be held. We won't be given orders
by the head of a military junta.''
	   Delfim da Silva said the two military sides were ``deadlocked.''
	   ``The rebels are hemmed in. They're not advancing, but we can't
get them out either,'' he said.
	   Heavy fighting could be heard early in the day at two military
installations in the Bissau suburb of Bra and around the army
headquarters in the suburb of Queije, U.S. embassy spokesman Bryan
Hunt said in a telephone interview with the Lisbon bureau of The
Associated Press.
	   Sporadic mortar and automatic weapons fire continued through the
day and some stray shells hit the Russian embassy, causing slight
damage but no casualties, Hunt said.
	   ``The major offensive by government troops ... was unsuccessful
as far as we can tell. The situation is very unsettled,'' Hunt
said.
	   Hunt said it was not clear which side held the army
headquarters, nor were there any credible figures for the number
killed in the fighting.
	   A reporter for Guinea-Bissau national radio, interviewed by
Lisbon radio TSF on Monday, said he counted 30 bodies scattered
around the bases at Bra.
	   The Bra military installation, which includes a barracks and an
arms depot, is 15 kilometers (10 miles) outside the capital.
	   The nearby international airport remained closed. Peace Corps
representatives and U.S. citizens around the country reported there
was no fighting elsewhere.
	   In downtown Bissau, streets were quiet and people were buying
groceries. Security forces ordered people to return home by noon
(1200GMT), Hunt said.
	   The city power supply was working normally, he said.
	   The ruling PAIGC party said in a statement broadcast on national
radio Tuesday that the government remained in control.
	   The PAIGC _ the Portuguese initials for the African Party for
the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde _ won the 1994 general
election and has 60 lawmakers in the 100-seat National Assembly,
the country's parliament.
	   Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has 1 million people.
Most of them live from farming and fishing.

Blast destroys homeless shelter in Montreal; about 15 hurt

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ An explosion, possibly caused by a severed gas
line, shattered a shelter for homeless people in Montreal on
Tuesday, killing one person and injuring at least 15, police said.
Two staff members were missing.
	   Police said the fatality was a woman who died from her wounds
within a few hours of the blast. Five other people also were
seriously injured, police said.
	   The explosion sheared off one entire wall of the three-story
stone building, spilling rubble into the street in historic Old
Montreal. Firefighters were searching through the debris, unsure if
the missing people _ a nun and a volunteer cook _ were trapped
underneath.
	   An official with the city gas company said a private contractor
who was trying to adjust a meter ruptured a gas pipe shortly before
the explosion.
	   ``Apparently he cut a pipe,'' said Stephane Bertrand. ``There
was a gas leak. He called Gaz Metropolitain and we got here as
quickly as possible... It seems he went into the building to urge
everyone to leave.''
	   No one lived in the Accueil Bonneau shelter _ it was used to
provide meals and shelter for homeless people during the day.
	   Authorities initially reported that about 30 people were
injured, but lowered the figure after determining that some were
counted more than once as they were taken to four different
hospitals.
	   The explosion damaged several adjacent buildings, as well as
tour buses parked near the shelter in an area of Montreal popular
with sight-seers.

	   Publicly listed Bank Universal, a subsidiary of widely
diversified Astra International, will not pay a dividend for the
company's 1997 earnings in a move to safeguard its capital, its
president said yesterday.
	   Stephen Z. Satyahadi said a proposal on not paying the dividend
was one of several corporate plans approved by the bank's
shareholders in an annual shareholders meeting yesterday.
	   He said that all the bank's profits last year would be used to
strengthen its capital as a crucial business strategy to enable the
bank to weather the economic crisis.
	   ``Our chief commissioner, Bapak Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, said
that a bank with stronger capital would survive longer, and our
shareholders agreed with him. I hope the effort will enable our
bank to cope with the current crisis,'' Stephen said.
	   Bank Universal's net profit plunged 52.62 percent to Rp 10.39
billion last year from Rp 21.94 billion in 1996.
	   Stephen said the decline was partly due to the increase in the
company's operation costs.
	   He added that its total assets as of December last year rose to
Rp 5.74 trillion, an increase by 65.67 percent from its figure last
year. Its capital last year rose by 328 percent to Rp 535.34
billion from 162.78 billion in 1996.
	   Stephen also announced that as of May 20, Bank Universal was
83.74 percent owned by publicly listed PT Astra International, 3.69
percent by PT Prahabima, 2.10 percent by PT Telkom's Pension Fund
Foundation, 1.05 percent by Bank Negara Indonesia's Pension Fund
and 0.35 percent by Nomura Singapore Ltd. The remaining 9.07
percent is owned by the public.
	   Stephen said former president Soeharto's daughter Siti Hediati
Prabowo only held 0.92 percent of Bank Universal's total stake
through her ownership in PT Prahabima.
	   He added that PT Prahabima was owned by Sumitro
Djojohadikusumo's family, whose son Prabowo is Siti Hediati's
husband.
	   ``Hediati's stake in bank Universal is only 0.92 percent. She
even holds it through her ownership in her father-in-law's company
PT Prahabima.''
	   He said Bank Universal was managed professionally and had been
appointed by the government as one of 31 banks to issue letters of
credits (L/Cs) backed by U.S credit guarantees.
	   Bank Universal director Jerry Ng said the company suffered a
loss of approximately Rp 56 million due to damage to its six branch
offices in Jakarta in riots last month.
	   ``But the loss will not affect our performance this year because
it is so little compared to our profit,'' he said. He added that
the company expected flat growth this year.
	   Bank Universal booked Rp 7 billion in earnings after tax in this
year's first quarter. Its assets stood at Rp 7.73 trillion as of
March 30.

Polgar defeats Karpov in chess battle of the sexes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
woman chess player, defeated World Chess champion Anatoly Karpov on
Tuesday in the first day of their four-day series of speed matches.
	   ``I think some of my moves made him pause, they were not what he
expected,'' said Polgar, 21. ``With only 22 seconds to go, he made
a wrong move and gave up.''
	   Karpov fought here with the Carokan defense, lost after the 50th
move.
	   The first match, with Judit playing black and using the Bennoni
defense, ended in a tie after the 33rd move.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, although fellow
Russian Garry Kasparov is considered the true world champion.
	   ``Historically, Judit is the greatest woman chess player in the
world,'' Karpov told state-run TV Tuesday.

	   In the past three decades our consciousness about space and the
earth as a habitable planet has been influenced by a new discipline
which is called space science. In many ways space science has
presented us with a new conception of the world.
	   It made us realize that we live on a planet whose size is
diminutive, whose resources are not unlimited and, due to its
unique position relative to the sun, can only ensure our lives
through a very sensitive, destructible, protective system.
	   This is our atmosphere -- a very thin smear of atmospheric
gases. It is like a thin membrane covering the earth, yet it is an
active part of the system and creates within it a structure and
balance of gases which is essential to maintaining life.
	   Without space science, and what it entails, namely space
technology, the facts cited above would not have been realized to
the extent they have.
	   The public often sees contradictory stories in the media about
global or climatic change or even about weather predictions.
	   Not knowing how science operates, people could easily blame the
meteorologist for not knowing his science. Worse still they could
accuse science of fallacy, for not being able to produce ``true
information''.
	   The obvious results from this ill-informed belief may be severe
if policymakers decide to suspend any action until scientists agree
about what is happening.
	   Seemingly controversial issues which bounce around actually are
the working mechanism in science which cannot escape from setting
boundaries on the limits of knowledge.
	   Most of us would have no difficulty in differentiating between
risk and true uncertainty. The first is an event with a known
probability and the second is an event with unknown probability.
Policymakers like to make unambiguous, defensible decisions, which
are often codified into laws and regulations. Inherent within this
system is their desire to know the risk of what they are doing,
rather than a true scientific uncertainty.
	   It is common nowadays for the public to read in newspapers that
``a respected scientific institution'' claims ``global warming is
coming'' and unless something is done to prevent it, catastrophe
will occur. Not long afterward the same public will hear from ``a
reputable scientist'' that ``there is no direct evidence for global
warming''.
	   Some people will react with: ``Don't waste money on something
that may or may not happen''; but other, more moderate people, are
likely to adopt a more positive approach: ``Try to prove which is
true''. Both sources are certainly right in expressing their
findings because they stress two different things.
	   Considering what is known about future climate change, it is
easy to stress a wide range of uncertainties. We should recognize
that what they know is substantial and useful information.
	   An assertion of the magnitude of climatic change may come from
researchers' inability to identify overlooked or underestimated
physical effects that could reduce estimated global warnings due
to, for example, a doubling of carbon dioxide levels in the air.
	   In order to narrow the limit of uncertainties, many new avenues
of research are being encouraged.
	   There should exist a healthy dichotomy between research and
narrowing down the uncertainly. Regarding the case for global
temperature increase, which is used as a fundamental measure of the
effect of increasing trace gases, modeling studies of cloud
effects, surface hydrological and high-altitude response are among
the areas of study that should be pursued.
	   Uncertainties can be obtained from all statistical methods known
to scientists. The long university training, whether in
undergraduate or research laboratories, should be able to cultivate
this kind of culture so that the scientist-to-be gets used to this
salient feature of scientific work.
	   Manipulation
	   In general, scientists reach uncertainties rather than absolute
precision. But when it is improperly disseminated, the findings
could be mistaken by the public who usually associates uncertainty
with scientific results.
	   Many results from space science have been propagated beyond
university and academic walls. Some necessarily invade legislative
offices. Space remote sensing is one of the versatile instruments
to monitor land and natural habitat. In recent years its results
have been used to delineate national policies.
	   It is our utmost concern that the language of the science of
remote sensing be made compatible with legislators' language.
Although legislative language is often open to interpretation,
regulations and rules are much easier to write and enforce if they
are stated in absolute terms.
	   Study of gas traces in an area provides information which is, by
nature, only certain within the study's epistemological and
methodological limits. Regulators are increasingly confronted with
the decision process of scientific certainty.
	   But all of us know how difficult it is to deal with the recent
shift in environmental concerns from visible pollution and
deforestation to subtle threats to life such as radon and
dehydrification.
	   Scientists are often asked or pressured by legislators to supply
such so-far-non-exact-information. When this happens, not only do
frustration and poor communication prevail but also mixed messages
appear in the media. Because of this uncertainty, environmental
issues are often manipulated by political and economic groups.
Scientists coming late on to the scene and other pure-minded groups
may be left in the dark, as is often the case with the pollution
effects of toxic chemicals.
	   The future
	   Like other new technology, space technology creates many
technical spin-offs and new cultures. People who commit themselves
to space technology are working at the highest levels of
technological developments in what is a technological age. They
should also know the basic premises of technology as otherwise they
will be degraded to being poor users of new technology.
	   An important characteristic of space technology is the great
challenge of the hostile space environment. This threat alone,
which is also more severe in respect of material than is generally
known, forms energizing factors for scientific pursuits. It is a
challenge for the scientists and engineers connected with and
working in space technology. Ultimately it fosters the birth of
innovation in many fields of science and human perception.
	   In order to appreciate the meaning of the newly discovered
frontier, a nation has to establish scientific knowledge which is a
prerequisite for progress.
	   Science literacy does not mean memorizing facts about science
and technology but it is a state of mind which enables one to
incorporate exogenous knowledge into the existing frames of
indigenous capabilities. Lectures on any level of education should
be able to transmit basic concepts of science and technology,
rather than transferring the mere facts of data. Uncertainty in
science should be presented in terms of errors in measurements so
that science students become aware of the power and limitation of
their knowledge.
	   Many branches of space science are very close to the discipline
of basic science. As basic science is also supposed to satisfy
one's ``innate curiosity'', teachers and educators should develop
the ability to arouse the interest of their pupils.
	   One way to do that is to be very explicit about the humanistic
aspects of space science and the processes which have led to any
discovery. The advances of science and technology need special
attention to the end that all citizens of modern society acquire
reasonable understanding of the subjects and that those with
special talents in space science find full opportunity to develop
their abilities.
	   The writer is head of Bosscha Observatory and a lecturer in the
School of Astronomy, Bandung Institute of Technology.

World Cup: Norway heavily favored in their first-ever meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Morocco 1994 opponent to Netherlands in 13th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Perfect preparations, no injuries and
perhaps the most impressive warmup record of all World Cup teams.
	   Norway's ``Drillos'', fourth on FIFA's world rankings after
winning their last three exhibitions over fellow Cup teams Denmark,
Mexico and Saudi Arabia by a whopping combined score of 13-2, are
heavily favored to win their first-ever meeting against Morocco on
the opening day of the tournament Wednesday.
	   Norway scored only one goal in three games during a
disappointing 1994 World Cup in the United States. But it would be
much more disappointing should they fail to make the second round
this time.
	   Morocco's ``Atlas Lions'', also playing in the World Cup finals
for the third time, were eliminated in the first round during the
'94 Cup as well. But another early exit would not be a big
surprise. The Moroccans, coached by former French manager Henri
Michel, are clearly the underdogs in this group.
	   Eleven Norwegians are back, most of them with more experience
from some of the toughest leagues in the world. In fact, Norway
could line up a complete starting lineup of English-based players.
	   Coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen watched Morocco draw Chile 1-1 in a
lackluster tuneup in southern France last week.
	   ``Morocco did not play well,'' he said ``Yet I think they were
better than Chile.
	   ``There are no easy matches in the World Cup, but I think we
have a good schedule. If I had the chance to choose, I would never
have picked Brazil in the opening game.''
	   The Moroccans will face a disciplined Norwegian defense that
only allowed two goals in eight games in an unbeaten qualifying
campaign. Norway has played 14 straight games without defeat since
losing 1-0 with a B team away to Australia early last year.
	   Known for its somewhat boring long-ball attack and tireless
running, Olsen will probably stick to his 4-5-1 formation. Tore
Andre Flo, a Cup Winners' Cup champion last month in his first
season with Chelsea, would be the lone striker.
	   Aerial attacks are a Norwegian specialty. So Flo and his older
brother, Jostein, both 1.93 meters (6-foot-4), could be joined by
their cousin Havard Flo (1.85 meters - 6-foot-1) if Olsen decides
to launch an aerial war against the shorter Moroccans with a rare
combo of three relatives.
	   ``Morocco has two or there good players in the air, but that's
it,'' Olsen said.
	   A speedy counterattack is the main offensive weapon from a
defensively oriented Moroccan team. Its key players play together
for Deportivo La Coruna in Spain: defender Noureddine Naybet,
midfielder Mustapha Hadji and forward Salaheddine Bassir.
	   Hadji, a native of France, played eight years for French club
Nancy. Naybet, a sweeper with more than 90 caps, is one of eight
veterans back on the team from 1994.
	   In the 1994 World Cup, Morocco lost all three matches _ against
the Netherlands (2-1), Belgium (1-0) and Saudi Arabia (2-1). Adding
to the team's frustration was its 1-0 quarterfinals loss to South
Africa in the 1998 African Nations Cup in Burkina Faso.
	   Michel, who has led the Atlas Lions since 1995 after coaching
France to the 1986 World Cup semifinals in Mexico, says the Nations
Cup defeat is a huge motivating factor.
	   The players ``want to prove that what happened in Burkina Faso
is not representative of their real abilities,'' Michel said.
	   ``The World Cup is the best chance for them to prove their
abilities.''

	   Quezon Rep. Wigberto Tanada yesterday called for a thorough
audit of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) before subjecting it to
another round of privatization.
	   Tanada also proposed that an inquiry be conducted to determine
the effects of a privatization on funds kept at PNB, particularly
the $280 million Marcos money which was transferred from the
family's Swiss Bank accounts, and intended for human rights victims
during the dictatorship..
	   ``So, where's the money? What will happen to it when PNB is
privatized? What about the claims of the human right victims?'' he
asked.
	   PNB, which is 46%-owned by government will be privatized in June
1999.
	   Tanada added that the regional financial crisis was a
''convenient excuse'' for PNB's problems. Tanada said PNB was
already experiencing difficulties even before the regional crisis
which broke out in July.
	   He pointed out that the bank was having a hard time dealing with
bad loans.
	   He cited for instance the loans to Ramon Jacinto used for the
purchase of the 8,000 square meter prime property in Makati as well
as to Philtranco and Monumento Plaza.
	   ``Its (PNB) quick privatization offers a smooth and quiet
resolution to the problem. But as some of our past privatization
experiences have shown, while assets were privatized, the
liabilities were absorbed by the national government, in short, the
taxpayers,'' the Quezon lawmaker said.
	   ''This is a clear case of privatized gains but the losses are
socialized.
	   This should not be allowed,'' he emphasized.
	   Banking analysts earlier advised PNB management to be
transparent in its operation, particularly to prospective its
buyers.

	   The wise and benevolent folks at Monsanto are launching an
advertising campaign in major European newspapers this month to
counter the wicked falsehood that genetically modified crops are
bad for you. And just in case the cynical Europeans doubt the word
of Monsanto's own spokesmen, they are getting some of Africa's
leading academics and politicians to sign this stirring endorsement
of biotechnology.
	   'Let the Harvest Begin', the ad is called, and it's so uplifting
that you wonder how anyone could refer to genetically engineered
crops as 'Frankenstein foods'. No, no, say the Africans: ``Many of
our needs have an ally in biotechnology and the promising advances
it offers for our future. With these advances, we prosper; without
them, we cannot thrive....Slowing its acceptance is a luxury our
hungry world cannot afford.''
	   Other prominent Africans angrily refused to sign the letter,
arguing that Monsanto is arrogantly shoving this profitable new
technology down the world's throat -- and that it does not help
Africa. But how can they accuse the U.S.-based mega-corporation of
arrogance when it keeps its own name almost invisibly small on the
draft declaration?
	   Selling genetically engineered crops as a weapon against famine,
rather than addressing the scientific or financial implications of
this revolution in food, is an idea that probably originated with
Burson Marsteller, the public relations specialists who did the
damage limitation in disasters like the Alaskan oil spill and the
Bhopal tragedy in India.
	   Back in 1996, when Europe's biggest biotech group was
researching how to overcome the resistance of European consumers,
Burson Marsteller warned that environmental and health issues were
``killing fields'' for bio-technology, and that ``the perception of
the profit motive fatally undermines the industry's credibility.''
So the best strategy was to reply to reasoned criticisms with
``symbols eliciting hope, satisfaction, caring, and self-esteem.''
Like Africans promising an end to famine, for example.
	   Why is this propaganda only being peddled in Europe, and not
back home in the United States where Monsanto is headquartered?
	   Because although the vast majority of American consumers say
that they want genetically modified foods to be marketed and
labeled separately (if they don't oppose them outright), the
bio-tech giants have already won the battle in the United States.
	   Avalanches of cash have been poured into the U.S. political
system by the bio-tech industry: ``It now rivals the oil industry
for weight and influence,'' says Ronnie Cummins, director of the
Pure Food campaign. By pure coincidence, one must assume, the Food
and Drug Administration now backs the industry's refusal to label
or segregate genetically altered foods -- and the companies have
got fourteen states to pass 'veggie libel' laws banning ``the
spread of false and damaging information about food.'')
	   Thirty million acres of genetically engineered crops were
planted in North America last year, and the U.S. government
actively supports the industry's efforts to stop other governments
from imposing any controls, or even special labeling requirements,
on their products (which are indistinguishable visually from the
real thing). But in Europe, the fight is not yet lost.
	   In Britain, for example, there are only 182 sites where
transgenic crops are being grown experimentally this year (though
that is twice as many as last year), and the opposition is both
determined and creative.
	   At one end of the spectrum, the Iceland supermarket chain, which
supplies 12 percent of the United Kingdom's frozen food, has banned
all foods containing genetically modified ingredients though it had
to go to enormous efforts to find alternative suppliers).
	   English Heritage and three other government conservation
agencies are calling for a three-year ban on all experimental
plantings.
	   At the other end, activists have uprooted the transgenic crops
in seven test sites in the UK this year, and are now setting up
protest camps where they plant the original organic crops instead.
	   ``We may look like dirty hippies scrabbling around on a field,''
said the spokesman for the squatters in a field near Norwich in
England, ``but we're making a serious point. Consumers are being
used as guinea pigs, but most don't even know that these fields
exist.''
	   This level of organized resistance to genetically modified foods
in Europe -- one opinion poll after another shows that over 90
percent of Germans want all genetically altered food clearly
labeled, and in Britain it hits 95 percent -- is why the big
advertising campaign is being unleashed. But even if their tactics
are cynically manipulative, are the bio-tech firms really wrong?
	   Nobody knows -- and that is precisely the problem. The
implications of the new biological technology are still not clear.
	   Will the bio-engineered plants cross-breed with wild varieties?
	   Will their resistance to pesticides be transmitted to weeds? Do
genetically engineered foods cause new allergies? Nobody knows --
but in the name of corporate profit these crops are being spread
around the world before the answers are known.
	   But what about 'starving Africa'? How dare we deprive Africans
of these new food technologies that will fend off famine?
	   Save your tears. The current generation of bio-engineered crops
are almost all industrial raw materials or animal feeds --
precisely the sort of crops that African countries grow on good
farmland (which would otherwise feed people) to earn foreign
exchange. And what do they need the hard currency for? To pay off
foreign debts, or to buy luxury imports.
	   Whatever their health and environmental effects, the economic
effect of the present generation of bio-engineered crops in Africa
is quite clear: more Mercedes-Benzes, and less food.

	   To President B.J. Habibie: Former president Soeharto appointed
you to replace him when the state's political situation was very
difficult and critical. Therefore, we can imagine how difficult is
the burden that you are shouldering today, especially with the
political crisis dragging on, the economic crisis worsening, the
legal crisis remaining uncertain, and the continued crisis of
confidence on the part of the people and the international
community.
	   Unfortunately, your first step in electing ministers as your
assistants has indeed become another problem because the people
find the capacity and credibility of some ministers questionable.
It seems that you did not quite, or could not, take into account
the demand for total reform, which is a popular demand voiced by
university students.
	   Your decision to set free political prisoners is quite pleasing.
However, the realization of this decision and the official
statements made afterward have become a big question mark to us. If
indeed the decision has been made for the sake of the image of the
``Order of Reform'' in enforcing the law and upholding justice and
humanity, why haven't all political prisoners been set free? Why
must there be exceptions? Our notes are as follows:
	   1. If the amnesty granted to Sri Bintang Pamungkas and Muchtar
Pakpahan on May 26, 1998 is intended to draw the sympathy of the
international community, particularly with respect to creditors,
because these two figures are considered to have a high value, then
it is certainly a mistake. The international community, including
business circles, is not stupid. Just like Indonesian people
themselves, the international community no longer tolerates
cheating. All wish to see the proof of sincerity in political will
and firmness in political action in setting free all political
prisoners, the victims of the Soeharto regime.
	   2. The amnesty for Nuku Sulaiman and Andi Syahputra and the
leniency shown toward Karlina Leksono, Gadis Arivia and Wilasih
Noviana on May 28, 1998 are nothing more than part of a play devoid
of humor. Why? Andi and Nuku would have soon completed their entire
jail terms, while Karlina, Gadis Arivia and Wilasih, detained three
days for a demonstration against milk prices which they held at the
Hotel Indonesia traffic circle in February 1998, were fined Rp
2,250 by the Central Jakarta District Court in March.
	   3. The exceptions, particularly with respect to political
prisoners allegedly related to the aborted communist coup in 1965,
show that the decision was only halfheartedly made.
	   Concerning this last category, we see the presence of excessive
and improper political vengeance and the absence of justice and
humanity in the conscience of this country's rulers. Why not
release them, they all have served over 30 years in prison! They
are all over 70 years old and are in poor health.
	   Having put down the above notes, we, who provide services to
prisoners, would like to call on you to demonstrate sincere
political will, justice and humanity in settling the problem of
political prisoners. Set free all, i.e. without exception,
political detainees/convicts. Restore their self-respect as
Indonesians.
	   As people of faith, we believe that all religions teach loving
kindness and repentance. Let us prove that the Indonesian people
are a highly cultured nation with a noble sense of humanity.

	   IT'S 4pm on an overcast Monday afternoon, yet dance music is
booming from a discotheque in Penang. Inside its cavernous hall,
the KRU brothers Norman, Yusry and Edry are busy executing slick

	   IT'S 4pm on an overcast Monday afternoon, yet dance music is
booming from a discotheque in Penang. Inside its cavernous hall,
the KRU brothers Norman, Yusry and Edry are busy executing slick
dance manoeuvres on the dance floor, accompanied by their
ever-present backup dancers.
	   The music sounds unmistakably KRU. Onstage, a video camera is
rolling, capturing the entire dance routine.
	   Welcome to the video shoot of Fobia - KRU's latest single from
the upcoming Silat Lagenda soundtrack album.
	   In between scenes, a gracious Norman readily talks to The New
Straits Times while the makeup lady hovers around, dabbing his face
with powder.
	   ``I don't know whether Fobia is going to be another
controversial song like Fanatik,'' Norman says.
	   ``Fanatik was about society. We were trying to convey our inner
feelings to get people to open up their minds to their
surroundings. Fobia is about KRU. It's about the traumatic
experience that we were put through last year, but here we are
again. It's like we haven't had enough''.
	   Shot on location in Penang, Fobia marks KRU's 10th attempt at
directing a music video. In the RM30,000 video, the brothers are
pursued on land, sea and sky - in stretch limousines, jetskis,
speedboats and a private jet.
	   ``This is the farthest that we have gone for a video shoot.
We've got 20 personnel from Kuala Lumpur here. It is a logistics
nightmare trying to get everybody co-ordinated. Usually, music
video production crews have a maximum of 12 people,'' says Norman.
	   Fobia is among 10 tracks on the KRU-produced soundtrack album
for Silat Lagenda, Malaysia's first full-length animated film
scheduled for release in August.
	   Meanwhile, KRU has succeeded in procuring compositions from a
dream team of songwriters for its self-produced debut English
album. The songwriters - Teddy Riley, David Foster, Babyface and
Diane Warren - have each contributed a song for the album.
	   ``We are going to have 14 tracks for the album. Seven songs are
from foreign composers, including several up-and-coming writers.
The rest of the songs are written by KRU,'' he said.
	   Nonetheless, Norman says the album will retain the KRU sound,
incorporating dance, pop, rap and R&AMP;B music.
	   ``As producers, we have to make sure that the album has
direction and is well co-ordinated. We must be able to have enough
confidence to make some changes to the songs (from other writers).
	   ``As far as the music arrangement is concerned, it is totally
our version of whatever the songwriter has given to us. We maintain
the melody and lyrics, but we have made some changes to the music
arrangement so that the songs blend into the whole album.''
	   KRU is enlisting the assistance of a vocal coach from the US
before laying down the vocal tracks next month.
	   The group is likely to go to Los Angeles in August for the
mixing, and will be able to release the album in October or
November.

	   The ``time bomb'' finally exploded and caused massive riots to
erupt in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities.
	   The mobs attacked, looted and set buildings on fire. Public
facilities, banks, malls, shops and even homes were destroyed and
looted. And most of them belonged to Indonesians of Chinese
descent.
	   Some experts said that the social gap triggered the lootings and
arson, which especially targeted the properties of
Chinese-Indonesians. A social gap is not the only factor which
caused such barbaric actions. The incapability of our House of
Representatives to express people's aspiration directly to the
government and racism are the other factors which must be
considered.
	   Even after we got our independence, there are still 'pribumi'
(indigenous), 'nonpribumi' (nonindigenous) and 'WNI Keturunan'
(Chinese-Indonesians). Some said that the Chinese-Indonesians were
always targeted by mobs because they have privileges provided by
the New Order government. They are probably referring to some
business tycoons. But what about the shop owners or the small
entrepreneurs who worked hard, starting from nothing and never
getting the privileges provided by the government?
	   Discrimination against minorities is also implemented by the
government. They should let the Chinese-Indonesians enter politics
and the Armed Forces. If the government denies that they implement
such a discriminating policy, they must declare loud and clear that
government departments, political parties and the Armed Forces are
wide open for every citizen, whatever ethnic, racial or religious
group they belong to. Set this policy parallel with the eradication
of corruption, collusion cronyism and nepotism.
	   Referring to the Thomas Cup team which retained the
international badminton Holy Grail, I suggest that TVRI and other
private television stations present community service ads featuring
the harmonious relationships in our Thomas Cup and Uber Cup teams.
These teams really represent Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in
Diversity) -- Moslems, Catholics, Protestants, Hindus, Buddhists,
Javanese, Chinese, Ambonese or other ethnic groups and tribes are
united to produce a marvelously synergical power.
	   Hopefully such actions will increase cross-cultural awareness
and understanding to remove prejudice and suspicion and boost
tolerance and mutual help among the people in a new and better
Indonesia.

	   Only a few weeks ago, many analysts watching political
developments in Indonesia tended to think in terms of two models of
change: the so-called Tiananmen model and the ``People Power''
model. Much to everybody's surprise, the events in Jakarta turned
out to be neither so bloody as in China, nor as abrupt as in the
Philippines, but a quick and largely peaceful transition.
	   Still, the two other models remain relevant as there may be both
hope and worry about things to come.
	   Ts of the state, which were challenged by the students,
and restored stability after changes in the state and party elite
and limiting further social and economic damage of the
three-month-long revolt.
	   Even in terms of its diplomatic consequences -- perhaps the most
damaging effects Beijing had to suffer -- the situation seemed to
be controllable after only some five to seven years.
	   Thus, at the end of the day, a monolithic regime was able to
remain in place because the state found its recipe to restore the
status quo by bloodily crushing the opposition forces.
	   The People Power of the EDSA highways in Manila in 1986, on the
other hand, may be the reverse of the Chinese solution.
	   Popular anger against Ferdinand Marcos' dictatorship was
expressed at all social levels. Political and spiritual leadership
was manifested readily in the persons of the widow of the
assassinated popular senator Benigno Aquino, Corazon Aquino, and
Cardinal Jaime Sin.
	   Popular opposition platforms were ready and led by the left wing
nationalistic front, the National Democratic Front (NDF), and other
movements.
	   Since decades of Marcos' dictatorship had heavily politicized
and radicalized the Filipino society, all one needed to do to oust
the dictator, so to speak, was merely a few acts on the part of his
generals to change sides. This happened at a crucial moment when
General Fidel Ramos did just that.
	   However, the People Power movement also opened, and was soon
threatened by, a momentum of continuing military rivalries and
rebellions, with the Rambo game of Col. Gringo Honasan being the
most well known example.
	   On a broader level, a significant divide occurred as well when
the NDF boycotted Cory Aquino's first general election. Had the NDF
not done so, the political landscape of the Philippines would have
been very different.
	   Hence the new political game became a democratic one, but
elitistic in nature. The EDSA revolution thus ended up in what some
Filipinos called an ``elitistic democracy''.
	   In short, while both revolts were clearly supported by most
sections of society, the mainly urban-based student revolt in China
was too small and weak to face the state apparatuses.
	   In the Philippines, in contrast, the disobedience and revolt
were truly mass based, while the state apparatuses were too weak
and divided to effectively act against the social dissonances.
	   Jakarta's ``May Revolution'', as the student protests leading to
the fall of Soeharto are now called, contained mixed elements. Like
in China, the structural imbalances between the student movement
and state apparatuses in Indonesia were obvious, although China, of
course, is a party state in which the armed forces are subjugated
under the party's leadership.
	   Like in China, the student rebellion was actively and implicitly
widely supported by the society, but the state leadership in
Indonesia -- both before and after the fall of Soeharto -- suffered
from a much more serious crisis than their counterparts in China.
	   Symbolism emanating from student power in Jakarta and Beijing
seemed to have created greater trouble and in so doing provoked a
quicker act of the state than it did in Manila.
	   Like the Chinese, the Indonesian students chose the very locus
of the power they challenged for their protest.
	   The building complex of the legislature and People's
Consultative Assembly (DPR/MPR) at Senayan and the National
Monument were supposed to signify the legitimacy of their protest
against what they saw as the illegitimate people's representative
and governmental bodies (although the planned gathering at the
National Monument was canceled at the eleventh hour). Echoes of
Jakarta in Pakistan and Zimbabwe emphasize this symbolic effect.
	   Much the same way, it was the legitimacy of the ``Heavenly Peace
Mandate'' supposedly bestowed upon the government and parliament
which the Chinese students challenged by occupying the Tiananmen
(''The Great Square of Heavenly Peace'').
	   No state government would tolerate such a pointed humiliation
before the eyes of the world one minute longer than needed.
	   Hence, in Beijing, just like in Jakarta, the government was
desperate to act quickly to end the international embarrassment:
five days in the case of Jakarta and few months for Beijing.
	   In the Chinese case, however, there was little, if any, specific
moral anger so deep as to precipitate an awakening of popular and
middle classes movements like in Manila and Jakarta.
	   Certainly, the Chinese students and urban masses' struggle for
freedom was motivated by a general protest against the monopolistic
communist regime.
	   But the Tiananmen model lacked the great and specifically
directed moral force manifested in the Philippines and Indonesia
following, respectively, Aquino's cold-blooded killing and the
tragic death of students at Trisakti University in Jakarta.
	   This explains the broader social support the Indonesian and
Filipino protest movements gathered.But if China's model lacks
specific crucial ingredients, the role of its armed forces
represents a potential threat that could happen elsewhere in
different way or at a later stage.
	   Indonesian opposition figure Amien Rais has claimed the reason
he called off the mass gathering on the early morning of May 20th
was that one Indonesian general warned him that ``we too could do a
Tiananmen blow''.
	   If this is true, it may prove to be a significant aspect of
Jakarta events that could remind us of China's way to end a state
crisis. In the present day context of the post-Soeharto transition,
uneasy and uncertain as it is, this potential also needs to be
considered in the future.
	   Indonesia's Armed Forces (ABRI) played a decisive, but very
cautious role. Gen. Syarwan Hamid, who as vice chairman of the
legislature gave permission to the students to stage a big protest
at the Senayan DPR/MPR complex, would not have done it without
consent from the top. More importantly, at the top level, ABRI had
during the crucial weeks in mid May ``only'' played a waiting game
and finally agreed to ask Soeharto to step down.
	   However, as a big ally and key powerholder during the three
decades of Soeharto rule, it is only natural that ABRI faced an
internal crisis which only intensified as the national leadership
crisis aggravated.
	   Salim Said and others pointed out that ABRI had gone through its
own crises for some time and started accordingly to do what they
promised: tut wuri handayani, playing a guiding social role from
the back seat. In the era of globalization -- an era of ``Reform or
Die'' -- there seemed to be no other choices for the ABRI top brass
than to structurally adapt to the new situation.
	   Hence, like in the Philippines, the People Power action in
Jakarta also tended to provoke and intensify the already existing
military rivalries. The sudden fall of the commander of the
Strategic Army Reserve (Kostrad), Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subijanto, would
seem to strengthen the impression that Jakarta's events also had
their own version of Gringo Honasan. Although the Honasan-like game
in Jakarta could not be played out openly, the essential
ingredients, like in Manila, were there.
	   They are to remain there as long as the Habibie government or
its successor fails to restore its both domestic and international
credibility and ability to guarantee the people's basic needs.
	   ``The most important prerequisite to reform is... efficient and
capable national leadership,'' said the ABRI chief of
Sociopolitical Affairs, Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
recently. ``I'd like to stress (the importance) of state leadership
because it is of paramount importance in the campaign for reform''
(The Jakarta Post May, 30, 1998).
	   At the end of Annus Mirabilis, the European ``Year of Miracles''
of 1989, a great number of students, joined and supported by human
rights and church affiliated organizations marched in the city of
Leipzig and Dresden chanting ``Wir sind Das Volk,'' (We Are The
(sic!) People).
	   It was a famous march of a prodemocracy movement that led to the
fall of Erich Honnecker's communist regime in East Germany. The
call effectively targeted the regime that claimed to be the only
true representative of the people.
	   The call for Reformasi Total from Senayan against a regime which
refused to do real reforms, could have had deeper effects -- not
only the fall of Soeharto, but also the real acts to fulfill the
needs of the people and to start a democratization proses like in
East Germany -- if the ``Jakarta May Revolution'' does not suffer
too much from Chinese-like structural imbalance and the
Philippines' Honasan-like maneuvering.
	   Like in Beijing, but unlike in Manila and Leipzig, the
prodemocracy movement in Jakarta lacked a solid political platform
to lead the momentum of change because the student protest was
insulated as ``a moral force'' and the politicians were too
divided. Conversely, the non-governmental and mass organizations
were politically too weak as a result of Soeharto's three decades
of repressive policy and its paralyzing impacts.
	   The writer is a journalist based in Amsterdam. He watched
closely the events in Jakarta recently, in Manila in 1986-1987 and
in Eastern Europe in 1989-1990.
	   Window: In the Philippines, in contrast the disobedience and
revolt were truly mass based, while the state apparatuses were too
weak and divided to effectively act against the social dissonances.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
woman chess player, defeated World Chess champion Anatoly Karpov on
Tuesday in the first day of their four-day series of speed matches.
	   ``I think some of my moves made him pause, they were not what he
expected,'' said Polgar, 21. ``With only 22 seconds to go, he made
a wrong move and gave up.''
	   Karpov fought her with the Carokan defense, but quit after the
50th move.
	   The first match, with Judit playing black and using the Bennoni
defense, ended in a tie after the 33rd move.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, although fellow
Russian Garry Kasparov is considered the true world champion.
	   ``Historically, Judit is the greatest woman chess player in the
world,'' Karpov told state-run TV Tuesday.

	   ``THE hardest part was convincing them,'' says Norman, the
eldest member of KRU.
	   ``This is no ordinary compilation album. It is a collaboration
of the work of some of the best talents in the country. So, for the
first time, we roped in superstars, established singers as well as
budding ones.''
	   Norman was addressing the Press at a pre-listening session of
KRU's latest undertaking at its office in Kuala Lumpur. It is the
soundtrack for the country's first animated movie, Silat Legenda.
	   He said while most of the singers were game to work together, it
was initially difficult to secure their participation as they are
signed to different labels.
	   ``This is an industry album, hence it is different from the
usual compilation albums. None of the songs has been released
before, so we are talking about new recording material. On top of
that, it is the first time that we working with top artistes,''
Norman added.
	   The soundtrack features Sharifah Aini (Takkan Melayu Hilang Di
Dunia), Ella (Aku), ex-Search vocalist Amy (Orait), Zainal Abidin
(Ceriteria), Ning Baizura (Bawa Daku Pergi), Elite (Lihatlah
Dunia), KRU (Fobia), Indigo (Istimewa) and Sheila Majid (Setia
Bersama).
	   Interestingly, each song was tailored to suit the vocal ability
of the singers.
	   Sharifah Aini, who needed only 20 minutes to record her song,
sings in asli style. Zainal's Ceriteria is distinctively pop-ethnic
and you can't help but be taken in by Amy's Orait which is so
typically him.
	   ``But what really surprised us was Sheila Majid readily agreeing
to sing our composition. We grew up listening to Sheila's songs and
have been big fans of hers. So it was like a dream come true when
she said `yes' to the project.
	   ``Sheila was certainly the toughest one (to approach) because
hers is a duet with KRU. How do you ask someone of her calibre to
do a duet with us?'' Norman asked.
	   Whichever way you look at it, this album is testimony to KRU's
producing and songwriting skills. Certainly, the project is the
biggest they've had to undertake. It wasn't because it involved a
huge sum of money or anything like that, Norman said, but because
``working with professionals and top artistes does give you the
creeps''.
	   ``I mean, what, for instance, would they think of our
compositions?''
	   Norman said they spent 40 to 45 days in the recording studio.
	   All the artistes were handpicked by the KRU members, bearing in
mind the importance of having a balanced line-up.
	   In the end, they settled for three categories - superstars
(those whose album sales have surpassed the 200,000 mark),
well-established singers (those who have been around for more than
25 years) and new artistes.
	   The singers are from Warner Music, EMI, BMG and KRU Records. EMI
will distribute the album.
	   ``We may have come from various labels but we all have but one
common goal, that is to ensure this album's success.''
	   Norman said for that to happen, they are not sparing anything.
	   ``We are allocating RM100,000 for production while a further
RM200,000 will be put aside for promotions. The line-up of artistes
deserves this kind of A&AMP;P (advertising and promotion) support.''
	   KRU has shot three music videos for the soundtrack album. Two
more will be produced later.
	   Said Norman: ``The soundtrack is released here at the end of
this month.
	   It will also be released in 13 other countries.''
	   And what is the album concept?
	   ``It is unique in the sense that it presents a whole world of
genres. We have rhythm and blues, pop, asli, rock, grunge, etc.
Some of the lyrics do reflect the storyline.''
	   Listening to the album, it is obvious that the boys do know how
to match the singer to the song. Take Zainal's song, for instance.
One listen and you can see his stamp. So too with Amy's Orait,
which showcases his personality (but where is his trademark
``pee...wit!?'').
	   The soundtrack is being released ahead of the film, which only
hits theatres in August.
	   Said Norman: ``We're following Hollywood in that we're releasing
the soundtrack first, followed by the movie. And with the current
situation, we would be happy if the album could sell between 60,000
and 70,000 copies.''
	   Silat Legenda is about five teenagers who come across a mystical
weapon which transforms them into 21st-century versions of
legendary Malacca warriors Hang Tuah, Hang Jebat, Hang Lekir, Hang
Kasturi and Hang Lekiu.

	   Since president Soeharto's resignation last month, people have
been noisily calling for an end to corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   People also discuss ways to avoid a recurrence of such illicit
business practices and ridicule those they believe are at the root
of the three evil diseases. The topic has become so popular that
people here have given the three problems a popular acronym, KKN,
standing for 'korupsi', 'kolusi' and 'nepotisme'.
	   While some people are busy discussing the matter, university
students are busy staging antigraft demonstrations. Some have gone
so far as to occupy local legislative council premises to press
reluctant legislators to support their cause.
	   Calls for the dismissal of certain officials believed to have
been involved in KKN have become so hysterical that it is causing
confusion among many bureaucrats. President B. J. Habibie has not
been spared from the onslaught. His younger brother Junus Effendy
quit his job as the head of the Batam Industrial Development
Authority, and his son Ilham resigned as assistant to chief of the
Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in a
bid to stanch accusations of nepotism aimed at the senior Habibie.
	   It is very tempting to speculate which of the three bureaucratic
diseases will claim the most casualties. Nepotism is the flavor of
the week, mainly because people consider it the easiest charge to
prove.
	   It is quite understandable because in the present political
culture -- inherited from the Soeharto era -- corruption has
frustratingly challenged law enforcement agencies because corrupt
officials have been able to keep the law at bay and intimidate the
public into accepting corruption. Proof of the country's corrupt
mentality was evident in the nonchalance of local authorities to
the results of a survey reported by the Hong Kong-based Political
and Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. (PERC) last year proclaiming
Indonesia the most corrupt country in Asia.
	   Besides, probes into corruption and collusion cases have always
run aground whenever powerful officials have been involved. The
principle of equal justice under the law is still a dream here.
There has also been a lack of morality in the handling of
corruption cases.
	   To avoid innocent people falling victim to public outrage, the
government said on Thursday it would soon issue comprehensive
criteria on what actions constitute corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   We can imagine how tricky the job will be. Cabinet members have
witnessed how tangled is the illicit web of doing business here and
how impotent our legal system is in the face of a corrupt regime.
In the recent past, it was common for the president's children to
gain government multimillion dollar projects without tender.
	   Last week, former vice president Sudharmono and two former
ministers tried hard to convince the public that all the
foundations set up by Soeharto were purely private ventures which
gained ``voluntary'' financial support from many parties.
	   We believe that Sudharmono and his colleagues must be aware that
it was impossible to separate Soeharto from his presidency -- or
his ironhanded rule, to be more precise -- or for anybody to turn
down his requests because that would be suicidal. The manipulative
activities were rampant in the absence of transparency.
	   What Sudharmono, or Soeharto, seems to have forgotten is a
saying by Abraham Lincoln: You can fool some people some time, you
can even fool whole people some time, but you cannot fool whole
people the whole time.
	   We hope the government will not resort to this kind of illogical
thinking in making the criteria for corruption, collusion and
nepotism in order to avoid legal semantic confusion.

	   PADIBERAS Nasional Bhd (Bernas) yesterday dismissed allegations
that it is the cause of the increase in the price of rice over
recent weeks.
	   Its managing director Mohd Ibrahim Mohd Nor, speaking at a press
conference in Kuala Lumpur yesterday, said Bernas supplies only 18
per cent of the rice in the domestic market ``as such, I do not
believe we are able to shake the market''.
	   ``With a such a small market share, is it fair to blame Bernas
for the current price increase? What I know is we make an excellent
scapegoat,'' he said.
	   He was responding to allegations by the Federation of the
Malaysia Consumer Associations (Fomca) which claimed that the price
rises were due to Bernas selling imported rice to its two
subsidiaries, which in turn sell to consumers at a higher price.
	   Ibrahim said he believed that rice wholesalers and retailers are
taking advantage of the situation to jack up prices. There are
37,000 retail outlets inclusive of supermarkets, which are being
served by 1,500 wholesalers.
	   Poor harvest worldwide due to the unfavourable weather
conditions has been identified as the cause of the price
escalations.
	   Prices of home-grown rice shot up by 21 per cent while that of
imported varieties by 52 per cent since May 1.
	   Malaysia imported 65 per cent of its rice from Thailand,
Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Taiwan.
	   Ibrahim, who described Fomca's allegations as ``grossly
untrue'', said Bernas had only increase the price of the imported
rice by not more than 30 per cent beginning May this year. It had,
between September last year and April this year, suffered losses
because it did not increase its rice's price.
	   The rice sold through its B-Mart outlets are also cheaper than
those sold by wholesalers and retailers.
	   Citing an example, Ibrahim said Bernas is selling the Super AAA
Grade at RM30 per 10kg compared with between RM38 and RM40 per kg
sold by wholesalers and retailers.
	   ``We sell the imported rice to BMart at average of 5 sen/kg
cheaper since these are for the B-Mart outlets and BMart sponsored
outlets. The network represents benchmark pricing when Bernas
avoids the middlemen,'' he said.
	   He also denied Fomca's allegations that Bernas is selling 80 per
cent of the 600,000 tonnes it imported annually to its
subsidiaries.
	   Ibrahim said Bernas is selling only 38.6 per cent of the
imported rice to its subsidiaries while the balance of 61.4 per
cent are sold to others.
	   On calls for the Government to liberalise the importation of
rice, Ibrahim said rice is a strategic commodity and as such,
handling the commodity cannot be viewed from one particular angle.
	   Ibrahim said the importation of rice was actually left to market
forces in 1973.
	   ``History showed that when the price and supply of rice
internationally take a vigorous fluctuation due to both national or
economic disasters, the responsibility for importation of rice
cannot be left to an organisation that is driven purely by profit
motive.
	   ``In facing an international market, we are confronted with
international traders and governments the size of which dwarfs even
an organisation like Bernas.
	   ``It is imperative that this responsibility is handled in a
coordinated manner by an organisation, which has the interest of
the consumers, the farmers, the trade as well as the country,'' he
added.
	   Explaining Bernas' business plan, Ibrahim said it takes
cognisance of consumers' interests, farmers' interests as well as
global threats.
	   ``We put consumers' interest as a priority one, it would only be
logical for Bernas to find ways and means to avoid the multi-layers
supply chain and go direct to the 37,000 retail base, if not to the
22 million people who consume rice in Malaysia.
	   ``We opted for a two-pronged approach to bring farmers closer to
consumers. We maintain direct supply to B-Mart and B-Mart sponsored
outlets as a benchmark and the last alternative to consumers as
well as forming joint ventures with some of the wholesalers.
	   ``With access to only half of the total rice supply, Bernas can
only hope to offer an alternative system for both the consumers and
farmers,'' he said.
	   On Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's directive
last Wednesday for more medium grade rice to be imported from
countries offering reasonable prices to enable the people to buy
them at affordable prices, Ibrahim said Bernas had done it in 1996.
	   ``We still have stock of the medium grade rice. It has not moved
since two years ago.''

	   The Jakarta Post's Asia Correspondent Harvey Stockwin reports on
the latest and ninth anniversary of the Beijing Massacre on June 3,
4 and 5, 1989. There were predictable happenings within China --
and some unexpected ones.
	   HONG KONG (JP): On the ninth anniversary of the Beijing Massacre
in June 1989, all the predictable events happened once again.
	   Predictably, there was a heavy police and military presence in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the home of the massive popular
student-initiated demonstrations in April, May and early June 1989.
	   Predictably, once again a few ordinary Chinese still tried to
parade their petitions for rectification of wrongs in Tiananmen
Square -- but were quickly arrested and whisked away by the police.
	   Predictably, all over China known dissidents were rounded up and
detained so that there would not be the slightest risk of
demonstrations anywhere. In 1989, there were demonstrations right
across the face of China -- a much unreported fact at that time,
when the worldwide media focussed primarily on Tiananmen Square.
	   Once again, as they do every June, Prof. Ding Zilin, who lost
her only son in the Beijing Massacre, together with 30 other
bereaved parents sent a petition to the government asking for a
full enquiry into the 1989 events.
	   They have yet to receive a reply. The urn containing her son's
ashes remains in his empty bedroom.
	   Predictably, since these and other facts were reported in the
Hong Kong newspapers, the Chinese authorities made sure that the
few such papers allowed into China all had the Tiananmen coverage
ripped out of them.
	   Predictably, there has been, as yet, no reversal of verdicts
regarding the Beijing Massacre, although a few scattered Chinese
voices continue to call for such a development.The demonstrations
and massacre in 1989 remain officially a counter-revolutionary
rebellion, as far as the Chinese Communist Party is concerned.
	   However, this year there were a few unusual developments, too.
	   Prof. Ding, who has tried to compile a list of all those killed
in the Beijing Massacre, awoke on June 4 to find a condolence
wreath outside her door.An anonymous person had the courage to
leave it there overnight.
	   Second, for the first time since 1989, there was a mass rally to
commemorate the Tiananmen tragedy on Chinese soil. The annual
candlelight vigil was held in Hong Kong's Victoria Park on the
evening of June 4. Previously, the vigil was always held under
British sovereignty.
	   To the credit of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, no
attempt was made to prevent the annual event taking place once
again. The big question was -- how many people would dare to turn
up?Last year the Jakarta Post estimated that between 45,000 and
50,000 attended the rally.
	   This year there was heavy drenching rain and a thunder storm
throughout the vigil. Yet, by this correspondent's careful
estimate, between 20,000 and 25,000 still attended, standing for
nearly two hours, protecting their candles with umbrellas. In the
adverse circumstances, it was a remarkable turnout.
	   This year at the vigil, messages were heard from Wei Jingsheng
and Wang Dan, leading Chinese dissidents now in the United States,
after recently being released from prison and sent into exile by
China.
	   Curiously, both Wei and Wang referred to the Beijing Massacre as
the ``June 4 Incident'' -- the morally obtuse terminology which
many Chinese and foreigners adopt to avoid offending the Chinese
communist leadership.
	   Third, for the first time, a former leading Chinese communist
official flatly stated that ``June 4 was a major tragedy for our
nation''.
	   He was former Central Committee member Bao Tong, who was a top
aide to the former CCP Secretary-general Zhao Ziyang, purged in
1989 for advocating reconciliation instead repression. Bao was
arrested just before the massacre, and has been imprisoned and
detained since then.
	   But within days of having his civil rights restored, Bao,
claiming the constitutional right to free speech, was busy giving
interviews to the Washington Post, Reuters News Agency and the
South China Morning Post, among others.
	   In all three interviews, Bao stressed the key role of former
Chinese paramount leader, the late Deng Xiaoping, in ordering the
People's Liberation Army troops to shoot the demonstrators.
	   Bao also carefully stressed the irresponsible nature of power in
China.
	   ``The root of the June 4 happening was problems in China's
political system,'' Bao told Reuters, `` It was a political system
that was difficult for the people to control''.
	   ``The two great events in the last 50 years'', Bao told the
South China Morning Post, ``the Cultural Revolution and June 4,
show that there should be checks and balances of political power.
If we, do not establish controls, then such a thing could happen
again''.
	   Given that China ``has already gone mad twice in the last 40
years'', Bao posed the question to the Washington Post as to ``what
will China do on the international scene?When it does not have
enough power, its attitude will be restrained. But once it develops
and becomes strong, what kind of role is it going to play without a
complete structural change?''
	   Predictably, on June 5, Bao was quickly reminded, by officials,
that his right to speak freely did not extend to conversations with
foreign correspondents.
	   Fourth, the United States commemorated the ninth anniversary by
forgetting what Tiananmen Square signifies for many Chinese, even
if they cannot say so out loud.
	   With the incredible crassness that one now comes to expect from
the current U.S. administration, on June 4 it was confirmed that
Bill Clinton will be greeted in Tiananmen Square when he arrives at
the end of June.
	   It will be an implicit endorsement which will immensely gratify
the present Chinese leadership.
	   All that Clinton had to do -- if he understood that China only
respects a superpower which behaves like one -- was to call in the
Chinese ambassador and say that since former Premier Zhou En Lai
was able to greet former President Richard Nixon at his aircraft
(for a famous handshake), that venue will do for Clinton, too.
	   One would hope that an American president, faced with facts of
1989, would feel it his duty not to accept an official welcome in
Tiananmen -- at least until verdicts are well and truly reversed.
Instead, all Clinton can do now do is to arrive for the welcoming
ceremony in a black suit and a black tie.
	   More likely, Clinton, who came to the presidency denouncing
``the Butchers of Beijing'', will also end up talking tamely about
the ``Tiananmen Incident''.
	   Understandably, for the bereaved Prof. Ding, Clinton's decision
was extremely upsetting.
	   As she told the South China Morning Post, ``The red carpet
Clinton will walk on is soaked with the blood of our relatives...
the United States is a superpower of the free world and is supposed
to uphold justice... (if Clinton is welcomed on the square) he will
stand on the wrong side of history''.
	   Clearly, the condolence wreath left outside her door did not
come from Clinton.

	   Following widespread public complaints over the city's water
tariff hike, city council speaker Edy Waluyo urged the
administration yesterday to follow through with its promise to
lower tap water prices soon.
	   Edy said the administration had no reason to repeatedly postpone
its plan to lower water tariffs since the city-owned water
management company, PDAM Jaya, had already settled its dispute with
two private companies it had previously cooperated with.
	   ``People are now waiting for lower tariffs as the administration
promised,'' he said.
	   Last month, the deputy governor for development affairs,
Budiardjo Soekmadi, promised the council the city government would
lower water prices ``as soon as possible''.
	   Budiardjo made the remarks after announcing the cancellation of
a water management cooperation between PDAM and two private
companies: PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (GDS), a subsidiary company
owned by tycoon Soedono Salim, and PT Kekar-Thames Airindo (Kati),
owned by former president Soeharto's eldest son Sigit
Hardjojudanto.
	   Under the cooperation with these two companies, PDAM had
announced a 25 percent average increase in tariffs from April 1.
The new tariffs mostly affected affluent customers, who must now
pay up to 65.71 percent more in their water bills.
	   However, the administration last month decided to end the
cooperation and set up a new deal with two foreign partners, French
firm Lyonnaise des Eaux and British firm Thames Water
International.
	   PDAM's promise to lower its water tariffs following the new
agreement has yet to make Jakartans happy.
	   Most people are upset that their bills this month more than
doubled those of previous months.
	   ``The city administration still enjoys lying to the public. What
are they thinking raising the water tariff during such times of
economic crisis?'' said a housewife.
	   Governor Sutiyoso refused to comment on the issue.
	   ``No, no, no. I don't have anything to say at the moment,'' he
told journalists yesterday evening.
	   According to Edy, the administration might be ``still figuring
out new tariffs that would be acceptable to the public''. Copyright

	   THE fate of Westmont Industries Bhd (WIB) and its wholly-owned
subsidiary Sabah Shipyard Sdn Bhd (Saship) will be known on August
29 when WIB presents the details of its restructuring proposals to
the High Court.
	   Creditors of the group are expected to vote on the proposals on
the same day. If accepted, the restructuring process will start by
the end of the year, group director Datuk Jaffar Indot told
reporters at a briefing yesterday.
	   He said he is ``reasonably confident'' the group's creditors
will support the proposed restructuring plan, given the encouraging
feedback.
	   WIB and Saship owe its creditors about RM970 million.
	   Of the amount, WIB owes RM66.49 million, of which RM61.09
million is due to unsecured creditors which include financial
institutions, RM869,000 to partially-secured creditors and RM4.88
million to unsecured general creditors, including hire-purchase and
leasing companies.
	   Saship's debt amounts to RM907.3 million, including RM197.91
million owed to WIB and a provision of RM312 million for bad debts.
	   The proposals will be binding on all WIB's creditors if it is
approved by 75 per cent of the creditors in terms of value and 50
per cent in the number of each class of creditors, said Jaffar.
	   ``We have talked to all of them to explain what the scheme is
all about and taken feedback and suggestions from them.''
	   The proposed settlement involves a cash payment, a debt-equity
conversion into new shares in WIB, and a moratorium on debt.
	   Earlier, WIB chairman Datuk Mohd Desa Pachi, reading from a
prepared statement, said the release of WIB's audited accounts for
the financial year ended December 31 1996 to the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange on Friday marks a turning point for the group and its new
shareholders and management.
	   WIB posted a pre-tax loss of RM664.79 million on a turnover of
RM376.61 million. Group loss after tax stood at RM715.58 million.
	   ``The new board found that the preliminary unaudited results for
the financial year, which was originally announced as a profit
after tax of RM54.9 million, could not be substantiated,'' said
Mohd Desa.
	   The new board was appointed on April 24 1997, four months after
the closure of the 1996 financial year.
	   The High Court had on February 4 1998 granted a restraining
order allowing WIB to proceed with the restructuring scheme.
	   The scheme includes a proposal to reduce 33 sen for each fully
paid-up RM1 WIB share, in order to reduce the balance of
accumulated losses by RM77.7 million. This will be followed by a
restricted issue to WIB's major shareholder, Swascojuta Sdn Bhd -
holding 21.8 per cent - to raise about RM61.15 million.
	   ``Liquidation of WIB is not a viable alternative as most
creditors will not receive full payment while shareholders'
investment in WIB will likely be rendered valueless,'' said Mohd
Desa.
	   The response from creditors is encouraging as the proposal
remains the best alternative for restoring the long-term viability
of WIB and Saship, he added.
	   Saship resumed its shiprepair activities in March after stopping
operatings for two months - which Jaffar said was sufficient to pay
for overheads.
	   In the medium term, Saship will be re-entering its shipbuilding
activities, Jaffar said.
	   The yard is expected to benefit from the estimated 70,000 tonnes
of offshore fabrication work for the next three years and the fact
that it is the only yard in Malaysia's eastern corridor, he added.

	   Two middle-ranking Tangerang Regency and Mayoralty officials
submitted their resignations yesterday in a bid to avoid
accusations of corruption.
	   The two were identified as Agus Rachmat, the head of the
regency's regional development board, and Muhaemin, the head of the
mayoralty's parks and funerals office.
	   Agus is the brother-in-law of regency secretary M.H. Thamrin,
while Muhaemin is the younger brother of Tangerang Mayor Djakaria
Mahmud.
	   Agus admitted yesterday that he had resigned to avoid
accusations that he was recruited nepotistically by Thamrin and had
thereafter frequently engaged in corrupt activities.
	   ``It's better for me to resign now rather than be dismissed at a
later date,'' he said.
	   He said there were still two relatives of Thamrin working as
officials in his administration. The two are secretary of the
regency regional development board Muchtar Lutfi and deputy head of
economic affairs Dedy Kusnadi.
	   ``But my resignation should not influence them and they don't
necessarily have to follow my example,'' Agus said. He now plans to
return to his former profession as a lecturer at Bandung Institute
of Technology.
	   Agus explained that he decided to resign as he had held his
current position for five years. ``Usually this position is held
only in three years,'' he said.
	   He said that he had informed Regent Agus Djunara of his
intention to resign earlier this month.
	   According to Suparman, the mayoralty administration assistant,
Muhaemin sent his resignation letter to the Governor of West Java.
	   ``The letter has yet to be answered,'' Suparman added.
	   Djakaria Mahmud earlier denied that he had assisted his brother
rise through the ranks in the council, saying he had gained
promotion on his own merit.
	   ``Muhaemin started as a section head, was promoted to division
head and now heads the office.''
	   Tangerang Mayoralty Council deputy chairman Ruchiat recently
threatened to resign if corrupt officials did not step down from
the council.

	   WHATEVER whatever happened to Vanilla Ice, the blonde rapper who
twisted the David Bowie/Queen collaboration Under Pressure into Ice
Ice Baby, a giant hit in the early Nineties.
	   The one who became a star overnight, sold millions of records
and disappeared into oblivion after one movie?
	   Well, the answer to this query is not really important, but it's
fair to say that the novelty of ``pale rappers'' was worn out quite
a while ago.
	   Still, that doesn't seem to bother a certain young man from
Kentucky in the United States who calls himself Trey D. Yes,
Kentucky - not really the ``ideal'' backdrop for rap music, which
seems to thrive in cosmopolitan areas, as well as big urban
districts and ghettos.
	   So, there he was, looking quite awkward on the stage of Beaufort
Hotel's ballroom in Sentosa Island, Singapore, where he was
promoting his music recently.
	   Trey D was backed by a deejay friend who ``scratched and
grooved'' while another cool friend provided the additional vocals.
	   He performed two songs, apparently his own compositions, Mirror,
Mirror and Higher and Higher.
	   The songs were funky and catchy, and the vocals, rather
melodious. The guys exhibited the usual ``yo, yo, yo'' gestures and
the jerk-your-shoulder-
while-your-mouth-shoots-incomprehensible-words action ruled the
day. It was rap, all right.
	   Yet, there was still this fleeting feeling that Trey D was
another Vanilla Ice, a flash-in-the-pan - sell today, sold
tomorrow.
	   Up close and personal the next day, one could not identify the
ordinary young man with the one who was on stage the night before.
	   That raised another question: what was a fine young man like
Trey D (he never told us his real name) doing in the very nasty
world of rap?
	   Couldn't he just sing?
	   ``Yes, I do sing, and I do play some instruments. I listen to
all sorts of music. It's just that I can express myself best in
this genre,'' he explained.
	   He said that he learned a lot by listening often to the radio.
It became his ``teacher'' of sorts, and from it, he learned to
explore his ideas.
	   Trey D said although he was into almost everything, his
favourites are Lionel Richie and Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire. The act that
has made the biggest impression on him is rapper L.L. Cool J.
	   The ideas for his songs are drawn from his own experience or
stories which were related to him by close friends. It seems there
is a moral to each song.
	   Mirror Mirror, for instance, deals with our inner self, how we
perceive things, and our direction in life.''
	   Trey D revealed that he was unsure how long he would be rapping,
and whether he would move on to singing. His priority now is to
explore all the possibilities in the rap world.
	   ``But one thing that I'm quite keen to do is produce. Somewhere
down the road, I see myself running my own company and producing
records. There's so much to learn first, though,'' he said.
	   The singles Mirror Mirror and Higher and Higher are expected to
be out soon. His release album is likely to follow soon after but
no dates have been confirmed.
	   Trey D is represented in Malaysia by Form Records.

Rains force evacuations in southern Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Heavy rains caused a river in southern Russia to
flood, forcing the evacuation of 1,200 people from a town in the
Stavropol region, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   One-meter (Three-feet) deep water from the Sukhaya Buivola River
flooded one-story buildings in Blagodarny, the news agency said.
	   Heavy rains also hit the adjoining Ipatovo district, flooding
200 homes and damaging an electricity sub-station, it said.
	   Weather officials say more than 10 centimeters (nearly 4 inches)
of rain fell on the Blagodarny and Ipatovo districts in 3-1/2
hours. That's the usual rainfall for two months.

	   KLANG, Sun. - A 25-year-old woman was among 14 motorists
detained for drink-driving during police operations in Shah Alam,

Report: 32 Arabs arrested for smuggling weapons from Jordan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Thirty-two Arabs have been arrested on
suspicion of smuggling weapons including machine guns and assault
rifles into Israel from Jordan, police said.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said a publication ban on the
arrests had been lifted Tuesday but she could not specify when the
arrests had been carried out. She had no further details on the
suspects.
	   Israel radio reported that the suspects included Palestinians
from the West Bank and Arab citizens of Israel.
	   Uzi submachine guns, assault rifles and hand guns were smuggled
by the suspects into Israel through the northern Naharayim border
crossing with Jordan, Israel radio reported.
	   The report said eight suspects will remain in custody until the
end of their trials and that charges against some of the group may
include intention to harm the state.
	   In February, the Israeli military intercepted a bid to smuggle
two boatloads of weapons and arms from Jordan via the Dead Sea.

	   KODAK (M) Sdn Bhd expects a 6 per cent increase in its domestic
market share within 12 months following the introduction of an
innovative retail concept, the ``New Kodak Express Programme''.
	   Its general manager of consumer imaging, Mr Richard Fleming said
currently Kodak (M) is ahead of its nearest competitor by 60 per
cent in terms of sales.
	   The New Kodak Express Programme is designed to meet the growing
demands of retail support and provide value-added services and
products to consumers, he said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday at a press
conference to launch the programme in Malaysia.
	   According to him, the programme is the result of extensive
research and a US$1 million (US$1  &QC;  RM3.99) investment by Kodak,
which enables the company to identify key driving factors in
consumer purchasing habits.
	   ``This new retail concept for Kodak Express Stores has already
shown significant success in the US where within 12 months, total
business increased by 62 per cent,'' he said.
	   ``These results indicate that there are vast opportunities to be
tapped in this region and Malaysia especially, if we improve the
retail presentation of Kodak products and services here,'' he
added.
	   Fleming pointed out that in Malaysia, a budget ranging from
RM16,000 to RM20,000 is required for an outlet to set up the
programme. At present there are 350 Kodak outlets operating in the
country.
	   Under the programme, he said, the new visual appeal of the
stores will project Kodak Express as young, vibrant and
professional. Staff will be equipped with the knowledge and
confidence to handle consumer enquiries through Kodak's
personalised training programme.
	   Aside from this, a loyalty programme for customers has also been
created, along with the introduction of other outstanding benefits
namely, Kodak's new point-of-sale system, rebates for members,
exclusive promotions and merchandise to blend in with Kodak's new
look, said Fleming.

	   PENANG, Sun. - With the hope of healing heart patients and
saving them from the pain and suffering which she has experienced,
little Mira Natasha Suria, a hole-in-the-heart patient, aspires to
be a medical specialist when she grows up.
	   While most six-year-olds would wish for computers, toys and
sweets, all Mira wants is to have a normal childhood and a chance
to do the selfless deed for people with heart problems.
	   However, her hopes can only be realised if she goes through a
corrective heart surgery costing a hefty RM25,000.
	   Doctors discovered a hole in her heart when she was eight months
old and she has been living with the problem ever since.
	   Her mother Zuraini Ridzuan, a housewife, expressed her thanks to
readers of the New Straits Times for their contributions earlier
which helped improve Mira's condition.
	   Mira went through an operation to enlarge an artery two years
ago.
	   However, without the corrective surgery, she may not be able to
live long and would have to endure suffering for the limited time
that she should live.
	   Her father Suria Majid, a taxi driver, has appealed to the
public for donations to give his daughter a new lease of life.
	   Suria, a father of two, who earns RM800 a month said he brought
Mira to Tawakal Hospital in Kuala Lumpur for check-ups once a year
and it cost RM420 each time.
	   Mira's surgery is scheduled for Aug 18 at the Ampang Puteri
Specialists Hospital.
	   Donations can be sent by way of crossed cheques payable to the
New Straits Times with Mira's name written on the back. Cheques can
be addressed to: Finance/Cashier, The New Straits Times Press (M)
Bhd, Balai Berita, 31, Jalan Riong, 59100 Kuala Lumpur.

	   AUTOMOTIVE replacement parts manufacturer New Hoong Fatt
Holdings Bhd ended its maiden day on the second board of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange with a premium of 15 sen yesterday.
	   With an offer price of RM2.80, the counter closed the day at
RM2.95 after hitting a high of RM3.06 and touching a low of RM2.88.
Some 169 lots were traded.
	   The stock earlier opened at RM3.06 with 10 lots traded in the
first minute.
	   ``We are quite satisfied with the (opening) price. Actually, we
are not bothered by it ... we will continue with our business as
usual,'' said its managing director Kim Lang Fatt.
	   New Hoong Fatt is involved in the manufacture, marketing and
trading of automotive parts and accessories. It has three
subsidiaries - New Hoong Fatt Auto Supplies Sdn Bhd, NJ Metal
Stamping Sdn Bhd and Jhi Soon Auto Metal Sdn Bhd.
	   NJ Metal Stamping and Jhi Soon Auto Metal manufactures
automotive replacement parts under the brand names of NJ and JS,
respectively.
	   New Hoong Fatt Auto Supplies markets, distributes and trades the
automotive replacement parts manufactured by its subsidiaries.
	   ``As of now, we are already expanding our export market and we
have been doing that for the last two years,'' said its exective
director Chin Jit Sin after New Hoong Fatt's listing ceremony at
the Exchange Square yesterday.
	   He added that the company hopes to increase its exports to 30
per cent of its turnover this year from the current 20 per cent.
	   ``For this year, we have invested RM10 million to expand our
plant in Klang and purchase new manufacturing equipment which uses
robotics technology,'' said Chin.
	   He said despite the slowdown in the economy, the company's plans
to expand its export market is not affected.
	   ``In fact, the depreciation of the ringgit has been quite
beneficial to us, in terms of our exported products while our
operating costs have not gone up as the costs are still in
ringgit,'' he said.
	   At present, New Hoong Fatt exports its products to Australia and
Thailand. It expects to tap into West Asian, South American and
African market in the near future.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The two top officials of the Russian statistics
service have been charged with helping big companies evade taxes,
raising fears that figures used to make government policy and
collect other taxes were falsified.
	   Investigators said they arrested Yuri Yurkov, head of the State
Statistics Committee, his deputy, Valery Dalin, and up to 20
alleged accomplices on Monday after a yearlong investigation.
	   More than dlrs 1 million in cash was found in Yurkov's
apartment, said government spokesman Alexei Volin said. Another
dlrs 500,000 and a large amount of jewelry was seized from the
others.
	   Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia, from ordinary citizens
to large corporations. The government's inability to collect tax
revenues has hobbled efforts to boost the economy.
	   Yurkov and the others were accused of manipulating economic data
to hide the real output of companies and reduce their tax
liability, and with selling classified information about rival
companies' performance.
	   The arrests could have far-reaching economic implications if it
turns out that data government officials rely on to make policy and
collect taxes was falsified. Yurkov has been head of the statistics
agency since 1993.
	   The Russian Prosecutor General's office said more than 20 people
were involved in the scheme, including the head of the agency's
data processing center, Boris Saakyan.
	   ``They have distributed roles among themselves making every
member of the criminal group earn money,'' it said in a statement.
	   It said that Yurkov and Saakyan made statements pleading guilty
to the charges. Yurkov is one of the highest-ranking Russian
officials to be arrested in recent years.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the arrests highlighted
government efforts to battle economic crimes.
	   ``I do not think that today's arrest of Yuri Yurkov is a
misfortune,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. He
said the arrests were a combined effort of the Russian security
service and the prosecutor general's office.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's new tax enforcement chief, Boris Fyodorov,
pledged once again to enforce the law equally against all tax
dodgers.
	   ``I've been told to collect taxes.'' he said at a news
conference. Because he intends to do so, ``People are hysterical.
It's like 1937, the year of the Stalin purges.''
	   In a country of 150 million people, only 3.2 million tax
declarations were submitted last year, Fyodorov said. He said his
first targets will be rich Russians and foreigners.
	   ``For years, the government has been pretending to collect
taxes, and people have been pretending to be paying them,''
Fyodorov said.

	   HWANG-DBS Securities Bhd's financial position will not be
strained after it forks out RM70 million to reimburse Omega
Securities' clients as it has a strong capital position.
	   Currently, the stockbroking company has some RM300 million in
fixed deposits, said Hwang-DBS executive chairman Datuk Hwang Sing
Lue, adding that the setting up of a branch in Shah Alam is timely
despite the current bearish sentiment.
	   Speaking at a press conference organised by the Securities
Commission (SC) yesterday, Hwang said, the Penang-based
stockbroking firm has always been keen to expand its operations
into the Klang Valley.
	   ``It is the opportunity we have tried for so many years but
without success ... As far as we are concerned, we feel that it is
the right time to start a branch,'' he said.
	   The branch, he said, is expected to be operational as soon as
possible with the cooperation of the relevant authorities.
	   Last Friday, the SC announced that Hwang-DBS has agreed to
participate in a reimbursement scheme, which effectively sees
Hwang-DBS forking out RM70 million to reimburse qualified clients
of Omega Securities (whose licence has been revoked) the net
amounts owing to them upon closing their accounts with Omega.
	   Under the scheme, a willing stockbroking company deemed fit by
the SC will undertake to reimburse clients of stockbroking company
whose licence has been revoked.
	   In Omega's case, it was placed under trading restrictions for
failing to fulfill prudential and business conduct standard of the
securities laws and Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) rules.
	   It was then directed by the SC to come up with a restructuring
exercise, but failed to do so, which caused a show-cause letter to
be issued by the SC to the compaof most of Omega's remisiers ``who are performing.''
	   ``As far as the staff of Omega are concerned, we have to go
through the list and decide later,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, SC chairman Datuk Dr Mohd Munir Majid stressed that
the reimbursement exercise does not entail Hwang-DBS taking over
Omega's assets and liabilities as it is not a takeover.
	   The assets and liabilities of Omega are really of no concern to
Hwang- DBS, said Munir, adding that the company's involvement goes
as far as offering Omega's clients recourse to claim the net amount
owing to them.
	   On whether Hwang-DBS would be keen to set up another branch,
Hwang said, the firm plans to ``take one thing at a time,'' but
added that it is not keen to open a branch in Sabah or Sarawak.
	   Meanwhile, under the reimbursement scheme, Hwang-DBS will send
out letters to eligible clents by June 15 1998, informing them the
details and procedures of the payment.
	   Eligible clients who opt to accept the payment under the scheme
will be required to return the reply slip to Hwang-DBS before June

	   State-owned electricity company PLN's move to unilaterally annul
a power purchase contract with PT Cikarang Listrindo received
backing from analysts yesterday, but there was silence from the
power industry.
	   Economist Hartojo Wignjowijoto and industry analyst Iskandar
Mandji even called on PLN to annul all its power purchase contracts
with independent power producers (IPPs), saying they landed the
contracts through corruption, collusion and nepotism.
	   ``I give two thumbs-up to PLN,'' Hartojo said. ``PLN should not
only annul Cikarang Listrindo, but all contracts with the existing
IPPs because they will only cause losses on PLN and PLN was
pres late, but better late than
never.''
	   PLN president Djiteng Marsudi announced Saturday that he had
notified Cikarang Listrindo, an independent power producer owned by
former president Soeharto's cousin Sudwikatmono, that PLN would
stop buying power from Cikarang beginning June 15.
	   PLN was obliged to buy power from Cikarang Listrindo for 20
years under a contract signed in 1996. Cikarang Listrindo runs a
150-MW gas-fired power plant in Bekasi, West Java.
	   Members of Cikarang Listrindo's board of management were not
available for comment yesterday.
	   ``All directors are in a meeting right now,'' Vina, an employee
of the firm, told reporters at its office.
	   Hartojo, who claims to have served as financial advisor to
several IPPs, said he knew many IPPs obtained the contracts
primarily through political connections and collusion.
	   ``I know for instance that a Chinese company which offered only
4 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) lost in one bidding to a
certain company which offered higher prices only because it didn't
have political connections,'' he said.
	   Hartojo dismissed accusations that PLN's move would worsen the
country's battered investment climate in the monetary crisis,
saying many companies were ready to replace them.
	   He also said the IPPs would restrain themselves from filing a
lawsuit against PLN for fear the court sessions would reveal their
involvement in corruption.
	   Lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis told The Jakarta Post that under the
existing law, a party was allowed to annul a contract made under
political and psychological duress. But the annulment of a contract
had to be made in courts, unless the contract itself mentioned
other forums.
	   ``I can't make much comment on PLN's move until I see the
contract itself,'' he said.
	   Djiteng indicated he might take unilateral action against IPPs
which refused to renegotiate contracts to alleviate PLN's financial
burdens in the crisis.
	   PLN has repeatedly asked the IPPs to renegotiate the contracts
in the wake of heavy financial burdens resulting from the sharp
depreciation of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
	   PLN suffered a loss of more than Rp 500 billion (US$45 million
at current rates) last year and predicted losses this year would
exceed Rp 2 trillion due to the rupiah's sharp depreciation.
	   The rupiah's fall has tripled the company's dollar-based
spending, including for power purchase and foreign debt payment.
	   PLN buys power from IPPs at an average price of 6.4 U.S. cents
or Rp 640 per kilowatt hour, compared with its average selling
price of Rp 234 per kilowatt hour.
	   The company has signed contracts with 26 IPPs, most of which are
owned by international power companies in partnership with
Soeharto's family and cronies.
	   Djiteng noted PLN actually did not need most of the private
projects but the company was forced to enter into the contracts.
	   IPPs management including PT Energy Sengkang, which runs a
135-MW power plant in South Sulawesi, and PT Jawa Power, which is
developing a 1,220-MW power plant in Paiton, East Java, refused
yesterday to discuss PLN's move.
	   ``No comment,'' said Jawa Power's president Gerald H.
Falgenhauer.
	   Jawa Power is owned by Germany's Siemens, Britain's Power Gen,
and Soeharto's son Bambang Trihatmodjo; Sengkang Energy is owned by
Australia's Energy Equity, El Paso of the United States and
Soeharto's daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana.

	   AFFIN Holdings Bhd's RM225 million and RM240 million guaranteed
redeemable bond issues have been reviewed and maintained at AA1(bg)
and AAA(bg) ratings respectively by Rating Agency Malaysia Bhd
(RAM). The ratings reflect the strength of the bank guarantee
provided by Public Bank Bhd and Malayan Banking Bhd which enhanced
the credit risk profile of both debt securities issued beyond that
of the issuing company's inherent or stand- alone risk.
Furthermore, RAM said, all risks associated with the debt
facilities are expected to be absorbed by the guarantors. The
rating agency pointed out that it last rated Public Bank at AA1
while Malayan Banking carries a AAA rating.

<TEXT>
	   MODENA, Italy (AP) _ It was a taste of Pavarotti both spicey and
spiked, with a touch of soul.
	   The tenor of his times sang in an outdoor song-fest Tuesday
night directed by Spike Lee and co-starring pop performers like the
Spice Girls, Stevie Wonder and Jon Bon Jovi.
	   The Ginger-less Spice group were giving their first performance
since their split with ``Ginger Spice,'' Geri Halliwell, was
announced.
	   The four and Pavarotti joined forces on the program for the song
``Viva Forever.''
	   Proceeds of the fifth annual ``Pavarotti and Friends'' charity
concert were destined to help poor children in the African nation
of Liberia. The show in a park in this northern city was broadcast
live on Italy's flagship state television channel, RAI-1.
	   A chorus of Liberian children opened the concert. Model Naomi
Campbell and designer Donatella Versace made surprise appearances,
appealing for contributions for the cause.
	   Also appearing was Celine Dion, performing a song associated
with a large ship. Pavarotti did not appear, but many in the
audience sang along with the theme from ``Titanic.''
	   As the 62-year-old Pavarotti has been making fewer opera
appearances in recent years, his pop career is on the upswing.
	   Other performers on the program were Vanessa Williams, Natalie
Cole, Trisha Yearwood and Italian stars Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero
and Pino Daniele.

	   The Capital Market Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) has yet to
penalize 35 listed companies which missed the April 30 deadline on
submitting their 1997 financial reports, the agency's chairman said
yesterday.
	   I Putu Gede Ary Suta said a penalty would be handed down only
after the agency received complete information on the reason for
the delay.
	   In previous years, Bapepam imposed the penalty one month after
the deadline passed.
	   Putu did not elaborate on why the agency was delaying extending
the penalty, but emphasized he would remain strict and never allow
any companies to breach the capital market regulations.
	   He said the economic crisis should not be used an excuse by the
delinquent firms.
	   ``Whatever results they have, whether they record earnings or
losses, they should report to Bapepam,'' he said. ``Listed
companies are required not only to report the good earnings but
losses as well.''
	   Capital market regulations stipulate that publicly listed
companies must submit their annual financial reports to Bapepam and
stock exchange operators three months at the latest after the end
of their book years.
	   Sanctions
	   Bapepam and the stock exchange impose different sanctions
against tardy companies.
	   The agency imposes a fine of Rp 1 million (US$100) for each
overdue day. The Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) metes out a lesser
amount of fine but companies are liable to be delisted.
	   According to the JSX, about 35 companies have not submitted
their annual balance sheets, including Bakrie and Brothers, Steady
Safe, Eterindo Wahanatama, Ometraco Corporation, Gajah Tunggal,
Bank Danamon, Bank PDFCI, Bank Surya, Bank Tiara Asia, Bank Umum
Nasional, Modern Bank, Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia (BDNI) and
Barito Pacific Timber.
	   Putu acknowledged the Rp 1 million fine per day was probably
``peanuts'' for many publicly listed companies but warned that the
relatively insignificant penalty was no reason for foot-dragging on
submitting the reports.
	   ``Though they can pay the Rp 1 million penalty fee, it should
not be the reason to persistently delay their financial report,''
he said.
	   A JSX spokeswoman announced yesterday the exchange would
temporarily suspend the trading activities of the 35 listed
companies if they failed to pay a previously announced penalty fee
of Rp 10 million each ($1,000) by June 12 for the delay in
submitting their financial reports.
	   ``If they fail to pay the penalty fee by June 12, I think the
JSX management will have to suspend the trading activities of those
companies on June 15,'' Intania Abdams said.

	   DEPUTY Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said yesterday
Malaysia should accept the fact that its internal system has
weaknesses and should be rectified particularly during the current
economic slowdown.
	   ``If firm measures are necessary, we will take them. If such
measures are necessary to guarantee the strength of our financial
institutions, we will adopt these measures so that they do not
become paralysed,'' he said when opening the Johor Umno Convention
at the Sibu Island Resort in Mersing.
	   Even though Malaysia remained firm in calling for reforms to the
international monetary system and uncertain market conditions, it
also needed to realise that not everything that was happening in
the countries of this region was the result of an unjust financial
system.
	   ``There are also internal ills and problems that needed to be
corrected.
	   If we refuse to accept the facts just like the past leadership
of Indonesia, which refused to accept, then the people will rise
and demand for changes in a harsh way,'' Anwar said.
	   Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said Malaysians should be
grateful that the country need not have to seek help from the
International Monetary Fund as the Government had already taken the
necessary measures to handle the economic problems.
	   ``Hence, Malaysia is demanding for justice in the international
financial system as well as reforms and more transparency,'' he
said.
	   ``We should make the corrections with determination and continue
reforming the culture of our society in dealing with the question
of the economy and management,'' Anwar said.
	   He said the Government would step up efforts to ensure
confidence particularly among investors in economic revival so that
the economy would move forward more rapidly.
	   ``While we demand for changes and reformation in the
international financial system, the nation should also defend its
policies which had served it well and also make appropriate
renewals and changes so that it did not deviate from the principle
of justice,'' he said.
	   Anwar said the international monetary system's present form and
methods favoured the rich nations making it possible for the
currency trading system to be manipulated and speculation to occur
and small and developing nations had to put up with the present
regulations.
	   ``We should not budge from our stand that part of our problems
and that of developing nations stemmed for an uncertain and unjust
financial and market system,'' he said.

	   FINNISH metals group, Outokumpu, has invested RM180 million in a
copper manufacturing plant in Pasir Gudang, Johor.
	   The factory, which has started partial production, makes an
array of products such as anode balls used for surfacing, copper
bars used as electricity conductors and copper tubes for
air-conditioning, refrigeration and other industrial applications.
	   These are made from grade A copper cathodes and copper strips
imported from Latin America and other Outokumpu plants in Europe.
	   Outokumpu Copper Products (M) Sdn Bhd managing director Pentti
Jahi said the Johor factory was the group's second investment in
Asia after its other plant in China, which was opened in late 1996.
	   The modern Johor factory uses equipment from Outokumpu's
technology units in Finland and Sweden, as well as from other
companies in United Kingdom, Austria and Germany.
	   ``Malaysia was chosen because of its prime location at the hub
of the Asian market, good logistics, availability of sound
technical expertise, computer knowledge, and complementary
infrastructure,'' he said.
	   Jahi said the Pasir Gudang port would also facilitate the
company's exports as well as the import of equipment and raw
materials.
	   ``About 80 per cent of our production will be exported to
Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan, while the rest
is for domestic use,'' he added.
	   The state-of-the-art Johor factory is fully air-conditioned to
prevent the copper from reacting with the high humidity here. The
production processes are computer-controlled and aided.
	   Jahi said although the Asian economic downturn had adversely
affected the group's business with a 40-60 per cent drop in demand,
the Pasir Gudang complex was not affected as it was not in full
operation yet.
	   ``We are targeting sales of between RM200 million and RM300
million once we go into full production,'' he said.
	   The factory is run by a specialist team of seven expatriates and
about 93 Malaysians.
	   ``We had to provide extensive training to local staff as most of
the machinery in the factory is unique. We have sent many of the
staff to Finland and the United States for technical training.
	   ``Skilled operators and commissioning engineers from abroad have
also come here to ensure a smooth start-up and also to train local
operators in the use of these machineries'', said Jahi.
	   Outokumpu Pasir Gudang, he added, would eventually become the
training ground for the region's managers and operators, who would
eventually help in starting up plants elsewhere.
	   ``The establishment of this plant should boost the reputation of
advanced Malaysian technology, under the Outokumpu name, in the
regional market,''
	   said Jahi.
	   As Outokumpu technology has been adopted by several other
companies in Malaysia and elsewhere, the Pasir Gudang production
unit may also engage in information exchange, training and
networking with other local copper- producing companies using
similar smelting and casting technology.
	   This environment-conscious organisation has a central waste
water treatment unit, and a closed circuit system barring the open
discharge of effluents into the air.
	   Expansion is among the firm's future prospects. There is space
both within the factory premises and the land acquired for
expansion.
	   Stainless Steel, one of Outokumpu's major business areas, is a
likely possibility, but nothing has been defined as yet.
	   With the mission of putting its expertise to use in responsible
metal production and improving customer services, Outokumpu
Malaysia is augured to be a forerunner in the field of wrought
copper and copper alloy products in Asia.

	   AT A time when most companies are announcing depressing results,
Computer Systems Advisers (M) Bhd (CSA) is enjoying an increased
turnover, profits and cash reserves, and the secret, says managing
director Chuah Tai Eu, is spreading its exposure at every level.
	   None of CSA's customers contributes more than 2 per cent to the
group's total turnover while not more than 30 per cent is sourced
from a single supplier.
	   It is a corporate doctrine that has worked for CSA even in these
troubled times - cash reserves stand at over RM15 million, low
borrowings and results for the first quarter of 1998 are better
than for the same period in 1997.
	   For the financial year 1997, the integrated computer systems
company achieved a 22 per cent jump in group pre-tax profit to
RM19.3 million on a turnover of RM370 million.
	   Chuah attributes all that to a good cash position, wide customer
base and a good balance of business activities.
	   ``We don't just depend on one or two companies that give 10 or
20 per cent of our business,'' said Chuah after CSA's annual
general meeting in Petaling Jaya yesterday.
	   It already command about 7 per cent of the RM4 billion Malaysian
IT market, making it one of the single largest IT companies in
Malaysia.
	   ``We just need to increase our market share by 1 per cent and we
can grow more than 10 per cent.''
	   For this year, Chuah says results will be ``about the same''
from a base of over 2,000 customers; each expected to contribute a
few million each.
	   Nevertheless, CSA has not been untouched by events and Chuah
said the results would have been much better off if not for the
economic crisis.
	   What has helped is hedging and that most of its suppliers deal
with CSA in ringgit with only about 20 per cent dealing in US
dollars, which has helped take the edge off high exchange rates.
	   Although some 20 per cent of CSA's turnover comes from the large
banks, Chuah said he is not overly concerned with their
non-performing loan levels as again, not more than 2 per cent of
turnover comes from each bank regardless of how large it is.
	   A spinoff from that is lower borrowings as a result of the
smoother cash flow.
	   Also, indications are that IT expenditure is the last thing
banks can afford to cut back on, even in these difficult times, if
they want to stay competitive.
	   Another 15 per cent comes from securities companies, 20 per cent
from its wholesaling operations and the rest comes from the
manufacturing and oil and gas sectors.
	   Other revenue opportunities for CSA are the looming Y2K problem,
service and maintenance operations as companies prefer to maintain
existing hardware to save money.
	   ``Service and out sourcing will be a main contributor to revenue
this year,'' said Chuah.

	   AS the title goes, this book is meant to help people win. Shiv
Khera, the author, is a sought-after and well-known speaker,
motivator and entrepreneur based in the United States.
	   Khera describes his book as a construction manual, a cookbook,
and a guidebook.
	   As a construction manual, it is said to describe tools that
readers need for success and offers blueprints to build a
successful and rewarding life.
	   As a cookbook, it lists the ingredients, or the principles that
readers need to follow to become successful and the recipe for
mixing them in the correct proportions.
	   And as a guidebook, the book provides a step-by-step how-to book
that will take readers from dreaming about success to unlocking
one's potential for success.
	   The book looks simple but the author does not encourage the book
to be completed in one reading because the concepts cannot be
absorbed by either casual or hurried reading.
	   ``It should be read slowly and carefully, one chapter at a time.
Don't move on to the next chapter until you are sure you understand
every concept in the previous chapter,'' Khera stressed in his
preface.
	   Eight chapters make up this book. Chapter one is on the
Importance of Attitude - Building a Positive Attitude and this is
followed by Success - Winning Strategies.
	   Chapter three is on Motivation - Motivating Yourself and Others
Every Day. The next chapter focuses on building positive
self-esteem and image, followed by chapter five which is basically
on interpersonal skills, helping the reader to build a pleasing
personality.
	   Forming positive habits and character is covered in chapter six,
while the next chapter is devoted to helping the reader to set and
achieve goals. The final chapter is on Values and Vision, stressing
on doing the right thing for the right reason.
	   Here's a good book to read especially in these times when many
feel that they are unable to achieve their dreams.

	   GOING by Baghdad's claims, the eight-year sanctions by the
United Nations (UN) against Iraq have succeeded in murdering more
people than the invasion of Kuwait did. President Saddam Hussain,
who incurred the wrath of the US, its allies, and the world in
general for the 1990 invasion, said that 1.5 million Iraqis have
died from malnutrition and a lack of medical supplies during the
past eight years.
	   Whether or not the claims can be substantiated is not the main
issue.
	   And eight years may or may not be a long period of punishment
for what Iraq inflicted upon Kuwait and its people. However, if
people in Iraq are dying because of the sanctions, it is the duty
of the international community to investigate. If Baghdad's claims
are true, the UN must take urgent measures to stop this human
rights violation. The sanctions are meant to teach the Government a
lesson, not to kill civilians who had no part in the Kuwaiti
invasion, or deny Iraqi children their basic rights such as
education and medical care. If the people continue to elect Saddam
as their leader, it is not up to anyone outside Iraq to try and
change their ways by denying them food and medicine. The UN must
investigate Saddam's claims since the UN's food-for-aid deal ought
to have supplied enough food and medicine to care for the ordinary
Iraqi. If people are dying, is it a question of not enough or is it
because help is not reaching the people it is intended for?
	   The UN should be concerned because something could really be
amiss here.
	   According to a news report, a Russian plane that landed at the
Al-Rashid airbase last month carried three crew members, a
five-member delegation and just 20 kg of medicine. What can a few
cartons of medicine do for 22 million people and how can a few
tonnes of flour feed 7 million hungry children? Under its
food-for-aid deal with Iraq, the UN has allowed Baghdad to sell
US$2 billion (US$1  &QC;  RM3.99) of oil every six months for the last
year and a half and buy urgently needed food and medicine with some
of the revenue. If these figures are correct, people in Iraq should
not be dying of hunger or from the lack of medical care. The UN has
been more generous for the coming half-year, allowing Iraq to sell
up to US$4.5 billion worth of its oil in exchange for food. That
should really make the UN oil-rich.
	   Failure on the part of the world body to act on Saddam's claims
will, once again, confirm the double-standards being applied on
countries, depending on whose side one is. It is for humanitarian
purposes that Malaysia and other countries have been pressing the
UN to free Iraq from a social calamity. But it is sad to note the
existence of bigots in the UN.
	   The US, which was the dominant power when Iraq was ousted from
Kuwait in 1991 (and still is), wants to see Saddam punished further
at the expense of the Iraqi people. By playing up the issue of
Iraqi chemical weapons, Washington has adopted a harsh stance
against Baghdad. In fact, its strong aversion towards Iraq deters
any effort by the UN to lift the sanctions.
	   Some US allies in the UN are backing Washington's move for
further sanctions on Iraq. It is not that the UN has been pressured
by other members to lift the sanction but as usual, it is the
minority veto owers who have the ultimate say. This has been the
manner in which the UN always falls into the US' clutches. It would
seem as if it is not the UN which oversees world's affairs but the
US.
	   What has happened to the egalitarianism in the UN Charter? While
the principle of equal rights has been the foundation of the UN, a
few countries are allowed to practice elitism. Never has the UN, it
its five decades of existence followed the rule of majority. And as
long as the minority rules, the Iraqi people will not have the
chance to re-build their lives. Should the sanctions remain, Iraq
will become history by the next decade. Or is this what the US and
its allies actually want? The Iraqis cannot afford to continue
living in this manner. People in a tight corner will do anything to
survive, whether the UN likes it or not. It's for the UN to decide.

	   BESIDES being one of Malaysia's ranking competitive off-roader,
Norman has been in the motor service and maintenance industry since
completing his diploma in diesel engineering at the Federal
Institute of Technology, Malaysia, in 1978.
	   The Penang boy has never looked back since then - starting as an
apprentice at a performance tuning workshop, and then working his
way through some of the finest performance tuning workshops and 4x4
centres in Malaysia.
	   Before his stint at Traction Motors, he was at Speedworks in
1989, which does things like putting combo turbo-chargers and
superchargers in Range Rovers.
	   In 1991 when Speedworks boss Toh Soon Hing joined hands with Ken
O'Keefe to set up Ultimate Offroad Centre in Petaling Jaya, Norman
was assigned full-time to the Speedworks 4x4 division.
	   Ultimate Suspensions is a pioneer in Australian after-market
heavy duty off-road suspensions for four-wheel drives.
	   His experience with 4x4s began in 1986 with a Daihatsu Rocky.
	   In a competition, he was driving for Dunlop and subsequently
went on to win the team class in the 1996 Rainforest Championship.
For this event, he replaced the Lada-Niva's original suspension
with the Australian-made Tough Dog brand.
	   The other makes in the Dunlop team were two Suzukis and one
Pajero.
	   As a seasoned campaigner in major Malaysian competitive offroad
events, he reckons there is a big difference in the new offroading
generation.
	   ``When I competed in those days, I also had to double as
mechanical back- up. Look at the new drivers (competitors) today,
they still lose to us old members in recovery skills. And when the
going gets tough, they (the competitors) start to quarrel with the
officials.
	   ``Pressure ... they (the competitors) can't take it.
	   ``Last time, we did not sleep for two to three days and we could
still joke. Now, they just drive to the campsite and then
compete,'' he said.

World Cup: Croatia barely beats French third division team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Davor Suker missed one penalty kick but
drove home another to give Croatia a hard-fought 2-1 victory in a
practice match against a third division French club Tuesday.
	   Five days before Croatia's World Cup debut against Jamaica, the
Real Madrid striker saved his team from an embarrassing draw with
the 43rd-minute goal.
	   The Croats showed little enthusiasm in the match, played before
a friendly crowd of 7,000 in this bucolic town in the eastern
French hills, where they have set up their training camp.
	   ``Today wasn't important,'' said Croatia's captain Zvomimir
Boban.
	   Mario Stanic opened the scoring for Croatia in the 4th minute,
blasting the ball in from close range.
	   But the locals leveled eight minutes later when Christophe
Violant duped the Croatian defense in a solo run.
	   Croatia's stars played only in the first half but even they were
regularly fooled by the local in offside traps.
	   Suker missed his first chance to put Croatia ahead in the 32nd
minute when he had his penalty shot fisted away by the opposing
goal keeper.
	   Croatia replaced most of its first-choice players in the second
half half, which ended goalless.

	   THREE-month KLibor futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange
(MME) ended lower yesterday as interbank rates firmed up.
	   Three-month underlying Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rates
(KLibor) increased to 11.04 per cent from 11.02 per cent
previously, following intervention by Bank Negara Malaysia.
	   Only three contract months were traded yesterday with a total
volume of 16 lots.
	   September 98 was down by seven ticks to 88.93 with five lots
traded, December 98 dropped by seven ticks to 88.93 with six lots
changing hands, while March 99 declined by one tick to 88.92 with
five lots traded.
	   Mr Chris Podbury of JF Apex Futures said trading in the futures
market was listless in quiet tone yesterday.
	   ``We, however, expect the three-month KLibor futures to continue
to trade sideways to higher in the near term,'' he added.

	   JAYA Jusco Stores Bhd, after recording a net loss of RM14.44
million in its last financial year, is confident of achieving
higher net profits of RM4 million for the year ending February 28
1999, despite the current economic slowdown.
	   Jaya Jusco's confidence hinges on the retail chain's
anticipation of success in the shifting of its business strategy
from being a traditional retail shopping complex to a
smaller-scaled Neighbouring Shopping Complex (NSC), serving
residential areas.
	   ``We foresee the NSC business would be more profitable as it
will be located in residential areas, which will provide
convenience to our customers,''Jaya Jusco's managing director Mr
Masaaki Toyoshima said after the group's annual general meeting in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
	   NSC's will be located at the main area like Klang Valley and
Johor Bahru. The group is looking at areas with between 50 per cent
and 60 per cent matured populations.
	   The group plans to open 14 NSC's by 2002 and 50 by 2010, and the
first NSC is expected to be opened in 1999. Jaya Jusco will invest
some RM15 million for each store.
	   The investments will be funded through the group's internal
funds and strategic alliances with developers. Through the
alliances, Jaya Jusco will come up with the building design and
will lease them for 20 years once its completed, while developers
will develop the land at their cost.
	   ``His will help us to minimise the initial investments and speed
up expansion,'' he said.
	   Asked whether Jaya Jusco plans to seek loans, he said that the
group has no plan to do so as it now trying to reduce its gearing
ratio which currently stands between 0.51 and 0.73 times.
	   The group also has total loans US dollar loans amounting to
US$42.17 million. (US$1  &QC; RM4.00) US$16.87 million is due for
repayment over the next 12 months.
	   Meanwhile, Jaya Jusco has deferred opening two of its new
megamall - Bayan Bay in Penang and Seri Alam Shopping Centre in
Johor Bahru - due to the projects' slow progress.
	   The group is currently expanding its Taman Maluri outlet in
Cheras and Melaka Shopping Centre in Malacca, and the expansion
exercises are expected to be completed in March 2000 and July this
year respectively.

	   RINGGIT closed slightly lower against the US dollar yesterday on
weak fundamentals in the market, dealers said.
	   The local unit ended at 3.9950/005 to the greenback as against
3.9700/900 last Friday.
	   Dealers attributed the ringgit's easier sentiment as well as
other regional currencies to the weakening yen.

at 2.3331/335 from 2.3422/582, stronger against the yen at
2.8395/840 from 2.8477/641 but declined against the Deutschemark to

	   COMPANY directors need to be aware that their liabilities
arising from the millennium bug or Year 2000 (Y2K) problem are
significant. This is because the problem has been clearly
identified and the solutions are made available.
	   Their liabiliies are compounded due to the immense publicity
that the problem has generated.
	   Among others, the failure to act on the problem may leave the
directors liable to shareholder action for damages. This was
disclosed by Philip Chan, lawyer from the firm Azalina, Chan and
Chia, during a recent seminar related to the Y2K problem.
	   The seminar, titled Insurance Day, was organised by Unisys (M)
Sdn Bhd.
	   ``The legal implications of the Y2K problem range from
liabilities of directors and officers, drafting of remediation
contracts, liabilities of insurers and liabilities of vendors and
computers,'' Chan elaborated.
	   He said company officers hence have the onus to hire experts and
ensure that the problem is rectified.
	   However, Chan remarked, they should not be passive and rely
totally on experts alone.
	   ``They must conduct their own due diligence in informing their
ownselves of the qualifications of the experts and the merits of
the business decisions.''
	   Chan also reminded company directors that the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange authorities require companies to disclose in 1998 and 1999
their annual reports of the efforts and actions taken by each
company to ensure that they are Year 2000 compliant. ``As such, the
directors are also advised to seek assistance of Y2K experts in
drafting the statements in the annual reports,'' he said.
	   Tips on handling Y2K problem Educate themselves about the issue
and establish a committee to oversee the project. Encourage
employees to attend conferences, purchase books, subscribe to
publications and on-line services, etc.
	   Direct that an inventory of software used by the enterprise be
compiled, including source code, object code, operating systems,
utilities, file archives, third party applications and tools.
	   Conduct a risk assessment and produce a statement of impact to
report on the effect the Year 2000 would have on the enterprise.
	   Have the nature of the problem and the actions necessary to
address its communicated to all levels of the enterprise.
	   Develop a detailed plan to address the problem including all
resources necessary, a budget and critical path analysis.
	   Execute the plan on a timely basis, including work plans for the
period, work completed during the period, problems that arose and
solutions that were implemented.
	   Consider all approaches in addressing the problem, including
external consultants, specialised training, deferring
implementation of new systems to address current systems and
advancing the implementation of new systems to retire legacy
systems.

	   THE impact of the weakening yen on the Asian region will be deep
and far- reaching, economists said yesterday.
	   Executive director of the Malaysian Institute of Economic
Research, Dr Mohd Arif said a weaker yen means a weaker Japanese
economy.
	   ``The Japanese economy is stagnating. If it remains stagnant, it
is not good news since Japan is one of our most important trading
partners. Japan is also a very important Asian player and the
softening of the yen will have a deep impact on the region,'' he
told Business Times in a telephone interview.
	   Dr Arif added that as the yen is weakening now (at a time the
Asian region is facing an economic and financial crisis) indicates
the crisis is going to be global.
	   ``Due to the crisis in Asia, a lot of capital has moved out of
the region and into the US and Europe. Now that this has happened,
it is just a matter of time before it hits them as well since the
world is so `borderless' now,'' he said.
	   When asked about the strength of the Japanese economy, Arif said
the Japanese domestic economy is much bigger than what it seems.
	   ``In spite of the trade surpluses Japan has been recording, the
export sector only contributes about 10 per cent to the economy.
	   ``The problem is Japan needs a lot of economic reforms. The
interest rates for instance are way too low. It is less than 1 per
cent. In addition to that, the Japanese economy is over-regulated
and highly protected,'' Arif said.
	   Meanwhile, Ratings Agency of Malaysia (RAM) manager for
Economics and Market Research, Dr Yeh Kim Leng said a strong yen is
needed to increase exports for the entire region.
	   ``A softer yen will mean that Japanese goods and services will
be more competitive. Competition with Japan will be more difficult
despite the weakness of the other Asian currencies.
	   ``It would also mean fewer Japanese investments into the region.
	   Therefore, it is better for Asia as a whole for Japan to have a
stronger yen,'' Yeh said.
	   He added that the collapse of Japan's domestic demand means the
country is liquidity strapped.
	   ``Interest rates are very low. Businesses and consumers are not
spending and the Japanese Government has tried very hard to
stimulate spending.
	   However, consumers and corporations are not responding and
domestic consumption has fallen considerably.''
	   Yeh explained that most large economies are two-thirds
domestic-driven.
	   ``They cannot export their way out of the economic gloom. The
region is hoping that Japan will be the engine leading to economic
recovery for the region (like the US was for Mexico)... but Japan
is not likely to be the locomotive here.
	   ``We have to wait for the Japanese economy to pick up ... we
have to wait for measures to filter through the economy,'' Yeh
added.
	   Japan announced in April a record 16.6 trillion yen (100yen  &QC; 
RM2.90) stimulus spending package but markets are yet to be
convinced that it will have a long-term impact on the economy.
	   He said since Japan has been in an economic slump since the
early 1990s, it stands a better chance of recovering.
	   Meanwhile, head of research at Kenanga BNP PrimeEast, Mr Seow
Choong Liang said the impact of the falling yen on the region's
currencies is clear-cut.
	   ``The yen is being held by some countries in their reserves.
Therefore, the devalution of the yen could have a direct affect on
the region's currencies.
	   ``The devaluation of the yen could also make Japanese goods more
competitive and thus other countries in the region would have to
devalue currencies if they want to remain in the game,'' Seow said.

	   REMEMBER actor James Dean, the rebel without a cause? Well, meet
a rebel with a cause - Leo Burnett Advertising Sdn Bhd's chief
operating officer and managing director, Peter Wilken.
	   His cause is to push the level of the local advertising industry
to consistently achieve world standards.
	   And he wants Leo Burnett to be the pioneer, the catalytic player
in upping the quality ante of the local advertisement industry.
	   Only by constantly seeking improvement, he said, agencies ensure
that they survive the ever-increasing competition from other firms
and management consultants.
	   As such, Wilken stated, it's high time that the industry's
leading agencies see beyond the national landscape and produce
world-class products.
	   According to him, if this challenge requires them to
unreasonably demand changes in the attitude of all industry players
and of rules regulating the industry, then so be it.
	   Like the true advertising man that he is, Wilken backs his
position by quoting George Bernard Shaw, who once said, human
progress is usually achieved by the unreasonable person and not by
the reasonable one.
	   Achieving quality by engaging in change management is something
that this 37-year-old Briton has done before.
	   He did this when he headed Ogilvy and Mather Philippines where
he transformed the agency from a low-profile outfit into an
award-winning, all within a time frame of within two years.
	   And hence it comes as no surprise that he has embarked on a
programme to reinvent the agency since coming on board in December
last year. This he believes, would play an instrumental role in
helping the agency to better conform to the dictates of the
marketplace. However, in doing so, Wilken does not intend to
compromise Leo Burnett's main asset - its people. That would
explain their on-going recritment exercise.
	   Currently, Leo Burnett is one of the largest privately-owned
companies in the world. The agency handles many of the world's top
brands, including the top three, namely McDonalds, Coca-Cola and
Marlboro.
	   Managing and nurturing creative people Q: You have experienced a
wide and varied career. How has this prepared you in helming Leo
Burnett at this particular juncture?
	   A: I am lucky that the first five of the nine years that I have
been in Asia was spent playing a pan-regional role. This gave me
the opportunity to work in many different markets, cultures and
scenarios.
	   Prior to that, I had the experience to live through one of the
worst economic recession in Europe.
	   If anything, I believe these experiences have taught me to stick
to my principles, especially in defining what you are as a person
and what your company believes in.
	   In other words, never lose sight of what your goals are and
always look long term.
	   Furthermore, we have to retain emotional commitment to our
partners.
	   As such, Leo Burnett will not be rattled by short-term pressures
and will only react according to long term perspective. As such,
Leo Burnett for example, will not be pulling out of the industry,
unlike one agency which did so recently just because the economy is
presently not doing well.
	   Q: Can you explain your vision for the company?
	   A: My own personal vision will reflect the corporate vision,
it's a shared vision.
	   But during a recent management meeting at Terengganu, we reached
a watershed decision.
	   We decided that after being a leading player in the local
advertising industry for the last few years, we should expand our
horizons and seek global recognition.
	   We intend to make advertisement campaigns that can be recognised
on a worldwide basis. This is because now people work and shop on a
worldwide basis, for example, someone from Chicago can come and
engage our strategic expertise.
	   Malaysia should be one of the top places to provide such
services and at the moment we are doing a disservice to the country
in allowing our competitors from Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan
steal a march on us.
	   But instead, in a recent CNBC-Media Asian Advertising industry
poll, Malaysia was placed quite lowly in terms of the most creative
countries to work in.
	   And in this survey, Thailand topped the list.
	   This is surprising since in terms of creative manpower, both the
countries are similar. It is actually attitude and some constraints
placed on the industry, like the Made-in-Malaysia policy.
	   Although, Leo Burnett is doing in isolated cases some world
class work, but this is not done in a consistent manner as it
should be done rightly so.
	   I intend to achieve this in two to three years' time.
	   Q: How do you ensure that your employees embrace your vision and
work in tandem to it?
	   A: You can't force feed a vision, at best you can only encourage
them to take it on.
	   It's a bit like learning, they should make the effort to absorb
what is being taught.
	   They have to know that the company intends to be world class in
what we do and work towards it.
	   Q: What is the difference between managing an advertising agency
and managing any other company?
	   A: The difference is that agencies don't physically produce
anything except ideas.
	   So we can't measure ourselves on a physical basis, so that's the
main challenge.
	   Furthermore, we are dealing with extremely bright and
independently minded people.
	   And generally, creative people, tend to be much more free
spirited and don't respond well if they're placed in straitjacket.
	   However, they still need some sort of boundaries.
	   So managing people and creating an environment to this effect is
absolutely important, especially so as it's a delicate thing that
needs to be constantly nurtured.
	   Q: Can we expect Malaysians to head the company anytime soon?
	   A: Well, our chairman, Ali Mohamed, is a Malaysian and it's a
fact that Leo Burnett has one of the lowest expatriate to Malaysian
ratio for an international agency. But, I believe that nationality
should be secondary to ability and talent. If we had an Eskimo who
is capable, we will hire him or her - it won't make a difference.
	   Q: Leo Burnett prides itself for low employee turnover. How did
the company achieve this?
	   A: Actually, manpower turnover is an interesting question.
Although generally it is treated as a good development, it does not
have to be so all the time.
	   Sometimes, it means that the company is not being aggressive
enough in promoting change within its organisation.
	   Advertising agencies are especially slow in the way they do
business and hence need dramatic change.
	   Changes not only in the way they are structured but also in
competing effectively in the marketplace.
	   To succeed against management consultancies, for example,
agencies need to hire people with absolutely leading edge strategic
capabilities.
	   But of course I'm not implying that to raise manpower quality,
an infusion of new blood is all that is required. We also rely
heavily on our own internal resources for this.
	   Q: How do you ensure that you have a ready supply of creative
people?
	   A: Creative training is really difficult although many people
still try it.
	   You can educate people to a certain extent like in the areas of
art direction but I don't really think that we can teach
creativity.
	   One way to encourage creativity is to push for the creation of
better advertising campaigns by using the world's best as the
benchmark.
	   Q: Management wise, how is Leo Burnett different from other
companies?
	   A: Well, we don't really do anything really radically different
but I would say that we do some of the simpler things in our
business exceptionally well.
	   Q: You speak much about change management. How will it affect
Leo Burnett organisationally?
	   A: I would like to create smaller companies within companies.
	   They will run with much autonomy and responsibility but infused
with the same spirit as its parent company.
	   Q: The first casualty during times of economic distress is the
advertising and public relations budget. Any comments?
	   A: Well, this is evidently occurring. Apart from few, usually
the larger multinationals, many companies don't actively invest
during these times.
	   It is happening simply because advertisement budget is the most
easiest and flexible budget that can be cut without an immediate
counter backlash.
	   Furthermore, many of the people who are working on the
advertisement budget don't have to live with the consequences as
the average life-cycle of a marketing manager is about three years.
	   Unfortunately, the long-term damage is not taken into account.
	   The impact of a large sustained budget cutback will not be seen
for about three to four years.
	   But then, the process of recovering market position too will
take an almost same amount of time.
	   Nevertheless, it is hard to argue with clients who are fighting
to retain their employees to make a choice between their
advertising budget and their people.
	   Advertising is something that is intangible, and people will
always argue for something that is tangible, like retaining their
employees.
	   Nevertheless, anyone who takes 10 minutes to read the various
literature abound on why advertising is key for long-term survival
will understand the need for continued advertising.
	   Additionally, this is the ideal time to kill off smaller
competitors.
	   Thus, the situation provides huge possibilities for companies
with foresight to invest.
	   Q: Do you think advertising takes a backseat because it is seen
as a luxury and not a necessity?
	   A: What many companies say and do are different. Many claim that
they know that advertising is important. However, figures
conclusively show that Malaysian companies tend to cut advertising
during recessionary times.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Sun. - The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
Ministry will meet Padiberas Nasional Bhd to discuss allegations
that it is the cause of the price increase in the Super grade rice.
	   Its minister, Datuk Seri Megat Junid Megat Ayob, said the
meeting was to find ways to stop spiralling prices, and to ensure
that no party would take advantage of the high market demand by
marking up the prices of super grade rice which is not
government-regulated.
	   The meeting, he said, would also include rice importers, millers
and wholesalers.
	   ``We have to check whether these allegations are true. This is a
staple food and an important item ... profits should not be the
only criterion,''
	   he said when asked to comment on allegations by the Federation
of the Malaysian Consumer Associations that Bernas had sold
imported rice at a high price.
	   He was speaking after the launching of Pemadam Kawasan Parliamen
Segambut.
	   Megat Junid who did not deny that some traders took advantage of
the situation to mark up the prices of super grade rice, said his
ministry and the Agriculture Ministry were studying ways to
overcome this situation.
	   ``The Government is likely to decide on whether to control the
price of super grade rice,'' he said adding that at the moment, the
Government would let market forces determine the price instead of
making it a controlled item.
	   The only control on super grade rice is on its quality in that
it should contain not more than 25 per cent of low quality rice
(beras hancur).
	   Standard Grade is a local produce which contains broken rice,
rice from unripened padi and permissible foreign bodies while
Premium Grade is local rice of moderate quality.
	   Megat Junid said studies showed that many prefer Super grade
rice compared to standard and premium grades.
	   Super grade, he said commands a 90 per cent market of the total
consumption nationwide, making it profitable and more favourable
for millers.
	   The lowest price of super grade rice with five per cent broken
content was RM2.52 per kg, those for packs with 10 to 15 per cent
broken content were lower at RM1.80.
	   The retail price of premium grade rice is fixed at RM1.05 per kg
while there is virtually no demand for standard grade rice.
	   Megat Junid said both ministries would continue enforcement to
ensure that prices of super grade rice would remain reasonable.
	   He said the Government could take action if traders and
retailers increased the prices of premium and standard grade rice
but could not do so for super grade rice although the contents must
conform to specifications laid down by the Government.
	   Megat Junid said the prices of domestic and imported rice had
increased by 21 per cent and 52 per cent respectively compared to
previous price since May.
	   He said the price of rice had become expensive while the demand
had increased due to the declining production caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
	   ``Indonesia which used to have a surplus of more than three
million tonnes of rice is facing a decline in its production which
had inevitably caused a shortage in the supply of rice to this
country,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Megat Junid, who is Pemadam president, said the 10
parliamentary constituencies in the Federal Territory must set up a
branch to provide after-care services to reformed addicts.

	   THE price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market rose 33 sen to RM23.53
per kg following the weakening of the ringgit against the US
dollar, dealers said.
	   The rise yesterday was an adjustment following the weakening of
the ringgit, they said, pointing out that last Friday tin on the
London Metal Exchnage dropped US$20 and that this meant there was
no adverse impact from that market here.
	   The ringgit breached the 4.00 level against the US dollar
yesterday. At 12.23pm, the ringgit stood at 4.0050 after sliding to
as low as 4.0300.
	   Buying on the KLTM yesterday came mainly from European and local
buyers.
	   At the opening level, buyers made bids for 148 tonnes while

	   KOTA BARU, Sun. - Fourteen vehicles were destroyed when a fire
razed a motor workshop at Jalan Long Yunus yesterday.
	   An adjacent shophouse was also destroyed in the incident which
occurred about 6.15pm.
	   Ten of the vehicles destroyed in the blaze had been left at the
shop for repairs.
	   Workshop proprietor Lin Tong Gan, 27, estimated the loss at
RM500,000.
	   State Fire and Rescue Department director Abdul Aziz Harun said
firemen in three engines spent about 90 minutes to bring the blaze
under control and prevented it from spreading to nearby buildings,
including a double- storey house and a petrol station.
	   Abdul Aziz added that initial investigations revealed the fire
might have started from a gas stove.
	   A motor-cyclist, Abdul Kadir Abdul Rahman, 63, of Kampung
Dendang, who fell off his machine in Ketereh two days ago, died at
the Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital in Kubang Kerian about
10.10am today. He had head and body injuries.
	   District traffic chief Assistant Superintendent Mohd Sany Ismail
said Abdul Kadir skidded after going over a pothole on Friday.

	   SOME 500 manufacturing companies of local products and services
will take part in the `Love Malaysia Consumer Fair 1998', an
exposition, said to be the biggest in the country.
	   Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad is scheduled to
officiate at the event, which will be held at the Mines Exhibition
Centre for a period of 10 days, from July 10 to July 19.
	   Announcing the details yesterday, Transport Minister Datuk Seri
Dr Ling Liong Sik said the event is to promote local products and
services, as part of efforts to overcome the current economic
problems.
	   ``When you love Malaysia, you buy Malaysian goods. This can help
our factories to strengthen their positions and ensure the
permanence of their employees,'' he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Besides buying local products, he said, Malaysians should also
use local services and save with local banks, study at local
universities and holiday at local tourist spots.
	   ``It improves the national resilience. This is what `Buy
Malaysia' means,'' he said.
	   The exposition is jointly organised by the Kuala Lumpur and
Selangor Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KLSCCCI) and the
Love Malaysia Action Committee. Its main sponsor is the Country
Heights Group of Companies.
	   The event demonstrates the loyalty and sincerity of Malaysian
Chinese businessmen in overcoming current economic woes, said
KLSCCCI president Lim Guan Teik.
	   To date, 300 companies have confirmed their participation
including the Taiwan Manufacturers' Association and some foreign
companies which manufacture here.
	   On whether other entrepreneurs such as Malays and Indians can
take part in the exposition, Ling said ``This is a national effort.
All are invited and no one who wishes to participate will be left
out.''
	   Besides promoting products and services, some companies will
also offer special prices during the promotion period.

Annan protests law banning religious parties in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan told
Tajikistan's president Tuesday that a new law banning religiously
based political parties could undermine the 1997 peace accord
between the government and the largely Muslim opposition.
	   The agreement guaranteed posts in a coalition government to the
United Tajik Opposition. But the UTO's largest component, the
Islamic Revival Party, would presumably be banned under the new
law, adopted by the Tajik parliament May 23.
	   Annan met Tuesday with Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov to
express ``serious concern that this decision would remove one of
the main pillars of the General Peace Agreement,'' the United
Nations said in a statement.
	   The agreement provided for the legalization of banned political
parties following the public declaration by the UTO that it had
disbanded its armed wing.
	   ``The secretary-general voiced the expectation that the
conciliation commission established by President Rakhmonov will
resolve this matter in the spirit of the general agreement signed
by the Tajik government with the United Tajik Opposition,'' the
statement added.
	   There was no comment from Rakhmonov, who was in New York to
attend the U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs, which
opened Monday.
	   Approval of the law banning such parties is among several recent
developments which have led to warnings from the opposition about
the prospect of renewed, largescale fighting in the former Soviet
Central Asian republic.
	   Last month, Tajik opposition figures also denounced a new
partnership among Russia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to curb the
rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the region.
	   The opposition said the partnership would ``seriously jeopardize
the divided Tajik society. Russia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan formed
the partnership to work to end the violence that has erupted twice
this year in Tajikistan, killing dozens of people.
	   Uzbek President Islam Karimov also said the new partners should
work together to revive Tajikistan's economy and oppose aggressive
Islamic fundamentalism in both Central Asia and the North Caucasus
regions.
	   Tajikistan has been troubled by sporadic violence despite the
peace accord ended a five-year civil war.

	   Wan, from Ipoh, Perak, attributed his success to a keen interest
in the subject and hard work.
	   ``My parents also gave me tremendous support,'' said Wan, who
will be leaving for Scotland on Wednesday to complete his
pharmaceutical degree.

	   MALAYSIAN rubber prices closed lower, reflecting weak regional
prices and lack of demand from buyers.
	   A dealer said the market was quiet and this was due to worries
about regional uncertainties.
	   ``Prices in Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore are all bearish.
The local price adjusted itself to regional levels,'' a dealer
said.
	   Another dealer said there are concerns about the regional
currency movements.
	   If the US dollar strengthens against the neigbouring producers'
currencies, it could make rubber from other countries more
competitive than local rubber, he said.
	   At the close, June International RSS One ended at 282.00 sen per
kg compared to 285 sen on Friday while June SMR 20 closed at 270.50
per kg compared to 273.50 sen at the end of last week.
	   The International Natural Rubber Organisation's (INRO) daily
market indicator price for June 5 stood at 198.44
Malaysian/Singapore cents versus 200 on June 4.
	   The five-day moving average stood at 201.60 cents versus 202.87
cents, previously.

	   IT wasn't the kind of news that grabbed too much attention and
the impact was probably felt more among those involved in computer
journalism. After 23 years, one of the computer industry's most
respected publications, Byte, is closing down.
	   Started in 1975, the magazine practically grew up alongside the
personal computer (PC) industry and was at one time regarded as
``the technology magazine''. It was known for its serious, in-depth
reporting on technology, as well as for its editorial independence
and influence on the computer industry.
	   Byte was seen as the benchmark and there were no serious
competitors then. It was always the first to report on the new
trends and the noteworthy in technology. But in recent years,
circulation has fallen, along with advertising revenues. Long-time
readers would notice the drastic cut in pagination of what was once
the thickest computer publication around.
	   Finally, it was bought over by CMP Media which decided to
suspend publication after the July issue. Though the company has
announced plans for a revamped version, many are sceptical. It also
appears to be doubtful as 74 of the 85 staff members were being
laid off.
	   Why buy a magazine and then suspend it?
	   An explanation offered by John Dvorak, the well-known columnist
of PC Magazine, was that CMP still perceived Byte to be a serious
rival of its own flagship Windows magazine. ``The sad thing is that
Byte is a symbolic and historic publication that should not have
met with such an ignominious finale. It's a crime,'' Dvorak
commented.
	   I remember Byte from way back because it was the favourite
computer magazine of the late Mah Swee Aun, who was also a pioneer
of sort, being the first sub-editor to work on Computimes. He used
to point out the interesting articles in each issue, and the crisp
writing style and easy- to-follow layout and design that
journalists should learn to emulate - a guide to the new age of
inIT journalism. However, Mah wasn't so forthcoming when anyone
wanted to borrow his copy of Byte.
	   Still, the magazine's abrupt end does come as a surprise. One
reason given was that Byte was not consumer-oriented but geared
more towards serious computer users. It doesn't focus on any niche
market segments like PCs or networking but attempts to be
wide-ranging, covering practically everything that was
computer-related. It was crammed with technical details about
hardware and software, a treasure trove for the computer
enthusiasts.
	   Perhaps, it tried to do too much, and failed to notice the
changes taking place around the industry. In recent years, the
computer magazine market has become rather specialised and a
general interest publication tends to find the going tough while
looking to retain readers and advertisers.
	   For Byte, the shutdown came after 10 years of sharp declines,
even though various attempts were made to revamp the magazine and
made it more relevant to readers and industry. Unfortunately, these
were not successful or maybe too late.
	   The demise of Byte also marked the end of Jerry Pournelle's
Chaos Manor user column, regarded as the longest-running,
continuously published feature in computer journalism. Another
milestone.
	   For those who were involved in computer publishing long before
computers were as ubiquitous as they are today, the end of Byte is
seen as the end of an era. Possibly, there are lessons to be
gathered from the demise of a once-prominent pioneer.

	   SHARE prices rose 0.2 per cent on future-led buying yesterday
despite concerns over renewed regional currency weakness triggered
by the Japanese yen's fall, dealers said.
	   The key Hang Seng index gained 17.16 points to close at
8,586.63, after a 4.1 per cent loss in the previous week's trade.
The value of turnover amounted to HK$4.548 billion, up from
Friday's HK$3.47 billion.
	   The market opened on a strong note with the key barometer
gaining 11.84 points by the end of the morning session.
	   Dealers said regional currency weakness triggered by the yen's
fall through the psychologically important 140 level against the
dollar dominated trading in morning session with the index falling
below the 8,500 point level at a stage.

Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Taiwan and South Korea.
	   ``There is great potential in this industry due to the high
demand overseas,'' said managing director Raymond Cheah.
	   Technofish, which started 12 years ago as a pioneer status
company, breeds and sells wholesale about 40 species and 60
varieties of aquarium fish commercially on its eight-hectare fish
farm at the Senai Industrial Estate.
	   It invested between RM50,000 and RM100,000 on each 0.4-ha of the
farm.
	   Each plot consists of about 20 to 200 earth ponds, areas for
hatchery, nursery, growout, grading, quarantine and packing.
	   ``The sales value for every hectare ranges between RM5,000 and
RM20,000 per month,'' Cheah said.
	   Besides fancy carp, scientifically known as cyprinus carpio,
other varieties include ramirez (apistogramma ramirezi), tiger barb
(barbodes tetrazona), goldfish (carrassius auratus), managuense
cichlid (cichlasoma managuense), dwarf gourami (colisa lalia),
kissing gourami (helostoma temmincki) and angel fish (pterophyllum
scalare).
	   Cheah said among the best selling were the tetras such as
penguin tetra (thayeria obliqua) and glowlight tetra (hemigrammus
erythrozonus), barbs and gouramis. The company breeds its own fry
from imported parent stock from countries in Southeast Asia,
Australia, China, India, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina,
Congo, Zambia and Madagascar.
	   Technofish also prepares its own feed, carries out in-breeding
and hatchery experiments as well as supplying fish fry to other
farms.
	   These fry are cultivated in the farm until they reach marketable
size.
	   Cheah, who is also the Johor Aquarium Fish Breeders Association
vice- president, said the aquarium fish industry had the fastest
returns compared with other agriculture-related ventures.
	   Technofish also provides training courses for Fisheries
Department staff and Universiti Putra Malaysia students.
	   Johor produces about 62 per cent of the country's total export
of RM60 million worth of aquarium fish last year.
	   There are more than 400 fish breeders in the State, scattered
over Jemaluang, Layang Layang, Ulu Tiram, Pontian, Kulai, Kluang,
Kota Tinggi and Kempas.
	   Cheah said the State Fisheries Department's constant support had
contributed to the success of the industry.

	   MODENA, Italy (AP) _ It was a taste of Pavarotti both spicey and
spiked, with a touch of soul.
	   The tenor of his times sang in an outdoor song-fest Tuesday
night directed by Spike Lee and co-starring pop performers like the
Spice Girls, Stevie Wonder and Jon Bon Jovi.
	   The Ginger-less Spice group were giving their first performance
since their split with ``Ginger Spice,'' Geri Halliwell, was
announced.
	   The four and Pavarotti joined forces for the song ``Viva
Forever.'' Before coming in with his operatic vibrato, the tenor
stood stolidly, smiling broadly, as the Spices undulated while
singing their breathy measures.

	   GOPENG Bhd has been appointed to market a multimedia course that
is being offered by an Australian university.
	   This followed the signing of an agreement by Gopeng's
subsidiary, Gopeng Technologies Systems Sdn Bhd, with Edith Cowan
University of Australia. It was signed in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
	   A third party to this agreement is multimedia firm Prism
(Australia), which had a hand in designing the courses and will
assist in the training of local teachers.
	   So far, Gopeng has finalised an agreement with a local college
which will be conducting the course. The course is expected to
commence this November and 60 students are expected to enrol.
	   Negotiations are ongoing with two other colleges and are
expected to be finalised within two months, said Hamdan.
	   The company declined to reveal the costs of the course.
	   ``The fee structure has not been finalised yet, but will be
comparable with fees of other twinning courses,'' Hamdan said.
	   Edith Cowan University's diploma course in multimedia currently
costs about A$10,800 (RM25,920) per year for overseas students.
	   Gopeng executive chairman Datuk Mohamed Hamdan Hazizi said it is
the group's intention to expand their activities especially in
education.

	   SHARES on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) ended
yesterday's trade broadly lower as investors dumped stocks on
worries over the declining ringgit, said analysts.
	   The gloomy regional markets yesterday also contributed to the
weak sentiment as the Japanese yen continued to fall against the US
dollar.
	   The KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) breached the psychological
500-point level yesterday to end the day 7.26 points or 1.44 per
cent down at 497.79 after touching a low of 497.44 at 3.48pm. Big
capitalised stocks were under selling pressure yesterday as foreign
funds, in reaction to the weakening ringgit were shorting the
stocks in thin volumes.
	   Yesterday, the ringgit closed at 3.9950/005 to the greenback as
against 3.9700/900 last Friday.
	   A weak ringgit would raise the external debt of the country's
corporations and raise the price of imported goods, they said.
	   The Second Board index closed 0.36 points lower to 109.05 while
the broader-based Emas Index was down 2.09 points at 128.46.
	   The scoreboard showed losers outpacing gainers 430 to 128 with
159 counters remained unchanged.
	   The broad-based BT Ordinaries eased 2.07 points to 121.78 while
the 30- share New Straits Industrial Index slid 34.96 points to end
at 2,988.05.
	   On the KLSE yesterday, total turnover was 99.290 million shares
valued at RM225.384 million compared with 106.763 million shares
valued at RM279.069 million last Friday.
	   Turnover on the main board was 82.729 million shares worth
RM214.948 million while trade on the Second Board was 5.504 million
shares worth 8.216 million yesterday.
	   Maybank was the most active counter with 13.259 million shares
traded followed by Berjaya Singer TSRs with 5.653 million shares
and TNB with 4.547 million shares dealt.

Four year's best records set at Slovnaft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Athletes in four events set records
for the year at the Slovnaft Grand Prix track meet on Tuesday.
	   In the Grand Prix women's discus Russia's Natalya Sadova
improved this year's best world result by 0.27 meter, reaching
67.85 meters. The throw secured the gold for Sadova, beating out
Anastasia Kelesidou from Greece by 2.02 meters. World champion
Beatrice Faumine from New Zeland came up short with 65.43.
	   ``It's my personal record, but it came too early ... I'll have
to keep this form,'' said Sadova after the meet. ``Sixty-seven
meters would get me gold at the European Championship in
Budapest.''
	   Other records were achieved in disciplines not included in the
Grand Prix competition.
	   In men's 3,000 steeplechase, Kenya's Joseph Keter became the
fastest athlete this year with 8 minutes, 8.91 seconds.
	   Running 1,500 meters in 4:00.81, Kenya's Jackline Maranga became
this year's fastest woman in the world.
	   Czech Daniela Bartova marked the European record as she defeated
4.51 meters in pole vault.
	   Running the 110-meter hurdles in 13.13 seconds, Mark Crear from
the United States missed this year's best record by just .01
second.

	   CARAN d'Ache of Switzerland, manufacturer of writing instruments
and colour products, has created for itself a new brand identity as
seen in its recent launch of its latest luxury pen collection
called Leman.
	   Established in 1924 and named after a French artist, the Swiss
pen manufacturer has incorporated a new brand identity into its
Leman collection. The new collection, in a break from the brand
identity used by Caran d'Ache since 1974, carries the new ``CdA''
monogram which ``better reflects the notion of a timeless
quality,'' the company said in a statement issued locally by its
sole Malaysian distributor S.A. Desco Marketing Sdn Bhd. The
monogram is in a dark red background and will crown the cap of each
writing equipment produced by Caran d'Ache in the future.
	   The Leman pen, first presented at the International Stationery
Exhibition in Frankfurt, Germany, on Feb 1 this year, comes with a
spring loaded clip and a two-toned, 18-carat gold fountain pen nib
with a rhodium-coated centre.

	   KLSE Composite Index Futures traded on the Kuala Lumpur Options
and Financial Futures Exchange (KLoffe) tracked the cash market to

2,755 lots.
	   Its high for the day was 500 and a low of 487.8. Open interests

level.

	   CARLSBERG has launched Carl's Reserve, which was initially
introduced for a limited period as a festive beer during this
year's Chinese New Year.
	   The new product is crystal-filtered, giving it a lively and
distinctive taste and less bitter than other regular beers.
	   Carlsberg Malaysia Managing Director Datuk Jorgen Bornhoft said
overwhleming market response during its launch, and subsequent
positive findings from consumer research led to the decision to
launch Carl's Reserve as a permanent brand.
	   The beer, which is aimed at the upper segment of the market,
will be initially available in small bottles only. There are plans
to introduce cans in the near future.
	   The product will also be distributed selectively in hotels,
clubs, pubs, restaurants and major supermarkets.
	   ``We in Carlsberg are very optimistic of the many opportunities
that exist now for entrenching Carl's Reserve solidly in this
market, even in these trying times.
	   ``We are going to invest substanially in a long-term brand
building programme rather than short-term sales driven activities,
which clearly demonstrates our faith in Malaysia as well as our
confidence in the future of Carl's Reserve,'' Bornhoft said.
	   During a Press conference after the launch, Bornhoft said Carl's
Reserve would be priced around RM5 in the retail market. It was
aimed at the younger generation.
	   When asked about the future prospects of the beer market, he
said, despite the economic problems the market was doing reasonably
well.
	   ``I do not agree with the notion that more people are drinking
beer because of the economic downturn. The Malaysian beer market
has always been supported by people who enjoy their drinks
especially those who drink moderately in the company of friends.
	   ``As such the trend is continuing. Furthermore there are also
those who are switching from expensive hard liquor to beer during
these times,'' he said.

Hamas: Sheik Yassin to return within days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yassin comment, Israel barring family
of another Hamas official from entering Gaza; ADDS Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Sheik Ahmed Yassin, founder and
spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, will return to
Gaza within days, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas spokesman, told The Associated Press that
Yassin _ who has been on a 3 1/2-month tour of Muslim countries
raising millions of dollars and drumming up support for Hamas _
will ``most likely'' come back to Gaza on Saturday.
	   Israel's security establishment and political leaders have been
debating for weeks whether the sheik would pose a greater danger
from outside or inside Gaza. Israel, which controls Gaza's borders,
could keep Yassin out if it wished.
	   Meanwhile, Israel barred the wife and children of another Hamas
official, Mousa Abu Marzouk, from entering the Gaza Strip from
Egypt Tuesday. Abu Marzouk was released last summer from a U.S.
jail and sent to Jordan where he lives now, after promising not to
get involved in terrorism.
	   ``This morning, my brother's wife Nadia and her five children
were refused entry into Gaza by the Israeli border police, even
though they traveled on American passports'' Abu Marzouk's brother
Mahmoud said.
	   He said it was the first time Israel had ever refused her
permission to visit and that the family had asked the Palestinian
Authority to intervene on their behalf. Mrs. Abu Marzouk returned
to Cairo, her brother-in-law said.
	   Regarding Yassin's return to Gaza, Israeli leaders appeared
Tuesday to be leaning toward allowing him back, in part because
keeping him out could set off an explosion of violence by backers
of Hamas.
	   ``The choice is not between what is good and better, but between
what is bad and worse,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Israel radio.
	   Yassin was quoted by the Sudan News Agency in Khartoum where he
is visiting, as saying he would return.
	   ``I did not sneak out through a window and I am going back home
through the door sooner or later. i am going to live among my
people leading the jihad there,'' Yassin said.
	   State-owned Israel TV reported that Israel's internal security
agency, Shin Bet, submitted its recommendation to the government
that Yassin's returned be allowed and coordinated with the
Palestinian Authority. Not other details on the recommendation were
available and the secret agency does not have a spokesperson.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel, and its military wing has
killed more than 100 Israelis in scores of attacks in recent years.
	   The group's popularity in the Palestinian lands, especially
Gaza, is seen as a growing threat to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's authority.
	   Yassin's fiery comments on his tour, such as his description of
suicide attacks as ``holy missions,'' have been widely reported in
Israel.
	   Yassin was freed from an Israeli jail last fall to buy the
freedom of two Israeli Mossad agents captured in Jordan during a
bungled assassination attempt on another Hamas leader.
	   On Monday, Netanyahu's inner security Cabinet debated the Yassin
question, but did not reach any decision.

	   THE formation of asset management companies to manage
non-performing loans is quite common in the West - an example that
is being followed by the Government in establishing Pengurusan
Danaharta Nasional Bhd.
	   Time will tell of the success or failure of this courageous
undertaking by the Government.
	   In its website, Bank Negara has included case studies of
countries such as the US, Sweden and Mexico, which have formed such
asset management companies following concerns on the solvency of
local banks.
	   The central bank said from 1980 to 1991, about 1,400 banks in
the US failed or received government assistance. During the same
period, 1,100 thrifts (retail savings and loans insitutions)
failed.
	   The US legislature then created the Resolution Trust Corporation
to help troubled thrifts.
	   The RTC's brief was to take over the non-performing loans of
failed thrifts, and actively manage these assets to maximise value
pending eventual disposal.
	   Formed in 1989, the RTC had at its peak assets totalling about
US$1 trillion (RM4 trillion). All these assets have been
successfully disposed of and the RTC ceased operations in 1996.
	   Another form of an asset management company set up by the US
Congress way back in 1933 was the Federal Depositors Insurance
Corporation which, among other things, acquired NPLs of banks
facing insolvency.
	   In what is termed as ``bulk sales,'' the FDIC, said Bank Negara
in its website, acquired NPLs as well as performing loans and sold
them in bulk to interested parties through a closed bid process.
	   Loans bought in bulk sales have common characteristics and are
packaged according to criteria such as loan size, quality, type,
collateral and location.
	   These packages are offered to interested parties and the
successful bidder takes on all the risks of the acquired loan
package from FDIC.
	   Bid packages forwarded to interested parties offer a specific
loan portfolio including loans information spreadsheets, invitation
and instruction to bid, loan sales agreements and other important
documents.
	   The FDIC finances its operations through the issue of bonds.
	   Bank Negara said in its website that the Mexican Government
received financial assistance from the US, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank.
	   This allowed the Government to provide support for banks through
the Bank Fund for Savings Support, Fondo Bancario para Proteccion
del Ahorro (FOBAPROA).
	   The FOBAPROA is a trust established by the Banco de Mexico to
provide ``preventive support'' to problem banks.
	   Its existence predates the 1994-1995 Mexican banking crisis.
FOBAPROA's stated mission is to cover all bank liabilities, except
subordinated debt.
	   FOBAPROA has generally acted as the lead agency in resolving
bank problems since the peso crisis.
	   One of the major FOBAPROA assistance programmes implemented was
the purchase of impaired loan assets from banks at net book value
(on the basis of the Mexican rating system) in exchange for a
requirement for the bank in question to raise new equity.
	   The FOBAPROA instituted this programme on a case by case basis:
in some instances, the FOBAPROA purchased US$2 of loans for every
US$1 of equity injected; other cases have run as high as 5 to 1.
	   In the case of Sweden, two banks were taken over by the
government, which formed asset management companies to acquire
these banks' non- performing assets.
	   This happened during the years 1991 to 1993 when several banks
were facing insolvency, Bank Negara said.
	   The Swedish government's initial step was to guarantee the
safety and soundness of the banking system, stating it would stand
behind the banks.
	   The government adopted legislation creating a comprehensive
programme to restructure the banking system. Its support led to the
private sector recapitalisation of the banks.
	   Four other banks in Sweden were encouraged to form their own
similar asset workout vehicles to take over problem real estate
loans.

	   IT is now official: Malaysia's economy contracted 1.8 per cent
in the first quarter but all is not lost as pronouncements since
then have given us hope.
	   Leading the chorus was Bank Negara Governor Tan Sri Ahmad Mohd
Don who duly noted that growth was picking up early in the second
quarter. At a recent briefing where the negative Gross Domestic
Product figure was announced, Ahmad and his team tried their best
to assure the Press that the economy was picking up steam.
	   However, the central bankers stopped short of saying whether
second quarter GDP growth would be positive. At best, there was an
impression of the second quarter hitting zero growth.
	   This column had warned in the third quarter of 1997 that if all
sectors of the economy were to cut costs, led by the Government
itself, there was a danger of the economy going into a tailspin
from which it would be extremely difficult to recover.
	   The concern then was that people in the private as well as
public sectors might go overboard in cutting costs rather than
cutting waste.
	   Cutting waste trims the fat and makes organisations more lean
and mean.
	   Cutting costs per se may be self-defeating. With everyone
cutting costs, domestic demand will shrink and the economy will
risk coming to a standstill.
	   Among the voices of hope was that of Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. He had said March
actually saw pick-up and the first quarter results were pulled down
by January and February.
	   With this, there is hope that the second quarter may be flat or
slightly positive and Malaysia can avoid a recession which,
technically, is two successive quarters of contraction.
	   February has traditionally been a ``quiet'' and under-performing
month.
	   Activities slow down for the festive season and will take time
to gather speed again.
	   However, this time, the incompetence of the authorities
responsible for water has added to our woes. And the
``authorities'' here do not mean just the Selangor Waterworks
Department.
	   There is a strongly-held view that the first quarter GDP figures
might not have been negative if there was no water crisis. What do
you expect the data to show when factories had to cut down on
production?
	   At a time when the nation needs every productive sector to bring
in the badly-needed foreign exchange, we hear of electronics
factories cutting production by 30 to 50 per cent.
	   One cannot avoid looking at the situation with the benefit of
hindsight.
	   Yes, the Waterworks engineers had recommended early plans for
water supply schemes but the State authorities had other
``agendas.''
	   Yes, there is now a contingency plan but does anyone monitor it
to see whether it works? Does the rationing system work? At best, a
sympathetic review will show that the rationing only brings to the
fore the inherent weakenesses of the reticulation system.
	   One wonders if the Waterworks staff actually know which valve
controls which area and how long it takes for water to reach
particular areas.
	   How else can Waterworks explain why factories, including the
largest single user of water in the Klang Valley, did not get water
for five days at a stretch while others within the rationing zones
got water every day at the same time?
	   Waterworks can now deny this but no amount of denial can erase
the sad fact that these factories, including the single largest
user, have given the Government an ultimatum.
	   If the worst happens and these factories relocate, the country
will lose more than their investments in terms of ringgit and sen.
We will have lost our image as an attractive investment
destination. We will have told the world that in a country with
abundant rainfall, we are unable to assure investors of sufficient
water supply.
	   Errant and incompetent Waterworks staff must be punished if they
fail in their duties. The ``bad apples'' should not drag down the
thousands of diligent, hardworking and solution-driven
professionals in the department.
	   The work culture there has to shift to a higher plane. They
cannot adopt a tidak apa attitude of not attending to pipe leaks
and mains bursts. When we do not even produce enough for our needs,
let us conserve every drop we manage to put into the system.
	   (As I pen these lines, I cannot help but mention the tale of a
leaking tank near my house. Countless complaints, including one
directly to the district engineer in October, have brought no
solution. Action there was: sometime in November, a Waterworks
employee in a gleaming 4WD vehicle stopped by to check and told me
he had no ladder to do a proper check! (At that time, there was
only one leak detected. Another tank has since then also sprung a
leak and there are now two leaking tanks! My neighbours and I get a
free reminder each time supply resumes in our area due to the
racket caused.) As for the Selangor State Government, it cannot
shirk its responsibilities or pass the blame to others. The State
has failed to implement the water supply schemes that Waterworks
engineers had recommended as early as 1990.
	   To be fair to the current Menteri Besar, he inherited a
situation which inevitably turned into a crisis. The person who was
supposed to ``press the button'' several years ago is no longer
around.
	   Let us make the best of the situation and make sure everyone
gets their fair share of water, especially industrial users.
	   TALKING POINT: The Government, right up to the highest
authority, must now pull out the stops and make sure these
factories DO NOT leave. It is a matter of national honour.

	   THE Royal Customs and Excise Malaysia spends some RM7 billion
annually on paper and document processing but electronic commerce
(e-commerce) will cut costs significantly and prove beneficial to
the Government, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Affifuddin Omar
said yesterday.
	   ``It will save a large amount in terms of money and e-commerce
will also enable the department to be more efficient. However, this
procedure is still at an early stage ... and therefore, it is
rather difficult to say how much can be saved by paperless
international trade,'' Affifuddin said.
	   He was speaking to reporters after opening the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (Apec) Customs-Industry Dialogue in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday.
	   It is estimated that in Japan, paper and document processing
costs US$12 billion (US$1  &QC;  RM4.000) a year, while it costs Apec
countries some US$46 billion.
	   E-commerce through the Internet is poised to boom over the next
few years with the value of transactions reaching US$300 billion by
the year 2001 from virtually zero at the start of 1990 and less
than US$10 billion today.
	   He also said the Customs Department will need to be more
transparent.
	   ``Through electronics, the department can be more transparent.
Currently, the files are kept in file cabinets in offices. When
people want to collect data, they have to follow specific rules and
regulations.
	   ``With the use of electronics, it is all there ... just a mouse
and a click away. It is not that it is not transparent now ... it
is just the nature of the administration and management of Customs
that makes it seem to be non-transparent,'' he added.

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ An explosion caused by a severed gas line
shattered a shelter for homeless people in Montreal on Tuesday,
killing two people and injuring about 20, authorities said. One
staff member was missing.
	   The explosion sheared off one entire wall of the three-story
stone building, spilling rubble into the street in historic Old
Montreal. Firefighters accompanied by sniffer dogs were searching
through the debris, unsure if the missing employee was trapped
underneath.
	   A fire department official, Alain Michaud, said the two
fatalities were women, but he had no details about them.

	   PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the
Government had made the right move by building the RM9 billion KL
International Airport at Sepang when the ringgit was still strong.
	   ``Some people didn't understand why we wanted to build the
airport and they claimed it was too costly to build a new one.
	   ``However, if we did not build it then, and had we been forced
to do this later or even now, we would not have been able to build
such an airport at RM9 billion,'' he told newsmen after a two-hour
visit of the airport yesterday.
	   Work on the airport, including earth works, started four years
ago.
	   With the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar, Dr
Mahathir said the cost of building an airport of such size would
escalate.
	   ``The KL International Airport was built at the right time when
the ringgit was strong. It cost about RM9 billion, which is
equivalent to about US$4 billion (currently US$1  &QC;  RM4.00), at that
time.
	   ``Now, the cost (to build such airport) will be more due to the
appreciation of the US dollar against the ringgit. The RM9 billion
will be equivalent to about US$2.4 billion now,'' he added.
	   The ringgit closed easier at 4.0000/100 against the greenback
yesterday compared with Friday's close of 3.9700/900.
	   At a cost of RM9 billion, Dr Mahathir said this was considered
cheaper than in other countries. ``Other countries have built
smaller airports but at a higher cost,'' he said.
	   Dr Mahathir also did not dismiss the possibility that the second
phase of the KL International Airport project would be delayed due
to present economic problems.
	   ``It may or may not (be delayed)... that is beyond our control.
If people are not flying (to the airport), it will be meaningless
to build a new terminal.
	   ``But, I think even if there is a delay or not, it will not be
for too long,'' he said.
	   Located about 50km from Kuala Lumpur, the KL International
Airport is scheduled to start operations on June 29, with the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Ja'afar scheduled to officially open the
airport on June 27.
	   The KL International Airport is a four-phase project designed to
cater to the passenger and air cargo demands of Malaysia in the
next century.
	   Initially, the airport is expected to handle some 25 million
passengers a year, and this may increase to 35 million by the year
2008, and 45 million by year 2012.

	   ROONDY Trading Co Sdn Bhd is seeking to expand its footwear
export business with the introduction of its own brands - ``Lewre
1908'' and ``Ezstep''.
	   In an interview, managing director Lew Fong Voon said the
company decided to market its own brands after having supplied to
major global brands over the past nine years.
	   Among these global brands are Red or Dead (UK), Buffalo of
London, Mosquitos (France), Kipling (Belgium), Aldo (North
America), Elle, Courreges, Renoma and Hush Puppies.
	   These exports now make up about 60 per cent of the company's
earnings last year, with the rest coming from supplies to local
in-house outfits like Ricci No and Tangs Studio.
	   ``We do not produce the footwear ourselves but work with a group
of people whom we have had partnerships with over the past
decade,'' said Lew at his office in Shah Alam, Selangor.
	   Roondy is mainly involved in the footwear design process and the
wholesale business.
	   ``Many of the international designers come over to work with our
in-house designers. In many instances, we design our own and
present it to our customers, who then adopt our designs.''
	   He added that each customer would usually launch two sets of new
designs every year - Spring and Fall collections - with each design
having up to 100 different variants.
	   For the company's in-house new brands, Lew said the decision to
produce them was prompted by the need to have a balanced earnings
portfolio, due to competition from cheaper suppliers within the
region.
	   ``Our footwear is not the cheapest when compared to those
produced in countries like Vietnam and China. So, we focused on
quality that our customers are willing to pay for.''
	   Eventually, the company expects half its earnings to come from
its own brands, with the rest coming from supplying to other
brandnames.
	   ``We are lucky to have built up strong relationships with our
clients over the years and they are very supportive of our
aspirations to have our own brands as it caters to a slightly
different market from theirs.''
	   The Lewre 1908 brand is pitched at the medium to upper range
customers, while the Ezstep represents the functional footwear,
catering mainly for office usage.
	   ``We already had two other brands which have done quite well
since we launched them a few years ago. Castel Franco is for the
elegant footwear, while Time Capsule is a range of casual footwear
mainly for the younger customer.''
	   Both these brands were previously available only in overseas
outlets, but Lew said all the company's four in-house brands are
now offered at local outlets.

schedule.
	   Speaking to reporters after a two-hour tour of the new airport
yesterday, he said he had several private visits a few weeks
earlier, and he was worried that the airport might not be able to
be completed on time.
	   After the tour, Dr Mahathir described the progress of the
airport as ``good, the quality high, and the total airport
management systems did not pose problems.''
	   The Prime Minister toured the main terminal building, the
satellite building and the ``Bunga Raya'' complex, a special
arrival and departure complex for the VVIPs.
	   He was given a briefing on the operations of the airport by KLIA
Bhd, the company overseeing the construction of the airport.
	   He congratulated KLIA Bhd for completing the construction of the
airport within a short period. The company took four years for the
airport to be completed - one year for earthworks and three years
for building construction.
	   The earth works of the airport project, which was undertaken on
a build- operate-transfer concept, commenced in 1995. The Prime
Minister himself officiated at the ground breaking ceremony of the
first package of the construction of the main terminal building on
March 27 that same year.
	   He described this as a record of sort, explaining that it would
require quite considerable management skills to manage such a large
and complex development that required 25,000 workers and more than
300 contracts.
	   Following the completion of the new airport, Dr Mahathir said
the country has succeeded in developing expertise for future
construction of major projects.
	   Dr Mahathir also said there was no compromise on the quality of
the construction in spite of the short time it took to complete the
airport.
	   ``You can see for yourself, the quality is very good,
construction work is very good, the finish is very good and the
designs are very innovative,'' he said, adding that the furniture,
which were locally made, are also of good quality. In fact, he
said, ``practically everything is local.''
	   On complaints that signages at the airport are too small, Dr
Mahathir said adjustments have been made earlier to the signages
but stressed that the relevant authorities will make corrections if
there is a need for them to do so.
	   ``I had received comments on that matter and adjustments were
made earlier but there is still dissatisfaction. If that (signages)
is not good enough, we will make corrections ... we are open to
criticisms,'' he said.
	   On the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang, Dr Mahathir
said it will not be left idle as the Royal Malaysian Air Force base
is situated there.
	   ``Other than that, the airport will also be used for servicing
and repairs ... we may also use the airport for general aviation
and others relating to aviation such as handling the Tabung Haji
flights,'' he added.
	   Asked if he was satisfied with the fares for public transport to
the new airport, Dr Mahathir said: ``For the time being, there is
going to be a lot of complaints, but one has to remember that when
one upgrades a certain thing, we have to pay a higher price.
	   ``There is no way we can afford to have better facilities but
(at the) same price. In Malaysia, we always want better things but
we want to pay less,'' he said, adding that this is ``a bit
difficult''.
	   On suggestions that it would cost a taxi passengers more to go
from Kuala Lumpur to the airport than taking the taxi from Kuala
Lumpur to Ipoh, Dr Mahathir said they can then travel by road.
``There is no point really, travelling south 60 miles in order to
go north ... that is why we built good roads,'' he said.

	   FLOPPIES of 1.44 megabytes (MB) don't get much respect nowadays.
It worked fine in the Eighties, when files and computer programs
were small in size.
	   You could cram your annual expenses, company reports, a yearly
budget and everything else under the sun yet still have enough room
to spare for a computer game that you can play on the go.
	   But when the Nineties came, it brought along the Internet, and
with the Internet comes shareware, freeware and the likes. It also
brought about a boom in the computer industry.
	   Computers got faster, programs got larger in size and personal
computers experienced SOS - suddenly obsolete syndrome - where a
new PC today will be a prehistoric monster tomorrow. However, the
1.44MB, 3.5-inch floppy disk and drive somehow eluded evolution.
Hence it became the target of verbal abuse and jibes when someone
wanted to hand out a 5MB sound file to a friend or a 16MB file of
the latest freeware to a fellow techie.
	   Seeing this problem, the computer industry responded with
numerous solutions. One of the viable solutions is the emergence of
``super floppies'' - diskettes with capacities exceeding 1.44MB. Up
until now Iomega Corp was the obvious popular player in this league
with its Iomega Zip drive.
	   However, Mitsubishi Electric is set to change that. Its product,
the LS- 120 SuperDisk Drive has garnered support from notebook and
desktop PC manufacturers. Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Gateway 2000,
Acer, IBM, NEC and Hitachi have announced that they would offer an
option of a 120MB Mitsubishi SuperDisk Drive with their computers.
More computer manufacturers are expected to follow.
	   The Mitsubishi LS-120 SuperDisk Drive is based on the LS-120
standard, developed by Imation Corp, Compaq Computer Corp,
Matsushita-Kotobuki Industries Ltd and OR Technology. It offers 83
times more storage space than the 1.44MB floppy and 20MB more than
its closest competitor, the Iomega Zip. The drive reads and writes
your ordinary, seen-and-used everywhere 3.5-inch disks as well as
the 120MB floppy disk, which looks and feels like an ordinary
floppy.
	   These characteristics make the LS-120 SuperDisk Drive a perfect
candidate to replace the already anaemic 1.44MB floppy disk and
drive. In case you are wondering how 120MB of data can be crammed
into a disk that has the same dimensions as an ordinary 1.44MB
floppy, the secret actually lies in the way the disk is
manufactured.
	   Basically, a unique manufacturing process is used to increase
the data track density on a 3.5-inch diskette from 135 tracks per
inch to 2,490 tracks per inch. This means that any unused gaps in
the floppy is fully utilised, and that data is stored much closer
together. This type of space conserving technique allows more data
to be stored in the same amount of space.
	   Since the track arrangements are different compared to a
conventional floppy, data is read using a special read/write head
that is accurately positioned using a laser servo motor. This head
also has the ability to read ordinary 3.5-inch diskettes as well,
hence boosting the reputation of this drive as a truly ``backward
compatible'' drive.
	   Installing the Mitsubishi LS-120 SuperDisk Drive was easy. All
we had to do is to place the drive in an empty bay in the PC,
connect the integrated drive electronics (IDE) cable from the back
of the drive to the motherboard and plug in the power cable to the
back of the drive. After that, we started our PC and Windows 95
detected the drive as a ``3.25-inch floppy'' and assigned it as an
E:\ drive.
	   According to the local distributor Metro Information Products
Sdn Bhd, the drive is supported by several motherboard
manufacturers such as Asus, Mitac and Trend. These motherboards
normally run on an Award Software Inc basic input output system
(BIOS).
	   Our review set was devoid of a proper installation manual, since
it is targeted at the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market
or people who are comfortable with their way in and out of
computers. Therefore, installation of this product should be left
to people who know exactly what they are doing. The drive performed
file transferring from and to the PCs hard disk with amazing speed.
It took less than a minute to transfer a 10MB file from the hard
disk to the drive, and another minute or so to transfer the same
file back to the hard disk.
	   With such impressive speed, the SuperDisk Drive is perfect for
transferring, archiving or backing up files as long as the files do
not exceed the 120MB disk quota. However, this drive may not be the
perfect solution if you are talking about high-capacity back-ups.
	   You might be better off with devices such as Iomega's Jaz or
SyQuest's SyJet 1.5-gigabyte (GB) which offers higher storage
capacity with a faster transfer rate and shorter seek time. When we
reviewed Imation's External LS-120 SuperDisk Drive some time ago,
we found it has compatibility problems when an ordinary 1.44MB
diskette is formatted in it and then used in an ordinary floppy
drive. Apparently, data stored in that particular diskette cannot
be read by the ordinary floppy drive. We were wondering if
Mitsubishi's LS-120 SuperDisk Drive had the same problem.
	   To find out, we fully formatted a 1.44MB floppy disk using the
SuperDisk Drive and another disk using an ordinary floppy drive. We
then transferred three joint picture experts group (JPEG) image
files with a total file size of 100-kilobytes and a Microsoft Word
97 document 45 kilobytes (KB) in size into both the 1.44MB disk in
the SuperDisk Drive and the floppy drive. The 1.44MB disk that was
in the SuperDisk Drive was then placed in the floppy drive and vice
versa. It seems that Mitsubishi's SuperDisk Drive did not suffer
the compatibility problem Imation's drive had.
	   The SuperDisk Drive had no trouble at all displaying the images
and opening the Word document. In fact, it did the job smoothly and
without much fuss. The SuperDisk Drive is a bit noisy when compared
to the floppy drive though. The motors emitted some grinding and
clicking noises whenever the drive is accessed.
	   Mitsubishi's SuperDisk Drive looks like the perfect replacement
for your 1.44MB floppy disk drive. It offers a large storage
capacity and is able to read your old 1.44MB floppies as well. It
can also serve as a back-up tool for your data as long as it does
not exceed the 120MB storage limit the disk has.
	   This drive offers an all-in-one solution at a very low price.

US hopeful as new Nigerian leader takes over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government praised Nigeria's new head
of state Tuesday, calling him a well respected professional soldier
who is capable of guiding his country toward democratic rule.
	   Spokesman James P. Rubin said Abdulsalam Abubakar, an army
general named to replace the late Sani Abacha, ``has a historic
opportunity to open the political process and institute a swift and
credible transition to civilian democratic rule.''
	   That process, Rubin said, should include freeing political
prisoners, ensuring respect for freedom of press, speech and
assembly and the return of the Nigerian military to the tasks of
defending the constitution and civilian rule.
	   ``We want this transition to make it possible for there to be a
return to civilian democratic rule by October 1, 1998,'' Rubin
said.
	   Rubin said a high-level U.S. mission may travel to Nigeria to
convey that message. Such a mission was supposed to go to Lagos
last week but Nigeria imposed conditions that the State Department
could not accept.
	   Abacha died on Monday after almost five years of repressive
rule. At the time of his death, he was maneuvering to perpetuate
his rule by being the sole candidate in elections set for August.
	   Abubakar, who received military training in the United States,
had served as Army chief of staff before assuming his new duties.

	   PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad yesterday
reiterated Malaysia's stand to get the country's trade and economy
away from the fluctuation in the value of the ringgit.
	   Speaking to reporters after visiting the new Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang, Dr Mahathir said this can be
easily done by conducting trade on a ``barter-type'' system where
the value of goods will not be influenced by fluctuation in the
local currency's exchange rate.
	   ``What we want to do is to get away from the (fluctuation) in
the value of the ringgit and this can be done easily by conducting
trade on a counter-trade basis or through practical bartering,'' he
said.

Four year's best records set at Slovnaft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Athletes in four events set records
for the year at the Slovnaft Grand Prix track meet on Tuesday.
	   In the Grand Prix women's discus Russia's Natalya Sadova
improved this year's best world result by 0.27 meters, reaching
67.85 meters. The throw secured the gold for Sadova, beating out
Anastasia Kelesidou from Greece by 2.02 meters. World champion
Beatrice Faumine from New Zeland came up short with 65.43.
	   ``It's my personal record, but it came too early ... I'll have
to keep this form,'' said Sadova after the meet. ``Sixty-seven
meters would get me gold at the European Championship in
Budapest.''
	   Other records were achieved in disciplines not included in the
Grand Prix competition.
	   In men's 3,000 steeplechase, Kenya's Joseph Keter became the
fastest athlete this year with 8 minutes, 8.91 seconds.
	   Running 1,500 meters in 4:00.81, Kenya's Jackline Maranga became
this year's fastest woman in the world.
	   Czech Daniela Bartova marked the European record as she defeated
4.51 meters in pole vault.
	   Running the 110-meter hurdles in 13.13 seconds, Mark Crear from
the United States missed this year's best record by just .01
second.

	   THE Umno supreme council last night extended the leave of party
vice- president Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib.
	   Umno president and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad
said Muhammad's leave of absence has been extended until the court
makes a decision on the case.
	   ``The supreme council holds the opinion that Muhammad cannot
assume his duty as a Umno vice president. Furthermore, there is
news that he will be taken to court again.
	   ``As such, he is not yet allowed to assume his duties as the
vice president. His leave of absence will be extended until the
court makes a decision on his case,'' he told reporters after
chairing a three-hour Umno supreme council meeting in Kuala Lumpur
last night.
	   Dr Mahathir said Muhammad had met him yesterday morning to
submit a declaration on his assets.
	   ``I am now checking to find out when he last made such a
declaration ...
	   I was busy today so I did not check it properly,'' he added. The
Prime Minister visited the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
Sepang yesterday morning.
	   Asked whether Muhammad's series of court cases, of which one was
in Australia, had caused any damage to the party, Dr Mahathir said:
``I do not know whether there is any damage or not. It just goes to
show that we have always adopted a stand that if any party member
does anything that warrants a case being taken against him, we will
not stand in the way.
	   Dr Mahathir said this has been the history of Umno, which had
seen several Menteris Besar facing court action, adding that: ``We
do not protect the guilty parties but if the person is innocent, we
will defend him.''
	   On the status of Negri Sembilan State Executive Councillor Datuk
Waad Mansor who was charged last May with five counts of
corruption, Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the
supreme council had received his resignation last month.
	   ``He is now on leave of absence until after the court decision
is made on the charges,'' he added.
	   To a question on the main theme of the upcoming Umno assembly,
Dr Mahathir said the economic problems would most likely be the
main theme.
	   ``This is not surprising. I myself would be doing injustice if I
do not talk about the economic problems during the meeting,'' he
added.
	   Asked whether corruption and nepotism would also be raised at
the meeting, Dr Mahathir said it is up to party members to do so if
they felt that the matters needed attention.
	   On the opposition's call for a roundtable meeting with other
political parties to discuss the economic situation, Dr Mahathir
said: ``We do not want to politicise this issue. The opposition had
said that they will win more seats because of the economic
downturn. To them, it is a political issue which will benefit them.
	   ``So it is up to the people to accept whether it is proper to
make use of the country's misfortune to improve their (the
opposition) fortune,'' he said.
	   Dr Mahathir also said the supreme council will discuss in detail
the Indonesian economic situation, and the lessons that could be
learnt from the republic's experience.
	   It also discussed the criticisms made towards the New Economic
Policy.

	   TOSHIBA Sales and Services Sdn Bhd recently announced the local
availability of its latest video compact disk (VCD) player, the
TVD-860K.
	   Its assistant general manager of marketing department Chay Kim
Hur said the TVD-860K is a powerful VCD player as it incorporates a
specially designed integrated circuit (IC) which can minimise
distortion to produce clearer images and purer sounds. It features
a sleek, silver body with dual-colour switches that allow users to
know the state of the disk.
	   The VCD player, which is priced at RM999, also features a
karaoke program which allows users to select and program songs from
three disks at the same time. Other options are digital echo
effect, duet capability and 15-step key control, a feature that
allows users to sing in their own key.
	   At the product launch, Toshiba Sales and Services' managing
director K.
	   Takagi said the company has acquired 10 per cent market share of
the local VCD player market which is worth RM100 million, and
intends to increase this to 15 per cent by year-end.

	   WITH its OmniBook 3000, Hewlett-Packard looks set to kill the
competition.
	   The OmniBook 3000 comes with a Pentium 200-megahertz or 233MHz
MMX processor, an easy-to-read (13.3-inch) diagonal 1,024 by 768
extended graphics array (XGA) thin film transistor (TFT) active
matrix display screen with up to 65,536 colours for what HP says
are true-to-life colour presentations and graphics.
	   With two megabytes of (MB) video dynamic random access memory
(VDRAM) and a 128-bit NeoMagic video graphics controller, the
system allows for a ``Zoomed Video'' port within its personal
computer (PC) card slot.
	   This means that a 32-bit PC card is able to directly access the
graphics and audio systems - it writes directly to graphics memory.
This gives smooth-motion real-time video for more interesting
presentations and engaging entertainment.
	   Perhaps, most important of all in these days of increasing
``miniaturisation'' (almost to the point of absurdity with the new
palmtops) - the OmniBook still has an industry standard, 87-key
keyboard with full- size key spacing. There is also an embedded
numeric keypad and 12 function keys.
	   The OmniBook has a number of useful features. Apart from its
large 2.1- gigabyte or 4GB removable enhanced-IDE hard disk (with
hardware-based password), and standard 16MB of extended data out
(EDO) DRAM (expandable to 144MB), it also has a video out, a
universal serial bus (USB) connector, and a four megabits per
second (Mbps) wireless infra-red IrDA port.
	   The infra-red port allows for easy transfer of data to desktop
machines equipped with a NetbeamIR Ethernet Access Point.
	   The suspend-resume facility allows you to get to work whenever
and wherever inspiration strikes without re-booting - and will
allow you to continue for a lot longer than it is likely to last as
it has a (lithium- ion) battery life of up to 2.5 hours.
	   The battery can be recharged in less than 2.5 hours, even with
the computer on and with battery operation, there is a two-minute
low-battery warning before a controlled shutdown. There is also a
dual battery option so that for instance, when you want to work on
a long-haul flight, you can, HP claims, keep going for up to five
hours at a stretch.
	   For those occasions when you are feeling particularly sociable
and would like to ``talk'' to your computer (rather than shout and
scream when you realise you just exited a program without saving
your file!) the OmniBook has a built-in microphone along with Sound
Blaster Pro-compatible sockets for external mike/stereo line in and
both headphones and stereo speakers.
	   This means that, for instance, with IBM's Via Voice speech
recognition program (which you can install with the optional
slim-line, low-power 14X CD-ROM drive) and 16MB of additional
memory, you can dictate memos and letters straight into your
computer or use voice commands instead.
	   On earlier OmniBook models, HP fitted its well-known built-in
``mouse''
	   device. Bearing a strange resemblance to a small paper stapler,
it popped out from the side on a plastic rod. Some users liked it,
others preferred the Trackpoint used on other OmniBooks.
	   On the OmniBook 3000, HP installed a TouchPad pointing device.
	   Inevitably, each system just takes getting used to.
	   With earlier models, there wasn't even an external mouse port,
so unless you wanted to use up the only serial port, you more or
less had to learn to adapt. On the OmniBook 3000, HP have sensibly
made a very welcome addition - a combined keyboard/mouse port
(PS/2). Thus, for those who have found the OmniBook's integrated
keyboards a trifle ``stiff'' (such as this writer), there is at
last an answer.
	   Computer users inevitably find that they can never really get
all they want in one notebook - for instance, earlier OmniBooks did
not have a built-in CD-ROM drive, keyboard/mouse port or S-video
port. And the keyboards certainly could have done with a lighter
touch. But most of those issues have been addressed in the OmniBook
3000.
	   And when there's a choice of central processing unit (CPU)
speeds as high as 200MHz and 233MHz, ``road warriors'' will find
that they can not only easily run their ``killer aps'' - the
enhanced speed of the fastest 233MHz chip kills the pain of waiting
for them to load.
	   True, the industry's newest machines with Intel's 266MHz MMX P2
chips do offer about 10 per cent increase in performance. But it's
a trade-off since such raw power inevitably means shorter time
before batteries die.
	   It's a killer, isn't it?

AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN
MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC.
	   IN 1952, a meteorite crashes into the Bering Straits. American
and Soviet scientists scrambled to investigate the incident. A
strange new type of metal is discovered. Intelligence reports the
metal is of extra- terrestrial origin. Both American and Soviet
forces are trying to gather as much of it as possible. Conflict
escalates into one of the biggest cover-ups in the 20th century,
covert hi-tech space combat. Does any of those ring a bell?
	   Well if it does, chances are you have played or at least have
seen an advertisement or two about BatttleZone. That's right, the
old arcade classic that was the first of its kind, featuring
three-dimensional wire frame-based graphics is back. Well, sort of,
anyway.
	   BattleZone again?
	   Activision has totally revamped BattleZone and has just recently
re- released it. Wait, before you say ``Oh no not another lousy
revamp with spruced up graphics?'', just let me say a few things.
	   This current release of BattleZone looks and plays very
different; I'm quite surprised that Activision would just call it a
re-release. In my honest opinion, it is a totally new game that
just has an old label plastered on its box. The main difference
that clearly separates it from the original classic would be its
gameplay.
	   Besides the ``point and shoot until it blows'' part of the
original is being present, Activision has also added strategic
elements into the game that would have been thought of as a
first-person-perspective shoot-'em-up game.
	   Resource management has also become an important issue. This is
simply because just like in any other strategy games, you will be
given a base and is responsible for gathering resources needed to
manufacture key structures and units.
	   In the game, you are the field commander (be it American or
Soviet). At your disposal are various types of vehicles; each with
its own functions and specialities. For instance, on the American
side, the basic assault vehicles are the Razor (a fast scouting
unit), Grizzly (a heavy assault tank), Bobcat (a light assault
tank) and the list goes on. Do not be mislead by the term tank
here; these vehicles definitely do not operate in the same way as a
normal tank would. Instead of travelling on threads, these vehicles
travel by means of some sort of anti-gravity propulsion.
	   Piloting these vehicles is quite similar to playing a helicopter
simulation. Forward to advance, backward to reverse, left and right
to rotate. There are even additional booster rockets to accelerate
or to jump over high terrains. The combat controls seem to have
been taken from Quake in the sense that both keyboard and mouse are
utilised. This might be a little awkward to those who are new to
it, but I believe Quake players should have little trouble in using
it.
	   Selecting units for command could not have been any simpler as
BattleZone employs a high-intuitive interface. Important keys used
to access unit functions are highlighted, unit functions are
brought up as soon as they are in your targeting reticle. Even with
all that on a screen, it still remains quite uncluttered. If you
think all this is complicated, do not worry as BattleZone comes
equipped with some basic tutorial missions that will get you up and
rejoicing over the scraps of some enemy battle-tanks.
	   The strategic side of the game centres upon gathering bio-metal
to produce defence structures, utility structures and manufacturing
structures. In order to gather bio-metal, you will need to
manufacture scavenger units. Scavenger units would look for
bio-metal deposits or scrap from destroyed units and send it back
to a recycler (a type of light factory). The recycler is used for
manufacturing defence turrets and light units. It is also used to
manufacture ammo and repair kits which can be picked up by touch. I
guess this is the only other similarity it has with the original
classic.
	   Other than that, the various units in the game and their
different capabilities also contributed to BattleZone's
semi-strategic nature.
	   Activision has also redefined the degree of virtual movement in
this release. Players are not given a chance to pilot vehicles but
roam around on foot as well. Sure, Activision is not the first to
do it, but no other game has ever done it this well (one reason why
you probably never have heard of it in other games). Just picture
this and you will know how cool this feature is.
	   Your vehicle gets blasted to smithereens but you managed to
eject. It is quite fortunate that the enemy does not notice you
slowly floating to the ground. Now what do you do? Either you could
walk back to base and get into another vehicle, or you stay around
to wreak more havoc. Using a sniper rifle (yeah, a rifle that comes
complete with a liquid crystal display sniping scope) you take out
the pilot of the nearest enemy vehicle and climb into it (a really
unpleasant tactic in multi-player games). Then you... (oh you get
the idea).
	   The only thing anyone may complain about this feature is that
while roaming on foot you only have two types of weaponry. However,
I would say it is definitely more realistic this way; I seriously
doubt that carrying more than four different types of heavy
weaponry alone in a near zero gravity would be practical.
	   It is getting hot out here In line with most of its recent
releases, Activision has done a lot in ensuring that BattleZone has
an intense gaming atmosphere. Radio chatter is aplenty and it is
not just to make the game look good but also serves to give you
insights into your mission objectives as well. That, plus the
voice-overs of the unnamed hero (that would be you) in the
single-player missions adds to its well-thought out game design.
The music itself is a little spooky and gloomy; hmmm, which covert
operation on the dark cold extra-terrestrial surfaces would be the
same without it, eh?
	   As with any other game, one of the key components in enhancing
the gaming experience would be the graphics. Graphics-wise,
BattleZone is really something to behold. It definitely has the
best looking Direct3D graphics I've seen in any 3-D accelerated
game in a long time. It's so detailed, the graphics are not any
different from the graphics found in BattleZone's rather impressive
introduction.
	   The terrain is something to behold as it appears before your
very eyes.
	   As you travel around, your craft will bob up and down following
every single detail of the terrain. It gets so real that at times
you may get a little nauseated. Unlike other Activision releases,
the highly customisable Instant Action/Skirmish feature is sorely
missed here.
	   There may be an empty playground for you to fool around with,
but there is hardly anything challenging to do on it. Another thing
I would like to bring up would be the lack of multi-player spawned
games. This means each of the participants of a multi-player game
must have a BattleZone compact disk.
	   Conclusion What are you waiting for now? Yes, I am now out of
breathe, honest. So unless you think your machine will not be able
to do justice to the BattleZone experience, go out and get this
``revolutionary action-strategy''
	   (as mentioned on the box) game from Activision.

	   THE movie Natural Enemy with a ``U'' rating, as indicated in the
TV programme section of NST on May 23, was shown the same evening.
	   After viewing it, I felt that there was an error in its
classification.
	   For by virtue of the film's story and violent contents - there
are four murders plus an attempt on the life of the villain's
natural mother - it should be classified under 18SG (for 18+ with
non-excessive violent/horrifying scenes).
	   Indeed, the film may not even pass for a 18SG rating, but at
least this would be more appropriate, as viewers would be
forewarned about its contents.
	   Worse still, the error was compounded by airing it as a Mother's
Day Special. Generally, a Mother's Day Special movie would have a
theme with an ending that warms the hearts of the viewers.
	   I wonder if that night, after viewing the film, parents and
children could go to bed with peace and happiness in their hearts.
	   The film had a chilling and disturbing effect on me. Surely, TV2
is not so short of good, wholesome films that it had to air Natural
Enemy as a Mother's Day Special.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Four jolly giants _ an African, American Indian, an
Asian and a European _ strode through Paris like good-guy Godzillas
on Tuesday, symbolizing the spirit of a World Cup that France hopes
will loom large in history.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the 18-meter (60-foot) robots took separate routes toward
the Place de la Concorde, the heart of a citywide tournament
kickoff party.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show. ``The grand theme is universality in a
single world.''
	   After a slow evening procession through the city, the four
giants met at the plaza jammed with tourists, soccer fans and
Parisians. The famed Obelisk from ancient Egypt had been
transformed into a giant World Cup with flashing video screens on
top.
	   Milling at the feet of the giants were a menagerie of wigged
ladies, insects, and what looked like Ninja aardvarks.
	   Scottish fans in kilts, already staggering drunk, hardly seemed
to notice the scene.
	   Parisians awoke Tuesday to find the dozing giants at familiar
monuments, along with throngs of strangely dressed tourists from
the 31 nations joining France in the planet's biggest sports
tournament.
	   Moussa, the African, was the first to stir in the evening, near
the Eiffel Tower, standing up and opening huge eyes to wild
applause.
	   He symbolized the man in a new world, and he rose up to see
dancing odd-shaped baobab trees and termite hills. Six ostriches _
actually men on stilts _ bobbed among women dressed as stylized
giraffes.
	   ``Amazing,'' said Florence Farriaux, as she hurried her three
kids home so their father could take them to Concorde, where Moussa
would meet the three others. ``I loved it.''
	   On the Pont Neuf over the Seine, Ho, the Asian, stood up in a
fantasy world of balloons shaped like flying fish and dancers
dressed as tropical sea creatures.
	   Pablo, the Indian, rose from a crouch under the Arc de Triomphe
and strolled down the Champs-Elysees to see the animated trees,
snakes and bugs that depict nature.
	   Romeo, the European, had been snoozing outside the Opera
Garnier. His theme was love, and along his route he bowed to a
sculptor's conception of the Urban Woman, a mere 4.5 meters (15
feet) tall.
	   David Quill, a Scottish engineer who came for no-nonsense
football, found himself carried away by the spectacle. ``This
brings together the four worlds,'' he said. ``I really liked it.''
	   Heavy overnight rains did not dampen the mood, but they washed
off Ho's loincloth, made of rubberized-plastic, exposing the
midriff of his articulated steel skeleton. Workmen pinned it back
on.
	   The 38-ton giants were powered by small trucks hidden in their
feet. They moved one after the other, as if the giants were
walking. Huge heads moved, eyes rolled, and fingers wiggled.
	   During the day, Parisians paid less attention to the four
colossi than the real characters in their midst. Clusters of soccer
fans roamed the streets in outlandish outfits and gaudy colors.
	   For once, passersby paid more attention to skirts on men rather
than women. Perhaps 20,000 Scots came across the Channel for the
opening game with Brazil on Wednesday. Most wore kilts.
	   Scott Wallace, a fishmonger, and his housepainter friend, Gerry
Shiels, sat behind tankards of lager at the Cafe Montecristo, each
with bare knees and Highland feathers towering above their hats.
	   ``I think we'll beat 'em, 2-1,'' Wallace said, a little
hopefully. ``Aye,'' Shiels agreed. ``And if we do, it'll be some
party.''
	   From the looks of things Tuesday, there'll be some party,
anyway.
	   Still, an Air France strike and soccer ticket foulups have left
many fans furious.
	   Crowds pushed their way into the France 98 shop to buy World Cup
paraphernalia: polyster T-shirts, caps, crowd-parting cologne,
fuzzy stuffed versions of the goofy-looking rooster mascot named
Footix.
	   Visitors seemed to show more interest than the French. Jacques
Lambert, head of the organizing committee, complained of an evident
lack of fervor among the general public.
	   A block off the Champs-Elysees, Jean-Pierre Arnal sat alone in
his little hardware store, wearing his usual white smock with his
dog at his feet.
	   ``Oouuff,'' he replied when asked about the World Cup, employing
a beloved French nonword that means the same thing as shrugged
shoulders.
	   ``I suppose it's a good thing, economically.''
	   Around the corner, Emmannuel Delhomme painted a banner on the
awning of his bookshop, the Livre Sterling: ``Good news, ladies.
This store will be open during all of the games of the World Cup.''
	   Delhomme, no soccer fan, said he was a little wary of the
snarled traffic, the armed police and boisterous visitors.
	   ``But, after all,'' he concluded, ``it's a good thing. Parisians
are so sad, so stressed, and this is a change. All these people in
colors and a happy mood. It is something new to talk about.''

	   THERE are a lot of hoaxes around on the Internet. How do you
avoid them?
	   Learn to read with scepticism! Look for these following
tell-tale signs.
	   Please pass along this message to 10/12/65 million people: Any
message which asks you to pass it along to more people is suspect.
The most famous of these is the Little Craig letter. This hoax asks
you to send an electronic mail (e-mail) to a dying child who
purportedly wants to be in the Guinness Book of Records or who is
exceptionally lonely. Don't fall for it! Little Craig was ill - in
1989. However, he is now 18 years old and a recipient of 16 million
cards and was included in the book of world records. Also, Craig
has been cured of cancer but still receiving five bags of mail a
day, which goes directly to the recycling depot.
	   A similar hoax is now being distributed but it tells people to
send business cards instead. A different version of this is the
``Cookie story''
	   where a few people claimed to have been charged a fortune for a
cookie recipe and is now making it publicly available out of
revenge. This here's-how-I-was-ripped-off-and-now-want-revenge
story starts off with ``....a true story of justice in the good old

	   There's a virus in your e-mail: Any e-mail message warning you
not to read e-mail is a hoax. It is not possible to catch a virus
from just reading an e-mail message. However, it is possible to
catch a virus from a document or program attached to an e-mail
message. Macro viruses, the most prevalent type of virus at the
moment, are often passed along over networks via e-mail
attachments. It is also possible to catch a virus if you set your
software package to read attach documents or run attached programs
without checking them first. So to be safe, read all your e-mail
and before opening attachments check them for viruses. If you buy a
new program, check for viruses. And always, always make sure you
back-up all your files. Names of these hoaxes are varied but they
include: Goodtime, PenPal, Deeyenda, PKZ300, Irina, and Ghost.
	   Please change your computer's configuration/send me your e-mail
account password: Some people think it's funny to have people
destroying their own computers. If you receive any message telling
you to change your account or send a file or message over the
network, call or e-mail your Internet provider or check with a

Ignore any message that act as a chain letter. Whether it is Bill
Gates testing a product and offering you thousands of dollars for
sending on his message or a little boy who tells you that for every
message forwarded some charity will receive money.
	   Chain letters are always hoaxes. There is no way of tracking the

	   These people who designed these urban legends are always careful
to present a nice little moral tale with a horrific end for the
hapless victim. Don't humour these rumour mongers by sending these
messages around. If you receive any stories involving organ theft,
people being sucked up in planes and thrown out over forest fires,
etc, go and check http://www.urbanlegends. com/. Remember, if this
were to happen even once, it would be No. 1 television and radio
news item within hours.
	   Make money fast: Never send money in response to e-mail. E-mail
from so-called charities are faked. No charity asks for funds using
e-mail, so don't be fooled. Pyramid schemes don't work. The people
who send them out know this and are committing a crime which can
land them in jail in most countries. If you receive a pyramid offer
or asked to send money, forward the e-mail with the complete header
to your Internet service provider or contact MYCERT. Look at it
this way; if there are ways to make money quickly why would anyone
offer it to you over the e-mail for nothing? So, stay safe and
remember: Just because it is written doesn't mean it's true.
	   The more urgent a message, the more suspect it is. Don't be
rushed into a response! Never, ever send anyone money! Never, ever
send any personal information such as your telephone number,
address or password.

	   I WISH to express my frustration over the unscheduled and
frequent power cuts experienced in SS21/16 in Petaling Jaya.
	   We have been experiencing power cuts almost every other day over
the last few weeks.
	   On one day, it lasted from 1pm to 3am (14 hours).
	   On another occasion, it was from 10pm to 7am (nine hours).
	   As you can imagine, in this hot weather, the power cuts are
causing a lot of inconvenience, especially for families with young
children.
	   Schoolchildren are also unable to complete their homework.
	   This problem seems to be common in Petaling Jaya, especially in
Damansara Utama.
	   It is disappointing to note that Tenaga Nasional has not come up
with any information on the situation.
	   Although Tenaga staff can be seen repairing the lines, the
frequency of occurrence and the length of time taken to resolve the
problem are not acceptable.
	   One Tenaga worker said they were still assessing the problem and
they believed it was caused by overloading.
	   They suspect that the number of air-conditioners in the area has
increased, therefore increasing the load.
	   What is Tenaga's solution to the problem?
	   Are they going to react to individual problems or are they
looking at the big picture and solving the problem at source?
	   What action are they taking?

Nasty FIFA presidential campaign hasn't ended yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA's presidential election is over, but things
are still nasty between winner Sepp Blatter and challenger Lennart
Johansson.
	   Blatter issued a press release Tuesday night through FIFA
``categorically'' denying rumors ``of a manipulation of the vote''
that gained him the post.
	   ``Mr. Blatter vehemently refuted the allegations and said he
would investigate the source of such malicious reports,'' the
release said. ``He stressed that he reserved the right to take
legal action against those seeking to defame him.''
	   Rumors apparently were fed by a story in the International
Herald Tribune on Tuesday which quoted Johansson, the president of
UEFA, possibly indicating that Monday's vote wasn't fair.
	   ``Something happened somewhere,'' Johansson was quoted as
saying. ``I had so many promises of votes that I am, to put it
mildly, surprised and disappointed to be beaten so
comprehensively.''
	   Blatter didn't get the necessary two-thirds majority on the
first ballot, but led 111-80, more than enough to win a simple
majority on the second vote. Johansson conceded before a second
vote could be held.
	   A FIFA source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said one
rumors that reached Blatter Tuesday involved the buying of votes.
	   Many had hoped the election would restore peace to soccer's
governing body after a bitter 2 1-2 month campaign rife with
personal attacks and name-calling.
	   Both candidates exchanged friendly statements following the
election, but Johansson clearly was upset.
	   ``The result is there, consequently he is the winner and we will
have to cooperate for the good of the game,'' Johansson said. ``But
we're not dropping our program. I'm loyal to the president but I'm
not going to obey everything he says.''

	   MERSING, Mon. - Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim
said the Government would continue to step up efforts to restore
confidence in the economy among local and foreign investors.
	   He said this would include providing more funds - not to protect
the interests of only selected companies or certain individuals -
but to be mobilised in a manner that benefited everyone, including
the low-income group.
	   He also said that while Malaysia was clamouring for reforms and
greater transparency of the international financial system, the
country should at the same time overcome its domestic weaknesses
and avoid the pitfalls experienced by others which had to resort to
the International Monetary Fund.
	   He said this when opening the third Johor Umno Convention at the
Sibu Island Resort on Sibu island, off Mersing.
	   Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, noted that not all of the
country's financial institutions were being responsible, saying
that some had given out loans at too fast a rate, including to
non-productive sectors like property.
	   There were also others which had ceased disbursing loans and did
not do enough for the Bumiputera lot.
	   ``It does not mean that we protect the attitude of financial
instutions... I protect transparency but there should be no
political inteference in the giving of loans,'' he added.
``Secondly, we must take steps to restore the confidence of local
and foreign investors (in our economy).''
	   He said if it was necessary to ensure the financial institutions
were strong, the Government would ensure just that although it
might mean causing difficulties to some parties.
	   He added that not only the big businesses were facing problems
but the rural people had also not been spared because of rising
prices, for example.
	   Anwar said while calling for transparency and reforms of the
international financial system, the country should also check its
domestic weaknesses, including corporate governance.
	   He said the country should not deny the fact that it was facing
economic problems. These problems, he said, were caused by external
factors as well as a number of weaknesses within.
	   He said if the country did not accept that domestic weaknesses
also needed to be corrected, ``we will invite an even bigger
catastrophe''.
	   Anwar also said he did not stop companies from restructuring but
if such an exercise was meant to safeguard the interests of a few,
then the companies would bring more problems to the economy.
	   ``Also, we should take steps to contain inflation and stabilise
the ringgit.''
	   Anwar said the economic system in the country should defend the
good policies, so as not to deviate from the principle of justice
to be fair to all, including the rural poor.
	   On Umno, he said the party must be prepared to demand that
weaknesses in the domestic financial and other systems be overcome.
	   In this context, he said transparency, fair distribution of
wealth and the spirit of musyawarah (consultation) were consistent
with the party's struggles.
	   Thus, he said, if within Umno, democracy and the spirit of
consensus were neglected, if transparency did not exist,
opportunities were monopolised (by certain individuals) and bribery
left rampant, then the party's very existence would be questioned.

AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN

	   AFTER reading through my last article I noticed that I did not
thoroughly explain the concept of the chat room as clearly as I
would have liked.
	   Allow me to draw an analogy between a hotel and a chat site.
Imagine a chat site as a hotel if you prefer. Inside the house
there are many rooms.
	   Now imagine that inside every room there are people chatting
about various subjects. As you walk through the hotel, you notice
that there are titles on the door of every room.
	   These titles indicate the char topics in the rooms. Thus, in a
room called ``Computer Talk'', for instance, one would naturally
find that the people in the room are talking about computers.
	   Likewise, in a room called, say, ``Casual Chat'', one would
expect the people in the room to be participating in a well, casual
chat, or to paraphrase the recently-ended (and sorely missed)
television series Seinfeld, a chat about nothing. So, it follows
that in a room called ``Teen Talk'', there would be teenagers
talking about mostly teenage issues.
	   If you enter a room titled ``Flirt'' for instance, you would
find a lot of people appearing to flirt with one another. The
ability to flirt with one (or more) participant in a chat room
appears to be one of the more controversial uses of the Internet
relay chat (IRC) service.
	   There have been many untoward incidents (some of which are
extremely interesting) that have been reported in the media... but
I digress.
	   We will return to the subject of flirting on the IRC in a later
article.
	   To continue, let us return to our earlier analogy (that of a
chat site being very much like a hotel).
	   In order to enter a room, you would first have to select the
room that you would like to chat in.
	   This can be done, of course, by walking down the corridor of the
hotel and looking at the room titles one by one until a particular
room title strikes your fancy.
	   Once it is done, you would then open the door and immediately be
surrounded by the chatters who arrived before you.
	   Now that you can not only hear the chatter, but also participate
in it by taking part in one of the discussions already started,
starting a new discussion, or by making a remark to someone (or
even no one in particular).
	   In our hotel analogy, you can see that it is easy to leave the
room (for instance, if you found nothing of interest or even
decided to visit another room) and travel down the corridor in
search of another one.
	   (Actually, due in part to the multi-tasking capabilities of most
modern operating systems, it is now possible to be in more than one
room at a time - just think of it as having cloned yourself.) All
this talk about rooms and corridors are all very well, but what
does this have to do with IRC? Well, now that the concept of sites
and rooms has been thoroughly explained, let's revisit the analogy.
	   In order to visit a hotel, you would first have to get to where
the hotel is.
	   Similarly, in order to use a chat site, you would first have to
log on to it. The process of logging on differs from one chat
client to another chat client.
	   Usually, however, to get logged on, one would need to have the
IRC server name the port to connect to (usually a number) a
username (sometimes called a ``nickname'' in IRC), and optionally,
a password. For instance, the server name for TalkCity is
chat.talkcity.com, port number 6667.
	   The username is, as stated in the earlier article, the name that
you like to be referred to in a room. This also serves to identify
you, but not all the time, as we shall see below.
	   Some servers enforce what is usually called ``username (or
nickname) registration''.
	   Username (or nickname) registration means that the server allows
a user to ``register'' a name. It then becomes exclusively his (or
hers) to use, and is protected by a password.
	   Another user trying to log on using the same name but without
supplying the password (or supplying an incorrect one) would
usually be informed that the username is already registered.
	   The user would then be instructed to choose another nickname
(one that is not registered).
	   This (username registration) is usually done to prevent
imposters from ``stealing'' an identity.
	   For example, assume user A has the username ``UserA''. After
some time spent in certain chat rooms, user A has become a
``regular'' and is thus known and recognised by many other
``regulars'' from the same chat room.
	   Now assume that user B logs on with the username UserA. With the
username registration in place, user B will simply be told that the
name UserA has already been registered and will be instructed to
select another username.
	   Without the registration procedure, user B will be able to pose
as UserA.
	   This would lead everyone in the chat room to believe that user B
is in fact user A. User B is now free to wreak havoc on user A's
reputation since everything he types will be attributed to user A.
	   User B, logged on as UserA, could start abusing all the regulars
(or even all the participants) and all this would be blamed on user
A. As a result, user A could find himself being ignored (or even
abused in return.) the next time he logs on.
	   This would probably cause no end of confusion as user A tries to
make sense of what he has been so unjustly accused of.
	   Shakespeare once made a mention of this: ``He who steals my
purse steals trash... but he who steals from me my good name steals
that which does not make him any richer, but makes me poor
indeed''.
	   Because of this, one would expect the use of nickname
registration to be more prevalent among chat-facilitating
companies, but sadly, the reverse appears to be true.
	   The main reason for nickname registrations lack of popularity is
widely said to be due to the difficulty of programming and
implementing such a facility. Let us all hope that in due time,
such an important and valuable facility becomes easier to write and
implement, and hopefully more popular.
	   The are other ways (albeit somewhat limited) to ``sniff out''
imposters.
	   We will discuss this, among other things, in the next article.
Until then, happy chatting.

	   FRIENDS: SERIES 1 EPISODES 1-24 (US, 1994/95) Directed by James
Burrows and others Starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa
Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer Running Time:
Approximately 90 minutes each Rating: 1/2 Distributor: Movie Magic
(03-9836688) IF The X-Files represents the acme of television
drama-suspense, Friends (and probably a few other series) is its
comedy counterpart.
	   The strong characterisation and continuity of this series about
six twentysomethings are big pluses. It sounds trite, but Friends
has a huge following because viewers care about the characters.
	   Of course, Rachel (Aniston), Monica (Cox), Phoebe (Kudrow), Joey
(LeBlanc), Chandler (Perry) and Ross (Schwimmer) form an attractive
group, even if they do little but sit around nursing oversized cups
of coffee and jawing away.
	   They are portrayed with broad quirks, yet they interact and
develop onscreen with naturalness and charm.
	   The scripts are consistently sharp and relevant. The stories are
a mixture of trivial misadventures in everyday life and compelling
season- long sagas.
	   Every episode - each cutely titled The One With/Where... - is a
fine example of ensemble acting. Chances are the show will
eventually fade, but right now, it's great, funny television.
	   The first season of 24 episodes has been packaged into these six
videos.
	   Watch how the show quickly gained momentum after wobbling
briefly at the start.
	   TOMORROW NEVER DIES (UK, 1997) Directed by Roger Spottiswoode
Starring Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Teri
Hatcher, Joe Don Baker, Judi Dench Running Time: 113 minutes
Rating: 1/2 Distributor: Movie Magic THE James Bond franchise is so
laden with formulae that it's increasingly difficult to appreciate
each successive instalment, even with the frequent retooling and
personnel changes. Very rarely is the template measurably
stretched.
	   Tomorrow Never Dies is more of the same. Sure, you can debate
endlessly about Brosnan's take of 007 as compared with the previous
Bonds, but it all boils down to how differently he orders his
Martini, beds his women and wipes the floor with the baddies.
	   In Tomorrow Never Dies, the villain is a media baron (Pryce) who
wants to - quick, take a wild guess - rule the world. His chosen
method is to manipulate and control global news. The evil deed of
the movie is his attempt to fool the Chinese and British into
sparking off a war.
	   Bond gets a tough Chinese agent (Yeoh) as an ally and has a
bedroom encounter with Hatcher, an ex-lover and Pryce's wife.
	   The stunts and gadgets are typically wonderful, but the
familiarity of Tomorrow Never Dies may gnaw at you.
	   OUT TO SEA (US, 1997) Directed by Martha Coolidge Starring Jack
Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Dyan Cannon, Gloria De Haven, Brent Spiner,
Elaine Stritch Running Time: 102 minutes Rating: Distributor:
Wawasan Videovan (03-7049125) THE Lemmon-Matthau pairing is
becoming a geriatric gimmick. In the past, their odd couple act
worked because the duo were excellent comedians who can carry far
the chalk-and-cheese routine. They're still great actors, but their
recent movies together have shown that their age - both are
septuagenarians - overshadows lots of things.
	   Admittedly, this is difficult to sidestep. Matthau, in
particular, seems to be physically labouring in Out To Sea, a
seaborne Grumpy Old Men.
	   He plays Charlie, a shiftless gambler who belatedly decides that
his ticket to a good life is to marry into money. Lemmon is
Matthau's brother- in-law who refuses to embrace life since being
widowed years ago.
	   Matthau dupes Lemmon into going with him on an all-expense paid
luxury cruise. In truth, the former has signed them up as dance
hosts. After Lemmon discovers the lie and the ensuing squabbling
subsides, romance comes on. Matthau pursues Cannon and her wealth,
while Lemmon and De Haven take turns blowing hot and cold.
	   Lemmon and Matthau deserve a better vehicle than Out To Sea, one
that's less predictable and more genuine in its story and laughs.
	   The fine acting overall is of some consolation. As usual, Lemmon
and Matthau are utterly at ease in their combination. Spiner (Data
of Star Trek: The Next Generation) slips comfortably into the skin
of the ambitious, control freak of a cruise director. Watch and
cringe as he croons - yes, croons - the Santana hit, Oye Como Va.
	   STARSHIP TROOPERS (US, 1997) Directed by Paul Verhoeven Starring
Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil
Patrick Harris, Patrick Muldoon, Michael Ironside Running Time: 110
minutes Rating: 1/2 Distributor: Berjaya HVN (03-9826688) WHEN it
comes to thrilling moviegoers, you've got to hand it to Dutch
director Paul Verhoeven. He wields his tools - violence, special
effects, sex, hardware, humour - with impressive dexterity and
efficiency. The trouble is, the substance of his more recent
efforts lag hopelessly behind.
	   Based on Robert A. Heinlein's futuristic sci-fi novel, Starship
Troopers is supposed to have some cerebral elements in its story of
Earth engaged in a war against intelligent, destructive alien bugs.
	   Van Dien, Meyer, Richards and Harris are schoolkids who enlist
in the campaign and quickly mature as the toll mounts. All the
components of a war drama are here: love, bravery, loss and
triumph.
	   The ``depth'' comes by way of political overtones such as the
fascist- style indoctrination in school and the media - a citizen,
we are intermittently told, is a notch higher than a civilian.
	   However, these are seldom anything more than background noise.
There's really no pause for thinking when the awesome SFX and
almost cartoonish goriness overpower all else. You'll probably be
swept along by the action and adventure. But it's equally likely
that you'll experience the weird aftertaste of pointlessness.
	   THE VERY BEST OF STING &AMP; THE POLICE (US, 1997) Running Time: 70
minutes Rating: 1/2 Distributor: Berjaya HVN WHETHER you should get
this depends on the kind of fan you are. If you're ravenous about
amassing everything to do with The Police and/or Sting, the video
store has probably kept aside your copy of this tape.
	   For those who admire - but not rabidly so - the defunct
three-man band and/or its high-minded frontman, this may not be of
much importance.
	   The Very Best is a video companion to yet another greatest hits
album.
	   The 17 music videos here are not in chronological order and the
amount of fresh material is negligible. Perhaps, the only
noteworthy thing is that The Very Best gives a glimpse of the
musical and stylistic evolution of an influential rock group.
Sting's post-Police career is patchy, but his music videos are
always visually interesting.

	   IN the last article, we saw several methods of enhancing the
ClipArt picture. One can add frames and background fill effects to
provide a printed look. It is possible to add various textures and
hues to improve this background. Today we will look at fine-tuning
this background, i.e.
	   the hypothetical space between the outline of the picture and
the frame that surrounds it.
	   In order to study the background effects, you must first insert
a ClipArt picture into the document. Then click on the picture so
you can see the handles around it. Invoke Format -) Picture. Click
on the Colours and Lines tab. Study the pulldown menu in the Fill
Colour item by clicking on the arrowhead to the right.
	   Choose: Fill Effects. You will see a dialogue box with four
tabs, namely Gradient, Texture, Pattern and Picture.
	   The Gradient dialogue box allows you to choose from several
combinations of hues. At the top of this dialogue box, you will see
an area labelled Colours with the options One Colour, Two Colours
and Preset. Below this, you will find two areas labelled Shading
Styles and Variants.
	   The options in the Colours menu, the Shading styles menu and the
Variants menu are linked. When you click on the One Colour option,
for example, a pulldown menu labelled Colour 1 appears to the right
of the dialogue box. This allows you to choose a colour of your
choice. A sliding bar appears below this.
	   The sliding bar allows you to change the intensity of the hues
that you see in the variants. The colours in the variants will
change, depending on your choice in the Colours menu.
	   The options in the shading styles area allow you to choose a
particular alignment of hues. Basically, the fill effects comprise
a certain colour (assuming you choose the one colour option) moving
in intensity from dark to bright.
	   If you were to choose the Horizontal option, then the upper
portion of the variants box will have a lighter hue and the lower
portion will take on a darker hue. Alternatively, the upper portion
can be darker and the lower portion lighter.
	   A third variant of this pattern is a dark middle portion
followed by lighter upper and lower edges. The final variant is a
light middle portion with darker upper and lower edges. You can
choose the variant that appeals to you from the Variants area.
	   The light and dark hues become horizontally placed, if you were
to choose the Horizontal option in the Shading Styles menu. If you
were to choose Vertical, the hues will occur in vertical lines.
	   The Diagonal up option causes the hues to occur in diagonal
lines, stretching from the bottom left corner to the top right.
	   Diagonal down has similar patterns of hues, but the alignment of
diagonals is now from the top left corner to the bottom right
corner.
	   The From Corner option gives interesting results. The dark
shades commence from one corner of the ClipArt picture and spread
out into lighter shades as they reach the opposite corner. The four
possible variants indicate the dark hues commencing from each of
the four corners of the picture.
	   The From Centre option has only two variants. In one of the
variants, the dark shades begin from the centre of the picture and
spread out in brightening hues. In the next variant, the light
shades occur at the centre and become darker as they spread out
towards the edges of the picture.
	   If you were to choose the two colours option, the menu to the
right of the box will change to show two pulldown menus labelled
Colour 1 and Colour 2 respectively.
	   You can add exciting colour combinations to the background of
your ClipArt picture via these menus. For example, if you want hues
of red and blue instead of light and dark hues of a single colour,
you can choose blue in the Colour 1 menu and red in the Colour 2
menu.
	   You can choose to have these hues aligned vertically,
horizontally, diagonally or emerging out from a centre by choosing
the appropriate options in the Shading Styles menu.
	   You should experiment with different colours and the From centre
option to get a feel of the attractive effects possible.
	   The third option in Colours is labelled Preset. When you click
on this option, you will get a pulldown menu labelled Preset
colours. This menu allows you a pre-determined combination of
colours. The names of these preset combinations are meant to be
user-friendly, and include titles such as Early Sunset
(representing bright colours of dawn), Nightfall (darker hues
associated with dusk) and so on.
	   I find Fire interesting. You might want to try out Brass if you
want a sombre, metallic background.
	   These preset backgrounds can be used in conjunction with the
various shading styles.
	   You must be careful when choosing a background, make sure that
it goes well with the ClipArt picture that you have chosen for the
foreground.
	   For example, if you have a picture that has darker colours at
the top and lighter colours below (for example, a boy with dark
hair wearing white shoes), you will want to choose a shading style
that gives light background colours at the upper half of the
picture and dark background colours at the bottom half of the
picture. The fill effects feature allows you to add a professional
touch to your ClipArt-based work.
	   However, the large number of choices that are possible sometimes
make it difficult to choose a particular background. It helps to
remember: generally a light background works well with a dark
foreground picture, and the converse is also generally true. In
addition, you must always check the final printed copy, especially
if you are using a colour printer. The colours on the printed copy
may look somewhat different from the copy on the screen.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Even as Paris put on the most festive show it could
muster to welcome the world's soccer fans, Air France pilots
decided Tuesday to go ahead with a strike that's left a threatening
cloud over the World Cup.
	   Four unions representing the striking pilots met at Charles de
Gaulle airport for several hours Tuesday evening, and agreed to
continue their 9-day-old walkout.
	   One union, the SNPL-Air Inter, accused Air France management of
``an obvious desire to worsen the strike.'' It called the airline's
``passivity'' since negotiations broke down last Saturday
``stunning and scandalous.''
	   Some union members, meanwhile, said they expected the company's
board to meet in a special session Saturday to consider new
proposals, but management refused to confirm that date.
	   The pilots increasingly are being seen as spoilers of France's
effort to put its best face forward for the World Cup, the gigantic
international soccer fest that begins Wednesday.
	   They weren't alone: train workers in St. Etienne, a World Cup
venue near Lyon in south-central France, called a strike for
Thursday. Some traffic in the region was expected to be disrupted.
	   As the pilots met Tuesday evening, acrobats, dancers, and four
jolly giants filled the capital's streets for a festive World Cup
kickoff. Fans were everywhere, many in kilts; thousands of Scots
have come for the opening game between Scotland and Brazil.
	   But many of the fans who've descended on the capital had to take
alternate means of transport when their Air France flights were
canceled.
	   Only one in four Air France planes was flying Tuesday, and other
carriers were cashing in on the carrier's woes.
	   British Airways estimated it is bringing in an additional 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) daily as a result of the Air
France strike.
	   Air France is the official carrier of the World Cup, and the
airline has arranged special flights to transport teams to their
destinations.
	   The French transport minister, meanwhile, urged pilots and
management to return to the negotiating table.
	   ``Each moment, each hour, each minute must be used for
discussion and for negotiation,'' Jean-Claude Gayssot told the
French parliament. ``Finding a solution to the conflict is
essential,'' Gayssot said.
	   The pilots are protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83 million)
in salary cuts. Air France says the cuts are needed to modernize
the airline, which was saved from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported
profits in 1996 and 1997.
	   The airline has offered to compensate the pilots by giving them
stock in exchange for the pay cuts.
	   Meanwhile, bus and subway service was reduced in Lyon, a World
Cup venue, on Tuesday following a drivers' strike there.
	   Another World Cup venue, Bordeaux, may also be hit with a
walkout by bus drivers on Thursday.

	   NOW, take a good look at yourself. Are you a designing person -
a fashion designer, for example, or an architect, an engineer or a
draftsperson?
	   Perhaps the boot is on the other foot, however. In other words,
has some designing person got designs on you? If the anwer is yes,
then you must be looking good. It may be, of course, that you are
actually wearing a designer label, though I do hope that you are
wearing the clothes as well.
	   A designer label, if you stop to think about it, would not
exactly cover very much.
	   I would recommend several banana leaves to keep you decent
rather than the traditional but skimpy fig-leaf.
	   Needless to say, if somebody has designs on you in the idiomatic
or traditional sense, they are assuredly not decorating you with
such things as watered silk, polka dots, sprigging, or even batik.
	   (Watered silk, in case you are wondering, is neither damp nor
diluted, but a silk patterned with discreet shiny patterns, while
sprigging usually consists of regular patterns of tiny flowers or
buds.) No, they are more likely to be eyeing you with a view to
making a profit, or to putting their mark on you. To put it another
way, having designs on somebody often means planning to get money
or goods out of the victim, or else it can mean planning to do harm
in some way.
	   For example, while on holiday in the UK, I was recently sitting
in my mother's garden when the robin came along. This is the
red-breasted bird that you often see on British Christmas cards,
rather than Robin Hood, though this particular bird qualifies to be
called the Prince of Thieves.
	   The nearest Malaysian equivalent would be the perky
black-and-white Magpie Robin, while the most likely bird to grab
your roti canai would probably be the audacious Lesser Mynah.
	   Anyway, this robin had designs, not on me, but on my French
stick, and it actually took a beakful of bread before I could even
say `Hop it!' So do be careful with your French stick, especially
in your compound.
	   Some marauding cat, bird, or sneak thief may have designs on it,
and then you will be left without your daily bread.
	   In a slightly more positive, if jokey, sense, ``having designs
on someone'' can mean that some interested party, male or female,
is hoping to get together with you.
	   This could mean that they wish to put their mark on you in the
time- honoured way and that wedding bells are in their eyes (though
I always feel that they really ought to go to the optician if this
is the case).
	   On the other hand, it could mean that they are marking up
another conquest, rather as sportsmen mark up a score on on the
scoreboard - in which case they ought to be playing cricket, and
possibly you ought to be making a run for it.
	   As I said before, the design may be literal, and it may take the
form of a designer label - but here I have to say that I am not at
all keen on being labelled, myself.
	   Nor does it seem too discreet or elegant to have labels
plastered over my front, back and sides, or any other visible part
of my anatomy.
	   As my friend Kathy remarked, far too many people these days are
``designered'' - a nice invention which somehow reminds me of verbs
such as blinkered and scuppered.
	   The superficial similarity is obviously the ``er'' at the end of
the verb, though these two verbs have the same ending for rather
different reasons.
	   As you might guess, ``blinker'' is a combination of the verb
``blink'' with one common ending for English nouns, the suffix
``er'', which often suggests action or a particular use for
something.
	   Horses traditionally wear blinkers (British English) or blinders
(American English) to prevent them from seeing scary things out of
the corners of their eyes.
	   So, if a human being is blinkered, he or she can't or won't see
something that is obvious, or perhaps is narrow-minded and can't
accept new ideas.
	   (Since American horses need to be blinded where British ones
appear only to close their eyes momentarily, you may well feel that
US equines are more sensitive than those in the UK - but that may
be just a mare's tale.) When it comes to being scuppered, the
Titanic is the all-time great example. Scupper comes from the Old
French verb escopir meaning to spit, though this seems slightly
inadequate for the torrent of water that rushes in when a hole is
made in a ship.
	   In this case, the ``er'' ending indicates that it has come
through French from a Latin original.
	   A scupper was not accidental in the beginning; it was a
deliberate hole, allowing water to drain off a ship's deck.
Metaphorically, if your plans are scuppered, you can imagine what
happens - they sink without trace, and you have to start all over
again.
	   Of course, the other similarity which connects ``designered'',
``blinkered''
	   and ``scuppered'' is that they all have negative connotations.
	   This is not to say that designer garments are bad in themselves.
On the contrary, they can be most attractive things but what
worries me a bit is that they are all too often seen as status
symbols, and they say very little about the real personality behind
the fancy clothes. The label sometimes seems to count for more than
the actual design.
	   Just a look at the word ``label'' itself, while we are at it, as
this is another word with a common ending or suffix.
	   ``El'' is a diminutive from Latin, so that a label is actually
lab + el - a little fold, or a little ribbon.
	   The related Old Norse word leppr seems to have meant a ``rag'',
so we are back to the idea of fashion, design, and glad rags -
otherwise known as your best clothes, or your party outfit.
	   (This is not to be confused with your birthday suit, since this
is even more of an exposure than wearing just a designer label or a
fig-leaf - it consists of the skin you were born with.) Rags, as
you may be aware, are not really the sort of thing you want to be
seen wearing, while ``a rag'' describes a cheap and sensational
tabloid newspaper - the connections are mostly negative.
	   By the same token, if you are ``labelled'' in English, the
chances are that it's a negative description of some kind.
	   For example, these days you could be labelled a ``wimp'' if you
seem to be feeble, over-sentimental, or physically unenterprising.
	   The kinds of label I should prefer are the more positive
professional and personal ones. I can label myself a ``lecturer'',
``writer'' and ``poet''
	   quite accurately, but I can only hope for pleasant labels from
other people, and I should here like to thank the many readers who
have sent me e-mails on my ``interesting'', ``useful'' and
``enjoyable'' Tongue Tip column.
	   Your appreciation, as well as your positive criticism and
comment on specific points, is something which helps me to design
these articles, and it also helps me to maintain a sense of humour
- something which we all need in trying times, or our tempers may
be in rags by the end of the day.

Wynalda is still trying to shed the bad boy rap.
	   One day after his 21st birthday, he was on top of the soccer
world, in the starting lineup as the United States played its first
World Cup game in 40 years.
	   Then, eight minutes into the second half, he became Eric the
Red, ejected for pushing a Czechoslovak player right in front of
the referee.
	   Ever since then, it's been a scarlet card on his back, an image
stuck to him like the defenders who follow his every move on the
field.
	   ``When I first came on to the national team, it was difficult
because I knew I was a volatile player. But I think I have changed
a great deal,'' he said Tuesday as he reached the somewhat wiser
old age of 29.
	   Time has changed him. And perhaps success, too.
	   It's his third World Cup. Now he's a leader and he knows it, the
top scorer in United States history.
	   He can relax a little _ oh, and perhaps please his coach by
working hard on defense, too.
	   Still, he's the one player Steve Sampson says provides
``brilliant moments.''
	   ``Eric has the ability to be very deceptive on the dribble, to
create that little space for him to pass or shoot. That first step,
when he's in form, is very hard to defend,'' Sampson said.
	   His status for the American opener against Germany on Monday has
been in doubt since April 16, when he had arthroscopic surgery on
his left knee. He's played just 74 minutes in games since then,
trying to work back to 100 percent.
	   On Tuesday, he played 45 minutes in a scrimmage against the
French club FC Gueugnon, a 4-0 U.S. victory. He didn't score, but
pronounced himself ready.
	   ``I believe that I'm healthy enough, I'm definitely healthy
enough,'' he said.
	   He has 32 goals in 100 international games, a Ruthian figure for
U.S. soccer, where the No. 2 scorer has just 21.
	   And, perhaps more importantly, he has some experience against
the Germans, the European champions. In the fall of 1992, he went
to Germany and scored nine goals in his first 10 games with FC
Saarbruecken of the Bundesliga. He spent three seasons in Germany,
scoring 21 goals in 57 games for Saarbruecken, and then scored two
goals in 23 games for VfL Bochum in 1994-95, when he was slowed by
a broken leg just before the midseason break.
	   ``I've had some bad injuries, some little injuries,'' he said.
``I never had the opportunity to heal up. The last few weeks have
been brilliant for me, not having the pressure from the club to
play when I'm not 100 percent.''
	   He came back to America for the start of Major League Soccer,
scoring 10 goals for San Jose in 1996, five last year and three
before the knee injury this season. Still, with a good World Cup,
he hopes to end up back in Europe, but not Germany.
	   ``When I said I'd never play in Germany again, that wasn't
saying that Germany was a bad place to play. I had some good times
and bad times in Germany,'' he said. ``My thinking is I'd like
another experience. I'd like to play in England or Spain.''
	   His agent keeps trying to tell him about opportunities in
Europe, but Wynalda doesn't want to hear it until after the
tournament. He may not start _ Sampson may go with Roy Wegerle or
Brian McBride because of the injury _ but Sampson says Wynalda will
see significant time.
	   ``This World Cup will really be the opportunity to make my
mark,'' Wynalda said. ``This World Cup is the most important of the
three, not just for myself, but for the team. This is our chance to
do something special.''

	   TAPAH, Mon. - Fishermen have been urged to venture into
aquaculture to supplement their income and help boost the State's
fish production for the domestic and foreign markets.
	   Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ramli Ngah Talib said fishermen should not
only depend on fishing from the sea, rivers or lakes, but should
also look into other ways to earn a living.
	   He said fishermen could go into large or small-scale commercial
aquaculture ventures.
	   Speaking to reporters after visiting a fish breeding project in
Chenderiang today, Ramli said through aquaculture, fishermen could
be assured of a continuous supply of fish.
	   He said fishermen were now dependent on the weather. While on
good days, they may have a bumper haul, they may return home
empty-handed on rainy days, he added.
	   The fish breeding project at a four-hectare site in Chenderiang
is being carried out by Bright Aquatic Sdn Bhd, a joint venture
between Johanif Abdul Rahman, 38, and Mohd Khairizam Abdul Majid,
41.
	   It produces freshwater fish fry including varieties like
catfish, tilapia merah and lampam jawa.
	   Accompanying the Menteri Besar was State Agriculture Committee
chairman Datuk Ramly Zahari and State Fisheries director Mhd Shah
Abdul Hamid.
	   Ramli said the State Government, through the Fisheries
Department, was willing to assist those interested in aquaculture.
	   ``The department will also provide expert advice on the matter
to help increase fish production.
	   ``Aquaculture activity is not difficult as many government
agencies have come up with scientific methods to increase fish
production and ensure the quality of produce.''
	   Currently, Perak produces 5,000 tonnes of fresh-water fish and
3,500 tonnes of brackish-water fish every year through aquaculture
activities.

	   TUMPAT, Mon. - A 40-year old man was found stabbed to death at
his house in Selehong, Kok Pasir early today.
	   Police identified the victim as Kamarulzaman Jusoh, a purchasing
officer at a hotel in Kota Baru.
	   District police chief Superintendent Muhd Fuad Talib said a
police party was sent to the scene following a telephone call from
a resident about 2.35am.
	   ``At the scene, police found Kamarulzaman sprawled on the
verandah with stab wound on his abdomen,'' he added.
	   He added that the police team also found a knife, believed to
have been used by the killer.
	   At least two men could have been involved in the killing,
according to the police. Kamarulzaman was alone in the house at the
time of the crime.
	   His mother, Fatimah Hassan, 64, said that she was asleep at her
house, which was about 30 metres away from her son's place, when
she heard his call.
	   ``It was about 2am. I went to his house and saw him lying in a
pool of blood with a knife in his hand,'' she added Muhd Fuad said
the body has been sent to the Tumpat Hospital for a post- mortem.
	   Police have classified the case as murder. They believe the
motive could be robbery as his wallet was missing.
	   He appealed to members of the public with information to contact
him or Investigation Officer Deputy Superintendent Hamid Sabran at
09-7257222.

	   Meteorological Department, Sabah branch director Chang Kung Chew
said the rain was not distributed evenly. Some places were still
facing a drought, especially in the coastal areas of the Kudat and

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Clad in a khaki army uniform and a beret,
Nigeria's new military ruler went on state-controlled television
Tuesday to pledge his support for a transition process that aims to
end army rule in favor of democracy.
	   ``We remain fully committed to the social-political transition
program of Gen. Sani Abacha's administration,'' Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar said, reading from a prepared statement. ``We will do
everything to ensure its full and successful implementation.''
	   Abacha, a ruthless dictator by any standards, died Monday of a
heart attack. He had long promised hand power over to the army but
never fulfilled his vow.
	   Hours after emerging as Abacha's sucessor, Abubakar was almost
immediately met with a barrage of calls from at home and abroad for
democracy to replace military autocracy.
	   Nigerians, weary after years of army rule, have long called for
democratic reform.
	   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' exiled
Nigerian playwright and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka said in
Jerusalem. ``So it's up to the military to recognize this.''
	   Abacha seized power in a 1993 coup and went on to become one of
Nigeria's harshest dictators. About 7,000 government critics and
dissidents have been locked up during his rule.
	   He was unmoved by international appeals, the threat of sanctions
and condemnation for his internal security policies, which human
rights groups say included torture and killings.
	   His successor is a 55-year-old career soldier who trained in the
United States early in his career and in 1981 served with Nigerian
troops assigned to a U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon. Abacha
appointed him chief of defense staff in 1993.
	   One after another, members of the international community
acknowledged Abacha's death, but more poignantly called it an
opportunity for democracy for Nigeria.
	   In the United States, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said
President Bill Clinton's administration was interested in Abubakar
surrendering power to democratic rule.
	   ``Our hope, among others, would be, at this moment of
transition, that an accountable civilian government ... will emerge
from what has been a very horrific episode,'' McCurry said.
	   Overshadowing condolences for Abacha, similar calls for
democracy in Nigeria came from France, Britain and members of the
British Commonwealth of nations.
	   In his televised statement, however, Abubakar appeared to hold
out an olive branch to a scornful international community. He also
called Nigeria's diaspora of self-exiled expatriates to return home
to rebuild help their country.
	   ``My servant appeal also goes to the international community for
their understanding and cooperation,'' he said. ``Nigeria demands a
fair hearing and constructive engagement and not isolation.''
	   Abubakar, meanwhile, faced the daunting task of rebuilding a
country eroded by years of corruption and economic mismanagement.
	   Up to 80 percent of the population lives in poverty, government
figures indicate.
	   From the sprawling commercial hub of Lagos to countless
countryside shanties, most Nigerians live without clean water,
reliable electricity or even basic health care.
	   The world's sixth-largest oil exporter, Nigeria can't even fill
its own gas tanks. Corruption and bureaucracy have put the
country's refineries out of business.
	   ``Do you see people crying in the streets?'' said government
clerk Musiniu Bakare after Abacha's death. ``People are rejoicing
now that he is gone, this man who ruined the economy.''
	   At home, leaders of various groups in Nigeria's pro-democracy
movement _ the political opposition, civil rights activists,
journalists and clergy _ were meeting Tuesday in hope of forging a
unified coalition to give strength to their demands for democracy.
	   Few were willing to speak on the record about their discussions,
saying they first wanted to hear from Abubakar, a career soldier
and close ally of Abacha.
	   But Edetaen Ojo, who runs the watchdog group Media Rights
Agenda, said he had few hopes for the new government.
	   ``I really don't think we're going to have much of a change,''
he said. ``He must have maneuvered himself in some way to get into
that position, so he must also want a taste of power.''
	   But like the world leaders who called for the transition to go
forward, Ojo said the sudden change was an opportunity that should
not be wasted.
	   ``This is a crucial moment,'' he said.
	   He also called for the release of jailed politician Moshood
Abiola, the presumed winner of 1993's annulled presidential
elections.
	   But opposition leaders and diplomats say they doubt the
transition can proceed as scheduled: with Aug. 1 presidential
elections and an Oct. 1 handover to civilian rule.
	   Most obviously, there aren't even any presidential candidates
left. Abacha, who never committed to running, was the only legal
candidate _ nominated by all five state-approved parties.
	   Amid many unknowns in post-Abacha Nigeria, one thing is clear:
Opponents are glad Abacha is gone.
	   ``Thank God that he's gone,'' said radical Lagos lawyer Gani
Fawehinmi.

	   THE way the Health Ministry handles transfers and postings of
medical officers is really a disappointing affair to doctors. A
recent incident involving the posting of my spouse who is a
Master's student further illustrates the point.
	   My spouse and I applied to a local university for the Master's
programme in medicine late last year. We were required to fill up
various forms and we clearly stated our marital status. Both of us
were accepted into the programme.
	   However, to our dismay, we later found out that both of us were
posted to different hospitals which were several hundred kilometres
apart. Calls to the ministry proved futile and instead we were told
to send in an appeal.
	   When we inquired why this had happened despite informing them of
our marital status, we were told that the data was not furnished by
the particular university.
	   What did we fill up the form for then? We haven't heard from the
ministry with regard to our appeal but my spouse is already
considering quitting the programme and even the public sector.
	   Ironically, a similar incident happened to a relative of ours
who got married recently. Both husband and wife are working and are
separated by land, river and sea. An appeal for a transfer was
submitted to the ministry early this year but it was rejected
without any reason.
	   Imagine the newly-weds meeting over the weekend and that too if
the spouse is not on call duty.
	   Many doctors who are married and currently serving the ministry
are subjected to this trauma every year. Despite complaints and
written appeals to the ministry, no changes have been seen or noted
in the system.
	   We are told to be a caring society, but how can we instil such
an attitude when the ministry has little regard for the welfare of
its doctors? Due to this factor, many doctors leave the public
sector and we are seriously considering this in view of the many
foul-ups by the ministry.
	   I seriously urge the Minister to look into this and many other
issues pertaining to the welfare of doctors before it is too late.

	   HEWLETT-PACKARD Co is exploring potential business opportunities
in the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), and identifying the areas
that could thrive within the environment.
	   HP's corporate vice president and Asia-Pacific operations
president and managing director Dick Warmington said the company is
also looking at whether its involvement in the MSC will be
meaningful in supporting its operations within Asia-Pacific.
	   According to him, HP has already established a presence in the
corridor through Prolin, an MSC-registered company which it has
acquired.
	   ``We are also looking at expanding some of our software
activities in that framework,'' he said at the HP Builds the
Electronic World Asia- Pacific Press Symposium which was held in
Sydney last week.
	   Warmington reiterated that HP is committed to the region, and
looks upon the current period of economic turbulence as an
opportunity to use information technology (IT) to propel nations
and corporations forward.
	   The company is also taking the opportunity to strengthen its
presence in the region for the long haul. ``We feel we have a very
real opportunity to gain greater leverage from investments around
the region,'' he said.
	   Late last year, HP announced an additional RM1 billion
investment in Malaysia to expand the company's present operations
in Penang and develop a new centre of excellence in the
manufacturing and testing of microwave components.
	   HP's plant is the largest single foreign investment in Penang
since the beginning of the State's industrialisation initiative in
1972. Its investment will be spread over a period of five years.
	   ``Actually, we are bringing some of the crown jewel technology
of our microwave instrumentation into Penang and the capability to
build the semiconductor components for our telecommunications
instruments,'' said Warmington.
	   HP's other investments in the region include Indonesia, Korea,
the Philippines, and Singapore.
	   In Indonesia, the company opened a business centre in Jakarta
late last year to provide IT consultation and customised-computing
solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises.
	   In Korea, the company recently announced an investment of up to
US$250 million (RM950 million), of which around US$100 million of
this would be infusion of working capital for the management of HP
operations in Korea.
	   ``About US$70 million has already been forwarded to Korea. Part
of the investment is to set up an HP financial operation to provide
Korean customers and partners with flexible financing and IT
equipment management services,'' said Warmington.
	   HP announced recently that it had purchased from Samsung
Electronics the 45 per cent shareholding in HP Korea.
	   In Singapore, the company has just established the first
regional part centre to speed up the supply of parts for repairing
and servicing HP's equipment in the region.
	   In January, HP announced in the Philippines the parts
distribution centre in Manila, along with 46 service centres
throughout the country to support its customers and partners.
	   HP also recently set up a centre of expertise to develop HP's
test and measurement electronics manufacturing solutions in Taiwan.
	   ``And the list goes on and will continue. While we are
experiencing a business slowdown in this region, we believe the
fundamentals remain in place to support Asia's long-term economic
growth,'' said Warmington.
	   He added that reforms currently underway in many of the affected
countries, though painful in the short term, will provide the free
market forces that should support high growth in the future.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Jacques Chirac and Tony Blair are hoping they'll
see each other at the World Cup final.
	   ``Maybe we'll be side by side again on July 12th,'' said Chirac,
the French president, during a meeting at the Elysee palace.
	   ``Oh, I hope so,'' replied Blair, the British prime minister.
	   Then he got more confident.
	   ``It's altogether possible, either with England or Scotland,''
said Blair.
	   Before the meeting to discuss the upcoming EU summit in Cardiff,
Wales, Blair showed his team spirit with a visit to the Scottish
team, which trains close to Paris. Chirac has visited the French
team.
	   Scotland plays Brazil in the opening match Wednesday.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Afghanistan's ousted president said
Tuesday he welcomed U.N. efforts to reduce opium poppy cultivation
in his country but warned that working through the Taliban was
``indeed helping the war machine.''
	   The Taliban Islamic army, which drove Burhanuddin Rabbani from
the capital Kabul in 1996, has agreed to work with the United
Nations to curb poppy production and encourage farmers to grow
alternate crops.
	   The proposal is being discussed on a wider scale at this week's
U.N. General Assembly on drugs as a way to provide financial
incentives to farmers to stop growing cannabis, opium poppies and
coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.
	   Most of the poppies in Afghanistan, used to produce heroin, are
believed grown in the 85 percent of the country under Taliban
control. While Rabbani welcomed aid, he warned against sending it
through Taliban channels.
	   ``If I were asked, I would definitely tell them that there were
other mechanisms and ways to help the southern part of Afghanistan
... rather than Taliban channels which would be indeed helping the
war machine,'' Rabbani said.
	   Although the Taliban controls most of the country, the U.N.
General Assembly never withdrew the seat of the Rabbani government,
meaning he is still recognized as the Afghan president.
	   Afghanistan and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, accounted for
90 percent of the world's illicit opium production in 1997. The
United Nations estimates that most of the heroin sold on the
streets of Western Europe comes from Afghanistan.

	   CRUDE palm oil (CPO) futures on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity
Exchange are likely to trade higher this week with sentiments to be
inspired by the currency factor.
	   The ringgit which weakened further last Friday (quoted at 3.97
to the US dollar against 3.86 the previous week), prompted
technical buying in the market.
	   Local trading house JF Apex Futures Sdn Bhd forsees the upside
potential in the near term with the three-month August contract
expected to test the RM2,419 level.
	   The week just ended featured a bullish report on Tuesday,
stating that India will retain its import duty of 25 per cent for
edible oil, while on Thursday, the US agricultural attache
estimated that Malaysia's palm oil stocks for end-June would ease
to 525,000 tonnes from 790,000 tonnes in the same month last year.
	   Talks that the State Trading Corporation of India will issue a
new tender soon, spurred interest for the local palm oil on
Thursday.
	   Palm oil exports were estimated to increase to 565,000 tonnes
against PORLA's exports for April at 530,385 tonnes.

	   LA BOULE, France (AP) _ England's World Cup squad flew into a
rainy Nantes Tuesday night 20 minutes behind schedule after a
friendly match against a local Caen club.
	   Manager Glenn Hoddle, whose players have hit the headlines
because of their drinking habits, would make no comment as he led
his troops into a bus for an 80-kiometer (50-mile) ride to their
base camp at the Hotel du Golf International near the seaside
resort of La Boule.
	   The squad was scheduled to have a training session at Stade
Moreau Defarge Wednesday afternoon.
	   Tuesday's warm-up match in Caens was held behind closed doors
and the only news to filter through was that England won 1-0 with
an 85th minute goal from Paul Scholes.

	   ZALA AMBESSA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Eritrean and Ethiopian troops
pummeled each other with shell and rocket fire along their disputed
border Tuesday, while diplomats and hundreds of frightened
foreigners flew out of the Eritrean capital.
	   The Eritrean army advanced along a jagged front line up a steep
mountain south of Zala Ambessa, pushing from 8 kilometers (5 miles)
to 15 kilometers (9 miles) into Ethiopian territory.
	   Each side accused the other of starting the fighting at dawn,
before morning mists cleared from the valley.
	   ``Everytime they attack us, we'll strike back and push them back
even farther,'' said Eritrean commander Capt. Afwerki, who uses
only one name.
	   Ethiopian government spokeswoman, Selome Taddesse said the
Eritreans had attacked Ethiopian positions south of Zala Ambessa
for the fourth time Tuesday afternoon. She added that the
Ethiopians had repulsed them, taking several prisoners and
inflicting heavy casualties. No further details were available.
	   Eritrean forces last week seized the border town, whose 15,000
civilians swiftly cleared out as the deafening roar of battle
began. Dozens of Eritrean troops were wounded and some were
evacuated in slings improvised from bloodied bedsheets and tree
branches.
	   In the Eritrean capital of Asmara, 105 kilometers (65 miles) to
the northwest, German and Russian diplomats boarded evacuation
flights after closing their embassies.
	   The Israeli and Danish governments last week closed their
diplomatic missions, fearing more bombardments by Ethiopian
warplanes, which hit Asmara's military-civilian airport on Friday
and Saturday. Ten remained open.
	   ``We are leaving with mixed feelings,'' German Ambassador
Wolfgang Ringe said after lowering the flag at his embassy.
	   A U.S.-chartered plane left for Cairo, Egypt, with 50 diplomats
and dependents, 120 naturalized Americans born in Eritrea, and 80
others including Russians, Swedes, Norwegians and Djiboutians.
	   ``This is the one chance I've got to get out. If I don't take
it, I'm afraid I'll be trapped here,'' said Gabriel Ephrem, an
Eritrean whose home is in San Diego.
	   Also aboard were a handful of Ethiopian diplomats, ordered out
by Eritrea in retaliation for the expulsion of its diplomats from
Addis Ababa last week. Two diplomats remained in each capital.
	   Commercial flights and most ships have stopped coming to Eritrea
because Ethiopia has said it cannot guarantee their safety. Eritrea
on Tuesday demanded that the international community force Ethiopia
to lift its threat.
	   ``World leaders should tell them, `You can fight on the front,
but you can't hold the capital hostage,''' said Yemane Gebremeskel,
presidential spokesman.
	   The government welcomed a plan debated by iplomats at an
Organization of African Unity summit to send a six-president
delegation the two Horn of Africa countries, he said.
	   In a message sent to the meeting in Burkina Faso, Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki said, ``The real stumbling block to peace
is Ethiopia's logic of force and spiral of measures that have begun
by blowing the problem out of proportion and have ended up
escalating the conflict to the brink of full-scale war.''
	   Isaias renewed his calls for an end to all hostilities, full
demilitarization of the border, and direct talks between Eritrea
and Ethiopia in the presence of high-level mediators.
	   In a terse statement, Ethiopia refused direct negotiations.
	   ``We have made it clear since the beginning, unless they
withdraw from areas they have occupied, we cannot sit down for any
talks, direct or indirect,'' Taddesse, the Ethiopian government
spokeswoman, said.
	   The northeast African nations are engaged in a battle over their
border. Ethiopia is resisting attempts by its smaller, northern
neighbor to control territory it says is wrongly held by Eritrea.
	   Eritrea claims its forces are within internationally recognized
borders drawn by Italy in the late 19th century. Eritrea, an
Italian colony from 1885 to 1941, was annexed in 1962 by Ethiopia,
against whom it later fought a 30-year war for independence.
	   The United States and Rwanda have crafted a peace proposal that
would require Eritrea withdraw to positions it occupied prior to
May 6, when border skirmishes broke out. Ethiopia has accepted the
plan, but Eritrea says it is sketchy.

Arafat maintains need for guns to defend Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
``peace needs a gun to defend it'' in an interview broadcast on
Spanish television on Wednesday.
	   The head of the Palestinian Authority also called on the
international community to take responsibility for the Mideast
peace process he said was threatened ``in its entirety'' by the
policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``I am not optimistic because the policies of Netanyahu run
against peace'' Arafat said in the interview recorded at his home
in Gaza on Friday.
	   The Palestinian leader also stressed his current lobbying of
Arab leaders in an effort to organize a summit that would serve as
immediate pressure on Israel to accept a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has yet to give a definitive response to the U.S. plan
which has already been accepted by the Palestinians.

New Nigerian leader inherits shattered economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's new military leader, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, inherits a shattered economy, ravaged by years
of endemic corruption.
	   But with Abubakar promising to honor plans to hand over power to
a civilian government later this year, analysts say the country may
be making its first tentative steps toward recovery.
	   ``The key question is who takes over and how that shifts the
balance of power between those who want to hang on to power, and
those who want to return to the barracks,'' said Jean Francois
Mercier, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
	   Moving toward an elected, democratic government could help build
investor confidence and creditor confidence here, he said.
	   Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, who died Monday of a
heart attack, is widely blamed for allowing the country's
potentially powerful economy slip into disarray during his five
years in power.
	   Under Abacha's rule, Nigeria became an international pariah, and
his government was accused of widespread human rights abuses and
rampant corruption.
	   Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest exporters of
crude oil, which earns this West African country more than dlrs
4.45 billion in annual revenues, up to 80 of the population live in
poverty, government statistics indicate. Nigeria's bounty was
largely believed squandered, pilfered or spent propping up the
country's ruling army.
	   So anemic is the economy that even in the heart of the vast oil
fields in the Niger Delta, the government either is unable or
unwilling to offer to help to poverty-stricken communities.
	   Laden with debt and marked as a risky credit prospect, Nigeria
is struggling just to keep afloat amid this latest political
turmoil.
	   Bringing itself more into line with the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank reform recommendations is crucial for Nigeria
if the West African country is to negotiate relief from its
crippling dlrs 35 billion external debt.
	   Although negotiations for additional IMF and World Bank loans
continue with Nigeria, both lending bodies insist that the country
must take measures to bring spending under control, while
increasing government revenues.

Mandela bids farewell to Abacha, pan-African summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela bade
farewell to his last pan-African summit Tuesday after paying
tribute to his former political enemy, Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha, who died Monday of a heart attack.
	   Mandela, 79, was whisked in a black limousine from the three-day
Organization of African Unity on Tuesday afternoon in Burkina
Faso's capital shortly after telling reporters in brief impromptu
remarks that Abacha's death was a great loss for Nigeria and
Africa.
	   The South African leader later flew out of the capital,
officials said, ending Mandela's farewell appearance at the OAU
summit before retiring from politics next year.
	   Mandela was echoing a statement made by South Africa's foreign
ministry praising Abacha for his country's role in ousting junta
troops in Sierra Leone. Nigeria led a multi-national force that
restored the country's elected government in February.
	   The conciliatory remarks came despite persistent tensions
between Nigeria and South Africa under the rule of Abacha and
Mandela.
	   Relations chilled between the two countries after Mandela called
for Commonwealth sanctions against Nigeria in retaliation for the
military execution of environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight fellow activists in 1995.
	   Last week, Abacha accused South Africa, Ghana and the U.S. of
working together to destabilize Nigeria.
	   In his parting speech to the OAU on Monday, Mandela urged
African leaders to work together for peace and development instead
of acting like ``superstars.''
	   He was warmly embraced and praised by other African leaders,
several of whom supported him while the 79-year-old walked , during
an informal photo session later in the day.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
``peace needs a gun to defend it'' in an interview broadcast on
Spanish television on Tuesday.
	   The head of the Palestinian Authority also called on the
international community to take responsibility for the Mideast
peace process he said was threatened ``in its entirety'' by the
policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``I am not optimistic because the policies of Netanyahu run
against peace'' Arafat said in the interview recorded at his home
in Gaza on Friday.
	   The Palestinian leader also stressed his current lobbying of
Arab leaders in an effort to organize a summit that would serve as
immediate pressure on Israel to accept a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel has yet to give a definitive response to the U.S. plan
which has already been accepted by the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian was shot and killed
Tuesday by Israeli troops who spotted him and several others trying
to enter a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip, the army said.
	   Military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
Palestinian was not armed. An Israeli army statement said an
explosive device was found where the suspects were standing near
the Morag settlement.
	   A statement from the Israeli army spokesman said Israeli
soldiers patrolling near the settlement spotted ``a number of
suspicions persons who tried to enter the Morag settlement. Israeli
forces ... opened fire towards the suspects, as a result one
suspect was killed.''
	   The army said the discovery of the explosive devise led them to
believe that an attack on Israeli patrols or civilians living in
the area was planned.
	   Palestinian police Commander Khaled Abu Oleh said the dead
Palestinian had been taken to Nasser hospital in the
Palestinian-controlled Khan Yunis refugee camp about 15 km south of
Morag. Oleh did not reveal the identity of the dead male but said
that a joint Israeli-Palestinian investigation into the incident
was underway.
	   Most of the Gaza Strip is under Palestinian control while Israel
maintains control of the areas around Jewish settlements and Gaza
's borders with Israel and Egypt.

No joy for oil producers as OPEC seeks more supply cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with oil falling further, grafs 11-12; SUBBING grafs 3,

add background for price drop; picking up 13th graf pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Things are looking pretty dismal in the oil
market.
	   Prices have been sinking, even though OPEC surprised traders
this spring by sticking with most of the production cuts its
members promised.
	   Now, some of the big players in OPEC are calling for deeper
reductions in output, and analysts predicted Tuesday they'll
probably lack the willpower to achieve any new targets. If that's
correct, consumers could continue to enjoy a bargain while
producers suffer.
	   ``There's not much out there that looks bullish,'' said Victor
Yu, who follows oil markets in New York for the commodity trader
Refco Inc. ``OPEC _ even though they said they were cutting back
`X' amount of barrels _ they aren't cutting that amount.''
	   Ten of the 11 members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed in an emergency meeting in March to
reduce output by 1.245 million barrels per day.
	   But the International Energy Agency in Paris reported Tuesday
that the actual cuts came up short, at around 1.017 million
barrels, last month.
	   And OPEC member Iraq boosted output modestly. Iraq did not join
the effort to cut production because it can only pump limited
amounts of crude under United Nations sanctions imposed after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   OPEC's dilemma enables U.S. motorists, who are among the world's
biggest energy consumers, to enjoy the benefits of cheap fuel
prices.
	   Retail gasoline in the United States was holding steady at about
dlrs 1.14 per gallon, according to a Lundberg Survey early this
month that said the start of the traditional summer driving season
had failed to push prices higher, thanks to a ``more than ample
supply.''
	   The IEA report cast further gloom over the markets by saying the
demand for crude in Asia was being hit even harder than expected as
a result of the lingering financial crisis. The oil market
collapsed this winter after OPEC's ill-judged decision to pump more
crude just as the Asian troubles worsened.
	   Prices plunged on New York and London futures markets Tuesday,
extending Monday's sharp declines.
	   Light sweet crude oil to be delivered in July dropped 70 cents,
to dlrs 13.85 per barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Brent crude for July was off 73 cents, closing at dlrs 13.49 per
barrel, on London's International Petroleum Exchange.

Mexican president wants open primary for ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLAUDE E. ERBSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mexico's president said Tuesday that he favors
an open primary to elect the ruling party's next presidential
candidate, after decades of the president choosing the candidate to
succeed him.
	   In a meeting with a small group of news media executives in New
York, President Ernesto Zedillo said he would prefer a ``wide
open'' primary for the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
	   The PRI ``has understood the need to be more competitive,''
Zedillo said.
	   It was unclear whether he was advocating a primary limited to
PRI members or open to all registered voters.
	   Since the party was founded in 1929, all Mexican presidents have
been from the PRI. Party officials have honored the outgoing
president's choice of a candidate to succeed him _ effectively
letting him name the next president.
	   But in recent elections opposition parties have presented real
challenges to the PRI because a series of reforms have made
elections more fair.
	   Zedillo was elected with just over 50 percent of the vote in
1994. In past decades, the PRI often improbably claimed 90 percent
of the vote.
	   Zedillo predicted that some form of primary would select the
candidate for the 2000 elections and said he personally preferred
an open primary to a smaller one in which PRI activists would
select a candidate.
	   Asked if he thought he might have to follow the tradition of
selecting the candidate himself _ a practice known as the
``dedazo'' or ``big finger'' _ he said: ``fortunately not.''
	   The party expects to hold a national convention this year to
decide on the mechanism for choosing a candidate.
	   Asked about a U.S. money-laundering investigation that has hurt
relations between the United States and Mexico, Zedillo said he was
not bothered by the failure of U.S. authorities to inform their
Mexican counterparts.
	   ``We also keep secret some of our anti-drug efforts,'' he said.
	   But he said Mexico's attorney general's office must determine
whether U.S. agents violated any laws in its investigation that led
to the arrest of dozens of Mexican banking officials.
	   He added that he and President Bill Clinton agreed during a
meeting Monday ``on the principle that no Mexican law should be
violated when applying U.S. laws.''
	   Zedillo said growing street crime in Mexico is not a by-product
of drug wars, not attributable to the economic situation. He said
that blaming street crime on the economy would be to accuse the
poor of a propensity to crime.
	   He said the ``inefficiency of our institutions'' was more to
blame for the growth of crime and the government's failure to
control it.

World Cup: Haiti, plagued by power cuts, getting extra electricity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: repeating to some points to fix style on slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ To bring World Cup matches live to
soccer-crazed Haitians, the state electricity company plans to
boost power to the capital that suffers 12-hour-a-day blackouts.
	   It comes at a price, however. The Nouvelliste newspaper reported
Tuesday that residents are being asked to turn off their
refrigerators, air conditioners and electric water pumps during
soccer matches.
	   Haitians have adopted the teams of Argentina and Brazil, the
defending champions who open the World Cup finals in France on
Wednesday. While Haitians have started flying Argentine and
Brazilian flags from their homes and cars, they appear indifferent
to Jamaica, only the second Caribbean team to make it to the finals
since Haiti broke the barrier in 1974.
	   Tuesday's Nouvelliste quoted Electricity of Haiti officials as
saying that they would boost power to Port-au-Prince from 55 to 100
megawatts during the World Cup. Even that will not guarantee
unbroken coverage since they city needs 115 megawatts daily,
according to officials who appealed to residents to turn off other
electrical appliances.
	   Probably fewer than a third of Port-au-Prince's 2 million
residents own television sets. But many were invited to crowd into
friends' homes or visit neighbors selling seats in front of their
TV sets.

a final decision on a referendum would be made in the next few

 &UR; Australia announces dlrs 9 million program for drug control in
Asia-Pacific &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Australia announced a dlrs 15 million (US
dlrs 9 million) program Tuesday to combat drug trafficking in the
Asia-Pacific region and to finance crop eradication programs in the
Mekong Basin of Southeast Asia.
	   Most of the funds will be used to develop an Asia-Pacific law
enforcement cooperation program and extend Australia's law
enforcement liaison offices throughout the region, according to
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
	   Other funds will be used for eradicating illegal crops and
providing alternative means of livelihood for farmers in the Mekong
Basin of Southeast Asia, strengthen customs services in the
Pacific, provide education for drug abusers and for health services
among addicts.
	   Downer announced the program _ known as ``Safer Streets, Safer
Borders'' _ during the second day of a three-day U.N. General
Assembly special session on drugs, during which representatives of
about 150 nations are to endorse a comprehensive program for
combating drug use worldwide.
	   ``Ultimately, if we are to protect our streets, we must also
protect our borders and our own region,'' Downer told the General
Assembly. He said the ``Safer Streets, Safer Borders'' program was
``an important step in that direction.''
	   ``I welcome the U.N.'s comprehensive approach to the drugs
problem which addresses not only controls on the supply of drugs
but also places increased emphasis on demand reduction and
alternative development programs,'' Downer added.
	   ``The elimination of illicit drugs remains the first and
ultimate goal,'' he said. ``But the reality is that drugs continue
to reach those who are prepared to risk their health and often
their lives using drugs.''
	   He said Australia supports the goal of reducing demand for drugs
_ which leaders of drug-producing nations say is essential if
narcotics control measures are to be effective.
	   ``This is an indispensable element in tackling the world drug
program,'' he added.

Mediator's resignation raises questions for Mexico conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TRINA KLEIST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Nearly two years after
peace talks between the government and Indian rebels broke down, a
key mediator's resignation is signaling that the government wants
to resolve the conflict on its own terms.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz, claiming growing government
``aggression'' against his church, on Sunday ended his efforts to
mediate an end to the uprising by the Zapatista National Liberation
Army. The mediation commission he led also disbanded.
	   The controversial bishop had led efforts to end the conflict
since it erupted on Jan. 1, 1994. The first talks in early 1994
were held here in his cathedral.
	   Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by supporters, his critics
accused him of causing the rebellion by preaching social activism
to the region's impoverished Indian communities. Some Zapatista
rebels are former church layworkers.
	   On Tuesday, masked men _ presumably Zapatistas or their
supporters _ ambushed six government supporters in the village of
Los Platanos, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of San Cristobal. One
man was killed and five were injured _ four of them seriously.
	   While there is no evidence Ruiz has advocated violence,
President Ernesto Zedillo last week issued a veiled warning, saying
that ``those who promote the theology of violence... should correct
their errors.'' Officials have repeatedly denounced Ruiz and his
diocese.
	   Supporters said Ruiz's sympathy with rebel goals helped convince
the suspicious Zapatistas to talk with the government.
	   ``What has happened is nothing positive,'' historian Lorenzo
Meyer of the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City said of Ruiz's
resignation. ``It polarizes the situation in Chiapas even more.
Now, the Zapatistas and the government are virtually alone.''
	   Zedillo seems to want it that way.
	   Government officials for months have questioned the need for
mediators, saying they want direct contact with the Zapatistas. As
part of its strategy, the government also is turning up the
pressure on the Zapatistas and their supporters.
	   At least 40,000 federal troops patrol the region. The government
has been accused of links to vigilante groups that have clashed
with Zapatista supporters, including a band that massacred 45 rebel
sympathizers in the town of Acteal late last year.
	   Officials have interrogated foreigners who sympathize with the
rebels at immigration checkpoints on roads to Zapatista-held areas,
and more than 150 foreigners accused of meddling in politics have
been expelled.
	   The government has raided at least two self-declared rebel
municipalities and has encouraged members of others to abandon the
rebels.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of Ruiz's rural layworkers have been charged
with crimes by local officials and his diocese says local
pro-government officials have used intimidation to close 33 Roman
Catholic churches.
	   The new government tactics come nearly two years after talks
broke down.
	   Government and rebel representatives spent 17 months in talks
that resulted in agreements on rights for Indians nationwide.
Sympathetic Congressmen proposed a law that the Zapatistas
accepted. The federal government ultimately rejected the measure
and offered its own, less sweeping version _ one that the
Zapatistas didn't like.
	   The rebels reacted by withdrawing from talks in August 1996,
accusing the government of reneging on its pact. Now, even the
once-voluble rebel military leader, Subcomandante Marcos, is being
unusually silent.
	   Signs are that circumstances are swinging in the government's
favor, Meyer said.
	   ``The federal government ... has the Zapatista army
surrounded,'' Meyer said. ``It is making life impossible for its
(village support) bases and is pouring out money to support ruling
party adherents in the appearance of a social program.''

Histadrut labor union boss re-elected to second term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The leader of Israel's largest labor
union was expected to win a landslide victory to a second term
Tuesday, according to exit poll results.
	   Israel TV exit polls showed Amir Peretz leading with 72 percent
of the vote one hour after polls closed around the country at 22:00
(19:00gmt). Final results were not expected before Wednesday 04:00
(0100gmt).
	   Peretz, a member of Israel's Labor party, has led some 600,000
Histradrut workers in several massive generals strikes over the
past two years mostly to protest a government proposal to roll back
on a pension agreement plus the plans to privatize state-owned
corporations.
	   Peretz, who ran on an ``anti-capitalist'' platform, ran against
one other candidate, Maxim Levy, a lawmaker with the small Gesher
party and brother of David Levy, who resigned as Israel's foreign
minister earlier this year over the stalled Mideast peace process.

Willis taking second chance to play in Canada
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL A. LUTZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Forward Kevin Willis, almost traded to Toronto
last February, finally became a Raptor in a trade for the 16th and
18th picks in the June 24 National Basketball Association draft and
a third player, the player's agent confirmed Tuesday.
	   ``Kevin is flattered that Toronto would trade two first round
picks and a third player for him to play in Toronto,'' said Steve
Woods, Willis' agent. ``Last February, it was a bargaining
manipulation whereas today it is based on Toronto wanting to bring
in a seasoned pro and an outstanding basketball player.''
	   Willis was one of Houston's steadiest performers last season. He
started 74 regular-season games and averaged 16.1 points and 8.4
rebounds. He is scheduled to be paid dlrs 2.1 million this season.
	   Rockets officials declined immediate comment.
	   Willis was involved in a regular-season trade with the Raptors
that would have sent guard Damon Stoudamire to the Rockets. That
deal fell apart and Stoudamire eventually was traded to Portland.
	   The Rockets and Woods were angered that word about the trade
leaked out.
	   ``What happened in February were three days of negotiations in
the press between Houston and Toronto,'' Woods said. ``That more or
less served to increase the market value of Damon Stoudamire.''
	   Toronto obtained the 18th pick from Portland. The 16th pick
originally belonged to New York.
	   The Rockets won consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995
but have failed to return to the title game since. Utah eliminated
Houston in the first round of the playoffs this spring.
	   The average age of the Rockets' playoff roster this season was
32.6, giving the team a goal of getting younger for next season.
They already owned the 14th pick.
	   Charles Jones, 41, and Clyde Drexler, 35, already have announced
their retirement and despite his outstanding performance last
season, trading Willis sent another 35-year old packing.
	   The Rockets still have two of their superstars, Hakeem Olajuwon
and Charles Barkley, both 35.

Polgar defeats Karpov in chess battle of the sexes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's Judit Polgar, the world's top
female chess player, defeated World Chess champion Anatoly Karpov
on Tuesday in the first day of their four-day series of speed
matches.
	   ``I think some of my moves made him pause, they were not what he
expected,'' said Polgar, 21. ``With only 22 seconds to go, he made
a wrong move and gave up.''
	   Karpov fought her with the Carokan defense but quit after the
50th move.
	   The first match, with Judit playing black and using the Bennoni
defense, ended in a tie after the 33rd move.
	   Karpov, 47, is the reigning champion of the World Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, although fellow
Russian Garry Kasparov is considered the true world champion.

Martin rises to the moment again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON SIRAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Great athletes are at their best when it means
the most. It is almost the definition of a champion.
	   By qualifying for the U.S. Open _ in a playoff no less, and
after nearly blowing it with a double bogey on the last hole of
regulation no less _ Casey Martin strengthened his credentials as a
great athlete.
	   ``Know what?'' Martin said after he made a birdie on the second
extra hole Monday to get the final qualifying spot in Cincinnati.
``I grew up hitting Whiffle ball shots around my yard thinking I
was in the Open. I guess it's going to come true.''
	   When Martin tees up a real ball at The Olympic Club in San
Francisco on June 18 he will represent all those who ever dreamed
of playing in the U.S. Open while knocking around a Whiffle ball.
	   And when he becomes the first person to ride a cart in a U.S.
Open he will represent all those who overcame great odds to live a
dream.
	   But to think of Martin merely as a role model for the disabled
is to do him a disservice. He is _ perhaps above all else _ a
golfer and a competitor who can rise to the occasion.
	   Twice this year Martin has played his best when it meant the
most.
	   The first time was in the opening event of the year on the Nike
Tour. Riding in a cart because of a temporary court order and while
anticipating the upcoming trial in his suit against the PGA Tour,
Martin won the Lakeland Classic.
	   ``A total weight has been lifted,'' Martin said at the time.
``All the stuff about the court and all the talk about me playing
in a cart, it weighs on you emotionally. Just to win is an amazing
relief.''
	   Martin went on to win that case against the PGA Tour _ a
decision under appeal _ and then was overwhelmed with offers for
public appearances and endorsements.
	   As happens with many players, he found that success creates
demands on one's time, making top-level golf difficult.
	   After winning his first start out of the blocks, Martin missed
the cut in three of his next five tournaments, and in 10
consecutive events he shot only one round below 68 and never
finished in the top 10.
	   ``I'm wearing down, there's no question,'' Martin, 25, said in
early May.
	   ``I'm getting a little more worn out every week,'' he said. ``If
it weren't for the carts, I wouldn't be able to play at all by
now.''
	   But as the U.S. Open neared _ the tournament he dreamed about in
all those imaginary rounds in his back yard _ Martin got his game
back. For a second time, he played his best when it meant the most.
	   He shot a 67 and a 64 last weekend at the Miami Valley Open in
Ohio, and his opening 67 in the U.S. Open qualifier put him in
position to be able to get into the playoff for the final spot.
	   ``I'm just kind of stunned,'' Martin said. ``I was so
disappointed after I finished (the 36th hole) that I kind of wrote
it off. I'm shocked that I'm here.''
	   Martin wouldn't have needed to endure the playoff if he had made
only a bogey on the 36th hole.
	   ``On the last hole, I just hit six bad shots, took a double and
was crushed,'' he said.
	   That he was able to rally after that miserable hole was
testimony of his competitive nature.
	   In a large sense, it was that competitive nature that led to his
suit against the PGA Tour. A circulatory defect in his right leg
was not about to stop him from being a professional golfer.
	   ``I realized if I win, that would open the way,'' Martin said
after the trial in Eugene, Oregon. ``That's something to feel good
about. I'd like to be a role model. Hopefully, I'll do a good
job.''

Pakistan hangs man found guilty of spying

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A man Pakistan says was spying for
its hostile neighbor India was hanged Tuesday in eastern Punjab
province, the state-run news agency said.
	   Bilbeer Singh, an Indian national, was arrested in 1989 on
charges of spying and was found guilty in 1991 and sentenced to
death.
	   Singh was charged with stealing documents about Pakistan's
nuclear installations near the federal capital of Islamabad and
with acquiring information on Pakistani army positions in the
disputed state of Kashmir.
	   Last month both countries detonated nuclear devices and declared
themselves nuclear states.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian was shot and killed
Tuesday by Israeli troops who spotted him and several others trying
to infiltrate a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip, the army said.
	   Military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
Palestinian was not armed. An Israeli army statement said an
explosive device was found where the suspects were standing near
the Morag settlement.
	   A statement from the Israeli army spokesman said Israeli
soldiers patrolling near the settlement spotted ``a number of
suspicions persons who tried to enter the Morag settlement. Israeli
forces ... opened fire towards the suspects, as a result one
suspect was killed.''
	   The army said the discovery of the explosive device led them to
believe that an attack on Israeli patrols or civilians living in
the area was planned.
	   Palestinian police Commander Khaled Abu Oleh said incident took
place around 23:30 (20:30gmt). He said the dead Palestinian had
been taken to Nasser hospital in the Palestinian-controlled Khan
Yunis refugee camp about 15 km (9 miles) south of Morag. Oleh said
a joint Israeli-Palestinian investigation into the incident was
underway.
	   Officials at Nasser hospital later identified the dead man as
Abud Qanan, a 22 year-old from the Khan Yunis.
	   Most of the Gaza Strip is under Palestinian control while Israel
maintains control of the areas around Jewish settlements and Gaza's
borders with Israel and Egypt.

Police fire at Haitian refugee sloop; 30 believe drowned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAYMOND HAINEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Authorities in the British Turks and
Caicos Islands fired at a sloop jammed with 100 Haitian boat
people, capsizing it and perhaps drowning as many as 30 people,
according to reports Tuesday.
	   John Kelley, deputy governor of the archipelago, said in a
telephone interview that there were claims the police hit the boat
when they tried to shoot warning shots over its bow on Monday.
	   The sloop flipped over and catapulted its passengers into the
ocean.
	   The bodies of six drowned Haitians were recovered Monday, and
rescuers searched Tuesday without success for 24 missing people,
Kelley said.
	   Kelley said that firing warning shots was a routine way to stop
suspect boats and capture some of the thousands of Haitians who try
to reach the Turks and Caicos illegally each year.
	   But he added, ``There is no evidence that the police officers'
shots hit the boat, and the six dead did not suffer bullet
wounds.''
	   He said they had asked Bermuda, another British territory, to
send Creole-speaking police to help interview the 70 survivors and
to investigate the charges that police bullets hit the vessel.
	   If true, the incident could be the worst ever caused by
authorities fighting to stem illegal immigration in the Caribbean.
The Turks and Caicos Islands, located between Cuba and the Bahamas,
are a popular tourist destination.
	   Investigators were expected to raise the sunken vessel to
examine it for bullet holes.
	   ``What the police try and do is to get aboard a boat and try and
see if it's carrying illegal migrants. If it is, it's escorted into
port and the illegals are flown back to Haiti,'' Kelley said.
	   It's not known how many Haitians flee their poverty-plagued
island and make the journey north to Providenciales, the most
populated of the Turks and Caicos islands, which have about 15,000
citizens. In 1996, the local government estimated Providenciales
had 7,000 legal residents _ including 1,000 Haitians with work or
residence permits _ and 6,000 illegal Haitians.

Notes, quotes and news from the world of golf
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON SIRAK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even though Augusta National Golf Club proved
once again this year that it was a match for the best golfers in
the world, several holes will be redesigned to make the course play
harder.
	   Despite coming barely a year after Tiger Woods set the Masters
record of 18-under-par, Augusta National's new chairman, William
``Hootie'' Johnson, said the tournament committee did not feel
pressured into making changes.
	   ``These changes come only after several years of study,''
Johnson said Tuesday. But he did say that concerns over how far
players are hitting the ball was a factor in the decision to alter
the famed layout.
	   ``I'd have to say yes, that would be one of the
considerations,'' he said. ``I would also have to point out that in
the history of the club we've made about 75 changes. But yes, part
of our reasoning is that these young men are hitting the ball a lot
longer.''
	   The 555-yard (505-meter) par-5 second hole will be made 25 yards
(23 meters) longer, bringing the fairway bunker back into play. For
years now, even moderately long hitters have been able to blow the
ball over that bunker.
	   No. 15, a 500-yard (455-meter) par-5 that Tiger Woods has hit
wedge into for his second shot, will have the mounds on the right
side of the fairway cut down 80-85 percent and several new clusters
of pines will be added requiring more accuracy off the tee.
	   Long hitters like Woods have used the mounds on the right side
as a virtual bankboard to send their tee shots bounding farther
down the fairway.
	   The 17th hole will be made about 15 yards (14 meters) longer and
the same clusters of pine trees placed between the 15th and 17th
fairway will come into play.
	   ``The changes on 2, 15 and 17 will require greater accuracy off
the tee,'' Johnson said.
	   A flood control project around the lake at No. 11 will result in
the 11th green being raised by 2 feet and Johnson said that would
give officials several more pin placements on the green.
	   ``I think that these changes that we've made will hold up for
the foreseeable future,'' Johnson said. ``We are comfortable with
our golf course. The record that Tiger broke stood for 32 years. We
think we have a pretty challenging golf course.''
	   Johnson said work on the changes, which he said is likely the
most done in any one year at Augusta National, was already under
way and would be completed by mid-October.
	   While the course has remained listed at 6,925 yards (6,302
meters) despite changes in the past, Johnson said he would like to
have the course remeasured this year.
	   On another matter, Johnson said that Casey Martin would be
invited to the Masters if he did something to qualify, such as
finishing in the top 16 of the U.S. Open.
	   ``We'd be pleased to have Casey participate in our tournament
and if the court ruling is that Casey ride in a cart we would be
more than pleased to accommodate him.''
	   Johnson was elected the fifth chairman of Augusta National Golf
Club on May 1 and began his term on May 19. He has been a member of
Augusta National since 1968.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GATOR GOOF: &LR;  Florida golf coach Buddy Alexander disqualified
himself from the U.S. Open sectional in Orlando after realizing he
had played the wrong ball for two holes.
	   The mistake was understandable. In fact, it couldn't have
happened to anyone but Alexander.
	   He hit his drive into the right rough on the par-5 16th at Bay
Hill Club and found what he thought was his ball _ a Titleist 3
with a Gators logo.
	   Only on the 17th green did Alexander see two small pencil marks
on the ball and realize it wasn't his. The ball actually belonged
to one of his players, Steve Scott, who had hit into the same area
about 90 minutes earlier and never found his ball.
	   ``I've never been DQ'd for hitting the wrong ball,'' said
Alexander, a former U.S. Amateur champion. ``I signed for a wrong
score once, but never this.''
	   Had Alexander realized his error on the 16th green, he could
have assessed himself a two-stroke penalty. But once he started
another hole with the wrong ball, the only choice was
disqualification.
	   Alexander was 8-over through 16 holes.
	   Scott, runnerup to Tiger Woods in the 1996 U.S. Amateur, said he
thought his ball lodged in a tree. He failed to qualify after
rounds of 76 and 79.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BUICK CLASSIC: &LR;  The Buick Classic at Westchester Country Club
this week has an impressive field despite the fact that players
will have to fly across the country after the tournament for the
U.S. Open at The Olympic Club in San Francisco.
	   A globe-trotting foreign contingent including Lee Westwood, Ian
Woosnam and Jose Maria Olazabal joins two-time defending champion
Ernie Els, Nick Faldo, Davis Love III, Jim Furyk and Tom Lehman in
the field.

 &UR; Woodward lawyer says she resigned weeks before firing &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A former lawyer for Louise Woodward said Tuesday
she had told her fellow attorneys she wanted out of the
controversial case six weeks before the British au pair announced
she had fired her.
	   Elaine Whitfield Sharp told The Associated Press she gave her
resignation notice on April 20 because she ``wanted out.''
	   Ms. Whitfield Sharp, who was fired from the case last week,
declined to elaborate.
	   ``At this time, I will not talk,'' she said, indicating she may
provide details for her desire to quit the case.
	   Ms. Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder and then had
that jury finding reduced to manslaughter by a judge in the case in
which she was charged with the death of an 8-month-old baby in her
care. She is awaiting the result of appeals by both prosecutors and
the defense.
	   Ms. Whitfield Sharp said she sent an e-mail notice of
resignation to Ms. Woodward's three other attorneys, Barry Scheck,
Andrew Good and Harvey Silverglate, on April 20, and a letter by
certified mail on April 21.
	   After discussing her resignation plans with the other attorneys,
Ms. Whitfield Sharp said she agreed to wait until the state Supreme
Judicial Court makes its decision on appeals in the case. A
decision could come any day.
	   ``In deference to Louise, I didn't withdraw and decided to hold
off, but there was to be a mutual parting of the ways,'' Ms.
Whitfield Sharp said.
	   Reached by telephone at his office Tuesday, Silverglate would
not comment.
	   ``We're not answering any questions about Elaine Sharp ... not
now,'' he said.
	   In a scathing statement to the media June 1, Silverglate and his
partners said Ms. Whitfield Sharp had been fired by Ms. Woodward.
The lawyers described Ms. Whitfield Sharp as displaying ``an
aberrant pattern of behavior.''
	   The firing came after Ms. Whitfield Sharp allegedly told a state
trooper who arrested her for drunken driving that she now believes
Ms. Woodward is guilty.
	   Asked why she didn't disclose her intentions to resign last week
after her colleagues said she was fired, Ms. Whitfield Sharp
indicated the timing was inappropriate. She denied it was a case of
sour grapes.
	   ``I've been crucified,'' she said in her first public comments
since the firing.
	   The lawyer said she decided to make her resignation plans public
to correct false media reports that her relationship with the
Woodwards deteriorated after her May 22 arrest.
	   Ms. Whitfield Sharp's statements come one day after her husband,
Dan, accused Ms. Woodward's mother of forging a housing bill to
squeeze money out of the au pair's legal defense fund.
	   Susan and Gary Woodward stayed at the Sharps' Marblehead home
while their daughter was on trial for the death of 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen.
	   Ms. Woodward, 20, lived at the Sharps' for several months after
her second-degree murder conviction was overturned and she was
sentenced to the 279 days she had served in prison since her
arrest.
	   Dan Sharp said the Woodwards created a phony bill for dlrs
15,400 that purported to charge them for housing and living
expenses during their stay. The Sharps said they didn't charge the
Woodwards anything.
	   The relationship between the Woodwards and the Sharps seems to
have been deteriorating for months. The 20-year-old moved out of
the Sharp home more than two months ago.
	   Last month, a London tabloid, The Mirror, reported a taped phone
conversation in which Ms. Whitfield Sharp allegedly says Ms.
Woodward lied to her and negotiated secret book and newspaper deals
about the case.
	   Meanwhile Tuesday, trustees of the Louise Woodward Appeal Fund
rejected allegations that the former au pair's mother defrauded the
fund.
	   At an emergency meeting, the trustees said Ms. Woodward's
parents ``have always acted in an honest and straightforward
manner'' and unanimously pledged to continue to support the family.

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ Authorities in the British Turks and
Caicos Islands fired at a sloop jammed with 100 Haitian boat
people, capsizing it and perhaps drowning as many as 30 people,
according to reports Tuesday.
	   John Kelly, deputy governor of the archipelago, said in a
telephone interview that there were claims the police hit the boat
when they tried to shoot warning shots over its bow on Monday.
	   The sloop flipped over and catapulted its passengers into the
ocean.
	   The bodies of six drowned Haitians were recovered Monday, and
rescuers searched Tuesday without success for 24 missing people,
Kelly said.
	   Kelly said that firing warning shots was a routine way to stop
suspect boats and capture some of the thousands of Haitians who try
to reach the Turks and Caicos illegally each year.
	   But he added, ``There is no evidence that the police officers'
shots hit the boat, and the six dead did not suffer bullet
wounds.''
	   He said they had asked Bermuda, another British territory, to
send Creole-speaking police to help interview the 70 survivors and
to investigate the charges that police bullets hit the vessel.
	   If true, the incident could be the worst ever caused by
authorities fighting to stem illegal immigration in the Caribbean.
The Turks and Caicos Islands, located between Cuba and the Bahamas,
are a popular tourist destination.
	   Investigators were expected to raise the sunken vessel to
examine it for bullet holes.
	   ``What the police try and do is to get aboard a boat and try and
see if it's carrying illegal migrants. If it is, it's escorted into
port and the illegals are flown back to Haiti,'' Kelly said.
	   It's not, 11th graf

Rowdy soccer fans cause disturbances along Champs-Elysees

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Police used tear gas Tuesday to disperse inebriated
soccer fans who threw beer bottles and tried to knock down a
phalanx of policemen during festivities kicking off the World Cup.
	   Police gave an early count of 15 policemen slightly injured by
the bottle-throwing.
	   About a dozen people were arrested in several incidents on the
famed Champs-Elysees, which lasted about an hour.
	   In the earlier incidents, dozens of fans threw beer bottles at
the helmeted police, who responded by charging at them. The fans
dispersed.
	   But about an hour later, just after midnight, several hundred
people, led by young fans armed with security barriers as battering
rams, tried to break through a line of policemen on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   This time police charged them and used tear gas. The fans
quickly dispersed.
	   While the police were clashing with the youths, tourists and
passers-by, in the area to soak up the post-parade atmosphere,
snapped pictures or filmed them with minicams.

Cuba says U.S. embargo and certification harmful to fight against
</HEADLINE>
drugs &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Cuba said Tuesday the U.S. embargo was
harming its efforts to fight drug trafficking and rejected as
illegitimate the U.S. procedure of certifying countries as allies
in the drug war.
	   ``The developing world,'' said Justice Minister Roberto Diaz
Sotolongo, ``is where the flow of the resources required to
confront the challenge posed by this evil is most necessary.''
	   Speaking to a U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs,
Diaz Sotolongo said there was political will in Cuba to prevent
using Cuban territory for moving drugs.
	   Cuban authorities prevented 95 million doses of cocaine from
being consumed in other countries between 1994 and 1997, he said.
	   ``Cuba is carrying the battle forward in difficult economic
conditions, further aggravated by the presence and strengthening of
the unjust and unilateral blockade which has lasted for nearly 40
years,'' said Diaz Sotolongo, who is also president of the national
drug commission.
	   The U.S. embargo has been strengthened by legislation, known as
the Helms-Burton act, which seeks to punish foreign companies that
invest in the communist island.
	   Diaz Sotolongo said Cuba rejected U.S. certification policies
``for they are illegitimate and contrary to international law.''
	   The certification program requires the U.S. president to certify
annually whether countries that feed illegal drug markets in the
United States are cooperating in anti-drug efforts. Countries that
fail certification are denied aid, unless the president waives
penalties in the national interest.
	   Cuba doesn't receive any federal U.S. aid, but it is not alone
in its condemnation of the policy.
	   On Tuesday, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Medrazo denounced the
procedure, saying Mexico didn't accept judgement of its efforts
``not from the United States or any other country.''
	   While some U.S. officials have defended it, the administration's
chief anti-drug official, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, has
criticized the certification process as building resentment in
Mexico and impairing anti-narcotics cooperation between the two
countries.

Dykstra says he won't play anymore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Philadelphia Phillies center fielder Lenny
Dykstra, citing the back problems that have kept him out of the
lineup for the last 1{ years, said Tuesday he won't play baseball
again.
	   ``I'm done,'' Dykstra said during an interview on ESPN. ``I
can't play again. I'm not physically able to play again.''
	   Dykstra stopped short of declaring he is retired, saying that
such an announcement would probably follow the season. An earlier
announcement would void the dlrs 5.5 million contract he is playing
under this year.
	   Dykstra, 35, had been diagnosed with spinal stenosis, a
congenital condition that narrows the opening where nerves go
through the spinal canal, causing pain when the nerves rub against
the passageway.
	   He had surgery to help fix the condition in July 1996 and after
an arduous rehabilitation, attempted a comeback this spring. On
March 17, Dykstra, who had only two hits in 21 at-bats (.095) this
spring, announced the pain in his back had returned and that he was
putting his comeback on hold.
	   ``I think all the years of grinding it out and just playing the
game the way it's supposed to be played has taken its toll,'' said
Dykstra, whose playing style earned him the nickname ``Nails.''
	   ``I probably could have faked them out this year and suffered
and been a part-time player, a pinch hitter, and that's not how I
want people to remember Lenny Dykstra,'' he said.
	   Dykstra has a career batting average of .285 in 12 major league
seasons with the Mets and Phillies. He was the colorful leadoff
hitter when the Phillies shocked baseball by going from last place
in 1992 to winning the National League pennant in 1993.

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ An explosion from a severed gas line destroyed a
center for homeless people in Montreal on Tuesday, killing two
volunteer workers and injuring about 20 people, authorities said.
	   The explosion sheared off a wall of the three-story stone
building, spilling rubble into the street in historic Old Montreal.
	   Firefighters accompanied by tracking dogs searched through the
debris, unsure if anyone was trapped underneath.
	   The two people killed were identified as women in their 60s, one
of them a nun, who had worked as volunteers at the shelter for a
number of years.
	   The city gas company, Gaz Metropolitain, said a private
contractor ruptured a gas pipe while trying to adjust a meter.
	   No one lived in the Accueil Bonneau shelter _ it was used to
provide meals and shelter for homeless people during the day.
	   Authorities initially reported that about 30 people were
injured, but lowered the figure after determining that some people
were counted more than once in the confusion.
	   The explosion damaged several adjacent buildings and some tour
buses, which were parked near the shelter in a popular tourist
area.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ With Cuba expressing concern about a recent U.S.
pact with Europe, Italy's foreign minister met Tuesday with Cuban
officials to express interest in continuing ties with the communist
island.
	   Lamberto Dini, who arrived Monday, was making the first visit by
a European Community foreign minister since the United States
imposed a tougher new version of its Cuba embargo in March 1996.
	   Cuban foreign minister Roberto Robaina, who met Dini on Tuesday,
said Monday that he was confident Europe continues to oppose the
U.S. law known as the Helms-Burton Act, which authorizes U.S.
sanctions against international companies that deal with Cuba.
	   President Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials have expressed
concern about an agreement announced last month by European and
U.S. officials to ease the impact of the law on European companies.
	   Under the agreement, European companies agreed to discourage
investment in expropriated U.S. properties in Cuba, while the
United States said it would not take legal action against European
companies that now use such property.
	   Dini expressed interest in the economic development of Cuba.
There is about dlrs 200 million in yearly trade between the two
countries and Italy is a major source of tourists for the island.

Officials: rights groups ``ganging up'' on Caribbean over death
</HEADLINE>
penalty &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Human rights groups are ``ganging up''
on Caribbean nations to force them to abandon the death penalty,
local justice ministers complained during a forum in Guyana.
	   They urged each other to openly oppose pressure by the United
Nations Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International, Caribbean
Rights and Human Rights Watch to curb their use of capital
punishment.
	   ``This is a fundamental issue that we must address because we
have a number of international organizations ganging up against
us,'' Radford Hill, Antigua's legal affairs and justice minister
said during the meeting last week. ``The better thing to do is for
us to come up with a harmonized approach to the issue. There is
strength in numbers.''
	   Britain has been pressuring many of its former colonies in the
Caribbean to abandon the death penalty, and the efforts have drawn
support from many human rights groups.
	   Caribbean countries counter that they need capital punishment to
deter murders related to drug trafficking, a problem they claim
other countries do not fully appreciate.
	   During the meeting, Guyanese Attorney General Charles Ramson
said the U.N. committee ``is insensitive to the normative behavior
and conditions'' in Guyana and other countries. Eliminating capital
punishment ``would have far-reaching negative effects and would
affect the safety of citizens,'' he said.
	   Representatives from Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana and
the Bahamas accused European countries of trying to impose their
culture on the Caribbean. Together, those four countries have more
than 130 people on death row.
	   Jamaica withdrew in October from a U.N. panel that hears death
row convicts' appeals, claiming the appeals were delaying
executions. Ramson has said Guyana will simply ignore the U.N.
panel's recommendations.
	   Trinidad and Tobago withdrew from the 1969 American Convention
on Human Rights, a human rights accord enforced by the Organization
of American States, on May 26. It accused the organization of
dragging its feet on death penalty appeals.
	   The move drew quick criticism from Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Police used tear gas to disperse inebriated soccer
fans who threw beer bottles and tried to knock down a phalanx of
policemen during festivities kicking off the World Cup.
	   Police gave an early count of 15 policemen slightly injured by
the bottle-throwing late Tuesday and early Wednesday.
	   About a dozen people were arrested in several incidents on the
famed Champs-Elysees, which lasted about an hour and a half.
	   The incidents marred the festive atmosphere of the meticulously
planned pre-World Cup events. Four 60-foot-tall robots made their
way through the city to the Place de la Concorde, where tens of
thousands watched a spectacle involving acrobats and dancers in
fanciful costumes.
	   The World Cup begins on Wednesday, and thousands of fans have
been pouring into Paris.
	   At about 10:30 p.m. (2030 GMT), dozens of fans threw beer
bottles at the helmeted police, who responded by charging at them.
The fans dispersed. The incident was repeated several times.
	   About an hour later, just after midnight, several hundred
people, led by young fans armed with security barriers as battering
rams, tried to break through a line of policemen on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   This time police charged them and used tear gas. The fans
quickly dispersed.

Cuba says U.S. embargo, certification as harmful to fight against
</HEADLINE>
drugs &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Cuba said Tuesday the U.S. embargo was
harming its efforts to fight drug trafficking and rejected as
illegitimate the U.S. procedure of certifying countries as allies
in the drug war.
	   ``The developing world,'' said Justice Minister Roberto Diaz
Sotolongo, ``is where the flow of the resources required to
confront the challenge posed by this evil is most necessary.''
	   Speaking to a U.N. General Assembly special session on drugs,
Diaz Sotolongo said there was political will in Cuba to prevent
using Cuban territory for moving drugs.
	   Cuban authorities prevented 95 million doses of cocaine from
being consumed in other countries between 1994 and 1997, he said.
	   ``Cuba is carrying the battle forward in difficult economic
conditions, further aggravated by the presence and strengthening of
the unjust and unilateral blockade which has lasted for nearly 40
years,'' said Diaz Sotolongo, who is also president of the national
drug commission.
	   The U.S. embargo has been strengthened by legislation, known as
the Helms-Burton act, which seeks to punish foreign companies that
invest in the communist island.
	   Diaz Sotolongo said Cuba rejected U.S. certification policies
``for they are illegitimate and contrary to international law.''
	   The certification program requires the U.S. president to certify
annually whether countries that feed illegal drug markets in the
United States are cooperating in anti-drug efforts. Countries that
fail certification are denied aid, unless the president waives
penalties in the national interest.
	   Cuba doesn't receive any federal U.S. aid, but it is not alone
in its condemnation of the policy.
	   On Tuesday, Mexican Attorney General Jorge Medrazo denounced the
procedure, saying Mexico didn't accept judgement of its efforts
``not from the United States or any other country.''
	   While some U.S. officials have defended it, the administration's
chief anti-drug official, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, has
criticized the certification process as building resentment in
Mexico and impairing anti-narcotics cooperation between the two
countries.

Africans praise Abacha the man, scorn the policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs with Mandela comments at OAU summit. &QL; 
 &UR; By AMBA DADSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ African leaders, diplomats and
dignitaries on Tuesday ignored late Sani Abacha's harsh domestic
politics, opting instead to praise the man who defended democracy
abroad while squelching liberty at home.
	   From the Ivory Coast to South Africa, carefully worded tributes
marked Abacha's death _ tributes that also carried a message
calling for change in Nigeria.
	   ``He was quick to recognize that prosperity in the region
depends on the capacity of countries in West Africa to foster peace
and stability,'' Ghana's Vice President John Atta Mills said.
	   At home Abacha crushed dissent, jailed opponents and refused his
people freedom and democracy.
	   But elsewhere in West Africa, Abacha's soldiers were ironically
welcomed by villagers as champions of democracy as they drove out
villains and despots to help restore elected governments.
	   At a meeting of Africa's top political body, the Organization of
African Unity, South African President Nelson Mandela paid tribute
to Abacha, his former political enemy.
	   Mandela, 79, who is serving his last term as president, told
reporters in brief impromptu remarks that Abacha's death was a
great loss for Nigeria and Africa.
	   The South African leader later flew out of Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, officials said, ending Mandela's farewell appearance at the
OAU summit before retiring from politics next year.
	   The conciliatory remarks came despite persistent tensions
between Nigeria and South Africa under the rule of Abacha and
Mandela.
	   Relations chilled between the two countries after Mandela called
for Commonwealth sanctions against Nigeria in retaliation for the
military execution of environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight fellow activists in 1995.

Rodman out of wresting ring and back at practice

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ For one more wacky day, the National Basketball
Association Finals turned into something resembling Rodmania.
	   Dennis Rodman found the time to attend practice Tuesday, but
gave no explanation for his actions Monday when he blew it off and
took part in a pro wrestling match in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
	   ``Dennis, in case you haven't noticed, is a little different
than the rest of us,'' teammate Steve Kerr said. ``He lives by a
different set of rules. Some guys might not be happy about it, but
ultimately he comes to play. He's going to be ready tomorrow
night.''
	   Rodman's teammates were left to do most of the explaining on the
eve of Game 4 after the Worm bolted out the door the moment
practice ended. He escaped another dlrs 10,000 fine from the league
by agreeing to answer questions from an NBA employee who, unlike
reporters, had access to the Bulls' locker room.
	   Actually, another dlrs 10,000 fine wouldn't have caused much
financial difficulty for Rodman. He was paid dlrs 250,000 for his
appearance on the wresting telecast, where he didn't actually
wrestle anyone but did hit Diamond Dallas Page over the head with a
chair.
	   A photo of Rodman and the wrestler Hulk Hogan appeared on the
back page of one Chicago newspaper under the headline ``Rodzilla.''
	   ``My kid came up and said, `Dennis is on TV,' '' Ron Harper
said. ``I liked it when he got the chair and hit the guy. Give me a
chair.''
	   Most of the Bulls found humor in the doings of Dennis. It seemed
he was the only thing people wanted to talk about during a second
straight off-day.
	   As a result, there was little discussion of the Jazz's
record-low 54-point output in Game 3 when the Bulls took a 2-1 lead
in the best-of-7 series.
	   The most prolific purveyor of Rodman-speak was Chicago coach
Phil Jackson, whose main concern was whether Rodman had actually
wrestled someone _ which would be a violation of the NBA player
contract.
	   ``Dennis fits well in that (wrestling) world. I think it's great
for him to have that, and I hope it's a career for him in the
future if that's where he wants to go.''
	   ``He didn't walk away from us,'' Jackson said. ``I'm sure it was
a planned occasion. They had a chartered jet for him and it was a
whole big thing. It wasn't that Dennis missed practice to do
something else. Dennis just couldn't make it.''
	   The fact that the Bulls could accept Rodman's absence and shrug
it off seemed to mystify the Jazz, whose practice is so regimented
that coach Jerry Sloan has been known to whistle everything to a
halt if he spots a player with his shirt untucked.
	   ``I couldn't coach him if he didn't come to practice,'' Sloan
said. ``We couldn't go in the other direction where there's no
discipline and no respect. Those things will always be important to
me.''
	   Rodman has been coming off the bench for the Bulls since the
Eastern Conference finals, and his production in this series has
been off _ no points and 10 rebounds in Game 1, three points and
nine rebounds in Game 2, two points and six rebounds in Game 3.

Former military junta leader is arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A member of the military junta
that ruled for seven years was arrested Tuesday on kidnapping
charges linked to Argentina's ``dirty war,'' officials and news
reports said.
	   Former president and commander-in-chief Jorge Rafael Videla, who
took power in a 1976, was detained on orders by a federal judge,
said Interior Minister Carlos Corach.
	   According to local news reports, the 71-year-old Videla was
arrested on charges of child kidnapping, in a case brought by
children whose parents ``disappeared'' during the military regime.
	   As the chief of the military, Videla presided over death squads
that waged a ``dirty war'' of torture and murder against political
opponents, mainly leftists from 1976-1983.
	   The Argentine government claims 9,000 people disappeared during
that time, but human rights groups put the figure at 30,000.
	   The Army chief was sentenced to life in prison in 1986 for human
rights abuses that occurred during the dictatorship. He served
several years before he was pardoned.
	   In 1990, Videla, along with all middle and senior-ranking
officers, was pardoned as part of a decree by President Carlos
Menem.

Police use tear gas to disperse bottle-throwing fans

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Police used tear gas to disperse drunken soccer
fans who threw beer bottles and tried to knock down a phalanx of
policemen during festivities kicking off the World Cup.
	   Police gave an early count of 15 policemen slightly injured by
the bottle-throwing late Tuesday and early Wednesday.
	   About a dozen people were arrested in several incidents on the
famed Champs-Elysees, which lasted about an hour and a half.
	   The incidents marred the festive atmosphere of the meticulously
planned pre-World Cup events. Four 60-foot-tall robots made their
way through the city to the Place de la Concorde, where tens of
thousands watched a spectacle involving acrobats and dancers in
fanciful costumes.
	   The World Cup begins on Wednesday, and thousands of fans have
been pouring into Paris.
	   At about 10:30 p.m. (2030 GMT), dozens of fans threw beer
bottles at the helmeted police, who responded by charging at them.
The fans dispersed. The incident was repeated several times.
	   About an hour later, just after midnight, several hundred
people, led by young fans armed with security barriers as battering
rams, tried to break through a line of policemen on the
Champs-Elysees.
	   This time police charged them and used tear gas. The fans
quickly dispersed.
	   While the police were clashing with the youths, tourists and
passers-by, in the area to soak up the post-parade atmosphere,
snapped pictures or filmed them with minicams.

Ron Wilson: from hockey stick to slapstick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Pies in the face. One-liners. Motivational talks.
Washington Capitals coach Ron Wilson does it all.
	   ``He just brings a very funny attitude, (turns) different things
into jokes and makes the guys laugh about it,'' Capitals center Joe
Juneau says. ``Some guys might get mad about comments made about
them on TV or in the paper, and he's got the ability to twist that
around so everybody laughs at it.''
	   Wilson started the tradition of hitting people in the face with
pies on their birthday. That included Wilson himself, when one of
the players socked him with a whipped cream pie.
	   ``He got his turn,'' left wing Chris Simon said.
	   Wilson says his locker-room material is usually spontaneous,
even the ``win one for the Gipper'' talks. Recently, he motivated
his team by telling them that reaching the finals would be like the
Apollo 11 astronauts reaching the moon.
	   ``I don't stay up all night (thinking about what to say),'' he
says.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GREAT SCOTT: &LR;  What makes Scotty Bowman such a great coach?
Detroit Red Wings forward Brendan Shanahan says Bowman has the
ability to read a game and make a change in the middle.
	   ``He has 10 incredible hockey senses,'' Shanahan says.
	   As the winner of seven Stanley Cups, Bowman also has the
attention of all the players.
	   ``The big thing, as a team, is that we all believe in him,''
Shanahan says. ``So regardless of what our game plan is, he has got
20 guys going out and not questioning (his authority). I think that
is the strength of our team.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE: &LR;  President Clinton was a good-luck charm
for the Washington Capitals when he came out for a game in the
playoffs. The Capitals beat the Buffalo Sabres 3-2 in overtime at
the MCI Center in the Eastern Conference finals.
	   Accompanied by Vice President Al Gore, Clinton became the first
sitting president to attend an NHL game. The Capitals return to
Washington for Games 3 and 4.
	   ``That was a step to have the president come to a game,''
Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig said. ``And hopefully he comes out now
when we go back to Washington.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DEFENSE FIRST: &LR;  Detroit's Steve Yzerman scored 24 goals this
season _ for him a big year under Scotty Bowman.
	   When Bowman became coach of the Red Wings in 1993, he stressed a
defensive system. That meant the end of 60-goal seasons for
Yzerman, who scored 65 in 1988-89 and 62 in 1989-90.
	   Yzerman's last big goal-scoring season was 1992-93 _ the year
before Bowman arrived _ when he had 58. The following season he
dropped to 24.
	   After scoring 465 goals in 10 seasons with the Red Wings,
Yzerman has only 118 in five under Bowman.
	   Asked if he missed those high-scoring years, Yzerman said:
``They were really so long ago, I don't remember them.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TITLE HUNTING: &LR;  The Capitals want to win the Stanley Cup as
much for Dale Hunter as they do for themselves. The center has
played more than 1,500 games in his 18 years in the National Hockey
League and this is his first trip to the Stanley Cup finals.
	   ``I say he is almost like our John Elway,'' said Phil Housley,
referring to the Denver quarterback who finally won the Super Bowl
after years of trying.
	   ``(Hunter) has been playing such a long time, and he cares a lot
for the game. Like myself, I think I wouldn't have anything without
playing hockey. We sure would like to see him hoisting the Cup. It
would be a great end to his career.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SAME TIME, DIFFERENT TEAM: &LR;  Ron Wilson's timetable for reaching
the Stanley Cup finals is right on schedule, although he never
figured it would be with the Washington Capitals.
	   ``In Anaheim, we said our goal was to get to the finals in five
years,'' he said. ``In five years I'm here, but with a different
team.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOME AWAY FROM HOME: &LR;  The Detroit Red Wings may be playing at
home, but they're not living there during the Stanley Cup finals.
The players spent Monday night in a hotel to get away from family
distractions and bond as a team.
	   The Red Wings did that last year when they won the Stanley Cup
for the first time in 42 years. Kris Draper said the Red Wings
``just relaxed and got a good night's sleep.''

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Luciano Pavarotti and the Spice Girls,
French cops on rollerblades, Britain's Queen Mother, Japan's
tabloids and a memorial service for Linda McCartney. Some items may
also have moved as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MODENA, Italy (AP) _ The newest Spice is ... Luciano Pavarotti?
	   The Ginger-less Spice Girls teamed up Tuesday with the famed
tenor for their first performance since announcing their split last
week.
	   The charity song-fest, ``Pavarotti and Friends,'' was directed
by Spike Lee and co-starred pop performers Celine Dion and Stevie
Wonder. Proceeds were to benefit poor children in the West African
nation of Liberia.
	   The four Spices and Pavarotti joined forces for the song ``Viva
Forever,'' their first performance since the departure of Ginger
Spice, Geri Halliwell.
	   The 62-year-old Pavarotti has been making fewer opera
appearances in recent years, but his pop career is on the upswing.
Tuesday's show in this northern city was broadcast live on Italy's
flagship state television station, RAI-1.
	   Also on the program were Vanessa Williams, Natalie Cole, Jon Bon
Jovi, Trisha Yearwood and Italian stars Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero
and Pino Daniele.
	   At a news conference, Lee was asked whether the all-girl group
would be as good without Ms. Halliwell.
	   ``I'm not an expert on the Spice Girls, so I don't know if I can
answer that,'' he answered.
	   The other Spice Girls declined to discussed the split.
	   ___
	   PARIS (AP) _ French cops on rollerblades made their first
appearance Tuesday on Paris streets, only hours before World Cup
festivities kicked off with a parade down the Champs-Elysees.
	   Clad in helmets, kneepads and windbreakers, an eight-man brigade
skated through Paris, which is being invaded by thousands of soccer
fans.
	   The special squad _ expected to grow to 30 in the next few weeks
_ was picked on the basis of skating ability, and trained by a top
French speed skater.
	   The idea was actually developed before the World Cup, to help
keep order on weekends. On weekend evenings, some 5,000 Parisians
gather at the Place d'Italie before skating through the city.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the
brigade was not a publicity stunt, but was designed to allow police
to intervene ``with more flexibility'' on the sidewalks.
	   Several U.S., Canadian and Dutch cities have experimented with
cops on rollerblades.
	   ___
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ The Queen Mother, undaunted by her 97
years and hip surgery less than five months ago, inaugurated a new
rowing boat at Cambridge University on Tuesday, but skipped the
usual champagne launch.
	   At Queens' College, the women's rowing team and sundry VIPs
gathered on the lawn to watch the mother of Queen Elizabeth II
unveil the boat's name _ the Patroness.
	   It was the 50th anniversary of her becoming the college's
patroness, and the 550th anniversary of the college's foundation.
	   The traditional breaking of a bottle on a new ship would damage
a glass fiber boat. So, after the Queen Mother left to have lunch,
the rowers held another brief ceremony to pour a glass of champagne
over the top of the boat for good luck.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Accusing Japan's ribald tabloids of going too far,
police said Tuesday they issued warnings to two newspapers for
publishing pornographic photos.
	   The warnings, made separately in recent months, were the first
in decades in which police took exception to material published in
Japan's often risque daily tabloids.
	   On March 9, Tokyo Sports published a photo downloaded from the
Internet showing female nudes that _ according to police _ were
insufficiently blurry.
	   Two months later, Nikkan Gendai printed a color photo of a
couple having sex _ again, only slightly blurry.
	   Neither paper will be charged with any crime because both
publishers pledged not to release such photographs again, the Tokyo
police said.
	   ``But we will not stop publishing sex-related materials,'' said
Yasuo Sakurai, chief editor of Tokyo Sports. ``Sex is a universal
interest of human beings, and we believe many readers like to read
what we publish.''
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ A day after an emotional memorial service for
Linda McCartney in London in which 700 guests sang the Beatles song
``Let It Be,'' Paul McCartney announced Tuesday that a second
service would be held later this month in New York City.
	   The former Beatle said he and the couple's children would attend
the June 22 service, at New York's Riverside Church.
	   The entire McCartney family has been surprised and touched by
the outpouring of support from fans and fellow animal lovers over
the past few weeks, he said in a statement. Mrs. McCartney was a
staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism.
	   After the service in London, at St. Martins-in-the-Fields
Church, McCartney thanked the hundreds who paid tribute to his
wife's memory, saying, `The kids and I thank them all for coming.
Although Linda's not here, she's in our hearts and her spirit and
her message will live on forever.''

Report: Insurer to form Japan's biggest asset management firm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. plans to form Japan's
largest asset management company early next year, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Sumitomo will create a subsidiary out of an affilated company
that will manage some 10 trillion yen (dlrs 71 billion) in assets,
the Asahi newspaper reported.
	   That would be more than twice as large as Japan's biggest
existing asset management company, the paper said.
	   Sumitomo is one of Japan's top insurers.
	   The new company will establish offices in New York, London, Hong
Kong and Singapore and hire about 30 asset management experts from
overseas companies, the Asahi report said.
	   The new company will be launched in January after a revision in
the country's insurance law allowing subsidiaries goes into effect
in December, it said.
	   Banks and other financial institutions are scrambling to form
new alliances with both domestic and overseas companies in line
with major reforms _ known collectively as the ``big bang'' _ aimed
at increasing competition in Japan's financial industry.

 &UR; Eds: Includes items on times of goals; Ronaldo's earring; Brits
shortage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It took only 94 years to do it, but the people who
run soccer have finally come up with a definite way to tell time
during a match.
	   For the first time at a World Cup, FIFA is introducing a
standardized system of timing goals, fouls and substitutions.
	   For decades, there have been two generally accepted ways of
marking such incidents.
	   For example, if Ronaldo had scored a goal 26 minutes, 15 seconds
into a match, some scorekeepers would say it came ``after 26
minutes'' and record it as ``Renaldo (26).''
	   Others would say it was ``in the 27th minute,'' writing it as
``Renaldo (27).'' FIFA says this is the system that will be used at
the World Cup.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Even the Brazilians are looking for more of an
edge.
	   Two-time FIFA Player of the Year Ronaldo probably doesn't need
it, but he's decided to wear an enamel earring, sent to him by a
female admirer, on his jersey as a good luck charm during Brazil's
World Cup games.
	   The shaven-headed 21-year-old megastar received the jewelry in
the mail, of which Ronaldo receives more than a 100 pieces a day _
most on the team.
	   The item still must meet FIFA approval. To wear on his jersey,
Ronaldo must present the amulet to the referee before the match,
who will have to decide whether it poses a safety threat.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than one in four men in Britain will take
time off from work to watch the World Cup, with some admitting they
are already planning to call in sick, according to a survey.
	   The survey of 1,200 people by the Institute of Personnel and
Development revealed that 28 percent of men and 8 percent of women
in England, Wales and Scotland plan to take time off work to watch
World Cup matches on TV.
	   Over half of those will take paid leave, one in four will take
advantage of flexible hours and 16 percent will take unpaid leave.
	   Around 3 percent admit they will take a sick day to watch games.
	   Some employers are taking steps to allow their staff to follow
the action.
	   At the Cadbury's Factory in Bourneville, near Birmingham, live
radio coverage will be piped in for the 4,000 employees to keep up
to date.
	   In Scotland, shifts have been changed and television screens are
being brought into some offices.
	   Production at the Coca-Cola and Schweppes plant in East Kilbride
will be stopped during each of Scotland's first round games against
Brazil, Norway and Morocco.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Not surprisingly, the money is pouring in for the
World Cup favorites at bookmakers in England.
	   One fan walked into a Coral betting shop and placed 20,000
pounds (dlrs 32,700) on the Netherlands to win it all.
	   ``He'll never need to go Dutch again if Bergkamp and Co. win the
World Cup,'' Coral spokesman Simon Clare said.
	   Even so, the Netherlands remained at 8-1 to win the tournament.
Brazil was the 3-1 favorite, followed by France at 6-1. Italy and
Germany were both 7-1, with England joining the Dutch at 8-1. Iran
was the distant outsider at 400-1.
	   Rival bookmaker Ladbrokes had similar odds, with defending
champion Brazil as 3-1 favorites and France at 11-2. Italy was
third at 6-1, and both Argentina and Germany were 7-1 picks.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France (AP) _ Attendance for Tuesday's
U.S. soccer scrimmage: 0.
	   The U.S. Soccer Federation barred reporters, fans and everyone
other than staff from Stade de Fetan in Trevoux for its 4-0 victory
over Gueugnon 4-0.
	   Why all the secrecy? After all, the stadium was open Monday in
Nice when Germany defeated a Cote d'Azure selection of young
professionals 2-1.
	   ``I want to have the ability to determine what I say after the
game, so I make the conclusions, not everyone else,'' U.S. coach
Steve Sampson said. ``If I open it to the American press, I have to
open it to all press. We all know there are certain connections in
the German press to the German national team coach.''
	   Brian McBride, Cobi Jones, Brian Maisonneuve and Ernie Stewart
scored for the Americans, who hadn't played a game since a
scoreless tie against Scotland on May 30 in Washington.
	   Each goalkeeper played 30 minutes, with Brad Friedel starting,
Kasey Keller following and Juergen Sommer finishing.
	   Marcelo Balboa (infected foot) and Chad Deering (ankle pain)
were the only players who didn't get in.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ To bring World Cup matches live to
soccer-crazed Haitians, the state electricity company plans to
boost power to the capital that suffers 12-hour-a-day blackouts.
	   It comes at a price, however. The Nouvelliste newspaper reported
Tuesday that residents are being asked to turn off their
refrigerators, air conditioners and electric water pumps during
soccer matches.
	   Haitians have adopted the teams of Argentina and Brazil, the
defending champions who open the World Cup finals in France on
Wednesday. While Haitians have started flying Argentine and
Brazilian flags from their homes and cars, they appear indifferent
to Jamaica, only the second Caribbean team to make it to the finals
since Haiti broke the barrier in 1974.
	   Tuesday's Nouvelliste quoted Electricity of Haiti officials as
saying that they would boost power to Port-au-Prince from 55 to 100
megawatts during the World Cup. Even that will not guarantee
unbroken coverage since they city needs 115 megawatts daily,
according to officials who appealed to residents to turn off other
electrical appliances.
	   Probably fewer than a third of Port-au-Prince's 2 million
residents own television sets.

7,000 barrels of diesel fuel spill into Caribbean Sea off Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
coast &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Seven thousand barrels of diesel fuel
spilled from a tanker into the Caribbean Sea, causing an ecological
crisis off the coast of Venezuela, officials said Tuesday.
	   The cause of Monday's spill in the Bay of Carenero, 100
kilometers (60 miles) east of the capital, Caracas, was not
immediately known. However, RCR radio reported that a hose sprung a
leak while transferring the fuel from the tanker to shore.
	   A diesel slick stretched 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) into the ocean,
and some of the fuel contaminated the shoreline, the state-run oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela said in a statement.
	   Workers were at the scene Tuesday trying to clean up the spill,
the statement said.
	   The affected area is a popular Venezuelan tourist destination
and home to a large number of mangrove plantations. Seven thousand
barrels is the equivalent of 1,059,884 liters (280,000 gallons) of
diesel.
	   ``We found out about the spill today,'' Alberto Colmenares, a
local representative for the Environment Ministry, told The
Associated Press Tuesday. ``They have not been able to contain all
of the fuel that was spilled.''
	   Petroleos de Venezuela uses a facility at the Bay of Carenero to
distribute diesel fuel to local markets inside Venezuela.

World Cup: Japanese believe relaxing is way to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AIX-LES-BAINS, France (AP) _ A mix of Hong Kong action films,
computer games and music appears to be working nerve-calming
wonders for the Japanese team.
	   The World Cup debutantes exuded relaxed confidence, often
laughing during practice Tuesday, the eve of the tournament's
opener. They even appeared to be enjoying themselves.
	   There isn't a hint of jitters or intimidation, although their
opener Sunday is against two-time World Cup winner Argentina.
	   So much for the longtime reputation of Japanese athletes as sure
failures under pressure, prone to performing well below their
abilities in international competition.
	   ``We're not doing anything all that different,'' said defender
Yutaka Akita, the picture of serenity. ``It's just that we happen
to be aiming for the World Cup.''
	   The players say there's no point in trying to be something they
can't be. The key, they say, is to stay cool and beat the mental
game so they can be at their very best.
	   ``If we've come this far, there's not much more we can do,''
said midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi, who sings tunes by Japanese pop
group Smap alone in his hotel room to let it all go. ``The main
point is to be brave so we can carry out everything we've worked
on.''
	   The team always travels with plenty of computer games and music
equipment to keep the players happy. The team chef has been
preparing rice, miso soup and other Japanese dishes.
	   Brazil-born striker Wagner Lopes listens to music and goes on
walks around this resort town on his free time.
	   Defender Akira Narahashi says he has no problems relaxing
because he has brought along his own TV set and personal collection
of Jackie Chan videos.
	   ``This is about time the players may be feeling nervous, a bit
frustrated,'' said coach Takeshi Okada, who has a reputation for
being in tune with the hidden inner workings of his players.
	   ``Personally, I don't think there's a single World Cup coach who
can say he's having fun,'' he told reporters with a wry smile.
	   Understandably, the players are excited.
	   ``Oh, I'm going to be so moved when they play the anthem,'' said
defender Eisuke Nakanishi.
	   Even the ever confident Akita, who says he is not at all worried
about Argentina, acknowledged he's thrilled Japan has finally
arrived at soccer's greatest tournament.
	   ``The World Cup has been my dream ever since I was a kid. It's
an honor just to be standing here,'' he said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A fantasy pageant to open the World Cup descended
into a drunken party that spilled across Paris in the early hours
of Wednesday, with police battling fans on the Champs-Elysees.
	   On Tuesday evening, crowds watched four 60-foot (18-meter)
robots depicting the world's races lumber into the Place de la
Concorde to meet around the ancient Egyptian Obelisk, done up as
the World Cup.
	   The spectacle ended in a swirl of color and sound, but the
gaiety was dampened by zealous security officers who forced crowds
behind a maze of barriers, often brusquely ignoring official
passes.
	   Near midnight, several hundred soccer fans of mixed nationality
began heaving bottles at the police. One group seized a metal
barrier and rammed it into a line of riot troops.
	   Police charged the fans, swinging batons and firing off tear
gas, chasing them up the broad avenue. At least a dozen were
arrested, and 15 policemen were treated for injuries.
	   In the heart of Paris, partying visitors jammed almost every
place that serves alcohol _ no small number in this town _ as they
waited for Wednesday's opening game between Brazil and Scotland.
	   Most seemed pretty relaxed, chanting their team's fight songs or
dancing impromptu sambas to Brazilian rhythms. Hundreds wore
football shirts emblazoned with ``Ronaldo,'' Brazil's star.
	   Brazil is favored, but not by the 20,000 Scots who crossed the
Channel for the opening game.
	   ``We'll win, 1-0, for certain,'' declared Eric Muirhead, in a
kilt and bare chest, as he wavered unsteadily at the edge of the
Place de la Concorde.
	   Neither he nor his friends seemed to notice the swarm of
costumed dancing figures: from bobbing baobab trees and women in
evening dress to silver creatures that looked like Ninja aardvarks.
	   Paris awoke on Tuesday to find the four giants _ an African, an
American Indian, an Asian and a European _ planted near their most
familiar monuments.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the robots took separate routes toward the Concorde.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show. ``The grand theme is universality in a
single world.''
	   Moussa, the African, was the first to stir in the evening, near
the Eiffel Tower, standing up and opening huge eyes to wild
applause.
	   He symbolized man in a new world, and he rose up to see dancing
odd-shaped baobab trees and termite hills. Six ostriches _ actually
men on stilts _ bobbed among women dressed as stylized giraffes.
	   ``Amazing,'' said Florence Farriaux, as she hurried her three
kids home so their father could take them to Concorde, where Moussa
would meet the three others. ``I loved it.''
	   On the Pont Neuf over the Seine, Ho, the Asian, stood up in a
fantasy world of balloons shaped like flying fish and dancers
dressed as tropical sea creatures.
	   Pablo, the Indian, rose from a crouch under the Arc de Triomphe
and strolled down the Champs-Elysees to see the animated trees,
snakes and bugs that depict nature.
	   Romeo, the European, had been snoozing outside the Opera
Garnier. His theme was love, and along his route he bowed to a
sculptor's conception of the Urban Woman, a mere 4.5 meters (15
feet) tall.
	   David Quill, a Scottish engineer who came for no-nonsense
football, found himself carried away by the spectacle. ``This
brings together the four worlds,'' he said. ``I really liked it.''
	   But another Scot, Eric Blackley, just shrugged. ``It's all
right, I suppose,'' he said. ``But it's not what I came here for.''

U.S. seeks Russian endorsement of strong measures against Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS; LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Yeltsin saying he will
meet with Milosevic himself, but rebuffing military action.
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is prepared to
talk to Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself, if necessary, to
get Moscow's support for tougher measures to stop the violent Serb
crackdown in Kosovo, senior U.S. officials say.
	   The Americans and Britons plan to ask the Security Council,
possibly next week, to authorize the use of force against the Serbs
to halt attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, diplomatic sources
said Tuesday.
	   Both they and the U.S. officials spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Bonn, Germany, Yeltsin pledged Tuesday to use his influence
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end police and army
attacks in Kosovo, but remained firmly opposed to any Western
military intervention.
	   Yeltsin said he would try to meet Milosevic in person, and made
clear he prefers friendly diplomacy over any military threats or
economic sanctions to resolve the conflict that has killed at least
250 people this year.
	   ``The more softly I speak the better the chances of a meeting,''
Yeltsin said at a news conference following two days of talks with
German officials. ``We will meet and discuss the question of how to
get out of this situation without getting into a big war.''
	   The Russian president said any military deployment in Kosovo
would be ``very dangerous'' and could spark a wider Balkan
conflict.
	   NATO defense ministers, who meet in Brussels on Thursday and
Friday, are expected to order NATO military commanders to draw up
plans for possible direct military intervention in Kosovo.
	   Such proposals could include a ``no-fly'' zone similar to one
imposed on Bosnia during the war there, or expanding the 750-member
U.N. peacekeeping force in nearby Macedonia. Nearly half that force
is American.
	   The Russians _ allies of the Serbs _ oppose NATO troops in the
area but have indicated they might support a more robust U.N. role.
That would require approval by the 15-member Security Council,
where the Russians have a permanent seat and veto power.
	   Diplomats said the Britons and the Americans are waiting to see
what NATO foreign ministers decide before circulating any draft
resolution.
	   In the past, however, strong council action on Kosovo and other
issues, notably Iraq, has been blocked by Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   To get Moscow's backing on Kosovo, the United States is trying
to show flexibility on other issues, including Iraq, in which
Moscow and Washington differ. The Americans have indicated they may
accept a scaling-back of U.N. inspections of Iraqi nuclear
facilities in the coming months.

Scotland dispenses with niceties; 18-meter monsters kick off World
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's easy to tell the opening kickoff of the World
Cup is getting closer _ the tone is getting more desperate.
	   ``We must go for the throat,'' Scotland's Gordon Durie said
Tuesday.
	   The 33-year-old striker and his teammates was expecting the
world to watch when Scotland takes the field against four-time and
defending champion Brazil in Wednesday's opening match of France
'98.
	   ``If we sit in and try and defend, they have players who can
destroy you,'' Durie said.
	   On the final day before the opener, World Cup activities
officially got underway Tuesday with a parade of four 18-meter
(60-foot) mechanical giants and 4,500 costumed extras through the
middle of Paris.
	   The Champs Elysees was awash with Brazilians in yellow,
Argentines in sky blue and Scots in all kinds of tartan kilts.
	   The FIFA presidential election, however, lingered a day more
than expected with Sepp Blatter, the winner, ``categorically''
denying rumors and reports that he bought the election.
	   ``Mr. Blatter vehemently refuted the allegations and said he
would investigate the source of such malicious reports,'' he said
through a FIFA release. ``He stressed that he reserved the right to
take legal action against those seeking to defame him.''
	   Rumors apparently were fed by a story in the International
Herald Tribune on Tuesday which quoted Johansson, the president of
UEFA, possibly indicating that Monday's vote wasn't fair.
	   ``Something happened somewhere,'' Johansson was quoted as
saying. ``I had so many promises of votes that I am, to put it
mildly, surprised and disappointed to be beaten so
comprehensively.''
	   Meanwhile, Brazil and Scotland, along with Morocco and Norway,
who were to play Wednesday night in the tournament's second match,
made final preparations for their debuts.
	   ``We must understand this moment,'' Brazilian midfielder
Leonardo said. ``I want to make history.''
	   Scotland was the team in position to create shockwaves, having
never advanced past the first round in eight trips to the finals
and won only four of 20 matches.
	   ``We have to lift ourselves to another level and show we can
compete against Brazil,'' said midfielder John Collins, who will
earn his 50th cap when the match kicks off at 5:30 p.m. (1530 GMT).
``We will need a superb performance that night as well as in the
other two games if we are to progress.''
	   The second Group A match of the day was a much-lower profile
affair, featuring two teams that both were bounced from the United
States after the first round in 1994.
	   However, the match was considered anything but a game between
equals.
	   Norway went into the match unbeaten in its last 14 games and
having outscored its last three opponents by a combined scored of
13-2. The ``Drillos'' are being picked by most experts to be the
second team that advances out of Group A with Brazil.
	   Morocco, conversely, will be a major surprise if it gets past
the first round.
	   It struggled to a 1-1 draw in its final prep match against Chile
on Thursday, allowing the equalizer in the 90th minute on a header
by Marcelo Salas.
	   To start it all, the French lived up to their artsy reputation
Tuesday with a ``Festival of Football'' through the streets of
Paris reminiscent of the opening ceremony for the 1992 Winter
Olympics in Albertville.
	   Ho, the Asian; Pablo, the American Indian; Romeo, the European;
and Moussa, the African, strode down the main avenues of Paris with
human-sized bugs and plants for escorts before meeting at Concorde
at the base of the Champs Elysees in a five-hour extravaganza.
	   Unlike the Olympics, soccer usually provides its own spontaneous
pageantry at matches, and is not accustomed to the scripted shows
more associated with the Summer and Winter Games.
	   It won over a few converts who came strictly for the matches.
	   ``This brings together the four worlds,'' Scottish engineer
David Quill said. ``I really liked it.''
	   Elsewhere, other teams still fretted about injuries.
	   Nigeria, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany all dealt with
various infirmities.
	   The Africans learned that starting defender Jero Shakpoke had
broken his collarbone and would be out for the tournament, and
forward Daniel Amokachi was felled by a twisted right knee.
	   Amokachi hurt himself about an hour into Tuesday's training
session when his foot got caught in the damp turf as he attempted a
shot. An assistant team trainer said it would Wednesday before the
extent of the injury was known.
	   Italy seemed to have good word on Alessandro Del Piero and
Moreno Torricelli, but Fabrizio Ravenelli, who was suffering from
fever and a cough, was taken for X-rays to determine if he had
bronchitis.
	   Dutch captain Ronald de Boer twisted his left ankle in training
Monday and didn't practice Tuesday. His status for the Netherlands'
opening World Cup Group E match Saturday against Belgium in St.
Denis was still to be determined.
	   And in the German camp, midfielder Christian Ziege missed his
third day of training with a fever and defender Thomas Helmer sat
out a second day with a thigh injury.

Author Richler in `stable condition' after kidney surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Novelist Mordecai Richler was reported in stable
condition after undergoing surgery at a Montreal hospital.
	   ``The doctors have said that the surgery went very well and he
is resting in stable condition,'' Montreal General Hospital
spokewoman Chantal Beauregard said Tuesday. ``I understand he's
spending the night in the recovery room.''
	   She would not confirm that the celebrated Canadian writer had
had kidney surgery_ as he had indicated in an newpaper interview
Monday.
	   ``Mr. Richler really wants to keep his personal life personal,''
said Beauregard. ``I think we have to respect his wish for privacy
at this time.''
	   Beauregard added that she did not know how long Richler would be
in hospital.
	   In in telephone interview Monday with the Montreal Gazette from
his hospital room, Richler said his general health was ``terrific''
and he expected to be home in a week.
	   ``I need to have something done about my kidney,'' said Richler,
67. ``It's not a life-threatening operation. It's done pretty often
and I'll just have a difficult week.''
	   Richler, the author of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz and
St. Urbain's Horsemen, has just published Barney's Version. He is
also an internationally known newspaper and magazine columnist.

U.S. dollar slightly higher, Tokyo stocks lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early
Wednesday as traders awaited the outcome of a meeting of G-7
finance officials later in the day. Tokyo stocks edged lower.
	   The dollar bought 140.56 yen at the start of morning trading, up
0.20 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York
level of 140.30 yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
slipped 9.79 points, or 0.06 percent, to 15,520.38 at the start of
Wednesday's trading. On Tuesday, the average rose 235.46 points, or
1.52 percent.
	   The dollar hovered above 140 yen as all eyes turned to Paris,
where deputy finance ministers of the Group of Seven top industrial
nations are meeting. Officials could announce a joint effort to
prop up the yen later Wednesday, traders warned.
	   The dollar had gained steadily against the yen in recent weeks
as investors shifted more and more funds out of Japan's lagging
markets and into the robust U.S. economy.
	   Concerns about the Japanese economy drove the dollar to a
seven-year high of 141.35 yen on Tuesday.
	   Such concerns also weighed on stock prices, offsetting optimism
the stronger dollar would boost the earnings of Japan's exporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.14 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,207.54. The
TOPIX closed up 10.32 points, or 0.86 percent, the day before.
	   Stock prices remained little changed as investors watched if G-7
officials in Paris would intervene in currency markets.
	   Without some move to support the yen, analysts cautioned foreign
investors will likely keep selling their Japanese holdings. That's
because a weakening yen erodes the dollar value of Japanese stocks.
	   ``The weak yen is good for exporters, but our concern is that it
will hurt the sentiment of foreign investors,'' said Tsuyoshi
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.200 percent, down from Tuesday's 1.210
percent. Its price rose to 112.02 yen from 111.96 yen.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Governments should enter the 21st
century understanding that peace means more than countries arming
themselves so heavily that no one will attack them, a respected
research institute said Wednesday.
	   ``The security agenda ahead must be founded on a new political
philosophy, encompassing a common, institutionalized system of
standards and shared values rather than concepts based on the
balance of power,'' the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute's yearbook said.
	   SIPRI's annual report is regarded as a definitive assessment of
global security issues.
	   The yearbook covers 1997, before the balance of power issue took
a worrisome turn with longtime foes India and Pakistan each
demonstrating its nuclear weapons capacity with a series of test
blasts last month.
	   ``One of the top priorities must be the complete elimination of
nuclear weapons,'' the institute urges in the yearbook's
introduction. Other parts of the report indicated a mixed prospect
for whether agreement on that scale is feasible.
	   On the favorable side, the report noted developments such as
last signing of the international treaty on banning anti-personnel
mines and the ratification by Russia, China and the United States
of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
	   But it noted ``the START II treaty remained in limbo in 1997,
despite agreement between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin on a
series of measures to boost its chances of being ratified by the
Russian Parliament.''
	   Among the report's other conclusions:
	   _ World military expenditure declined by about one-third from
1988 to 1997 and is estimated to be about dlrs 740 billion for last
year.
	   _ Russia's military expenditure in 1997 was less than 10 percent
of what the Soviet Union spent a decade earlier.
	   _ Peace accords last year in Liberia, Tajikistan and Bangladesh
can be considered ``major successes in armed conflict resolution.''

Insurer to form Japan's biggest asset management firm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation from Sumitomo, ADDS name of largest
existing company in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. plans to form Japan's
largest asset management company early next year, a company
spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Sumitomo will create a subsidiary out of an affiliated company
that will manage some 10 trillion yen (dlrs 71 billion) in assets,
said Sumitomo spokesman Hitoshi Yamanaka.
	   That would be more than twice as large as Japan's biggest
existing asset management company, Nomura Asset Management.
	   Sumitomo aims to launch the company in January after a revision
in the country's insurance law allowing subsidiaries goes into
effect in December, he said.
	   Sumitomo is the world's third largest insurer.
	   The new company will establish offices in New York, London, Hong
Kong and Singapore and hire about 30 asset management experts from
overseas companies.
	   Banks and other financial institutions are scrambling to form
new alliances with both domestic and overseas companies in line
with major reforms _ known collectively as the ``big bang'' _ aimed
at increasing competition in Japan's financial industry.

	   PALEMBANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Hampered by smoke and ashes still
smoldering after two days, rescuers returned to a burned out
shopping center and movie theater complex Wednesday expecting to
recover the bodies of dozens of victims trapped inside.
	   Fire swept through the Megahira shopping center Monday night. So
far only 19 bodies have been recovered. But firefighters and police
fear many more died when choking black smoke filled the building.
	   Witnesses said stores in the center had been shut for several
hours when the fire started.
	   Police said at least 54 people were known to have been in three
movie theaters inside. Dozens more were playing pool in an adjacent
amusement center.
	   ``Many victims are still inside,'' police chief Brig. Gen. Dedde
Janrigadi was quoted as saying by the Sumatra Espres newspaper.
	   The cause of the fire has not been established, he said.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Sardjo Sadjat said 19 people were
injured, 14 of them treated in hospitals in the city, 460
kilometers (285 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Survivors said panic broke out when the building was engulfed
with smoke. None said they saw any flames.
	   One man told the newspaper Republika that people ``trampled on
one another'' to get out.
	   ``I think no one can survive,'' said Djaieni, a fire department
official.
	   The shopping center, in Palembang on the island of Sumatra, was
built in 1976. It was rebuilt after fire destroyed much of it in
1985, when one firefighter was killed.
	   Last month several shopping malls were set afire during riots in
the capital, Jakarta. Hundreds of people died, mostly looters
trapped inside.

Canadian experts say no cyanide contamination in Kyrgyzstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) _ Canadian experts have found no
signs of cyanide contamination in soil or water near villages in
central Asia where a huge spill took place last month, says a
spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department.
	   The findings appear to back up Cameco Corp., which has
repeatedly denied that it poisoned anyone with its May 20 spill
into a river that supplies several villages.
	   The Kyrgyz government insists the spill killed two people and
affected at least 2,500 others.
	   Valerie Noftle of the department said Tuesday that two federal
government scientists found contamination only at the actual
accident site since they arrived in Kyrgyzstan last Friday.
	   Noftle said the scientists will make test kits available to
local people to test their soil and water.
	   ``The test methods that were used have won the approval of the
local leaders,'' she said from Ottawa. ``They've been reassured by
the immediate and easily available results of the method.''
	   Bernard Michel, president of Cameco, blamed poor crisis
management by the Kyrgyz government for the panic that has seen
thousands of people go to hospital in the central Asian republic.
	   ``The government has been faced with a crisis that instead of
managing, it let go,'' Michel said Tuesday at a news conference at
the company's Saskatoon headquarters.
	   Michel said it is possible a few people ingested small amounts
of sodium cyanide in the first few days of the spill but ``we have
never seen any of those people.''
	   A report by the World Health Organization released Tuesday
confirmed cyanide wouldn't cause the high number of reported
illnesses because cyanide breaks down quickly in the body.
	   The report didn't comment on the deaths that have been
attributed to poisoning or the effects on people immediately after
the spill.
	   A commission of scientists from Russia, U.S., Canada, Kyrgyzstan
and WHO also agreed Tuesday to examine the aftermath of the spill
to figure out why so many people were made sick.
	   One Russian physician has proposed the theory that people were
made sick by a virus transmitted by chickens. Kyrgyz government
officials say more than 5,000 people from five villages sought
medical attention after the accident.

Former military junta leader is arrested for child kidnapping
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update and clarify. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL ZADUNAISKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A former Argentine president has
been arrested and charged with kidnapping children born to parents
who were killed during the nation's ``dirty war,'' officials said.
	   Jorge Rafael Videla, who led the military junta that took power
in a 1976 coup, was detained Tuesday on orders by a federal judge,
Interior Minister Carlos Corach said.
	   Videla, 71, was arrested on charges of child kidnapping and
falsifying identity documents, a spokesman for the court told The
Associated Press in a phone interview.
	   Videla was held at a police station awaiting questioning by
federal judge Roberto Marquevich, who was urged by human rights
groups to investigate allegations that some children of dissidents
who were slain were handed over to members of the military, who
raised them.
	   Videla is accused of being involved in five such cases,
including those of two children given to Norberto Bianco, a former
military doctor who fled to Paraguay after democracy was restored.
	   He was extradited to Argentina and jailed on kidnapping charges.
	   The two children have grown and married and reside in Paraguay.
No immediate information was available on the other three children
mentioned in the charges.
	   As chief of the military, Videla had final authority over death
squads that waged a ``dirty war'' of torture and murder against
political opponents, mainly leftists, from 1976-1983.
	   The Argentine government claims 9,000 people disappeared during
that time, but human rights groups put the figure at 30,000.
	   The army chief was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for human
rights abuses during the dictatorship. In 1990, Videla, along with
all middle and senior-ranking officers, was pardoned as part of a
decree by President Carlos Menem.
	   Human rights advocates hailed his arrest Tuesday as a victory
for justice.
	   ``This is the result of more than twenty years of struggling for
justice,'' said leftist Congressman Alfredo Bravo, who was jailed
and tortured during the dirty war.
	   Hebe Bonafini, president of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, said,
``We are glad he is in prison, though he should serve time for all
of his crimes, not just baby kidnapping.''
	   Since 1977, the Mothers march every week around the Plaza de
Mayo facing the presidential office building in downtown Buenos
Aires to demand justice for their missing children.

Drug problem is downside of the collapse of Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Taking advantage of the collapse of the
Soviet Union, drug traffickers have established links across
Central Asia to smuggle narcotics from Afghanistan to lucrative
markets in Western Europe.
	   Leaders of the newly independent states such as Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic complain they lack the resources
to combat criminal syndicates based in Russia and Western Europe.
	   The end of the Soviet Union, with its police state internal
controls, gave traffickers a freer hand to move large amounts of
opium and other drugs across Central Asia to markets in Western
Europe.
	   ``The drug problem is acute throughout the Central Asian
region,'' the prime minister of the Kyrgyz, Kubanychbek Jumaliev,
told the U.N. special session on drugs Tuesday. The three-day
conference ends Wednesday.
	   ``Two or three years ago, people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea what heroin is,'' Jumaliev said. ``Nowadays, it
has become one of the main drugs on the illegal market.''
	   U.N. officials say the problem is made worse because of the
decades-long instability in Afghanistan, which along with Myanmar
produces most of the world's illicit supply of opium.
	   The newly independent states of Central Asia, some of which have
suffered their own internal instability, lack the means to control
their borders and maintain surveillance on drug traffickers moving
in and out of Afghanistan.
	   ``Today, it is possible to say with confidence that the main
source of growing, producing and delivering drugs to the European
countries is Afghanistan,'' said Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov
of Uzbekistan.
	   Afghan factions permit the drug trade to earn money to buy more
weapons, which in turn produces more fighting and instability, he
said.
	   The president of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, complained that
the international community has devoted considerable resources to
combatting drugs in Latin America and Southeast Asia but has left
poor Central Asian states on their own.
	   Rakhmonov said that in 1991, the year the Soviet Union
collapsed, police in Tajikistan seized only 10 kilograms (22
pounds) of narcotics. In 1997, Tajik police seized more than 4.5
tons.
	   He estimated that the figure seized amounts to no more than 15
percent of the total amount of drugs which passed through Tajik
territory.
	   ``The Republic of Tajikistan is not yet in a condition to
finance independently the programs and measures to combat this
evil,'' Rakhmonov said. ``We require active support and assistance
to block and control illicit drug traffic.''
	   Officials from those countries said privately they would like
the European Union to provide more assistance since most of the
drugs passing through Central Asia will end up sold on the streets
of Berlin, Paris, London and other Western European cities.
	   Kamilov suggested that the European Union help Central Asian
states establish a coordination center to monitor the flow of drugs
and develop plans for curbing the flow.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ In his first address to the nation,
Nigeria's new military ruler has vowed to support a transition to
civilian rule and said the country's many political exiles were
welcome to return home.
	   But Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar went into no details on how the
transition would be carried out, leaving up in the air just how
such an enormous shift could be accomplished by Oct. 1, the date
the program was to be completed.
	   Abubakar was speaking hours after he was appointed by the ruling
military junta to replace Gen. Sani Abacha as ruler of this West
African nation, rich in oil reserves but torn by ethnic divisions.
Abacha died Monday of a heart attack after a five-year
dictatorship.
	   Speaking on national television Tuesday night, Abubakar said his
government was ``fully committed to the social-political transition
program of Gen. Sani Abacha's administration.''
	   ``We will do everything to ensure its full and successful
implementation,'' Abubakar said Tuesday night.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Air Vice Marshal Mohammed Alfa, a senior
military junta aide, told reporters that Abubakar would turn the
country over to an elected civilian government by Oct. 1 _ but gave
no details.
	   Abubakar, a career soldier and long a close ally of Abacha, also
called on Nigeria's political exiles to return to the country.
	   ``I invite all Nigerians in self-exile to return home to join
the process of reconstruction and reconciliation,'' said the
general, who remained stone-faced throughout the five minute
speech.
	   Such well-known exiles as Wole Soyinka, a writer and Nobel
laureate, have warned that the military must give way to civilian
leadership.
	   ``I'm afraid that if the military does not bow to the will of
the people, armed insurrection becomes inevitable,'' he said in
Jerusalem, where he was lecturing. ``The signs of it are already
there.''
	   Also Tuesday, many civil rights groups called for the release of
jailed businessman Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993
annulled presidential elections.
	   Abacha, a dictator well-known for his brutality, had long
promised that his transition program would end military rule in
Nigeria. But he was also widely seen as manipulating the system to
have himself transformed into a civilian ruler. Though he never
officially declared his candidacy, he was the only person nominated
by Nigeria's five registered political parties for Aug. 1
presidential elections.
	   Abubakar, who was named as chief of defense staff under Abacha
in 1993, made no comment on the election date or lack of
contestants.
	   Abubakar has not been welcomed warmly by Nigeria's pro-democracy
supporters.
	   ``We are under no illusion that by Abacha's death, military rule
has come an end,'' the United Action for Democracy said in a
statement, adding ``the struggle against military rule in all its
guises will be renewed with vigor.''
	   Many other groups declined to comment, though, as they met to
discuss forging a stronger pro-democracy alliance.
	   But countries around the world added their voices to the call
that the military, which has ruled Nigeria off and on since the
country achieved independence from Britain nearly 40 years ago,
finally step aide for good. Abacha himself seized power in a 1993
coup. During his years in power about 7,000 government critics and
dissidents were imprisoned.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the
Clinton administration hoped that Abubakar would soon surrender
power. Similar calls for democracy in Nigeria came from France,
Britain and members of the Commonwealth of former British colonies.
	   Still, several nations in West Africa praised Abacha for making
his military a regional peacekeeper. Sierra Leone President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah was returned to power earlier this year as a direct
result of Nigeria's military intervention.
	   And Liberian President Charles Taylor called for a national day
of mourning for Abacha _ whose troops helped to implement peace
accords that ended seven years of civil war in Liberia.
	   In Lagos, which was officially in mourning over Abacha's death,
there were few signs of tears over the death of Abacha.
	   ``There's no reason to be upset,'' said Kehinda Suleiman, a
40-year-old Lagos resident. ``We're happy he's gone. He was not
such a good leader.''
	   Abacha's leadership problems are visible everywhere in Lagos,
from the lines for gasoline that stretch for blocks to the
flickerng electricity and the phones that can't call across town.
His years in power were marked by accusations of jumps corruption
and mismanagement that completely crippled much of Nigeria's
infrastructure. Nigeria's economy, once the pride of West Africa,
is now an utter mess. Up to 80 percent of Nigeria's 115 million
people _ Africa's most-populous nation _ live in poverty.

Attorneys seek release of Mexican drug suspects after two charges

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ A judge has cleared two brothers
believed to lead Mexico's biggest methamphetamine cartel of two of
the three charges they faced. Their attorney said he is seeking
their release from jail.
	   But the attorney general's office said Tuesday that it would
seek proceedings to have the brothers, Luis and Jesus Amezcua
Contreras, extradited to the United States.
	   Judge Jose Nieves Luna Castro cleared the brothers of one count
each of criminal association and money laundering, saying they had
been charged under statutes that were not in effect at the time of
the alleged crimes. He ordered them held for trial under a separate
money laundering charge.
	   Defense attorney Everado Rojas Contreras said he is seeking a
court order that would free his clients and prevent their
extradition.
	   ``The attorney general's office hasn't offered a single piece of
evidence that, in my opinion, is worthwhile,'' he said.
	   In announcing the arrests of the Amezcua brothers last week, the
attorney general's office said that Mexico's largest
methamphetamine and amphetamine trafficking cartel had been broken
up. He said police had seized dozens of businesses in three states
and found chemicals used for producing the drug.
	   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said the Amezcua
brothers' organization was the largest methamphetamine and chemical
trafficking gang known to U.S. law enforcement agents.
	   But the Amezcua brothers were not charged with drug violations.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the attorney general's office said
it is continuing its investigations linking the brothers to drug
trafficking and organized crime.
	   Methamphetamine _ a highly addictive synthetic drug also known
as crank, ice or crystal _ has gained popularity along the U.S.
West Coast and central states, surpassing usage of crack and other
drugs in many communities.

Martinez fails to surpass Marichal's record

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Not even the president of Nicaragua could help El
Presidente.
	   Atlanta's Dennis Martinez, trying to surpass Juan Marichal as
the winningest Latin American pitcher in U.S. major league history,
was knocked out in the fifth inning by the Boston Red Sox on
Tuesday night.
	   Martinez, who is tied with Marichal at 243 victories, left the
game after giving up back-to-back singles leading off the fifth.
The Red Sox built a 7-1 lead in the inning.
	   Martinez readily gave up the ball when Atlanta manager Bobby Cox
arrived at the mound and sprinted off the field to polite cheers
from the crowd at Turner Field, while Nicaraguan president Arnoldo
Aleman watched from a luxury box.
	   The Red Sox broke a 1-1 tie with five runs in the fourth, though
only one was earned because of two Atlanta errors. Still, it was a
dismal outing for the 43-year-old Martinez, who had tied Marichal's
record with a 12-hit shutout at Milwaukee last week.
	   The final line for El Presidente: four innings, nine hits, seven
runs _ three earned _ one walk and four strikeouts. He may return
to the bullpen without getting another start, since John Smoltz is
beginning a minor-league rehabilitation assignment in preparation
for coming off the disabled list.
	   The poor outing spoiled a planned celebration in Martinez's
Central American homeland.
	   ``This is very prestigious for the Nicaraguan people,'' said
Aleman, who met with Martinez for a few minutes before the game and
walked around the field during batting practice wearing a white cap
with the word ``Nicaragua'' emblazoned above the bill.
	   ``We're here to tell him that he's not alone,'' Aleman said
through an interpreter. ``He's also joined by the people of
Nicaragua. Everyone, all of Nicaragua, will be watching tonight.''
	   Aleman arrived at the ballpark about an hour before the game,
accompanied by a contingent of security guards wearing Braves caps.
Soon, it was clear this wasn't just another regular-season game.
	   ``It's kind of like it is before a playoff game,'' pitcher Tom
Glavine said. ``All I know is they had all the parking places
blocked in our lot.''
	   The Braves have a large Latin contingent, which was particularly
excited by Martinez's big night. Outfielder Danny Bautista, a
native of the Dominican Republic, posed for photographs with Aleman
in the tunnel leading to the Atlanta dugout.
	   The president watched the game from a luxury box and said he
would keep coming back until Martinez broke Marichal's record.
	   ``It's very exciting,'' said shortstop Ozzie Guillen, a
Venezuelan. ``I've got to believe this will be more intense than
the normal game. ... This is a big game not just for the Latin
American community, but for all of baseball.''

Mediator's resignation raises questions for Mexico conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with grafs 5 and 6 to show that
rebel leaders denied responsibility for ambush &QL; 
 &UR; By TRINA KLEIST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Nearly two years after
peace talks between the government and Indian rebels broke down, a
key mediator's resignation is signaling that the government wants
to resolve the conflict on its own terms.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz, claiming growing government
``aggression'' against his church, on Sunday ended his efforts to
mediate an end to the uprising by the Zapatista National Liberation
Army. The mediation commission he led also disbanded.
	   The controversial bishop had led efforts to end the conflict
since it erupted on Jan. 1, 1994. The first talks in early 1994
were held here in his cathedral.
	   Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by supporters, his critics
accused him of causing the rebellion by preaching social activism
to the region's impoverished Indian communities. Some Zapatista
rebels are former church layworkers.
	   On Tuesday, masked men ambushed six government supporters in the
village of Los Platanos, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of San
Cristobal. One man was killed and five were injured _ four of them
seriously.
	   Because pro-rebel and pro-government peasants have clashed in
the area in the past, suspicion among local residents immediately
fell on the Zapatistas and their supporters. But rebel leaders
issued a statement to the press denying responsiblity.
	   While there is no evidence Ruiz has advocated violence,
President Ernesto Zedillo last week issued a veiled warning, saying
that ``those who promote the theology of violence... should correct
their errors.'' Officials have repeatedly denounced Ruiz and his
diocese.
	   Supporters said Ruiz's sympathy with rebel goals helped convince
the suspicious Zapatistas to talk with the government.
	   ``What has happened is nothing positive,'' historian Lorenzo
Meyer of the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City said of Ruiz's
resignation. ``It polarizes the situation in Chiapas even more.
Now, the Zapatistas and the government are virtually alone.''
	   Zedillo seems to want it that way.
	   Government officials for months have questioned the need for
mediators, saying they want direct contact with the Zapatistas. As
part of its strategy, the government also is turning up the
pressure on the Zapatistas and their supporters.
	   At least 40,000 federal troops patrol the region. The government
has been accused of links to vigilante groups that have clashed
with Zapatista supporters, including a band that massacred 45 rebel
sympathizers in the town of Acteal late last year.
	   Officials have interrogated foreigners who sympathize with the
rebels at immigration checkpoints on roads to Zapatista-held areas,
and more than 150 foreigners accused of meddling in politics have
been expelled.
	   The government has raided at least two self-declared rebel
municipalities and has encouraged members of others to abandon the
rebels.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of Ruiz's rural layworkers have been charged
with crimes by local officials and his diocese says local
pro-government officials have used intimidation to close 33 Roman
Catholic churches.
	   The new government tactics come nearly two years after talks
broke down.
	   Government and rebel representatives spent 17 months in talks
that resulted in agreements on rights for Indians nationwide.
Sympathetic Congressmen proposed a law that the Zapatistas
accepted. The federal government ultimately rejected the measure
and offered its own, less sweeping version _ one that the
Zapatistas didn't like.
	   The rebels reacted by withdrawing from talks in August 1996,
accusing the government of reneging on its pact. Now, even the
once-voluble rebel military leader, Subcomandante Marcos, is being
unusually silent.
	   Signs are that circumstances are swinging in the government's
favor, Meyer said.
	   ``The federal government ... has the Zapatista army
surrounded,'' Meyer said. ``It is making life impossible for its
(village support) bases and is pouring out money to support ruling
party adherents in the appearance of a social program.''

Snow `property' damaged by ash fall, judge rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Falling volcanic ash damaged the
snow ``property'' of a ski slope operator, a judge has ruled in a
landmark case sparked by eruptions that ruined two ski seasons.
	   The High Court has ordered State Insurance to pay ski slope
operator Ruapehu Alpine Lifts U.S. dlrs 2.6 million (5 million NZ
dollars) for profits lost during the Mount Ruapehu eruptions of
1995 and 1996 in central North Island.
	   Justice Warwick Gendall ruled Tuesday that the company should be
paid for the ash damage to its snow property.
	   He said snow was tangible, capable of being used, shaped and
harvested and ``by its very essence'' was used in the business.
	   Gendall said he had been unable to find any case covering snow
as property, but being a product of nature did not exclude it from
being defined as ``property.''
	   The payout is for losses suffered by the operator due to the
slope closure caused by volcanic ash damage to the snow.
	   State Insurance had earlier paid U.S. dlrs 750,000 (1.5 million
NZ) to the company for damage to plant and equipment, and an extra
U.S. dlrs 550,000 (1.1 million NZ) for interruption to business by
the 1995 eruption.
	   Local business, from farming and market gardening to tourism and
ski slopes, lost an estimated U.S. dlrs 5 million (10 million NZ)
in profits as a result of the eruptions.
	   State Insurance spokeswoman Jackie Curtis said the company was
considering an appeal against the ruling that snow was property.
	   Mount Ruapehu, meanwhile, continues to rumble occasionally and
spit steam from vents at the bottom of its crater lake.
	   Vulcanologists maintain a Level One alert on the mountain, the
alert used when a minor local eruption is in progress. It is the
lowest alert rating.

Indonesian president offers special status to East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; With Indonesia-Troubled Territory &QL; 
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Signaling a possible easing of
Indonesia's tight control, new President B.J. Habibie said he's
ready to grant special status to East Timor in exchange for peace
in the disputed territory.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Habibie
also said Tuesday that he had signed a decree to release 10 East
Timor rebels jailed by Indonesia, which invaded the former
Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it the next year.
	   The new Indonesian leader emphasized, however, that special
status did not mean political autonomy, and he said that imprisoned
East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao would remain behind bars.
	   Indonesia regards Gusmao as a criminal, saying he has committed
violent acts in his fight against Indonesian rule. He is serving a
20-year prison term in Jakarta's Cipinang Prison.
	   East Timorese activists said Tuesday's gesture was not enough
for them to end their long-running guerrilla war against Indonesian
rule.
	   ``They are rehashing an old position, which requires first that
the United Nations recognize the illegal annexation of East Timor
by Indonesia,'' said Jose Ramos-Horta, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning
independence activist for East Timor.
	   ``This is not a serious proposal, and I am stating unequivocally
that we reject it,'' Ramos-Horta told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy
School of Government.
	   Habibie's comments on East Timor appeared to be a significant
change from the policy of former President Suharto, who steadfastly
refused to consider granting any special status or any form of
local autonomy to East Timor.
	   Weeks of massive student and worker protests, fueled by alleged
government corruption and Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades, forced Suharto to step down last month after 32 years of
autocratic rule.
	   More than 150,000 people fled Indonesia when those deadly riots
broke out, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Some 70,837 Indonesian citizens and 81,526 foreigners left
between May 14 and May 20 from airports and seaports on the islands
of Java, Bali and Sumatra, the Jakarta Post quoted immigration
chief Pranowo as saying. He said more than 51,000 people returned
in subsequent days.
	   Habibie's recent promises of economic and political reforms
weren't enough to prevent more anti-government protests Tuesday.
	   Student mobs protesting alleged local government corruption
threw rocks and smashed bank windows Tuesday in Tegal, a coastal
town about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of Jakarta. No injuries
or arrests were reported. Three peaceful protests also were
reported elsewhere in the capital.
	   Regarding East Timor, a Habibie aide, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said predominantly Muslim Indonesia would grant some
form of recognition to the territory's culture and Roman Catholic
religion.
	   Other parts of Indonesia with special status include Jakarta,
the deeply Muslim province of Aceh in north Sumatra Island, and the
sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java.
	   Their local governments enjoy a few, mostly symbolic, privileges
and powers.

Amusement park among the perks monarch lavishes on Brunei

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Down the road from the
sultan's palace is his gift to the people of Brunei: a sprawling
amusement park where entertainment is courtesy of the king.
	   ``It's not as big as Disneyland, but it's better,'' said
Mohamhad Sofrihaten, 19, who like many Bruneians has dubbed the
park the Sultan's Playground. ``In Disney, money's king. Here,
everything's free.''
	   Some locals shrug off the free rides at Jerudong Park Playground
as another perk of living in this oil-rich kingdom on the north
coast of Borneo, ruled by one of the wealthiest men in the world.
	   No one pays taxes and medical care is free, thanks to the oil
reserves that keep inflation nonexistent and also have sheltered
Brunei from Asia's currency crisis. There are no highway speed
limits and subsidies keep prices low for the gasoline that fuels
all the imported cars.
	   Other Bruneians say it's due compensation for the kingdom's
``cannots.''
	   In recent years, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's push for a stricter
Islam in the majority Muslim nation of 300,000 people has brought
laws banning alcohol, most night life past 10 p.m. and the public
display of affection _ all of which still exist unofficially.
	   The one authorized exception is the multibillion-dollar
amusement park, which is open until 2 a.m. on the outskirts of
Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital. Built by the sultan in 1994 to
mark his 48th birthday, the park draws a nightly crowd of 2,000
that scarcely fills its sprawl.
	   Thrill seekers careen on looping roller coasters and plunge on a
50-meter (165-foot) freefall ride with no lines to slow them down.
Music fans get free tickets to concerts by the likes Michael
Jackson and Celine Dion. Young couples stray from marble paths to
steal forbidden kisses.
	   ``It's the only place where guys can play loud music and look at
pretty girls,'' said Caroline Ang, a Bruneian travel agent. ``You
can't really live without vices.''
	   That is the unspoken message that has trickled out of the
sultan's lavish 50-acre (20-hectare) palace, which is gated from
the public except for one day a year at the end of the holy month
of Ramadan.
	   Several Filipino actresses and beauty queens have allegedly
received large sums to entertain at the 1,788-room royal palace,
the world's largest residence.
	   Last year, a former Miss USA, Shannon Marketic, filed a damage
suit against the sultan claiming she had been held captive at the
palace for 32 days with six other American beauty queens and told
they had to engage in sex soirees with wealthy men.
	   The sultan denied having had contact with Ms. Marketic. His
lawyer got the dlrs 90 million lawsuit dismissed from a U.S.
District Court on the grounds the sultan has sovereign immunity and
cannot be sued.
	   Press coverage of the case was blacked out in Brunei. Locals
said rumors slipped through, but they choose their words carefully
when commenting.
	   ``Just like in a small family, no one questions what the master
of the house does,'' said Ang. ``But if you disobey, he can point a
finger.''
	   The sultan and religious leaders have recently scolded the
kingdom's people for sinning. Awang Abdul Aziz Junid, a leading
religious teacher, warned against ``unhealthy entertainment,''
notably liquor and women who wear revealing clothes that flout
Islam's teachings about modest dress.
	   While alcohol sales are forbidden, non-Muslim visitors can bring
up to two liters into Brunei.
	   Many restaurants honor a bring-your-own policy. Bruneians also
can drive three hours to Malaysia for liquor, but some partake of
the underground market, where alcohol is sold in back alleys and
sipped in tea cups.
	   One cafe is known for its ``herbal brew.'' At night, tables are
topped with tea pots as customers sip beer concealed in dainty
china.
	   In a residential section, a van parked backwards marks a house
that is more than it seems. A double rap on the glass front door
and a face appears between the curtains. The illicit order is
placed, and, quickly, a newspaper-wrapped beer is slipped out the
gated door.
	   The risk for such activities is high as raids are common and
punishment runs to a fine of 200,000 Brunei dollars (dlrs 120,000)
or jail.
	   But competition keeps prices down. Two cans of Heineken sell for
10 Brunei dollars (dlrs 6), only slightly more than across the
border in Malaysia.
	   ``It's the forbidden fruit,'' said one beer buyer who asked to
remain anonymous.

Rwandan hospital struggles to treat war casualties

<TEXT>
	   GAKENYI, Rwanda (AP) _ Up in the hilltop hospital, a doctor
walks from bed to bed surveying patients suffering from machete and
bullet wounds. Almost all of the 117 beds are full.
	   For Dr. Jules Niteyimana, the tiny hospital and its traumatized
patients, halfway between the capital, Kigali, and the stronghold
of Hutu rebels in the northwest, reflect the reality of Rwanda.
	   ``We have both rebel and army casualties. It's confusing here.
Everyone is scared,'' he whispers, making sure there are no
eavesdroppers. ``First, the rebels threaten to kill you unless you
give money. Then, the army kills you when they find out you paid
the rebels.''
	   One patient, Bonna Musabyimana, 12, was shot in the left leg in
April when government soldiers approached her house in nearby
Cyeru. The doctors had to amputate above the knee after the wound
became gangrenous. Her 14-year-old brother was shot in the face but
survived.
	   ``The soldiers came and shot me,'' Bonna says in a low voice.
``They took away cattle from our village.''
	   Pushing the girl's wheelchair is a 13-year-old boy who can't
remember his name and can't say if it was soldiers or rebels who
fired the bullet that ripped through his right knee two months
earlier.
	   Hidden by thick banana trees, the white-washed, hangar-shaped
hospital is reached by a winding dirt road leading from Gakenyi,
the small town at the bottom of the hill.
	   Inside clean, quiet wards, patients lie on metal beds with
sterile sheets that are meticulously changed every day. Those who
can get around with crutches lounge in the shades of the backyard
garden.
	   Outside the iron-gate entrance, dozens of barefoot farmers line
up every day to get medicine.
	   The hospital, which is financed by the Roman Catholic Church,
has an X-ray machine and a well-equipped operating room. It charges
less than private hospitals in the cities and is affordable to most
people. Humanitarian groups provide medicines and medical
equipment.
	   Founded in 1974, the hospital and its staff have survived
political upheavals, ethnic tensions between Hutus and minority
Tutsis, a 1990 civil war and a Hutu-organized genocide four years
later that ended with Tutsis in control of the government.
	   But this may be the year the hospital closes down, Niteyimana
says.
	   In February, he dodged behind his desk to escape bullets sprayed
into the wards. For two hours, the Tutsi-led army fired in and
around the compound. The soldiers later said they opened fire
because they suspected the rebels were nearby, Niteyimana says.
	   A month later, the rebels attacked Gakenyi, burning the town
hall and killing 31 people, but leaving the hospital intact.
Charred buildings and cars still blacken the green hills and lush
banana plantations.
	   In April, the hospital's only surgeon, a Spaniard, packed and
left without warning. The Catholic nurses who lived on a hill
across from the hospital soon left, too, leaving Niteyimana, who is
a Gakenyi native, three other doctors and a handful of medical
assistants and nurses.
	   ``We're surrounded here. The rebels are everywhere. You cannot
see them, but they can see you,'' Niteyimana says. ``They have been
telling people in the mountains not to come down because the
hospital will be attacked soon.''
	   Often, the mere presence of soldiers is reason for the rebels to
attack.
	   Road ambushes, attacks on prisons to free detained Hutus, and
more brazen raids on military convoys have become common in Rwanda
since November 1996, when more than a million Hutu refugees
returned from 2 1-2 years in exile.
	   Defeated Hutu soldiers and militiamen, many of them responsible
for the 1994 slaughter of more than 500,000 Tutsis, hid among the
returning refugees and are now bent on destabilizing the country.
	   Many human-rights groups and diplomats say both the rebels and
the army are responsible for the deaths of thousands of Rwandans.
The government says it prosecutes soldiers accused of killing
civilians and denies the army is systematically killing Hutus in
revenge for rebel attacks.
	   ``It's a civil war,'' says a Gakenyi man. ``Both sides are
killing. And they all wear the same uniform.''

Benfica defeats MetroStars 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Brian Deane scored two early
goals Tuesday to lead Benfica of Portugal to a 3-1 victory over the
New York-New Jersey MetroStars.
	   In the first half, the MetroStars were unable to contain Deane,
who scored seven goals in 14 games in the Portuguese League after
transferring at midseason from Sheffield Wednesday of England.
	   The striker, who left the game for a substitute in the 52nd
minute, scored on a header in the 13th minute and then beat three
defenders to a low cross in the 22nd minute, flicking the ball into
the goal.
	   The MetroStars, who have won four of their last five Major
League Soccer game, scored in the 25th minute on a penalty kick by
Diego Sonora after Benfica defender Paulo Madeira was called for a
handball in the penalty box.
	   Benfica added an insurance goal in the 88th minute when Ulf
Pringle headed in a cross.
	   The Lisbon-based club, a second-place finisher to Oporto in the
1998 Portuguese League, got two acrobatic saves from Belgian
goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme in the second half to preserve the
victory.
	   Benfica, which features players from eight countries, concludes
its brief trip to the United States on Thursday with a game against
the MLS' New England Revolution in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

Palestinians call for Security Council action on settlements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Palestinians called Tuesday for Security
Council action against Israel for approving construction of 58
homes for Jews on east Jerusalem land where an Arab girls' school
was to have been built.
	   ``It is imperative for the international community to take
measures in order to confront these Israeli policies and actions,''
the Palestinian's U.N. representative, Nasser al-Kidwa, wrote in a
letter to the current Security Council president, Antonio Monteiro
of Portugal.
	   There was no indication the council was prepared to act on the
issue. The United States has long sought to keep Arab-Israeli
issues from reaching the council, and in the past has vetoed
resolutions criticizing Israel for its settlement policies.
	   In the letter, which al-Kidwa gave to Monteiro in a meeting
Tuesday, the Palestinian representative said the Security Council
``as the body responsible for the maintenance of international
peace and security, should formally consider the situation with a
view of taking the necessary actions in this regard.''
	   He called the decision by the Israeli interior ministry to
approve the construction ``yet another example of the pursuit by
the government of Israel of an intensified expansionist policy for
the colonization and judaization of Arab Jerusalem.''
	   The United States has asked Israel for a time-out in settlement
construction to help restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
stalled since Israel began another settlement project on a disputed
east Jerusalem hilltop in March 1997.

Sweden calls for an end to ``massive'' pro-drug propaganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sweden called Tuesday for an end to the
``massive propaganda'' machine that makes drug use appear
fashionable and safe to young people.
	   Margot Wallstrom, Swedish minister of health and social affairs,
urged participants at the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs to undertake effective international cooperation to counter
the marketing she said was most often aimed directly at the young.
	   ``Such messages are transmitted worldwide in a matter of seconds
and tend to be embedded in a cultural context, accompanied by music
and fashion,'' she said.
	   ``Risks associated with drug abuse are played down and _
unbelievably _ cannabis and some of the synthetic drugs are
portrayed as totally safe and harmless.''
	   She acknowledged that trying to reverse this trend will be
difficult and expensive. ``But we, the political leaders of the
U.N. member states must make it very clear that we will not allow
ourselves to be influenced by those who promote illicit drugs.''

U.S. basketball team invited to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WATERBURY, Connecticut (AP) _ The Teikyo Post men's basketball
team is planning a historic trip this summer, becoming the first
U.S. sports delegation to visit the communist nation of North
Korea.
	   The school announced Tuesday it has accepted the invitation from
Intersport USA Inc., a non-profit sports exchange program. The
11-day trip begins Aug. 1 and includes a stop in China before
heading to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. The country has
been a communist nation since the 1950s.
	   ``Teikyo Post University is the ideal institution to undertake
this endeavor because of the international flavor we have,'' head
coach Tom Curle said.
	   The Waterbury school is affiliated with Teikyo University in
Japan. The basketball team is a member of the NAIA and the
Collegiate Atlantic Collegiate Conference.
	   The Rev. Philip Cascia, president and founder of
Connecticut-based Intersport, said the program visits countries
that, historically, have had strained relations with the United
States.
	   Since 1988, Intersport has taken athletes to goodwill
tournaments in the former Soviet Union, China, Vietnam and Cuba and
has plans to visit Iran in the future.

Japan's ruling party seeks extension for vote on economic stimulus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Parliament will vote Wednesday to extend
its current session by eight days to complete passage of a 16.6
trillion yen (dlrs 119 billion) economic stimulus package, an
official said.
	   The extension would keep Japan's Parliament, which was scheduled
to go into recess Wednesday, in session until June 18, a lower
house spokeswoman said.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party wants the extra time to
finish cobbling together the largest economic stimulus package in
Japanese history, which is aimed at reviving an economy on the
brink of recession.
	   Opposition party members are expected to counter by seeking a
vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for
his handling of the economy, Japanese media said. Such a measure
would be unlikely to pass.
	   The extension will mean that upper house elections scheduled for
this summer will likely take place between July 8 and 18, Kyodo
News reported.
	   Parliament passed Tuesday a bill to streamline nation's
bureaucracy.
	   The new law will trim the number of agencies and ministries to
13 from 22 within five years. It will cut the number of public
employees by about 10 percent and strengthen the prime minister's
control over policy making.
	   The new law was a key policy objective of Hashimoto, who has
promised to cut costs and rein in Japan's powerful ministries.

U.S. dollar slips, Tokyo stocks fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Wednesday
morning as traders waited for the outcome of a meeting of G-7
finance officials later in the day. Tokyo stocks fell in light
trading.
	   The dollar bought 140.63 yen in late morning trading, up 0.16
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and above its late New York level of
140.30 yen overnight.
	   The dollar's relative strength from its New York level followed
some buying on speculation that deputy finance ministers of the
Group of Seven will not issue a statement after their meeting in
Paris.
	   ``After all, no one knows what will come out of the G-7 deputy's
meeting and people are nervous,'' said Yasuhisa Morikuni, assistant
vice president at Bank of America.
	   Morikuni and other traders said the dollar would likely remain
in a narrow range for the rest of the Asian day as players were
avoiding making significant moves prior to the G-7 meeting and
congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, also later Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 107.79 points, or 0.69 percent, to 15,422.38 at the end of the
morning trading. On Tuesday, the average rose 235.46 points, or
1.52 percent.
	   The dollar had gained steadily against the yen in recent weeks
as investors shifted more and more funds out of Japan's lagging
markets and into the robust U.S. economy.
	   Concerns about the Japanese economy drove the dollar to a
seven-year high of 141.35 yen on Tuesday.
	   Such concerns also weighed on stock prices, offsetting optimism
the stronger dollar would boost the earnings of Japan's exporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 5.70 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,202.98. The
TOPIX closed up 10.32 points, or 0.86 percent, the day before.
	   Analysts said foreign investors will likely keep selling their
Japanese holdings, if the yen keeps weakening. That's because a
weaker yen erodes the dollar value of Japanese stocks.
	   ``The weak yen is good for exporters, but our concern is that it
will hurt the sentiment of foreign investors,'' said Tsuyoshi
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 1.210 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's
finish. Its price was marginally lower at 111.95 yen, down from
111.96 yen.

Lufthansa booking center for Melbourne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ German airline Lufthansa will
establish its Asia-Pacific reservations call center in Melbourne, a
move which will create 300 jobs.
	   Industry Minister Mark Birrell said Wednesday the center, due to
open in October, will handle calls from Japan, Hong Kong,
Singapore, New Zealand and Australia, as well as night-time calls
from Europe and the United States.
	   He said Melbourne's main attraction had been its skilled,
multi-lingual population, as well as the possibility of setting up
in the central business district.
	   Beating a number of other cities for the center, including Kuala
Lumpur and Macau, was a ``tremendous coup'' for Melbourne and added
impetus to the government's push to attract more international
companies, he said.
	   Lufthansa reservations vice-president William Pattison said
Melbourne would be one of nine call centers around the world as
Lufthansa sought to centralize its operations away from the current
211 call centers.

Red Wings 2, Capitals 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Tomas Holmstrom set up goals by Joe Kocur and
Nicklas Lidstrom in the first period to lead the Red Wings to a 2-1
victory over the Washington Capitals in the opening game of the
Stanley Cup finals on Tuesday night.
	   The Capitals, playing in the first final in their 24-year
history, came into the series as a heavy underdog, with most
prognosticators expecting the best-of-7 series to end in four or
five games.
	   For two periods, the game went as everyone expected. Detroit
dominated and Washington barely mounted a challenge.
	   A goal late in the second period by Richard Zednick got
Washington back in the game and Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood
had to make at least six good saves in the final period to keep
Detroit ahead.
	   Game 2 also will be in Detroit on Thursday before the series
shifts to Washington for games on Saturday and Tuesday.
	   Osgood had 16 saves as the Red Wings handed Washington only its
second loss in nine playoff games on the road.
	   Olaf Kolzig, who carried Washington through the first three
rounds by stopping 546 of 577 shots, had 29 saves. He was
defenseless on both goals, beaten on a deflection on the first and
through a screen on the second.
	   The Red Wings dominated most of the first two periods. They
outshot the Capitals 19-10, held them without a shot for more than
a 15-minute span bridging the first and second periods and only
allowed one shot on three Washington power plays.
	   However, a great play by Andrei Nikolishin late in the second
period set up a late goal by Zednick, his seventh of the playoffs,
that got Washington back in the game.
	   Holmstrom made the big plays on both of the Red Wings'
first-period goals.
	   Playing on a fourth line that had Doug Brown at center and Kocur
on the wing, Holmstrom actually made two great plays to help set up
Kocur's fourth goal of the playoffs.
	   After stopping a pass off the boards at center ice by Washington
defenseman Sergei Gonchar, Holmstrom retrieved the puck and tapped
it off the boards at the Capitals' blue line to set up a 2-on-1.
Brown carried the puck down the left side and backhanded a pass
across the crease that Kocur deflected past Kolzig at 14:04.
	   Kocur, back in the lineup because of a groin injury to Brent
Gilchrist, appeared to have his foot in the crease, but the goal
was allowed after a review.
	   Lidstrom got his sixth goal of the playoffs just 2:14 later on a
shot from the left point that Kolzig never saw. Holmstrom dug the
puck out behind the net and feathered it to Steve Yzerman before
going to the front to screen Kolzig.

Australian team faces funding trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia will be forced to miss out on
half the sports when it hosts the 2000 Paralympics unless the
federal government supplies more funding, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
	   Australian Paralympic Committee (APC) chief executive Scott
Derwin said Australia's team would be almost halved from a
projected 280 athletes to 155 unless the government supplies Aust
dlrs 1.5 million (U.S. dlrs 900,000) in annual funding until 2000.
	   The host nation would also only be able to contest nine sports,
rather than the full 18 as planned, Derwin said.
	   The APC can not pick up the shortfall through its own marketing
program because it has sold the marketing rights for the event to
the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee.

Parisians catch the spirit at ``Festival of Soccer''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Four jolly giants _ an African, American Indian, an
Asian and a European _ strode through Paris like good-guy Godzillas
on Tuesday, symbolizing the spirit of a World Cup that France hopes
will loom large in history.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the 18-meter (60-foot) robots took separate routes toward
the Place de la Concorde, the heart of a citywide tournament
kickoff party.
	   ``We want to show that football is accessible to everyone and
belongs to no one,'' said Jean-Pascal Levy-Trumet, who designed the
``Fete du Football'' show. ``The grand theme is universality in a
single world.''
	   As crowds watched the pageant end, however, several hundred
soccer fans hurled bottles at police on the Champs Elysees,
provoking an angry response from riot troops.
	   The fans fled, chased by police firing tear gas, and no arrests
were immediately reported.
	   Parisians awoke Tuesday to find the dozing giants at familiar
monuments, along with throngs of strangely dressed tourists from
the 31 nations joining France in the planet's biggest sports
tournament.
	   Moussa, the African, was the first to stir in the evening, near
the Eiffel Tower, standing up and opening huge eyes to wild
applause.
	   He symbolized man in a new world, and he rose up to see dancing
odd-shaped baobab trees and termite hills. Six ostriches _ actually
men on stilts _ bobbed among women dressed as stylized giraffes.
	   ``Amazing,'' said Florence Farriaux, as she hurried her three
kids home so their father could take them to Concorde, where Moussa
would meet the three others. ``I loved it.''
	   On the Pont Neuf over the Seine, Ho, the Asian, stood up in a
fantasy world of balloons shaped like flying fish and dancers
dressed as tropical sea creatures.
	   Pablo, the Indian, rose from a crouch under the Arc de Triomphe
and strolled down the Champs-Elysees to see the animated trees,
snakes and bugs that depict nature.
	   Romeo, the European, had been snoozing outside the Opera
Garnier. His theme was love, and along his route he bowed to a
sculptor's conception of the Urban Woman, a mere 4.5 meters (15
feet) tall.
	   David Quill, a Scottish engineer who came for no-nonsense
football, found himself carried away by the spectacle. ``This
brings together the four worlds,'' he said. ``I really liked it.''
	   As dark fell, the four giants met at the Concorde around the
famed Obelisk from ancient Egypt, which had been transformed into a
towering replica of the World Cup, topped by video screens.
	   At their feet, in a swirl of color, danced the full range of
costumed escorts, from ladies in body-length white wooden wigs to
silver-clad creatures that looked like Ninja aardvarks.
	   The vast plaza was jammed with fascinated Frenchmen and soccer
tourists. But at the edge, a cluster of Scottish fans, already
staggering drunk, hardly seemed to notice the show.
	   Heavy overnight rains had not dampened the mood, but they washed
off Ho's loincloth, made of rubberized-plastic, exposing the
midriff of his articulated steel skeleton. Workmen pinned it back
on.
	   The 38-ton giants were powered by small trucks hidden in their
feet. They moved one after the other, as if the giants were
walking. Huge heads moved, eyes rolled, and fingers wiggled.
	   During the day, Parisians paid less attention to the four
colossi than the real characters in their midst. Clusters of soccer
fans roamed the streets in outlandish outfits and gaudy colors.
	   For once, passersby paid more attention to skirts on men rather
than women. Perhaps 20,000 Scots came across the Channel for the
opening game with Brazil on Wednesday. Most wore kilts.
	   Scott Wallace, a fishmonger, and his housepainter friend, Gerry
Shiels, sat behind tankards of lager at the Cafe Montecristo, each
with bare knees and Highland feathers towering above their hats.
	   ``I think we'll beat 'em, 2-1,'' Wallace said, a little
hopefully. ``Aye,'' Shiels agreed. ``And if we do, it'll be some
party.''
	   From the looks of things Tuesday, there'll be some party,
anyway.
	   Still, an Air France strike and soccer ticket foulups have left
many fans furious.
	   Crowds pushed their way into the France 98 shop to buy World Cup
paraphernalia: polyster T-shirts, caps, crowd-parting cologne,
fuzzy stuffed versions of the goofy-looking rooster mascot named
Footix.
	   Visitors seemed to show more interest than the French. Jacques
Lambert, head of the organizing committee, complained of an evident
lack of fervor among the general public.
	   A block off the Champs-Elysees, Emmannuel Delhomme painted a
banner on the awning of his bookshop, the Livre Sterling: ``Good
news, ladies. This store will be open during all of the games of
the World Cup.''
	   Delhomme, no soccer fan, said he was a little wary of the
snarled traffic, the armed police and boisterous visitors.
	   ``But, after all,'' he concluded, ``it's a good thing. Parisians
are so sad, so stressed, and this is a change. All these people in
colors and a happy mood. It is something new to talk about.''

Government won't pay to remove Sydney's eyesore building, says
</HEADLINE>

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Wednesday he despises the building that eclipses the Sydney Opera
House as much as anyone else but ruled out paying for it to be torn
down.
	   Public outrage has been growing over the structure, a more than
230-room apartment building at Sydney's Circular Quay, culminating
in calls for it to be razed before it is ever occupied.
	   The building has been dubbed ``The Toaster'' by expatriate
historian and art critic Robert Hughes because of its blocky, glass
and steel facade.
	   It is the first of three buildings planned for the eastern side
of the Quay, the site of the first British landing in 1788 and a
popular tourist stop.
	   The source of most ire is that the building blocks the view of
the Sydney Opera House, one of the city's most famous landmarks and
recently listed by Time magazine as one of the top architectural
achievements of the century.
	   Hughes, the art critic for Time, has led calls for the
building's destruction.
	   Howard said Wednesday he could not justify using government
money from the U.S. dlrs 590 million (Australian dollars 1 billion)
Federation Fund to buy the building.
	   ``As a citizen of Sydney I'd like to see it disappear, but I've
got to ask myself should I really divert money that I could
otherwise spend on facilities for people in need,'' Howard told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``I just don't think I can justify switching funds from those
sorts of things.''
	   He blamed city and New South Wales state officials for granting
planning approval for the development, which he agreed was ugly.
	   The New South Wales government has estimated it would cost about
U.S. dlrs 118 (Australian dollars 200 million) to demolish the
building and buy back the land from its Hong Kong owners.

Red Sox beat Braves 9-3, Twins blank Cubs 8-0

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ For at least a few more days, Dennis Martinez and
Juan Marichal will remain linked as the winningest Latin American
pitchers in major-league history.
	   Martinez, who tied Marichal's record last week by winning his
243rd game, was knocked out in the fifth inning by the Boston Red
Sox, who went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 9-3 Tuesday night.
	   Nicaraguan president Arnoldo Aleman watched with disappointment
as Martinez (2-3) allowed nine hits and seven runs _ three earned _
in four-plus innings.
	   Bret Saberhagen (8-3) allowed seven hits in seven innings to win
his third straight decision.
 &UR; Twins 8, Cubs 0 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Kerry Wood struggled with his control as he lost
for the first time since April and Chicago's 10-game winning streak
was snapped.
	   Bothered by an abscessed tooth, Wood (6-3) gave up six runs _
two earned _ and five hits, walked four and struck out only four in
3 1-3 innings, the second-shortest outing of his rookie season.
	   Brad Radke (8-4) pitched a four-hitter for his first shutout of
the season and his third complete game.
 &UR; Yankees 11, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Orlando Hernandez pitched a four-hitter in his
second major league start and New York unleashed a 17-hit assault
to win its eighth straight.
	   Hernandez (2-0) came within two outs of a shutout, but Jose
Vidro doubled and Vladimir Guerrero singled him home. Hernandez
struck out nine as the Yankees became the first AL team to win a
game in Montreal.
	   Scott Brosius had the 10th two-homer game of his career and
Bernie Williams homered off Montreal starter Carlos Perez (6-4).
Luis Sojo had four hits and Chuck Knoblauch scored three runs and
walked three times.
 &UR; Cardinals 5, White Sox 4 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Delino DeShields drove in two runs as St. Louis
snapped a six-game losing streak.
	   White Sox center fielder Mike Cameron made a spectacular leaping
catch at the fence in right center in the seventh to rob Mark
McGwire of a potential 30th home run. McGwire went 1-for-4 with a
single in the fifth.
	   Cameron and Albert Belle homered for the White Sox, who lost for
the fourth time in the last five games.
	   Lance Painter (2-0) pitched three innings of two-hit relief for
the Cardinals, who won for only the second time in their last 11
games. Jeff Brantley got his 10th save.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Blue Jays 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, pinch-hitter Edgar Renteria's RBI single in the ninth
gave Florida the win.
	   Dave Berg singled to start the ninth against Paul Quantrill
(0-2), then advanced on a sacrifice. After Dan Plesac relieved,
Cliff Floyd hit an infield single and Renteria hit the game-winner
to left.
	   Livan Hernandez (4-4) pitched his third complete game, allowing
nine hits and four runs, adding an RBI single in the second.
 &UR; Phillies 2, Orioles 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Matt Beech pitched six shutout innings had a
career-high nine strikeouts for Philadelphia.
	   Beech (2-3), Wayne Gomes and Mark Leiter limited the Orioles to
three hits one night after Baltimore collected season-highs in runs
(14) and hits (18) against the Phillies. Leiter pitched two innings
for his 12th save.
	   Baltimore starter Sidney Ponson (0-4) pitched six innings,
allowing two runs and six hits, including Mark Lewis' fourth
homer.
 &UR; Pirates 7, Indians 4 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Jon Lieber pitched 6 2-3 strong innings to lead
Pittsburgh.
	   The defending AL champion Indians made two errors and ran
themselves out of a second-and-third, none-out rally without
scoring in the seventh.
	   Lieber (4-7) allowed three runs and eight hits, including Jim
Thome's 17th homer. Ricardo Rincon pitched 2 1-3 for his sixth
save.
	   Indians starter Dwight Gooden allowed three runs and seven hits,
including Kevin Young's 13th homer, in 5 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Astros 5, Tigers 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Todd Jones blew a save for the second straight night
as Houston scored four ninth-inning runs to win its fourth
straight.
	   Craig Biggio's two-run homer off Jones (0-3) was the key hit as
the Astros rallied to win in the ninth for the second straight
game.
	   Mike Hampton (8-3) gave up three runs and nine hits in eight
innings. Billy Wagner got his 16th save.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Royals 3, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In Kansas City Missouri, Marquis Grissom drew a bases-loaded
walk with two out in the 10th and Mark Loretta added a two-run
single to lift Milwaukee.
	   Jeff Montgomery (0-3) loaded the bases with three walks,
including one intentional. After Grissom's walk brought in the
go-ahead run, Loretta singled into left field to complete a 3-for-4
night.
	   Bob Wickman (3-4) got the victory with 2 1-3 innings of relief
as the Brewers snapped a six-game road losing streak. Doug Jones
got the last two outs for his 12th save.

China announces plan to promote science, technology and education
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Premier Zhu Rongji has set up a group to plan
China's strategy for developing science, technology and education _
fields seen as crucial to the country's economic development,
state-run media reported Wednesday.
	   The government plans to pour more money into science and
research that can help promote development, the Xinhua News Agency
quoted Zhu as saying.
	   ``We must work out an overall plan for development of science,
technology and education in tandem with the growth of the national
economy,'' Zhu said at the first meeting of the group, which is
also led by vice premier Li Lanqing.
	   China's current generation of leaders, most of whom have a
background in engineering, say the country must boost technology if
it is to compete in world markets.
	   During the first three decades after the Communists took power
in 1949, political campaigns and central planning caused China to
fall far behind other industrialized countries in many areas.
	   Antiquated equipment and production technology are seen as major
reasons for the inability of most state-owned enterprises to
achieve profitability.
	   Premier Zhu, who took office in March, and other top leaders
hope to make up for lost time by investing more in education and
research and by attracting more high-tech foreign investment.
