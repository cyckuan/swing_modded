<HEADLINE> More Nepali Couples Want to Join Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 28 percent of all Nepali
couples, or 1.1 million couples, who have not used any
contraceptive method, have said they want to join the family
planning program, researchers here said today.
</P>
<P>
About 24 percent of the Nepali couples had been using
contraceptives for family planning by 1991, but more couples would
join them if proper programs are carried out targeting these
potential voluntary couples, according to a family planning study.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by several governmental agencies with
technical assistance of Johns Hopkins University of the United
States, was designed to collect basic information on family
planning knowledge, attitudes and practices among couples in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 2,716 women and 687 men in four Nepali districts
showed that more than 95 percent of Nepali women had a high-level
knowledge about family planning.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, about 90 percent Nepali women know about specific
modern contraceptive methods.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that Nepalese people have changed a lot in
their attitudes towards and behavior in family planning, which has
led to the recent growing demand for contraceptives in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey could be used to work out more
strategic information, education and communication programs to
reach those couples who never used any contraceptive before, the
study pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Pardons Woman Jailed for Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac has
signed an order pardoning Veronique Akobe, a woman from Cote
d'Ivoire jailed in 1990 in France for killing the son of her
employer, who she said had raped her.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the French Presidential Office said today that
Akobe, 32, would be released from jail immediately.
</P>
<P>
Akobe, who was a maid employee of a family house in Rennes, was
arrested in 1990 and then condemned to 20 years in jail for
killing the son and seriously wounding the father of her employer.
She said she had been raped by both of them.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 woman lawmakers of France signed an appeal to Chirac
for pardoning Akobe, and 42,500 people in her home country Cote
d'Ivoire signed a petition for her release.
</P>
<P>
The European Association against Violence on Working Women also
collected some 40,000 signatures in an appeal to Chirac to pardon
Akobe. The group compared the affair to that around the Philippine
maid Sarah Balagan in the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The French president signed the order early this week.

<HEADLINE> China, Kyrgyzstan to Further Relations, Presidents Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that the Chinese people are ready to join
with the Kyrgyz people to make greater contributions to peace,
development and progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Kyrgyz President Askar
Akayevich Akayev, Jiang said he was to "explore with leaders of
Kyrgyzstan ways to build our future relationship from a
strategic height toward the 21st century, and to enable our
peoples to live in harmony from generation to generation."
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here earlier this afternoon on a two-day state
visit to Kyrgyzstan at the invitation of President Akayev.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the friendly, good-neighborly,
mutually-beneficial and cooperative relationship between China and
Kyrghystan has enjoyed healthy development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral exchanges and cooperation in all fields between the
two countries have produced positive results, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the two countries are good neighbors
with 1,000 kilometers of common borders, and Kyrgyzstan, once an
important country on the ancient "Silk Road," had made
extraordinary contributions to commercial and cultural exchanges
between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1991, Kyrgyzstan has stabilized its
political situation, gradually revived its economy, improved
national unity and made progress in social development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It is now a country full of vigor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Akayev said China was one of the first countries which
recognized Kyrgyzstan soon after its independence and has rendered
the most important political support to the formation of a
fledgling Kyrghystan.
</P>
<P>
"We bear in mind and always treasure all these," Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two
countries created very favorable conditions for bilateral cooperation
in all fields.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past five years, the two countries have laid a sound
foundation bound by relevant cooperative agreements, and
exchanged high-level visits and witnessed rapid development in
economic and trade relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are strengthening cooperation for peace and
stability in Asia, which is manifested by the significant accord on
building military trust in border areas between China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed by their heads of state
in Shanghai, China, in April, Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we have enough reason to re-affirm that we have no conflicts
and differences which would hamper the further development of our
bilateral relations toward the 21st century," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Jiang is expected to have an in-depth exchange of
views with President Akayev and other leaders of Kyrgyzstan on
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern, and
sign a number of documents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President flew to Bishkek, the fifth leg of his
six-nation tour in Europe and central Asia, after successfully winding
up his state visit to Uzbekistan, which was preceded by visits to
Spain, Norway and Romania.

<P>
PESHAWAR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia is
preparing to launch a big offensive on the capital of Kabul, a
Taliban source on condition of anonymity told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the Taliban leadership has directed the
governors of the Taliban-controlled provinces in Afghanistan to
send their troops to the outskirts of Kabul.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Official Visits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter
Tarnoff started his visit to Greece today by holding talks with
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
Confidence-building measures between Greece and Turkey in the
Aegean and a 1988 agreement between the two countries were the
main subjects of talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said after the meeting that he favored the point in
the measures which foresees the holding of military exercises in
the Aegean over the summer period.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 memorandum was signed by the then Greek and Turkish
foreign ministers, Karolos Papoulias and Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Greece has accused Turkey of failing to meet its obligations
in the document.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey almost came to blows over the uninhabited
islet of Imia in January this year following the mutual claims on
the island.
</P>
<P>
Tarnoff, who had already held talks in Nicosia and Ankara, said
he found Greece reacted positively on the issue of reducing
tension in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis held talks
with visiting U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Jan Lodal, who is
accompanying Tarnoff on his regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Lodal said after talks that Ankara was "seriously considering"
implementing a section of the 1988 Papoulias-Yilmaz memorandum
suspending military exercises in the Aegean over the months of
July and August.
</P>
<P>
Arsenis, however, stressed that Greece had implemented this
measure since 1988.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas today confirmed that U.S. President Bill Clinton had sent a
letter to Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Reppas described the letter as "good," noting that the U.S.
president mentioned "the respect for territorial integrity and
borders in the region."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Reform in State-Owned Enterprises (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president said party committees and governments at all
levels should first of all attach importance to study. Emphasis
should be placed on enterprise reform and, as the first step, they
should raise their consciousness in their work, their
understanding of government policies and their leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, leading officials should personally take charge of
the work concerning the reform of state-owned enterprises, as is
the case with some examples where progress has been achieved in
the reform, and enterprises should have a good managerial
mechanism to implement the reform policies.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the enterprise reform involves every department of
society. Each department should cite it an important job and
coordinate with other departments so as to speed up the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, leading officials at various levels should attach
importance to their work style and avoid formalism when carrying
out government policies on enterprise reform. This is also true at
the time when their enterprise learns from the successful
experiences of others enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, officials should show kind attention to people's
life. With the deepening of reform and other factors, some
enterprises face operational problems, which affect the livelihood
of some workers.
</P>
<P>
The reform represents the basic and long-term interests of the
workers, and the reform in the past dozen years and more have
remarkably improved people's living standards. However, officials
should give much heed to troubles of some enterprises and their
workers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin called on party committees and governments at all
levels to strengthen leadership and take positive and effective
measures to speed up the process of the state-owned enterprises'
reform, which constitutes a leading economic issue concerning the
growth of the national economy and also a major political issue,
which will have bearing on the destiny of the country's socialist
system.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Up 1.9 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories jumped
1.9 percent in May, the third straight advance and the biggest in
nine months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for both durable and nondurable
goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 315.9 billion dollars, up from
310 billion in April.
</P>
<P>
It also revised the initial estimate of a 0.1 percent decline
in April to a 0.2 percent gain after March's 1.7 percent advance.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's
manufacturing strength and an increase could mean a pickup in
production and job growth.
</P>
<P>
The report said orders for durable goods in May shot up 3.4
percent, steepest since a 5.1 percent advance last August. They
had fallen 2.5 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Among durable goods, the volatile transportation component
jumped 12.2 percent, wiping out a 12.1 percent loss a month
earlier. Much of the rebound was due to aircraft orders.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nondurable goods, such as chemicals and clothing,
managed a 0.1 percent gain following April's 2.4 percent surge.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased by 0.4 percent, the
eighth advance in nine months. A growing backlog suggests
businesses may have to increase production facilities and manpower
to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Inventories, another measure of future activity, fell 0.2
percent, the third straight decline.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, rose 1.1 percent, the
fourth gain in a row.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, U.S. manufacturing had fallen behind in the
current economic expansion. But the latest data showed solid gains
in industrial production in April and May.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today said he was prepared to continue dialogue with India
in spite of escalating tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Confrontation and armed conflicts have never solved problems
permanently and we must not repeat the mistakes of the past or the
folly of yet another war, which will bring in its wake untold
misery," he said in a speech to the annual meeting of the National
Defense College.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari said Kashmir is the key to the problems of South
Asia, and one which has bedevilled relations between India and
Pakistan since their independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Pakistan was prepared to maintain dialogue with
India on Kashmir and other problems between the two countries,
including nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will not accept unilateral and one-sided restraints
and obligations on its nuclear program, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The government had managed to convince the United
States that it was neither fair nor feasible to ask Pakistan to
roll back its nuclear Program.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has asserted that it will not sign the
Non-Proliferation Treaty unilaterally, it can do so simultaneously
with India."
</P>
<P>
On problems in Afghanistan, the president hoped for a peaceful
solution to the bloodshed in the country but said Pakistan has no
intention of interfering in its internal affairs or siding with
any faction.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have no preference for any party in particular."
said the president.
</P>
<P>
"We earnestly hope that an amicable situation is hammered out
through negotiations - and not through use of force."

<HEADLINE> World Population Reaches 5.77 Billion in Mid-1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The world's population has
reached 5.77 billion in mid-1996, with 80 percent of the global
total in developing countries continuing to increase at record
levels, a private population research organization said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 edition of the World Population Data
Sheet released by the Population Reference Bureau, the world
population will reach the sixth billion as soon as 1999, after
having passed the 5 billion mark in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"There have been notable declines in birth rates, particularly
in some countries of Asia and Latin America," said Carl Haub, the
organization's chief demographer, "but as long as each woman in
developing countries continues to bear two children each, the
rapid population growth will continue to occur."
</P>
<P>
"Birth rates in developing countries remain at twice the level
needed to stabilize world population size at some point in the
future," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Data Sheet said, the world's two huge population
giants, China and India, have gained a lower birth rate through
population control programs in recent years. China's current
fertility is only 1.8 children per woman, even lower than that of
the United States.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- High-quality law officials should
be trained to ensure long-term social stability, State Councillor
Luo Gan urged today at a national conference on public security.
</P>
<P>
"The training of more high-quality law officials and judicial
workers is urgent for the crackdown on crime, and the smooth
implementation of measures for the improvement of all aspects of
social securities," Luo said. "It is also important for the
country to achieve its economic goals and long-term stability."
</P>
<P>
Luo, who is also the deputy director of the Commission of
Comprehensive Management of Social Security, said that law
officials should have a strong sense of discipline and not commit
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Those who violate laws, cover up evil activities or provide
harbors for criminals must be strictly handled in accordance to
law," said Luo. "Corruption will never be allowed in judicial
departments."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the ongoing crackdown on crime is of vital
importance, and comprehensive management is needed to ensure a
safer society. He called on governments at all levels to attach
greater importance to the improvement of public security.

<HEADLINE> EC To Drop Competition Probe Into VISA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) --The European Commission is to drop
its investigation into credit card issuer Visa International after
the organization dropped a proposal that would have banned members
from issuing competing cards in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert
said he had warned Visa that its proposal was unacceptable and the
company dropped the plan after a European board meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Visa USA also confirmed to the European Commission(EC) that its
rules do not prevent the European branches, parents or
subsidiaries of Visa USA members from issuing competing cards.
</P>
<P>
The EC's investigation into Visa was launched in January after
some of its competitors, including American Express and Dean
Witter Discover, made formal complaints to the EC.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has reached the preliminary view that Visa's
proposal, if adopted, would have infringed EU competition rules
because it would have restricted competition between international
card systems as well as between banks which issue cards riding on
those systems.
</P>
<P>
The EC said it was determined to ensure that payment card
markets are kept open and that access by new competitors is not
impeded.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Hellenes Abroad
(CHA) will open a regional conference in Cyprus this weekend to
identify and discuss problems facing hellenism abroad.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Angelos Aslanides, the
President of the European Department of the Council of Hellenes
Abroad.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Aslanides said the venue of the meeting,
to be participated by 77 delegates representing 1,100 Greek
overseas organizations from Eastern and Western Europe, was
intentional to help participants "get to know the Cyprus problem,
become acquainted with the positions of the Greek Cypriot side and
discuss ways to assist and promote these positions."
</P>
<P>
"Working sessions will focus on two themes: to list our
concerns and to set up a nine-member coordinating regional body
for the European branch of CHA," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which will end Monday, will set up different
committees to deal with ethnic concerns, education and culture,
youth, women's issues, sport, social issues and Black Sea
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Referring to ethnic concerns, Aslanides said a special
committee will be formed to discuss Greco-Turkish relations and
the problems in Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The CHA, established in December 1995, is an international
movement that unites hellenes around the globe and acts as an
advisory body to the Greek government.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Raises 1996 Current Account Deficit Projection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government revised
its earlier projection of the current-account deficit for this
year twice as much as 11-12 billion U.S. dollars at an expanded
economic ministers' meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting upheld the forecasts of 7.0 to 7.5 percent
of economic growth and 4.5 percent of inflation rate for the year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current-account deficit for the first half of
this year is estimated at 9 billion dollars and the deficit for
the entire year is expected to top 11 billion to 12 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have
grown 7.5 percent on a year-on-year basis in the first half of
this year and the pace is expected to slow down amid slowing
exports and capital investment in the second half. The yearly
growth rate, however, is likely to be somewhere between 7.0 and
7.5 percent as projected earlier.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices increased 3.8 percent on a year-on-year basis
in the first six months, and the new education tax, utility
charges rises and other factors are expected to cause the pace to
surpass the year-end target of 4.5 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the final quarter, however, the harvest of farm crops and
stabilized prices of manufactured goods and utilities will push
down the inflation rate to the 4.5-percent level.

<HEADLINE> Air France Europe to Cancel Flights Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Air France Europe, formerly called
Air Inter, today decided to cancel most of its flights from the
Orly airport Thursday, except those to Corsica and eight
provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the company's leaders hours after
several trade unions of pilots and ground staff called for a
24-hour strike Thursday, the day when Christian Blanc,
president-general director of Air France Europe, is due to
announce several decisions concerning the future of the company.
</P>
<P>
But the company will keep flights from the Roisy-Charles de
Gaulle airport and rotations between several provincial cities,
said AFP reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Air France will postpone its flights to the Indian
Ocean islands, the Antille islands and the Magreb countries
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some trade unions have urged a stop to the closing of 18 lines
by Air France Europe, an immediate stop to the process of merger
with Air France, development of the company and its employment, as
well as "maintenance of the whole of the company's activities."

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan to Hold Talks on Semi-Conductors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Europe and Japan are to hold a
further round of talks in Tokyo on a global deal on computer chips
after "encouraging" progress at last week's G-7 summit in France.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the talks will be to narrow and, if possible,
eliminate any remaining divergences in the European and Japanese
approaches to future international cooperation on market access in
the semi-conductor industry," an EC spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Japan will hold separate negotiations with the United States the
following day on the future of its bilateral semi-conductor
agreement which expires at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. wants to renew the agreement it signed with Japan in
1991 which guaranteed U.S. chip manufacturers at least 20 percent
of the Japanese market. The U.S. claims it needs some
kind of framework to ensure foreign growth in the Japanese
semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
But Japan says the market is now open to foreign players and
opposes a bilateral accord with the U.S., preferring to go for a
global computer chip deal.
</P>
<P>
It has been backed by the European Union which supports a
trilateral or multilateral arrangement for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The EC has also said it is also consulting with the U.S. on a
trilateral arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Arrives in Tashkent for State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here today to begin a two-day state visit to Uzbekistan to
"deepen mutual understanding and friendship, and enhance bilateral
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Uzbekistan by a Chinese head of
state. Jiang was greeted at the airport by Speaker of the Supreme
Assembly of Uzbekistan Erkin Khalilov, Foreign Minister Abdulyaziz
Kamilov and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the airport, Jiang said China
and Uzbekistan are good close neighbors and have traditional
friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the positive results of Sino-Uzbek
cooperation in every field over the past few years," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches importance to its relations with Uzbekistan,
and believes such relations are not only in conformity with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also beneficial to
world peace, stability and development," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Jiang is expected to hold talks with his
Uzbek counterpart Islam Karimov and Speaker Khalilov.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Jiang's arrival, President Karimov presided over a
welcome ceremony at the Dyrmen State Guest House in honor of the
Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan is an important state in central Asia. China
recognized that country soon after its independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here at the invitation of President Karimov,
after winding up his four-day state visit to Romania. This was the
fourth leg of Jiang's six-nation tour which will also take him to
Kyrghyzstan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President had made successful state visits to Spain
and Norway during his current European and central Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> HPV Virus a Major Cause of Cervical Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Women should have smear tests at
least once every three to five years to help detect and treat
cervical cancer which annually kills more than 300,000 women
worldwide, the World Health Organization said today.
</P>
<P>
Experts have confirmed that a virus known as the human papilloma
virus (HPV) is a major cause of cervical cancer, which is
contracted by some half a million women every year, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five specialists from 17 countries who recently attended
a meeting in Geneva, held HPV responsible for this global health
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women
worldwide and the most common in developing countries where it
kills 225,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
The disease is strongly linked with the early onset of sexual
activity and multiple sexual partners. The WHO said more than 90
percent of new cases worldwide are due to sexually transmitted
HPV infection of the cervix.
</P>
<P>
The global public health body urged women to have cervical
smear tests at least once every three or five years as early
detection makes it possible to cure the disease by surgery or
radiotherapy.
</P>
<P>
In Canada and Finland, for example, early detection of
precancerous lesions through cytological screening has helped
reduce mortality rates by up to 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Asks Prime Ministers to Pardon Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk
today asked the country's Co-Prime Ministers to agree to a royal
pardon for an opposition newspaper editor who was jailed last week
for defaming them.
</P>
<P>
The king said the offense committed by Chan Ratana, editor of
the Khmer-language Voice of Khmer Youth newspaper, is "evident and
grave," but urged them to exercise Buddhist tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Chan was sued by the two prime ministers last February after
his paper, which supports the opposition Khmer Nation Party, ran a
cartoon and story entitled "Ranariddh is more stupid than Hun Sen
three times a day."
</P>
<P>
A municipal court found him guilty of spreading disinformation,
but an appeal court later changed the charge to defamation in
October.
</P>
<P>
He was jailed on Friday after the Supreme Court upheld the
appeal court ruling of one year's imprisonment and a fine of five
million riels (2,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Your gesture of clemency towards those who unjustly drag you
through the mud will not fail to further increase your
stature ... and will give more credibility and prestige to our
young and liberal democracy," the king wrote in a letter to his
son and First Prime Minister, Norodom Ranariddh, and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The king said he too had been a victim of slander by
journalists but he chose neither to respond to them, nor sue them.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that (you) will accept the inspiration of my example
to give to your enemies who are very unfair and unjustly insolent
to you the same Buddhist tolerance," the king wrote in the letter
released by the palace, but dated from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the king is entitled to grant anyone an
amnesty, but he said he wanted the support of both premiers before
making a decision.
</P>
<P>
Both the prime ministers later said they would support the
king.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Use of Contraceptives Doesn't Increase Risk of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Long-term use of contraceptive pills
does not increase the risk of breast cancer, the World Health
Organization (WHO) has said.
</P>
<P>
But there is a slightly higher risk among women who still use
the pill against those who stopped one to four years ago, the WHO
said.
</P>
<P>
Women who stopped using oral contraceptive pills 10 or more
years ago face the same level of risk of breast cancer as those
who have never used it, said the WHO, citing the results of a
large international study.
</P>
<P>
The findings confirmed the results of earlier studies which
showed no link between the long-term use of the pill and increased
risk of breast cancer, the WHO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
However, it is also found that the use of the pill does appear
to play a role in breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Compared with non-users, the risk of breast cancer is a little
higher among women still using the pill as well as those who had
used it but quit one to four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, women still using the pill are more vulnerable to the
disease than those who quit one to four years ago, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear whether the contraceptive itself to
blame for the risk increase, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Globally, hormonal contraceptives are used mainly by women
below the age of 35. The risk of breast cancer in this age group
is comparatively low, especially in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sees Sub-Saharan Africa Still in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa continues to
wallow in abject poverty despite efforts by the World Bank and
other organizations to improve the lot of the region's poor, a
senior World Bank official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting to discuss poverty alleviation at the
University of Zimbabwe, World Bank Vice-president for the Africa
region Callisto Madavo said the number of people living in
poverty was still high in many African countries, including
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The population living on less than one U.S. Dollar a day
increased from 1.2 billion in 1987 to 1.3 billion in 1993 in the
world and most of this increase was in sub-Saharan Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Africa is facing a major challenge as the number of poor is
growing, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately the growth rate in most economies averages two
percent when the population grows by about 2.8 percent,
negatively affecting the per capita basis," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the suffering of the poor, the World Bank offical
promised a five-fold increase in lending for human capital
development.
</P>
<P>
"I personally experienced poverty in my youth and I am
committed to reducing poverty not only in my country (Zimbabwe)
and the continent, but globally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Madavo arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday on his first official visit
since being appointed to the post two months ago.

MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin was
ahead of his political rival -- Gennady Zyuganov across the
country in the presidential run-off election, according to an
early exit poll of the CNN television.
</P>
<P>
The poll, taking in just 118 of 93,000 polling stations, showed

</P>
<P>
However, the exit poll, conducted by the US Mitofsky Institute,

<HEADLINE> France's Oldest Overseas School to Celebrate Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France and Greece will celebrate in
September the 150th anniversary of the founding of the French
School in Athens (EFA), the school's headmaster said here today.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Greek President Constantine
Stephanopulos are expected to send messages of congratulations to
the school, and the prime ministers of the two countries will
attend the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The EFA, set up in 1846 to study ancient Greek culture, was the
first school France established overseas. It has developed into a
prestigious center for archeological studies and excavations.
</P>
<P>
It began archeological research in 1870, the year France and
Germany fought a war, to "compete with German science."
</P>
<P>
Headmaster Roland Etienne said, "The major framework of the
time has not changed too much, but we keep finding new fields of
interest in sub-marine excavations, arts and literature, and
environment designs."
</P>
<P>
The school now has a research staff of nine and offers
programs for about 40 students studying for a doctorate degree in
Greek culture.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 150 years, the EFA has discovered dozens of
monuments, hundreds of statues, thousands of inscriptions and tens
of thousands of coins dating back to ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the EFA, France has four other schools established
abroad specializing in the study of foreign cultures - in Rome,
Cairo, Vietnam and Madrid.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Israel, Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela plans to visit Israel and Palestine next month to
support the middle east peace process, but no date has been
finalized, South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, Mankahlana said the
president had accepted an invitation by former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres to visit the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a new government under Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu is now in power will not affect the president's first
state visit to Israel, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mankahlana said Mandela would also visit Palestine
and meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) used to
condemn Israel for its policies on the Palestinians. Arafat was
one of many leading overseas ANC supporters, who were invited to
Mandela's inauguration as president in 1994.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Mandela is prepared to meet leaders of the
extremist Hamas movement responsible for a spate of bombing in
Israel, Mankahlana said the president would meet anyone who had a
role to play in the peace process, "only if he has time."

MAPUTO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said here today that a mechanism will be set up to
fight the "family violence" against women.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while opening the First
National Congress of the Organization of Mozambican Mothers
(OMM), which was founded in Dar es salaam, Tanzania, 23 years
ago to fight for the independence of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Family violence is an expression of the unequal relations
between men and women and constitutes an obstacle to "social
stability and harmony", he said.
</P>
<P>
A temporary sanctuary should be established for those women
who are attacked by men, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 250 delegates of the congress will discuss the
achievements made by the OMM and the difficulties it met with in
the last five years.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today the Chinese government is willing to work together with
the Uzbek government and make unremitting efforts to upgrade the
friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet hosted by Uzbek President Islam Karimov, Jiang
said "the moment we set foot on your beautiful country, we were
impressed by your friendly feelings toward the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to see that Uzbekistan has made great
achievements in maintaining social stability, developing national
economy and expanding exchanges with neighboring countries, as
well as other countries in the world, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Two thousand years ago, the ancient 'Silk Road' joined our two
countries closely together; since the establishment of diplomatic
ties, we have deepened our mutual understanding and friendship and
expanded our exchanges and cooperation," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said both China and Uzbekistan, which are concentrating on
building their own countries, desire for a long-term stable
international environment and equal and mutually-beneficial
cooperation and good-neighborly relationship.
</P>
<P>
He wished Uzbekistan stability, prosperity and happiness.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said Uzbekistan and China had once been the two
important centers on the great "Silk Road," and today "we are
making joint efforts to revive this important passageway linking
the east and west."
</P>
<P>
He said Uzbekistan aims at building itself into a prosperous
country with a developed market economy, democracy and law and
order.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, his five-year-old republic is eager to
safeguard and consolidate regional peace and stability, protect
civil and ethnic harmony, and strengthen national independence and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said the foundation for Uzbek-Chinese economic and trade
cooperation has already been laid and at present both sides should
"be more determined to explore for new fields in which the
existing potential can be tapped more effectively."
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang's current visit would be helpful
in turning the great potential in bilateral economic relations
into reality.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President arrived here today to begin a two-day
state visit to the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Almost three times more
professionals are emigrating from South Africa than the number
being replaced by new arrivals this year, according to a study
released in Pretoria by the Central Statistical Service (CSS)
today.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted after the Department of Home Affairs
introduced a system whereby all South African residents leaving
the country had to complete a departure form.
</P>
<P>
The system is implemented only at the international airports
of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, because about 97 percent
of emigrants left the country via the three cities.
</P>
<P>
The sutdy shows 3083 emigrants left the country in the first
quarter of 1996, compared with 1118 immigrants entering the
country in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The number of emigrants was 27 percent higher than that of the
same period of last year, while the number of immigrants
decreased by 21.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in a net loss of 1965 people who were
economically active, the study indicated.
</P>
<P>
Education related occupations also saw a loss of 132 people,
with only 27 new arrivals capable of filling the vacated
positions.
</P>
<P>
An example is that 39 medical and dental professionals left
during that period, while only 18 professionals arrived in South
Africa, the study said.

and National Heritage Francis Lotodo today appealed to the
public and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) to co-operate with
the government to solve the street children problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing hundreds of street children,
government officials and NGO representatives involved in street
children programs here during the Street Youth Festival, which
was launched by Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi in Nakuru on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that street children pose a potential problem to the

at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Kenya has a total of 40,000 street
children scattered in the country's main urban centers
"where they live below human habitation conditions."
</P>
<P>
He called on all Kenyans and organisations to come forward
and assist the governmen in finding a lasting solution to the
problem of street children.
</P>
<P>
He said the government alone could not address the problem due
to a lack of funds and hailed NGOs involved in street
children for supplementing the government's efforts and urged
them to continue with the same spirit.
</P>
<P>
He called for programmatic action and programs to
rehabilitate street children by providing them with better
social amenities, education, and technical training counselling.

Henry Kevin Mckinney, 36, had been accused of beating Kang

Kang, 39, fell and hit her head and later died of a brain

Prosecutors had demanded a 15-year term for the American.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reaffirms Land-For-Peace Principle in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 3 (Xinhua) -- An envoy of the United States
reaffirmed Washington's adherence to the land-for-peace principle
as a peace foundation in the region after meeting with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of his talks with the Lebanese
president, Richard Jones, U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, denied
he had received any instructions indicating a change of the
U.S. position on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning a retreat in the U.S. position
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking office
last month, the American diplomat said, "I have not received any
instructions indicating that."
</P>
<P>
"The instructions I received from Washington reiterate and
reaffirm a persistence in the bases of the peace process," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Israeli prime minister's opposition to
the principle of exchanging land for peace, Jones noted that the
U.S. administration still upholds this principle as a foundation
for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The United States' position on this issue is clear," he said,
"we depend on the land-for-peace principle and I don't think
there is a doubt in it."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu has his special opinions and analyses, but we have
our position," the U.S. envoy added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the Madrid principles were "foundations of the
peace process" and U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338
are the bases through which the progress had been achieved in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see that the U.S. position on these problems has
changed," the diplomat emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Tuesday that the land-for-peace principle was
not the basis of the Madrid conference in October, 1991, which
started the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Talking to foreign reporters in Jerusalem, the Israeli Likud
leader said that "the framework of Madrid does not include the
land-for-peace statement."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the Madrid conference included
U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for the return of
captured Arab land, but said Israel had complied with them by
handing the vast Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt under the 1978 Camp
David accords.
</P>
<P>
"We have our own interpretation of what is land-for-peace and
how much land was given." he said, "As you know Israel so far has
given over 90 percent of the land that came under its control in
a war of self-defense," a reference to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war
in which the Jewish state seized Egypt's Sinai, Syria's Golan
Heights, West Bank and the Arab east Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Britain Call for Resumption of Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein and British
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called here today for a resumption
of the Middle East peace process in order to achieve a comprehensive
and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind told a press conference after his talks with the king
that they exchanged views on the latest developments in the region
concerning the peace process and bilateral ties as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that other topics discussed were the international
fight against terrorism as well as the Iraqi issue, especially
U.N. resolution 986 and the oil-for-food deal between Baghdad and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said he briefed the king on the outcome of the G-7
summit held in France last week.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind stressed that his country welcomes the results of
last month's Arab summit in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary is on his two-nation Middle East
tour, including Saudi Arabia, which aims at promoting
the Middle East peace process in view of Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu's election as Israeli prime minister, who opposes
trading land for peace.

<P>
AMMAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The joint Jordanian-Yemeni High
Committee opened a two-day meeting here today to discuss
bilateral economic and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, co-chaired by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti and his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani, will
discuss how to promote trade and cultural exchanges and cooperation in

political and economic relations among Arab states on the
basis of integration and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of achieving a real progress in
peace talks on all tracks, saying that the resolution passed by
the Arab summit last month in Cairo was the best example of
coordinated Arab stands on various issues.

<HEADLINE> Bank Official Arrested on Charges of Helping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's security forces today
arrested an employee of the Suez Branch of the National Bank on
charges of helping Islamic fundamentalist militants cash forged
bank checks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted an Interior
Ministry source as saying that Mahmoud Saleh Ahmed helped Helmi
Azazi, a militant who has been arrested, in cashing checks.
</P>
<P>
But Ahmed denied that he knew Azazi, who was involved in
terrorist activities, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The checks were sent to Azazi by Yasser Tawfik, a wanted
terrorist who is still at large abroad, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed will be released on bail, MENA added.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, there has been a violent confrontation
between police and Islamic militants seeking to install strict
Islamic rule in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The militants have carried out many terrorist attacks on
tourists, civilians as well as policemen.
</P>
<P>
In another development, police killed a suspected Islamic
militant in Abu Kurkas, Minya province in southern Egypt, early
today, MENA reported.
</P>
<P>
The militant, who was involved in several terrorist operations,
was shot dead during a shoot-out with police who came to his
hideout in a plantation trying to arrest him, according to MENA.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Sends Letter to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
has sent a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, stressing
Greece's strong commitment to reducing tensions in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent Tuesday and released today, was replying a
letter from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the Greek premier expressed concern that Turkey
had still not withdrawn statements challenging Greek sovereignty
of the inhabited Greek island of Gavdos, off southern Crete,
despite Ankara's assurances to the U.S. government that it did not
mean to question the sovereignty of Gavdos.
</P>
<P>
In May, a Turkish officer taking part in the planning of a NATO
exercise in Naples had asked Gavdos to be excluded from plans,
saying that the island's legal status was "in doubt."
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of tensions, provided it is achieved in a way
that does not compromise sovereignty, is a necessary first step
towards the creation of a climate of good faith and mutual
understanding," Simitis said in his letter. But he stressed that
much of the tension in the Aegean was the direct result of
"massive and intentional" violations of Greek airspace and
territorial waters by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Stopping the practice of "systematic violations" was of utmost
importance, Simitis said, adding that this would contribute to
reducing tensions and the gradual restoration of confidence
between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Simitis expressed agreement to Clinton's views on activating
the 1988 accords signed by the then Greek and Turkish foreign
ministers, Karolos Papoulias and Mesut Yilmaz. If the accords were
implemented with good faith and common sense, they would reduce
the risk of dangerous incidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Simitis said, had already unilaterally implemented the
provisions of the accord.
</P>
<P>
He also accepted in principle the idea of instituting a hotline
between Greece and Turkey within a NATO framework.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Clears Over 28,000 Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The demining project in
Ethiopia has cleared over 28,000 anti-personnel and tank mines
and defused explosives since it started operation last September,
the Defense Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry quoted training head of the campaign Lt. Estay
Gebre-Selassie as saying that Between last September and this
April, the project has demined or defused 28,175 anti-personnel
and tank mines as well as explosives.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Estay said the disposal squads deployed both in eastern
and northern Ethiopia are still engaged in mine-clearing
activities in a bid to save the lives of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Another mines disposal group currently under training is to be
assigned in the southern and south-western parts of the country
for a similar mission, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there is an estimated ten million mines in
Ethiopia and Eritrea where war had been raging for three decades,
reducing land to unproductivity and killing a lot of people and
animals every year.

<HEADLINE> Woman Power Noted in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Woman power in Zambia to filter
their way into positions of responsibility was stressed at a
seminar in Kabwe, north of Lusaka, today.
</P>
<P>
"Under the changed environment, we want every Zambian to
effectively contribute to the nation's development process and
women workers should be no exception to this strategy," said Alex
Chirwa, secretary general of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions
when opening the three-day women leadership seminar.
</P>
<P>
He challenged women leaders to come up with policies and
strategies which would meet the needs of women workers, saying
"we want to give you a leverage in addressing issues pertaining
to women because we believe you understand these issues better
than we the menfolk."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Gerd Emil Lieser, resident
representative of the Friedrich Ebert Stefung Fees in Zambia,
said women need to believe that they have both the right and the
ability to take on more responsibility as social attitudes which
consign women to the home or to under value and under paid jobs
undermine women's confidence in themselves.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the need to understand the barrier that has
prevented women's full participation at higher levels in all
aspects of society.
</P>
<P>
At present, not a few Zambian women get jobs in government
departments and business companies. However, the large number of
women in the country, particularly in the countryside, are
difficult to match with their male folks.
</P>
<P>
They have to do heavy manual labor in farming fields. Even
though they come to cities and towns, most of them make a living
as street vendors with low incomes.

megawatt through hydro-power and subterranean steam generation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said close to 588.1 million Birr (about 93
million US Dollars) have been allocated for the construction of
power stations.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has used 23 percent of the hydro-power potential it
has with only 5 percent of its population using electric power,
it was reported here.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firm to Invest 200 Mln US Dlrs in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian company has agreed to
invest 200 million U.S. dollars in Cuba despite the threats of
lawsuits by Cuban Americans and denial of entry into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Vancouver-based Wilton Properties Ltd. forged a 400 million
U.S. dollar deal Monday with Cuba's hotel firm Gran Caribe to
jointly develop 11 hotels and other tourist facilities throughout
the Caribbean island country.
</P>
<P>
The two will split the costs of the venture equally. They also
have formed a company called Vancuba Holdings SA of Havana to
oversea construction, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
This project represents the first major investment for a
Canadian company in Cuba's tourism industry. Construction of the
first hotel is expected to begin next year.
</P>
<P>
The deal is considered the biggest foreign investment in Cuba
since the U.S. introduced its hardline Helms-Burton law to
discourage foreign investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Cuba law allows U.S. citizens and companies to launch
lawsuits against foreign firms operating on former U.S. property
expropriated by Cuba. It also allows the U.S. to bar foreign
executives of those companies from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government and companies have vehemently opposed
the U.S. legislation ever since. Monday's agreement is a direct
challenge to the tough U.S. anti-Cuba law.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely Canadians will continue to increase their stake
in Cuba in the months to come," a former Cuban analyst with the
U.S. government was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Leaves Short-Term Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
decided to keep the short-term interest rates unchanged after its
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded a two-day meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to leave rates steady at least for the time being
had been expected by many economists who said that the Fed wants
to see more information on the economy before changing the
interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy was expanding at an annual rate of 2.2 percent
in the first quarter and at a more speedy pace in the second
quarter. But the inflation has been kept under well control
although the unemployment rate was as low as around 5.6 percent in
the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a widespread belief that the U.S. Fed is about
to begin applying the brakes to the U.S. economy. Many analysts
believe the Fed will wait no longer than its next meeting on
August 20 before beginning to raise rates.
</P>
<P>
The Fed sets interest rate policy eight times a year at
meetings of its FOMC, composed of the Fed's seven board members in
Washington and five of its 12 regional bank presidents.
</P>
<P>
The two-day FOMC meeting marked the first session to be
attended by two new Fed members. Former White House budget
director Alice Rivlin was sworn in as vice chairman last week and
St. Louis economist Laurence H. Meyer took office as a Fed
governor.
</P>
<P>
The last time when the U.S. Fed changed from easing credit
conditions to tightening was in February 1994. It raised the
federal fund rate, the interest that banks charge each other, from
3 percent to 6 percent by February 1995, putting brake on the
overheating economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed also cut the federal funds rate for three times
between July 1995 and January of this year. The rate is 5.25
percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted the Fed will at most increase rates
to 6 percent this year to get inflation under control. That would
leave the funds rate exactly where it was before the Fed began
loosening a year ago.

<HEADLINE> US Probes Possible Conspirators Outside Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investigators have
identified individuals who had conducted surveillance of several
U.S. military housing sites in Saudi Arabia before last week's
truck bombing there.
</P>
<P>
These identified individuals passed through a certain Arab
nation and possibly some other Middle East countries, according
to a report published in the Washington Post today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were quoted by the report as saying that the
discovery is among several indications that have led U.S.
intelligence officials to adopt a new working hypotheses that
those involved in the attack had planned and carried out the blast
with help from colleagues in one or more nations besides Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investigators have assumed that the extensive surveillance
efforts at sensitive military facilities were preparations for the
truck bombing Tuesday last week that killed 19 American soldiers
and injured several hundred American and Saudi servicemen at the
air base near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official privy to the information about persons who
conducted surveillance of the military sites emphasized, however,
that it was "very sketchy information" in terms of resolving
whether these individuals were connected to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"It is bits and pieces ... and not very conclusive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other speculation about the potential involvement of persons
outside Saudi Arabia is centered on the enormous amount of
explosives used for truck bomb -- around 5,000 pounds, which the
U.S. investigators have speculated was imported from some other
countries into Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has dispatched FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh to Saudi Arabia and the officials said Freeh plans to visit
the blast site, talk with senior Saudi officials and get direct
briefings from some of 70 FBI agents and other U.S. investigators
who are already in the country.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Flight Crews Vote To Go On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- British Airways flight crews voted
today by 90 percent to go on strike over the pay dispute.
</P>
<P>
The strike could take place within two weeks, hitting summer
holidays, said the British Airline Pilots' Association.
</P>
<P>
Pilots and flight engineers are angry at what they see as an
attempt by the airline to cut their pay. Pilots average 50,000
pounds (75,000 US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of British Airways, Bob Dobayling told a
press conference before the ballot was cast that "if they (the
pilots' union BALPA) do call any industrial action, they must by
law give us at least seven days' notice."
</P>
<P>
He added British Airways was happy to talk to the BALPA at any
time, saying he was ready to do anything reasonable "in the
interests of customers and the company as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Chris Darke of the BALPA told BBC radio, "We're not going to
announce we'll take action today. We're going give the company
some time to reflect on the ballot result in the hope we could
avoid a strike which would be extremely damaging to the future of
the company."
</P>
<P>
The row began about four years ago when British Airways took
over Dan Air and paid their pilots less than its own flight crews.

<HEADLINE> Thousand Demonstrate in Paris to Support the "Paperless" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- About one thousand people
demonstrated this afternoon in Paris in support of the
"paperless" -- foreigners living in France without residence
papers from the government.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the "Ile-de-France" organization which groups
the paperless, in coordination with sympathetic groups and
political parties, the demonstrators called for the provision by
the government of residence papers, the abolition of the Pasqua
laws and the lifting of anti-immigration restrictions.
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, the paperless people have
intensified their movement to gain their right to work and live in
France. About 300 Africans occupied the Church of Saint-Ambroise
in Paris in March in protest of the refusal by the government to
give them residence papers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was a direct reaction to a decision taken on
June 26 by the government to allow only 46 of a group of 100
paperless people to stay for one more year.

<HEADLINE> US Militia Arsenal of Weapons, Explosives Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the Independence
Day, U.S. federal agents Tuesday seized large amount of weapons
and ammunition from the homes of "Viper Militia" members, who were
accused of plotting to blow up government buildings, local media
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
(ATF) said four trucks of shotguns, rifles, metal boxes and large
wooden crates were found in the Phoenix home of Gary Bauer, who
and 11 other militia members were charged on Monday with plotting
to blast government buildings in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
The members were plotting to use explosives to destroy
buildings housing offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), ATF, Internal Revenue Service, Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the Secret Service, the Phoenix Police
Department and the Arizona National Guard, according to Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
In the homes of other members of the militia, weapons,
ammunition, militia training manuals, "Viper Team" insignia
patches and survival books were found.
</P>
<P>
Also seized were a riot smoke grenade, gas masks, a Japanese
bolt action rifle, manuals for using grenade launchers, as well as
about 700 pounds of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer used in the
Oklahoma City bombing last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday praised the law enforcement
officers. "Their dedication and hard work over the last six months
may have saved many lives," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Leaders Warn Against Pre-election Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- British business leaders urged the
British government Tuesday to avoid damaging the stable economic
climate by offering unjustified tax cuts as a pre-election bribe,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The call came as the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC),
representing 200,000 businesses, opened its annual convention in
Birmingham amid warnings that some sectors of the economy remained
vulnerable, particularly manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has said that he will
not jeopardize the economic recovery by tax-cutting, business
leaders remain unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
Some business leaders said that the need for economic stability
could not be "overstressed", and firms were in search of lasting
gains from policy stability, rather than short-term incentives
such as capital allowances.
</P>
<P>
Robin Geldard, president of the BCC, said: "We do not wish to
see economic prudence cast to the wind for the sake of political
expediency, and we urge the Chancellor not to be seduced into a
tax-cutting budget which we cannot afford".
</P>
<P>
Geldard said that two years of steady economic growth were
bearing fruit, with inflation, public borrowing and unemployment
figures going in the right direction, even though manufacturing
remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
But the forthcoming election threatened a period of political
turbulence as politicians sought popularity and advantage, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the government to be careful in reducing tax on
businesses, urging the government to reform and simplify the
taxation system rather than to push through expedient cuts to win
support.

<HEADLINE> Salim Urges China to Play Bigger role in Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary
general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), today urged
china to enlarge her role in maintaining peace and fostering
socio-economic development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a visit to the Chinese embassy in Yaounde, capital of
Cameroon and the venue of the forthcoming 32nd OAU summit
meeting, Salim said the recent African tour by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin has opened "a new chapter" on Sino-African relations.
</P>
<P>
Salim paid a three-hour visit to the Chinese embassy, saying
he especially chose to visit it "out of his special feelings for
China."
</P>
<P>
"I have received invitations from many embassies and
organizations in Yaounde. But I think the Chinese embassy will be
the only one that I should pay a visit here before the
conference," he told Chinese ambassador to Cameroon, Zhu
You-rong.
</P>
<P>
Salim and his aides arrived here last weekend to prepare for
the two-day OAU Council of Ministers meeting starting Thursday
and for the summit from July 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
On President Jiang's recent African tour, Salim said it
"renewed the friendly relations" between China and Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Africa and China has a history of friendship. We are
expecting China to play a bigger role in Africa's development
because we know that China is our friend in need," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim said China should play an active role in helping
Africa's economic integration process which would be on top of
the agenda of the OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief heaped glowing words on the old generation of
Chinese leaders, saying late chairman Mao Zedong and late premier
Zhou Enlai "put the Sino-African relations on top of the agenda
of the Chinese diplomacy" and had "special feelings for their
African brothers."
</P>
<P>
He said President Jiang's visit had renewed this "special
relationship".
</P>
<P>
President Jiang is the first top Chinese leader to visit
Africa since late premier Zhou's two African tours in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Jiang delivered a keynote speech on Sino-African relations at
the OAU headquarters in Addia Ababa and donated 1.2 million US
Dollars to the African Peace Fund which was established in 1995.

<HEADLINE> 9 Ministers of Afghan New Cabinet to Be Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Nine ministers appointed by
Afghan new Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar will be sworn in
tonight, said a report coming from Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Afghan presidential spokesman Abdul Aziz
Murad as saying that this was a major step in the development of
the new government, although a lot more work has to be done.
</P>
<P>
The nine ministers' appointments were announced late Wednesday
by Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani who had made a
reconciliation with one of his arch rivals Hezb-i-Islami
(Hekmatyar group) and set up a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine portfolios, the minister of defense has been
assigned to Hekmatyar's top intelligence chief Wahidullah
Sabawoon, while Hekmatyar's political advisor Abdul Haddi
Arghandewal will take the office of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's former defense minister, Mohammed Yunus Qanooni, will
lead the new Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Shah Ahmedzai from Ittehad-i-Islami, another party allied
with Rabbani, will be the minister of education while Qiamuddin
Kashaf, another Ittehad member, will take the Ministry of
Information and Culture.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say who will take the remaining four of the
nine portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there would be 26 portfolios in the new
coalition government. But many positions are left vacant because
of controversial nominations.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar arrived in Kabul last Wednesday and took oath as the
prime minister of the new coalition government.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Parliament Elects Speaker to End Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's parliament elected a
new speaker today, ending a month-long confrontation between the
ruling and opposition parties which has delayed the opening of the
new National Assembly following April's general election.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the rival parties re-started negotiations to
resolve the dispute in the face of mounting public criticism over
the political standoff.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, ruling New Korea Party nominee Kim Soo-han, and
two deputy speakers were finally elected today after the two
sides ironed out almost all their differences.
</P>
<P>
The opening of parliament had been stalled since its first
session on June 5 when the main opposition National Congress for
New Politics joined forces with the United Liberal Democrats
to prevent a speaker being elected.
</P>
<P>
They were protesting at the way the NKP had recaptured the
overall majority it lost in the elections by poaching other new
members of parliament, mainly independents.
</P>
<P>
Enraged by the recruitment campaign, the opposition camp
accused the ruling party of reversing the voters' choice of its
minority role in the parliament and said the recruits had been
bullied into joining.
</P>
<P>
The opposition was also furious over an official investigation
into election irregularities that they said unfairly targetted the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The new speaker, 68-year-old Kim Soo-han, has been elected to the
National Assembly six times and had served as spokesman and senior
member of opposition parties before joining the ruling NKP in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He was elected on the ruling party's national representation
ticket in the general elections on April 11. He is a long-time
associate of NKP leader President Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
Parliament also elected Oh Se-eung of the ruling NKP and Kim
Young-bae of the main opposition National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP) vice speakers at the resumed session.
</P>
<P>
To make up for time lost during the dispute, the ruling and
opposition parties agreed to open a three-week extraordinary
session on July 8 to elect the National Assembly standing
committee chairman and deal with other pending issues.

KATHMANDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
implemented a technology transfer and development project in a bid
to transform and develop imported technologies to meet the
national needs, officials said at a seminar here today.
</P>
<P>
The project, under the Ministry of Industry, also aims to
encourage the promotion of the existing technologies in the
country, especially by providing them to private sectors for
widespread application.
</P>
<P>
The ministry organized the seminar to study various
technologies being used in the country's industrial sector and the
possibilities of importing appropriate technologies from foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that there is a growing need for new
technologies in Nepal as the country is undergoing a rapid
industrial development for the improvement of productivity.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, representatives of governmental agencies and
industries called for interaction between the government and the
business community to develop and transfer foreign technologies in
the country.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to launch a technological
bulletin in Nepal to ensure a regular information flow on new
technologies between local and international institutions.

<HEADLINE> US Auto Sales in June Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Auto sales in the United States
slowed abruptly in June, suggesting a slowdown in economic
growth, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales of cars and
light trucks in June slipped 2.4 percent from the same period a
year ago, while Toyota said its sales dropped 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Together with other auto makers that reported their results
earlier this week, June's auto sales dropped 1 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The downshifting pleased economists and Wall Street analysts
who greeted it as a sign that the economy was settling down to
a steadier pace and was less likely to overheat.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that by the end of the year, auto makers
will have sold just 14.8 million cars and trucks -- a sharp
slowdown from the 15.2 million annualized pace they kept in the
first six months of this year, and a sharp drop from last
month's 15.8 million level.
</P>
<P>
In Ford's case, its car sales dropped 4.6 percent in the first
half of the year, while light-truck sales rose 2.7 percent, the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Other auto makers posted mixed results this week. On Monday,
the Chrysler Corporation said its sales rose 1 percent from a
strong showing in June 1995. On Tuesday, the General Motors
Corporation said its sales dropped 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Salim Urges for Relieving of African Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim today
pressed for a common African stance to seek a lasting solution to
the debt problem of the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The debt problem has become a major development crisis of our
time," Salim told a press conference following the end of the
opening ceremony of the 64th OAU Council of Ministers meeting
which has entered into closed-door session in Yaounde, capital of
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to be the most serious single bottleneck of
Africa's economic breakthrough until we take a common stance to
blow it," said the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
Africa's outstanding debt rose by US$18 billion to a
historical high of US$320 billion at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
That means if the debt burden were shared equally among the
continent's estimated 680 million people, each African would have
to pay some US$490, an amount which outstrips average per capita
annual income in the region.
</P>
<P>
And the sub-Sahara region has a debt burden of over US$20
billion, roughly 40 percent of that being multi-lateral debt, 40
percent bilteral debt, and 20 percent commercial debt, according
to a report recently released by the African Development Bank
(ADP).
</P>
<P>
In an even more challenging picture, the debt obligations of
the 25 low income severely indebted countries in Africa are more
than 200 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP), several
times their export earnings.
</P>
<P>
"They simply cannot afford to pay. And nobody expects them to
pay. That's the irony of it," said a World Bank official who came
as an observer of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
These countries have to get official debt rescheduling -- to
get the debt to be rescheduled by the Paris Club in the case of
Official Development Aid (ODA) debts, and the London Club in the
case of the conmercial debt.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have to accept certain conditionalities, the
most important of which is the structural adjustment program
conditionalities.
</P>
<P>
Salim called for the international creditors to take sincere
measures to help relieve Africa's debt burdens and attach less
harsh conditionalities over the rescheduling of the debt.
</P>
<P>
So far, the international creditors have taken some measures
on the issue, including the conciliation or reduction of
concessional bilateral debt, support to the IDA buy back
facility.
</P>
<P>
Despite these measures, external debt is still increasing
every year and remains a major constraint to African development.
</P>
<P>
Even under the most optimistic assumptions, 24 African
countries will continue to face a debt burden which is
unsustainable -- as defined by the World Bank criteria -- until
well into the 21th century.
</P>
<P>
African countries have begun to realize the need to take a
common stance in fighting the "debt war", according to Salim.
</P>
<P>
"We could not afford any delay," he said, adding that the debt
issue would be of prime concern for the OAU Council of Ministers
meeting which today began its two-day closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said the council of ministers meeting is
expected to work out an special agenda on the debt issue to be
submitted to the heads of state and government summit meeting
scheduled for July 8-10.

President Boris Yeltsin to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Yeltsin, fresh from his victory over his
political rival Gennady Zuyganov in yesterday's presidential
election, Chernomyrdin said he had been told to draft proposals
for a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister indicated opposition members could join the
government provided they agree with the course of its policies.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever color they are when they come into the government,
they immediately become all one color in the Cabinet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will be made up of people who know how to do
their jobs."
</P>
<P>
He said the new government should not be made up of
politicians defending the interests and benefits of a certain
party or organization, though some experts representing various
political ideas might enter the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But Chernomyrdin dismissed suggestions by Yeltsin's new
security chief Alexander Lebed that he should be made vice
president. Although the Russian constitution makes no provision
for such a post, Lebed has said he wants the job.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian law, the government must formally resign
after a presidential election and the president must propose his
candidate for prime minister to the parliament's lower chamber,
the State Duma, for approval. The Duma has no say over other
Cabinet members, who are approved by the president after being
proposed by the premier.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, the Duma speaker, has said that the lower
house would approve Chernomyrdin as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Increases in Kuwait, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Crime rate in Kuwait has
increased in recent years compared with that before the 1990 Gulf
Crisis, according to a study available here today.
</P>
<P>
Jassim Mohammed Karam, an assistant professor at Kuwait
University, said in his study supported by statistics and graphics
that in 1994, Kuwait reported 19,907 crimes, a ratio of 1171
crimes for every 100,000 inhabitants compared with 868 crimes for
every 100,000 inhabitants in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The study said crimes related to theft and violence have
increased after Kuwait was liberated by U.S.-led allied forces
from Iraqi occupation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, murder cases stood at 27, attempted murders, 144,
cases of breaking into houses, 239, attempted kidnapings, 174,
and cases of suicide, 69, the study says.
</P>
<P>
Drug related crimes numbered 394 in 1995, with 644 persons
accused.
</P>
<P>
However, the study does not give details of why crimes
increased in Kuwait after 1990.
</P>
<P>
The professor called upon psychologists, socialists and
scientists to cooperate and study the reasons behind the increase
in crime rate.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Humanitarian Aid for Kyrgyzstan and Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
here today that it has approved a package of humanitarian aid,
including food and medical aid, for Kyrgyzstan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The grant for Kyrgyzstan, worth 3.6 million ECU (about 4.9
million U.S. dollars) and channeled via the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will enable the Dutch and German
branches of the Red Cross and other non-governmental organizations
to carry out a co-ordinated program over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The EC said German Agro-Action and France Liberte, both aid
agencies, will look after the procurement and distribution of
basic foods including wheat, oil and sugar. The Dutch and German
branches of the Red Cross will concentrate on the medical part of
the program.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan obtained grants last year from the EC totalling
eight million ECU (about 10.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The aid for Sudan, worth 13.1 million ECU (about 17 million
U.S. dollars), will cover the most pressing needs of medical aid,
food and water supply projects to civilians caught in the on-going
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Due to ethnic and religious conflicts in this African country,
the Muslim government in the north and the rebel south have fought
two civil wars. The first civil war lasted for 17 years from 1955
to 1972, and the second civil war started in 1983 and is still
raging.
</P>
<P>
Part of the EC grant will support humanitarian aid
operations in and around the capital Khartoum in the north, where
1.9 million refugees from other provinces are concentrated and
living in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
The EC grant will also fund ECHO flights which ferry goods
and passengers for humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
So far, Sudan has got 61 million ECU (about 80 million dollars)
from ECHO, helping to ease the suffering of those caught up in the
civil war.

TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Ghana beat Japan 3-1 in a friendly
soccer match ahead of the Atlanta Olympic Games in Urawa on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan took the lead in the 22nd minute when Teruyoshi Ito
slammed a rebound into the African net after keeper Simon Addo
intercepted a Japanese pass.
</P>
<P>
But Ghana, bronze medallists at Barcelona, fought back and kept
the ball for most of the time in the second half, repeatedly
threatening the Japanese goal.
</P>
<P>
Japanese keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi punched out the ball when
forward Duah Emmanuel stormed through between two defenders to
fire a lightning shot in the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
But Charles Akunnor produced an angled pass from the right for
Ahinful, who struck home into the left corner in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
Eleven minutes later, Augustin Akunnor made another golden
chance on Nii Aryee Welbeck's kick from the righthand
corner. Ahinful completed the move with a right-footer for the
decider.
</P>
<P>
It was sweet revenge for Ghana for the two defeats they
suffered in Japan when they visited Nagoya and Kobe in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Workers' Salaries Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwe cabinet minister today
announced salary increments of up to 27 percent for domestic
workers and said civil servants will be awarded a cost of living
adjustment to cushion the negative impact of high prices.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro said at a news conference that the Zimbabwean economy
could this year absorb ''reasonable'' salary increases although
these would have to be based on the employers' ability to pay and
the productivity of workers in the private sector and
parastatals.
</P>
<P>
Due to good rains this year, Zimbabwe's economic growth in
1996/97 is projected at 7.1 percent, while the inflation rate,
which currently stands at over 24 percent, is expected to drop to
about 20 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Key sectors of the economy -- agriculture, manufacturing and
mining -- are expected to register positive growth rates of 18
percent, six percent and 13 percent, respectively, this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, ''it appears that there is adequate scope
for collective bargaining to prevail in the private sector. In
view of the foregoing, I believe that the economy will be in a
position to absorb reasonable wage increments compensating for
rises in the cost of living.''
</P>
<P>
She said the public service commission would soon announce the
1996/97 wage and salary increases, including the cost of living
adjustment for civil servants to cushion the negative impact of

<HEADLINE> China Important to World Peace: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China has already a leading role
to play in contributing to international peace and security as a
permanent member of the UN Security Council, said Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
</P>
<P>
In his luncheon address to the Australian Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong this afternoon, Downer said that as China's economy
modernizes and expands to be one of the world's three biggest
economies early next century, its regional and global influence
will become even more apparent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the way China approaches its renunciation goals
over the coming years will be important to all regional countries,
since it makes a significant impact on major strategic
relationships.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Australia's trade with China has more
than doubled over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
"But in just three years, contracted Australian investment in
China has expanded almost six-folds, from 800 million Australian
dollars to over 4.5 billion Australian dollars," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is now Australia's sixth largest trading
partner and two-way trade between the two sides is likely to
approach 8 billion Australian dollars (6.2 billion US dollars)
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
After July 1997, "the combined markets of Hong Kong and China
will constitute Australia's second-largest trading partner,"
although of course Hong Kong will maintain its economic autonomy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Hong Kong, he said that China's commitment
to the formula of "one country, two systems" is an undertaking of
great significance, adding that the formula will allow Hong Kong
and the international business community to plan for the future in
Hong Kong with confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said, "what has been promised under the Joint Declaration
and the Basic Law lays a solid foundation for a continuation of
Hong Kong's prosperity and way of life."
</P>
<P>
Downer arrived here on Tuesday from Seoul, the Republic of
Korea. During his stay in Hong Kong, he met with Australian
businessmen, Hong Kong government officials and the members of the
Preparatory Committee (PC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, including PC's vice-chairmen Tung Chee-hwa and Leung
Chun-ying.
</P>
<P>
The Australian foreign minister left here for Hanoi, Vietnam,
this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Say Extra-Budgetary Funds Must Be Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's financial departments must
take a tough stand on the control and spending of extra-budgetary
funds to prevent further government corruption and waste, many
Chinese lawmakers requested today.
</P>
<P>
Former Beijing leaders Chen Xitong and Wang Baosen "have
taught us a grave lesson in this matter," said Xu Jing, member of
the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang committed suicide because he feared prosecution for
corruption charges. Chen resigned as Party Chief of Beijing
because of his involvement in Wang's case.
</P>
<P>
Members of the top legislative body were reviewing reports
given yesterday by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and General
Auditor Guo Zhenqian, that covered final accounts of central
finance and the auditing results on the budget enforcement by
central government departments.
</P>
<P>
The extra-budgetary funds exceeded 200 billion yuan in 1995,
accounting for more than half of the central budgetary revenues,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
"Such a tremendous amount of state money under the control of
government departments without strict control would mean waste and
corruption," said Wu Shuqing, member of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Another legislator, He Wanfen, said the country must resolve
this problem, otherwise "the money earned by the people through
hard labor will continue to be drained from the state coffer, and
a number of officials would degenerate into corruption because of
the loose management system."
</P>
<P>
Guo's report exposed for the first time the fact that some
financial departments once inappropriately used state money to
invest in the security markets. Guo's report was highly praised by
legislators Huang Yuzhang and Hao Yichun.
</P>
<P>
They said the problems discovered by auditors must be taken
seriously by the financial and other departments. And auditors
"should continue to work this way," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Many other legislators said that too much money has been spent
to set up the local branches of the State Taxation Administration.
</P>
<P>
The excessive payments for tax collectors and bank employees
have affected fair distribution of incomes, and must be addressed,
said Liu Guoguang and Ye Shuhua.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers expressed their excitement for the report given
by the auditor-general. Another report, given by Wang Bingqian,
vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, detailed how the
environmental laws are enforced for their effective supervision
over relevant departments and localities.
</P>
<P>
"Such reports indicated that building of the socialist legal
system and supervision by the top legislature have been fruitful,"
said Feng Zhijun, member of NPC Standing Committee.

<P>
BISHKEK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China attaches great importance to cooperation and
contacts between the parliaments of China and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang held talks here today with Mukar Cholponbayev, speaker of
Kyrgyzstan's Legislative Assembly, and Almanbet Mutubraimov,
speaker of the Assembly of People's Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and Kyrgyzstan four years ago, the two
countries have kept close high-level exchanges and carried out
all-round cooperation, supported by scores of
cooperation accords.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan supports China's stand on Taiwan issue and
anti-seperatism, while China backs Kyrgyzstan's efforts in
safeguarding independence, maintaining social stability and
developing its national economy.
</P>
<P>
China and Kyrgyzstan have made great progress in settling their
long-standing border problems, an achievement which has historic
significance in consolidating and developing long-term and stable
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cholponbayev and Mutubraimov said that Kyrgyzstan appreciated
the friendly relations between the two countries and Jiang's visit
will further promote relations.
</P>
<P>
They said that their country pays close attention to China's
development and will learn a lot from China's experience.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) is
ready to keep good high level contacts with the two chambers of
the Kyrgyz parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two speakers expressed their willingness to develop
relations with the NPC and the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), in an effort to promote the
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Wednesday on a two-day state visit, the
first ever made by a Chinese head of state, to the Central Asian
country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmaker Calls for Better Identification of Emigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese lawmaker today
called for a clearer definition of the identity of people who were
born in China but live overseas.
</P>
<P>
Huang Changxi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), made the appeal at the
committee's 20th meeting.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, an estimated two
million people from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan have settled down overseas. They are usually called new
emigrants, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
It is of great importance to define the identity of these
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, many representatives of these people have set
forth proposals calling for a clearer legal definition of their
identity, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Those returning to the motherland, as well as various
organizations working overseas for China, have also found it
necessary to create such a legal explanation.
</P>
<P>
Many of the new emigrants are high-ranking intellectuals and
prominent businesspeople, who left the country following the
founding of new China, and have a fairly clear understanding of
the motherland, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
A new generation of famous scholars and entrepreneurs are
expected to emerge from these people in years ahead, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A well-known revolutionary literary
figure was commemorated today in a meeting held by Chinese
officials, who also called on artists to adhere to the Party line.
</P>
<P>
"People should learn from Mao Dun, a great revolutionary
literati," said councillor Li Tieying during the meeting in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He added that artists must adhere to Karl Marx's philosophies,
and also the Party's principle that "literature and art should serve
the people and socialism."
</P>
<P>
They should follow in the footsteps of Mao Dun, China's first
cultural minister in the 1950s, and one of the first Chinese
Communist Party members in the 1920s, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Mao was one of the founders of the country's modern literature
movement. His realistic novels served as weapons for the Party to
use against its enemies.
</P>
<P>
Mao left a legacy of 12 million Chinese characters in novels
and short stories, including "Midnight," considered a milestone in
China's literature, because it illustrated the fact that only
socialism can save China.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Party Central Committee Politburo,
asked artists to follow Mao's example by moving toward the social
reality and portraying social life in their works.
</P>
<P>
"Artists must inherit and learn from foreign and Chinese
cultures, but with a critic's eye," he said. He also urged them to
improve their craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
"By learning from Mao Dun, we can maintain the scientific
manner of seeking truth from the fact while always procceeding
from actual conditions," Li said, adding that artists must oppose
left- and right-wing deviations, neither of which are suitable
political philosophies.
</P>
<P>
He said that to remember Mao Dun is to adhere to the Party's
basic line, create a socialist culture with Chinese
characteristics, and improve people's spiritual lives and moral
standards.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was also attended by Li Ruihuan, who is a
member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Party's Central
Committee, and other senior Party and government officials.
</P>
<P>
Mao Dun is the pen name of Shen Yanbing, who died in 1981. His
memorial service was presided over by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration will last through the week nationwide. It

have traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was greeted at the airport by Kazak State Secretary

"We are satisfied with the positive results of Sino-Kazak
cooperation in every field over the past few years," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to develop Sino-Kazak good neighborly and
friendly relations on the basis of the five principles of peaceful

<HEADLINE> OAU Ministers Meet to Address Pressing Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) opened here today its 64th Council of Ministers Meeting to
address a host of pressing political, economic and social issues
facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting opens at a time when Africa is at the cross road
of its national building and economic development," said Prime
Minister Simon Achu of Cameroon, the host country of the meeting,
in a speech declaring the opening of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister put top priority on maintaining peace in
the continent, urging Africans to "be united and solve their own
problems", especially the inter-state and internal conflicts
which "have destroyed our economies".
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together under the OAU to maintain peace in
Africa, because there is no peace in the continent until there is
peace in each state," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Together we fight. Devided we fall," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, H. E. Ablasse Ouedraogo, the outgoing Chairman
of the previous Council of Ministers and Foreign Minister of
Burkina Faso highlighted the need to step up the implementation
of the Abuja Treaty aimed at establishing the African Economic
Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
"In face of the increasing marginalisation of the world
economic system, Africans must be united to face the challenge,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank report, Africa is set to lose 2.6
billion US Dollars every year owing to the marginalisation of the
continent by the Uruguay Round world trade agreement concluded in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, OAU Secretary General Salim A. Salim called for the
African countries to take a common stance to relieve the pressing
issue of external debts facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
Africa's outstanding debts rose by 18 billion US Dollars to a
historical high of 320 billion at the end of 1995, representing
over 80 percent of Africa's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
That means if the debt burden is shared equally among the
continent's estimated 680 million people, each African would have
to pay some 490 Dollars, an amount which outstrips average per
capita annual income in the region.
</P>
<P>
Salim also urged for the conflicting parties in Africa's hot
spots including Liberia, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and Sierra
Leone, to "drop down their selfish interests and show their
reconciliatory attitude".
</P>
<P>
K. Y. Amoako, United Nations Under-Secretary General and
Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission of Africa
(UNECA), also delivered a keynote speech on behalf of UN
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by 51 foreign ministers from the 53
OAU member states except Somalia and Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony was followed by the closed-door session
of the Council of Ministers who will, during the next two days,
discuss the draft agenda submitted by OAU Secretary General
Salim.
</P>
<P>
And the OAU heads of state and government summit meeting will
be held on July 8-10. enditem

<HEADLINE> Study: "African AIDS" No More Virulent Than </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The African sub-type of the HIV
virus is not more virulent than the European sub-type found in
most Israeli AIDS patients, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
This finding, to be explained at the next World AIDS
Conference in Vancouver, Canada, was disclosed Wednesday by
Professor Zvi Bentwich, who is establishing a National Center for
AIDS Research and Treatment at Kaplan Hospital in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Bentwich said that after following two separate groups of HIV
carriers for four years, it became clear that the structure of
the sub-types was different, but that the African one was not more
aggressive or faster acting. Another Kaplan study has found that
overcoming parasitic diseases and other infections in AIDS
patients reduces the devastation of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The National AIDS center, whose building will be completed at
Kaplan within a year, will coordinate AIDS prevention, treatment
and research in a single location -- but it will not take the
place of smaller facilities around the country.
</P>
<P>
The center will enlist the aid of researchers and
pharmaceutical companies, and serve as a focus for international
congresses, as well as an advanced-training center. It has
contacts with AIDS education groups in Egypt and Jordan, and will
educate medical staff here on AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
The new center will include inpatients and outpatients areas,
plus a unit for dental and ophthalmological care and dietary
counseling.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have suggested
that two new laws covering auctions and firearms control, and a
revision of an old law on archives, be passed by China's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Xue Ju, chairman of the Law Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), reported the opinions of Chinese
lawmakers this afternoon to the 20th meeting of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Members of the NPC Standing Committee deliberated drafts of the
three laws on June 29 and July 1. They believe the drafts have
included opinions from various social strata and are ready for
approval.
</P>
<P>
The Law Committee studies the views of the Standing Committee
members, then offers improvements.

<P>
Li Hao, vice-chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic
Committee, delivered a report today on his committee's examination
of the financial budget of central finance, which was submitted
Wednesday to the NPC Standing Committee by Minister of Finance
Liu Zhongli.

Li said the central finance's 1995 budget was implemented
satisfactorily, but that it was not well-managed, funds were
misappropriated, written replies to some expenditure budgets were
not made on time, the losses of revenue were serious, and the
management and supervision over the revenue and expenditures of
some units was weak.
</P>
<P>
Governmental departments that were audited, especially the
Ministry of Finance, should pay close attention to their problems
and carefully solve them, Li said. All those violating the law
will be punished.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World's Five Most Expensive Cities are in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Five of the world's 10 most
expensive cities are in Asia, an international survey on the cost
of living shows.
</P>
<P>
The five most expensive cities in the world are Tokyo, Osaka,
Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, with Seoul and Singapore ranked
seventh and 10th, according to the survey of 139 cities around the
world by the Geneva-based company Corporate Resources Group (CRG).
</P>
<P>
The only European cities to rank among the top ten are Moscow
in sixth place, followed by the Swiss cities of Geneva and Zurich
taking eighth and ninth place. Europe's least expensive cities are
Vilnius in Lithuania, Limassol in Cyprus and Birmingham, England.
</P>
<P>
The report also included a separate ranking of hotel and
related travel costs. It shows that Hong Kong is the most
expensive city for business travellers, followed by Moscow, Tokyo,
Brussels and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The dominance of Asian cities in the top ten is partly due to
the high cost of housing which is included for the first time in
the ranking's index, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Housing costs in Beijing are now the most expensive in the
world, followed by Tokyo and Hong Kong. The only non-Asian city to
rank among the top ten for housing is Moscow which has also seen
dramatic increases in prices for good accommodation.
</P>
<P>
The CRG cost of living index is intended for use by governments
and international firms to protect the purchasing power of
personnel sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on a basket of over 200 products which
includes food consumed at home, alcohol, tobacco, domestic
supplies and services, home services, personal care, clothing and
footwear, utilities, transport, sport and leisure, home
entertainment, housing, schooling and travel.
</P>
<P>
In the western hemisphere, Sao Paulo in Brazil has become the
most expensive city, followed by Buenos Aires, Argentia, and Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil. The American and Canadian cities compare very
favorably to many European and Asian cities. Mexico City and
Monterrey in Mexico remain among the least expensive cities in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive cities in Africa are Libreville in Gabon and
Brazzaville in the Congo, taking 31st and 32nd place in the list.

TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government leaders today
hailed the victory of Russian President Boris Yeltsin in
Wednesday's presidential election runoff and hoped the Russian
reform drive will not halt after the race.
</P>
<P>
Japan also hopes that Moscow will make efforts to normalize
relations with Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama,
the top government spokesman, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to seek to normalize bilateral ties in
the October 1993 Tokyo Declaration by resolving a territorial
dispute and signing a peace treaty, Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto voiced the hope
that Yeltsin's victory will secure continuation of the country's
reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told reporters that Russia's finance and economy are
important to Japan while its defense and security will have a
bearing on the international community.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials have said a victory for
Yeltsin will mean Japan does not have to change its stance over
its relations with Russia, especially over the long-simmering
territorial row.
</P>

The 1993 Tokyo Declaration calls for an early solution to the
dispute over four small islands off Japan's northernmost main

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province,
which is seriously affected by desertification with 17.4 percent
of its area covered by desert, has made successes since it began a
desert-control campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since that time, the province has invested 13.6 million yuan in
the comprehensive controlling of desert in the Qadam Basin, the
upper reaches of the Yellow River, the area around Qinghai Lake,
and in the Gonghe-Guinan region -- the four most-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, 112,860 ha of desert have been dealt with, and 3,800
ha of trees planted. Tests have shown that the number of days of
windstorms was reduced by 44.4 percent because of the improved
environment.
</P>
<P>
To make the anti-desert campaign go more smoothly, governmental
officials at various levels have signed pledges of responsibility,
and local people have been mobilized for participation.
</P>
<P>
In Guinan County, nearly 80,000 people have volunteered to

NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A sharp rise in the prices of
petroleum products announced by the Indian government on Tuesday
is likely to have a major impact on inflation and lead to an all
round increase in prices of goods and services, The Times of India
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to an official release, the price of petrol has gone
up by 25 percent while that of diesel and cooling gas by 30
percent as from Wednesday.

points as a result of the direct and indirect effects of the hike.
</P>
<P>
Even Petroleum Secretary Vijay Kelkar admitted that the hike
would result in a "direct increase of 1.2 percent in the wholesale
price index."
</P>
<P>
He said that added to this would be an indirect impact on the
general price level, but he declined to quantify it.

Indian industry and stock markets responded sharply to the
massive price hike. The sensitive index on the stock market in
Mumbai (Bombay) plummeted by 91.44 points on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said
that the "one stroke" hike would lead to distortions in the
economy while the Confederation of Indian Industry described the
move as "extremely inflationary" and "anti poor."
</P>
<P>
The major brunt of the hike will be faced by the transport
sector with a sharp hike in fare and freight rates.

<HEADLINE> Improvement In Xinjiang Farmers' Living Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that 80
percent of the farmers in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
northwest China, are leading better lives than in the past.
</P>
<P>
The multi-ethnic region is one of China's poor areas, and its
oases, which sustain life and work, account for only four percent
of its total territory.
</P>
<P>
With state help, Xinjiang farmers' income rose steadily to
1,136 yuan per capita last year, an actual increase of ten
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, farmers' income from the production of
grain, cotton and other crops fell, but that from industry and the
service trades increased.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are now spendiong more on clothing and consumer
durables, such as television sets, tape recorders, electric fans,
washing machines, and refrigerators.

<HEADLINE> Washing Machine Markets Still Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's urban dwellers are getting
into a real spin as they discard their out-dated washing machines.
</P>
<P>
Sales are expected to heavy this year - with city folk
switching to automatic washers, that wash, rinse and spin.
</P>
<P>
China's State Information Center says the country will witness
thriving a washing machine market this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, sales of washing machines will be the
same as last year, noting that the 35 million washing machines
sold before 1989 are now entering a renewal period, and Chinese
rural residents now have more money to consume.
</P>
<P>
The center also analysed that competition will be more fierce,
noting that more brands of washing machines have entered China's
market.
</P>
<P>
The center said with the improvement of living standards,
Chinese residents now have more money and more choice in washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the urban residents will buy more automatic
washing machines, while the rural ones will become the major
consumers of comparatively outdated washing machine.

<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary Hector
Villanueva said today that mass media must broaden its role to
include advocating for children's rights and mobilizing resources
to meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
"Mass media must broaden its role from merely informing and
educating the public on children's issues to include advocating
for children's rights, mobilizing resources to meet children's
basic needs and give full play to their potential, and integrate
children's issues with national and local development issues", he
said at the Asian summit on children's rights and the media that
ended today.
</P>
<P>
He said this will require mass media to invest in the
children's future in terms of manpower, funding, research,
training and linkages.
</P>
<P>
"Media coverage should focus on priority issues rather than
limited to sensational and events-oriented stories of sex, crime

<HEADLINE> China's Tariffs Continue To Come Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to scale down
its tariff over the next two years, letting tariffs account for 15
percent of revenues of the central government, as opposed to the
current 30 percent, "China Chemical Industry News" reports.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at aligning the Chinese economy with
international ones, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
China's import tariffs were lowered on April 1, but are still
11 percentage points higher than other developing nations on
average.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the lowering will temporarily affect
national revenues and will strike some industries and primary
products such as rubber and grain, but it will result in increased
income and offset partial losses if measures are taken to manage
the processing trade better.
</P>
<P>
Preferential treatment for imports of foreign-funded
enterprises and for special economic zones and development zones
will be eliminated gradually, but China will continue to protect
some fledgling industries and implement a tariff-quota system to
restrict the import of some commodities.
</P>
<P>
In all, the paper says, China is trying to bring down its
tariffs to a level comparable to other developing nations in the
coming two years.

<HEADLINE> Who is Threatening World Peace? Asks Liberation Army Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Army Daily, the
Chinese armed forces key newspaper, today carried a signed article
by Wei Wei refuting the "China Threat" theory.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the groundless catcalls of some western powers,
particularly the United States, to preach that China is
increasingly showing off its force, and that China has become
something of a superpower, a string of questions was raised at the
beginning of the article to draw attention of readers.
</P>
<P>
Who is showing its force to carry out hegemonism and power
politics around world, relying on its own mighty military force
and economic power? Who is imposing its will as a superpower onto
small, poor and weak countries? Who on earth is threatening world
peace and development? the article asked.
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that in modern history, the Chinese people
suffered the bullying of foreign forces for a long period of time,
and deeply knew the pains of invasion," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people value their hard-won independence and
freedom after the founding of new China, and have been getting
along friendly with the people of many countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
China has never attempted to seek hegemony in the world or in
any region, never invaded an inch of foreign territory, never
formed any military alliance, nor stationed a single soldier in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, China cut one million of its armed forces a
dozen years ago, which was rarely seen in terms of military
reduction moves across the world. In addition, China is the first
country to transfer men and women from the armed services to civil
departments on an overall scale.
</P>
<P>
It is the United States, advocating most the "China Threat"
theory, that has been attacked by people across the world for its
ambition to dominate the world, the article said.
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War period, the United States carried out its
"containment strategy" and "super-containment strategy".
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, it is implementing an "engagement and expansion
strategy" to interfere in international affairs and impose its
social patterns and values onto the whole world.

<P>
Driven by its hegemonic ambition, the United States has seen
the most powerful military buildup in the world. Statistics by
authoritative western organizations showed that the military
budget of the United States in 1994 stood at 280.6 billion US
dollars, which was 45 times that of China.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure for each American service personnel was 170,000
US dollars, 82 times that in China. The military spending for each
American was 1,081 US dollars, while the per capita figure in
China was only 5.3 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Driven by its hegemonic ambition, the United States strives to
maintain its military presence around the globe, with nearly 400
military bases in different places of the world, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It has stationed 100,000 troops in Europe, a large fleet and
powerful air force in Middle East, 100,000 troops in Northeast
Asia. And it attempts to regain its control over Southeast Asia
through military access and cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the United States unscrupulously claims to be the
only country in the world to go in for large-scale and effective
military moves beyond its own boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Driven by its hegemonic ambition, the United States has been
showing off its force more and more, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States has launched more than 70 foreign wars and
invasions since its founding 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With various excuses in the past dozen years, it dispatched
troops to other countries nine times, such as the invasion of
Grenada, the sweeping of Panama, military moves in the Persian
Gulf, and its intervention in Somalia and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
In July, 1994, US President Bill Clinton stressed time and
again in his report on "engagement and expansion strategy" that
after the Cold War, it is of paramount importance to maintain and
expand a powerful defence which is able to be put into action at
any time, so as to enhance American security.
</P>
<P>
A powerful defence helps ensure American impact on world
affairs, which most revealed the hegemonic ambition of the United
States to interfere in world affairs and expand American interest
with the support of its strong military force.

The article said that in handling international affairs and
relations with other countries, the United States has always
pursued power politics, bullying the weak and playing the "role of
global gendarme."
</P>
<P>
In so doing, it resorted to political, economic and cultural
means, as well as military means, the article added.
</P>
<P>
"Economic sanctions" are a big stick used frequently by the
US. According to some Americans, economic sanctions are an
"important weapon" that the US employs to force other countries,
especially small, poor and weak countries with ideology different
from that in the US, to change their course.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, during the 1975-1994 period, the US
used the "Super-301" 11 times for trade sanctions, thus applying
enormous pressure on developing countries and Europe, and opening
many trade channels for itself.
</P>
<P>
To subvert Cuba, the US disregarded a UN resolution requiring
it to cancel its blockade of Cuba that had been adopted four
times. In March 1996, it intensified its economic blockade of Cuba
and threatened to enforce sanctions against foreign companies that
maintain trade and economic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The US Congress recently adopted new bills applying even more
severe sanctions against Iran and Libya, and threatened to
penalize foreign companies that had invested in the two
countries.

LHASA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region is
carrying out its third-phase comprehensive agricultural
development program in zones in Xigaze City, and Lhaze and Gonggar
counties.
</P>
<P>
The central government will set aside 20 million yuan (2.4
million US dollars) a year for the agricultural projects, and
regional government will earmark 10 million yuan for supporting
funds to be used for water conservation, forestry, transportation,
and energy facilities.
</P>
<P>
The first and second phases took place in four zones. Between
1990 and 1995, they produced an additional 51,250 tons of grain,
some 7,200 tons of edible oils, and 1,010 tons of meat.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 2,240 ha of trees were planted and 5,570 ha

By employing domestic legislation to force other countries to
yield to its political will, the US not only targets developing
countries, but also its allies.
</P>
<P>
The US has also applied pressure to the United Nations by
economic means. As everybody knows, the US has defaulted one
billion US dollars in membership fees to the UN.
</P>
<P>
According to an American official, one billion dollars is less
than one percent of US defense expenditure, and nobody believes
that the US can not afford to pay its UN membership fee.
</P>
<P>
By defaulting, the US aims to coerce the UN to act on its will,
the article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to 'human rights diplomacy' to pursue power politics
has long been another favorite trick of the US," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The US also frequently applies sanctions against other
countries under the pretext of the "lack of human rights" and
"infringement of human rights."
</P>
<P>
The US has taken the lead in proposing anti-China motions in
the UN human rights meetings, but has failed miserably, it said.
</P>

Since 1992, the US has manipulated the UN Human Rights
Committee to adopt 58 resolutions on human rights, nearly all of
which were directed at developing countries.

The article pointed out that not in the past or at present, has
China ever interfered in the internal affairs of the United
States, or done anything harmful to US interests. On the contrary,
the US has time and again created disturbances against, and
interfered in China's internal affairs. This is an indisputable
fact, the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
The article said that Taiwan issue is the major obstacle which
affects Sino-US relations. It continued, in recent years, the US
government has time again acted against its promises, saying one
thing, while doing another.
</P>
<P>
The US government acknowledged that Taiwan is a part of China,
but under the surface, it connived the forces calling for the
independence of Taiwan, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, the US government allowed Lee Teng-hui to
visit the US, which seriously challenged the national sovereignty
and national dignity of China, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The US government acted against its promises and continuously
sold large quantities of advanced weapons, including F-16
fighters, ship-based missiles, ship-based artillery, attack
helicopters and tanks, and even lent Taiwan cruisers and tank
landing ships, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the US government also unwisely
interfered in military exercises the Chinese armed forces
conducted in the Taiwan Straits, which was up to the international
norms, and dispatched an aircraft carrier formation to the area to
show off its military might.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives and the Senate of the US
government even passed a resolution preaching that the US military
forces should "safeguard Taiwan".

During the human rights conference held earlier this year, the
US and other Western countries attacked by name 60 countries in
Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and made
indiscreet comments on internal affairs of these countries.
</P>
<P>
This mean act of interfering in internal affairs of other
countries under the pretext of the human rights issue constitutes
a gross violation of the rules on the handling of international
relations, as well as a serious threat to world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
In fact, everybody knows that human rights in the US are in

Having no regard to the common rules for the handling of

purposely provoked confrontation, and dished up a "theory of China
threat" to confuse and poison people's minds. What on earth do
they want to do, the article asked.

For example, the US fanfares arms control. But everyone knows
that the US has always taken weapon exports as a special means to
pursue its politics and foreign policy, and that it has used arms
sales to interfere in regional situations.
</P>
<P>
The US currently exports arms to 141 countries and regions. It
has supplied weapons to one warring side or both sides, involved
in 45 regional conflicts over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a major factor that has led to continuation of a
number of hot spots and wars in the world," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The US, which supplies at least 60 percent of annual global
arms sales, has threatened to apply sanctions against a number of
countries for providing defensive weapons to smaller countries.
</P>
<P>
The US has also baselessly accused China for proliferation of
weapons, and tried by hook or crook to obstruct China in
cooperation with other countries, in making peaceful use of
nuclear energy.

<P>
In fact, the US is the world's No. 1 proliferator and user of
massive lethal weapons. The fact was revealed not long ago that
the US army used radioactive and poison gas weapons when NATO
bombed Bosnian Serb installations last year serves as the latest
evidence.
</P>
<P>
The article said that since the ending of cold war the
pursuance of hegemony and power politics has constituted a major
factor leading to international disputes and tensions and
threatening world peace and development.

The country that has been pursuing hegemony and power politics
is precisely the US that has been trying to spread the "theory of

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM: Arab-Iranian Relations Should Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara said here today that relations between the Arab states
and Iran should improve.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Shara said that his recent talks in Tehran led to a conviction
that the Arab states and Iran have common interests.
</P>
<P>
He added that any difference or misunderstanding should be
removed between Egypt and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Shara said upon arrival in Cairo earlier today that Iran wants
to improve relations with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he briefed Mubarak on Syria's efforts to
iron out differences between Iran and Bahrain and his recent visit
to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has accused Iran of interfering in its internal affairs
and plotting to overthrow its ruling regime. Iran rejected the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
Shara said that he conveyed a letter by his president Hafez
al-Assad to Mubarak. The letter dealt with means to promote
inter-Arab relations as well as latest developments in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Turkish-Israeli military pact, he said
that he hoped the new Turkish government would reconsider this
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arab states such as Egypt and Syria have shown special concerns
over the agreement signed last February, under which Israeli
warplanes can use Turkey's airspace in military trainings.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has led to fears that Turkey and Israel may have
forged a military alliance, which threatens the security of the
Arabs.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Peace in the southern Philippines
seems a long and troubled journey away as negotiators of the
government and the country's Muslim rebels are preparing to meet
anew in Jakarta, Indonesia, next week to smooth out "with
finality" the creases in the texture of the peace pact reached
last month.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) have expressed the hope for the finalization of a peace
agreement ending the 28-year MNLF insurgency in Mindanao when
their representatives meet in Jakarta on July 10-15.
</P>
<P>
Rays of a breakthrough dawned on June 23 when the government
and the Muslim rebel group agreed in Davao, Mindanao, to set up a
Southern Philippine Council for Peace and Development in the
southern islands.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the three-year-term council, to be headed
by MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari and covering 14 provinces and nine
cities in Mindanao and Palawan, is to be the interim mechanism
leading to the establishment of an MNLF-proposed autonomous
government.
</P>
<P>
However, strong opposition to the peace pact in the southern
Philippines has cast a long shadow over any bright prospects of
the Jakarta talks.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the peace pact was announced, uproars of suspicion,
anger and resistance have been overwhelming in Mindanao, the
ancestral home of a minority Muslim population of five million in
this largely Christian country.
</P>
<P>
Decades of migration of Christian settlers into Mindanao has
turned the area into a predominantly Christian region, where
almost all of the governors and mayors are Christian.
</P>
<P>
The agreed MNLF-led council is putting fears both in local
leaders, who are concerned about diminished local governments, and
in Christian residents who reject a Muslim rule.
</P>
<P>
Protests and demonstrations, which have been going on for weeks
in the southern Philippines, greeted President Fidel Ramos on his
trip to Mindanao on Tuesday and Wednesday to rally support for the
peace plan.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, an irate mob of Christians pelted Ramos' car with
tomatoes when the president traveled through General Santos city.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians are calling for bolder, confrontational moves,
allegedly from candle-lighting protests to formation of secret
armed units against the perceived MNLF control.
</P>
<P>
Prospects of the Jakarta talks have been made even gloomier by
the strong objection from opposition parties in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties described the peace pact as "a secret accord
which betrays the interests of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers said that the government is not authorized to
create the council, which they described as a provisional
government, and called the establishment of the council illegal.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the creation of the council would lead to an
armed conflict between Muslims and Christians in Mindanao, where
the MNLF-led revolt for more self-rule claimed 50,000 lives during
its height in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the strong opposition to the peace pact, the
unsolved disagreement between the government and MNLF negotiators
also threatens to stall the Jakarta talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators will attempt to define more clearly the
proposed council as the interim body, the creation of a regional
force during the term of the council and the integration of MNLF
forces into the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Although the government and the MNLF said these issues were
"minor," local analysts said they are in fact "ticklish and
contentious" as a wide gap is separating the two sides on these
issues.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF wants to have its own police forces with MNLF fighters
in full operational control, a demand rejected by the government
who says this is against the constitution and too costly.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF also wants its 25,000 fighters to be integrated into
the government army, while the government says it could absorb
only 5,500.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts are anticipating a tough job for the
negotiators in Jakarta to tailor the final agreement not only to
the consensus of the two sides, but also to the understanding of
the opposition parties and Christians in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Biological Proposal For Treating Lake Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have jointly worked out a plan
to deal with pollution in Dianchi Lake, using bio-technology.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which is in the Kunming suburbs, is a leading source
of drinking and industrial water for the capital city, but more
than 400,000 tons of waste water are poured into it daily.
</P>
<P>
Because of the nutritiments in the water, algae grow rampantly,
worsening the environment.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 researchers from the Aquatic Biological Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yunnan Provincial
Institute of Environmental Science worked out a plan for treating
the pollution, following an eight-month study.
</P>
<P>
According to the three-phase plan, algae and Eichhornia
crassipes Solms, a kind of plant abundant in the lake, will be
used to extract protein, fiber, fat, and starch, and the
production of feed, fertilizer, and fiber products.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the method will provide experience for treating
polluted lakes with nutritiments in their water, experts say.

<HEADLINE> China, Kyrgyzstan to Develop Good-Neighborly Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here today with his Kyrgyz counterpart Askar Akayevich, proposing
that the two countries set up a new type of good-neighborly
relations looking toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang put forward the proposal at a banquet given by the Kyrgyz
president, who said afterwards that he agreed with Jiang's
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Akayevich said that his country attaches great importance to
Jiang's visit, which he described as one paid by the highest
leader from the "great neighboring country."
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan "was, is and will be" China's good neighbor and
partner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties four
years ago, China and Kyrgyzstan have made headway in
mutually-beneficial cooperation in politics, economy and trade,
science and technology, culture and education, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with all these and value the personal
contributions made by President Akayevich," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president stressed that developing long-term
good-neighborly relations with other countries is one of the basic
policies of China.
</P>
<P>
No matter how the world situation changes, China will hold its
policy of developing friendly and cooperative Sino-Kyrgyz
relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of our two countries should map out our future
relationship looking toward the 21st century to enable it to help
maintain the long-term and stable, friendly and cooperative
relations," said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Akayevich said that he completely agrees with Jiang's proposal
for further developing bilateral relations. He regards China as a
partner with strategic significance.
</P>
<P>
He said that a prosperous China will help maintain world peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan is firmly opposed to national separatism and will
not allow any anti-China activities on its territory, he said,
adding that his country supports China's territorial integration
and the cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the two countries have made progress in trade
and that the bilateral trade and economic relations have a great
potential and bright prospect.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our respective departments will strengthen cooperation
and actively explore new ways and methods in line with
international trade practices and characteristics of our two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Akayevich said both governments should encourage more
enterprises to cooperate. Jiang's visit will help promote the
mutual trade and economic relations, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents spoke highly of the Sino-Kyrgyz agreement on
the demarcation of the borders between the two countries they
signed earlier today. They said it will help consolidate and
develop the long-term good-neighborly relations and promote
prosperity and stability in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Akayevich also said that the five-nation border agreement on
confidence-building in the military field in border areas that was
signed in Shanghai, China in April 1996, is of historic
significance.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Shipbuilders See Fewer Backlog Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean shipbuilding
industry is suffering from a downturn in the backlog of orders due
to the expansion of the industry's capacity and a weak Japanese
yen, the Korean Shipbuilding Industry Association (KSIA) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of orders based on the gross tonnage of ships stood
at 11.91 million tons at the end of June this year, down 5.3
percent from the previous month and 11.2 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The orders backlog at the end of June was only enough to keep
the country's shipbuilding industry operating for one year and
five months, given its shipbuilding capacity of 8.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in four years that the orders backlog
shrank to the equivalent of one year and five months. The orders
backlog covering two years is considered normal for the South
Korean shipbuilding industry, according to the KSIA.
</P>
<P>
The backlog decline was attributed to the fact that the orders
received since this year have sharply decreased and that the
country's shipbuilding capacity rose by 3 million tons because of
dockyard expansion by large shipbuilders last year.
</P>
<P>
"Orders backlog can be kept stable only when actual
shipbuilding performance is on par with the volume of orders, but
the backlog is bound to shrink under the present condition in
which the shipbuilding capacity nearly doubles the volume of
orders," a KSIA official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the second largest shipbuilder in the world after
Japan, received overseas orders for 34 vessels weighing 1.47
million gross tons during the first five months of this year, down
33 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country received orders for 194 ships weighing
7.13 million gross tons, up 11.9 percent from the 6.37 million
gross tons recorded in 1994.

MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today renewed his appeal to the United States government to help
resolve the equity issue for Filipino veterans who fought side by

</P>
<P>
Ramos sought President Clinton's help in asking the US Congress

pending before it.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill will help alleviate the plight of

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia's Wind Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 4 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has made great headway in utilizing its wind
resources by developing 125,000 small wind-driven generators and
four large wind-driven power plants.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Inner Mongolia ranks first in the
country in terms of total wind energy resources. It is
sparsely-populated, making it a likely candidate for developing
the wind-driven power sector.
</P>
<P>
The local government has worked out preferential policies to
encourage development of wind-driven power and has set aside 23.5
million yuan over the past ten years to subsidize the building of
small wind-driven generators, helping make power available to
560,000 farmers and herdspeople.
</P>
<P>
It developed 49 wind-driven generators with annual electricity
output of 15 million kwh by taking advantage of various foreign
loans, totaling 20 million US dollars, and a large power plant
with a 1.2-million-kw capacity is under construction.

<HEADLINE> First Sino-Foreign Joint Multi-Functional Electric Power Engineering Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-US joint venture to produce
power generators as a total package is to be built in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The venture will develop, design, sell, purchase, build and
operate power-generating equipment, believed to be the first
operation of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Xinke Electric Power Engineering Company will be
jointly set up by the Shanghai Electric Products Manufacturing
Group and US's Westinghouse Company.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the founding of the new multi-functional electricity
engineering company, SEG cooperated with Westinghouse in other
projects. These included steam turbines, generators, and other
equipment used in power stations. The ventures have increased
Westinghouse's investment in China to more than 100 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
SEG led the country in its 4.02 million kilowatts of generating
units, as well as in sales of its machinery last year.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture is expected to help put the electric
power station industry in Shanghai on a par with international
advanced standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in developing a
new species of Merino ram in the northwest's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The research work has great practical value, scientists say,
because the species can increase net wool output by more than ten
percent, according to the experimental results.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the increased use of the new species
of rams has yielded 710,000 yuan in direct economic returns and
10.5 million yuan worth of indirect economic returns, scientists
calculate.
</P>
<P>
The new species are useful for the popularization of
better-quality genes in Merino rams, the promotion of fine
wool-production, and the development of animal husbandry in
Xinjiang, according to Ma Ning, a professor at Jilin Agricultural
University.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Timber Production To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's timber production is
forecast to reach 400,000 cubic metres this year, up from 371,300
cubic metres last year, the Financial Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Timber Producers Federation of Zimbabwe Mike
Houstone said, ''total sawn timber production has grown from 15,900
cubic metres in 1980 to 37,500 cubic metres in 1990 and is likely to
exceed 450,000 cubic metres in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
He said demand for sawn timber and its other by-products remained
strong last year, both on the domestic and export markets. He
attributed the high demand to on-going projects around the country.
</P>
<P>
''There are some local and foreign investors capable of bringing
to the table much-needed technical skills and financial investments
into the local timber industry. But they can only do this if the
government can acknowledge it wants the development of the industry
and sends clear signals to that effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the government to put across consistent messages
that it supported the fundamentals of a free market economy.

<HEADLINE> Man Survives Transplant of Five Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese cancer patient who had
seven organs removed and five transplants has survived the surgery
for 19 days.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for someone in China to have the liver,
bladder, duodenum, gastric antrum, and pancreas transplanted
simultaneously, according to doctors at Nanfang Hospital attached
to People's Liberation Army No. 1 Medical College.
</P>
<P>
Liang Jinhe, a 38-year-old farmer from Conghua City, in south
China's Guangdong Province, had part of his liver removed when he
was diagnosed with liver cancer five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Nanfang Hospital discovered cancer cells in Liang's
abdominal cavity again on May 14, and decided to remove the
cancerous organs and do a transplant operation.
</P>
<P>
During a 21-hour operation on June 14, Liang's liver, bladder,
spleen, stomach, duodenum, and adrenal gland were removed, and the
following transplant surgery was said to be a success.
</P>
<P>
At present, doctors report that Liang's new organs, especially
the liver, bladder, and spleen, are functioning normally, and he
has regained consciousness.
</P>
<P>
"The surgery is not only the first of its kind in China, but
also rare in the world," the doctors said. "The success marks a
breakthrough in multi-organ transplants in China."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Changes have taken place in the
rural areas of Vietnam since the country started the Doi Moi
(renovation) process in 1986, in parallel with success in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, according to local official report, headway
has been made nationwide in the area of housing development
with 'permanent-structure' houses increasing to 58 per cent of the
total at present from 20.4 per cent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Top on the list is the Red River Delta that now has 28 per cent
of all permanent structures and 57 per cent of semi-permanent
structures. However, makeshift structures still account for 74
per cent in the Mekong River Delta and over 59 per cent in the
regions inhabited by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of material life for the rural population have
much improved.
</P>
<P>
The rate of households having tv sets (over half of which are
colour) and radio sets has risen from 3 per cent and 11 per cent
respectively in 1990 to 22 per cent and 40 per cent at present.
</P>
<P>
For every hundred families in the rural areas there are 9
motorbikes. In the eastern part of south Vietnam, in particular,
there are 45 radio sets, 33 tv sets and about 30 motorbikes per
hundred households.
</P>
<P>
On mechanization, the number of large and small tractors has
risen from 11,630 and 21,500 in 1989 to 32,600 and 77,618 at
present while that of water pumps has risen from 168,000 to
600,000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 5,310 communes (60.4 per cent), 35,620
villages ( 53.5 per cent) and six million rural dwellers (54 per
cent) have access to electricity from the national grid.
</P>
<P>
This has helped develop agriculture as well as small industry
and handicrafts. It has also helped restore and even expand
traditional handicrafts villages, creating employment
opportunities for millions of people in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
On education, primary education has been expanded to almost all
the rural communes while the current percentage of communes with
junior secondary schools, senior secondary schools and
kindergartens is 77 per cent, 7 per cent and 77 per cent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Health care has now reached every rural commune while 70 per
cent of the households have access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 communes (95 per cent) are fully accessible by
water and land routes and 8,000 communes have roads suitable for
motor vehicles. Vietnam now has a rural road network totalling
nearly 5,000 km.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Accounting Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China today released three
documents that set standards for its fast-growing accounting
business.
</P>
<P>
The three documents are Provisional Rules on the Representative
Offices of Overseas Accounting Firms, Provisional Rules on
Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Accounting Firms, and the Notice of
Allowing International Accounting Firms to Identify Multiple
Member Firms in China. The issuing of the documents marks an
important step toward further opening China's accounting sector.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youcai, vice-minister of finance, said at a press
conference here today that "China's accounting market is open and
the door will never be closed but will only be opened wider."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that, just as in the case of other
countries, the opening of China's accounting market is subject to
certain conditions and restraints. He did not elaborate on this.
</P>
<P>
"We will take effective measures to legalize and standardize
the opening process and increase the transparency of the
conditions," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
All institutions established in China by overseas accounting
firms must abide by Chinese laws, rules, policies and regulations,
the vice-minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (CICPA) is entrusted by the Ministry of Finance to be
responsible for controlling and monitoring those institutions.
</P>
<P>
China has already approved 36 representative offices of 15
international accounting firms in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang and Dalian, Zhang said,
adding that China has also approved nine Sino-foreign joint
venture accounting firms and has approved the membership of
Shenzhen Zhonghua CPA in Horwath International and that of
Shenyang CPA in Moores Rowland.
</P>
<P>
China has extended temporary auditing licenses to more than 100
overseas accounting firms that have not established offices but do
business in China, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has opened its CPA tests to overseas
candidates, and since 1994, more than 2,500 persons from 10
countries and regions have signed up for CPA examinations, with
those who qualified having been accepted by CICPA.
</P>
<P>
Ding Pingzhun, secretary-general of CICPA, pointed out that all
representative offices of overseas accounting firms will be
scrutinized this year to ensure that they do not exceed the
established business limits.
</P>
<P>
"Those guilty of serious rule infractions will be
disenfranchised and denied access to China's accounting market
for five years," Ding said.

PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) - The following are today's major news
items in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation - Boris Yeltsin heads for the winning of the Russian
presidential election Wednesday, but his wavering health has
already fed speculations about the hypothetical succession by
General Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
- German defense minister Volker Ruhe has indicated a cut of
troops and military programs. Germany had cut its military budget
from 54 billion marks (36 billion U.S. dollars) in 1991 to 47.1
billion marks (about 32 billion dollars) in 1996, and the budget
is expected to continue to drop to 46 billion marks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro - Boris Yeltsin beat Gennady Zyuganov with a
clear-cut lead. But speculations about his health led most
observers to doubt his capability to rule for four more
years. Meanwhile, Lebed is more and more likely to act as a heir.
</P>
<P>
- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced a plan to cut
income tax in 1997. In a television interview Wednesday evening,
he also said the government will reinforce security forces in the
violence-shaken island of Corsica, and expressed support to a
planned merger between Air France and Air France Europe (Air
Inter).
</P>
<P>
Le Monde - Two prominent company leaders of France are under
legal investigation for their possible involvement in a financial
scandal concerning the Elf oil group. Andre Tarallo, the president
of Elf-Gabon, and Loik Le Floch-Prigent, former president of Elf
Aquitaine and the current president of the National Railway Company
of France, were ordered to attend two separate court hearings on
Wednesday and Thursday, to clarify their role in a financial scandal
involving the Elf and a textile group called Bildermann.

CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has criticized what he called a U.S. media campaign against
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by Egypt's leading
Arabic-language daily Al-Ahram, Moussa said that it is a campaign
against a secretary general representing developing countries and
Africa, adding that the campaign is unfavorable for the way the
U.N. will be run over the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
"We support reelection of Ghali as expressed by the expanded
Arab summit" held in Cairo last month, and "it is expected to be
endorsed by the upcoming African summit" to be held in Yaounde,
Cameroon, Moussa said in the interview carried by the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also said that an arms race will start in the Middle
East if Israel insists on keeping and developing its nuclear
program.
</P>
<P>
Once this race is initiated, he said, Israel will not be alone
in the race, pointing out that no country is to blame for seeking
nuclear knowledge to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli arsenal has reached a degree threatening stability
in the region, he said.

</P>
<P>
The official said that there has been a boom in
telecommunication business between China and Southeast Asia and
more frequent contacts have made it difficult for satellite and
maritime systems to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
To promote exchanges between China and Southeast Asia, China
Telecom and Singapore proposed construction of a cable in May,
1994, and were later joined by Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Viet
Nam.
</P>
<P>
The optical fibre starts in Shanghai, passes through Viet Nam,
Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia, before reaching Singapore. By using
advanced optical fibre telecommunications technology, the system
can provide access to 30,000 digital circuits and free lines for
domestic communication, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The partner countries will be responsible for the 400 million
US dollars in construction funds, 140 million US dollars of which
will be paid by China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese section of the cable runs for 3,900 kilometers,
going through Hangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, Nanning, and Pingxiang
before entering Viet Nam. Another section starts at Guangzhou and
goes to Viet Nam via Nanning and Pingxiang.
</P>
<P>
When the cable opens to traffic in early 1998, it will link
China with Europe and the rest of the world by Euro-Asia optical
fibre and the Indian Ocean's international marine cable via
Singapore, the official said.

<HEADLINE> AEC Motor To Be Started By OAU Summit </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The engine to implement the Abuja
treaty to establish the African Economic Community (AEC) is
expected to be started by the Organisation of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
"Now it's about the time after so many delays," said OAU
spokesman Ibrahim Dagash before the opening of the 64th OAU
council of ministers session in the Cameroonian capital of
Yaounde today.
</P>
<P>
According to the AEC treaty which was signed in the Nigerian
capital of Abuja in 1991 and came into effect on May 12, 1996,
African countries are to establish a profound economic community
by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
However, the process was stalled as its core organ, the
Economic and Social Commission (ECOSOC), has failed to be
inaugurated so far.
</P>
<P>
And the AEC ministerial meeting to discuss the setup of ECOSOC
has been postponed time and again, according to a report to be
submitted to the OAU council of ministers meeting opened today.
</P>
<P>
"I urge for member states to be represented at the AEC
ministrial meeting to reflect their commitment to the
implementation of the Abuja treaty and to the establishment of
the AEC," said OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim in a
report submitted to the OAU council of ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress that ECOSOC is a very important organ
of the AEC without which the process of establishing AEC could
not effectively start," said Salim.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said the inauguration of ECOSOC
and ways to step up the regional economic integration process is
hign on the agenda of the forthcoming OAU heads of state and
government summit meeting scheduled for next week.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Within four years, each of
Israel's 2,400 schools will have a modern computer lab, making it
the first country in the world with so many computers in its
educational system, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Haim Tirosh, chairman of the Israel
Association for Computers in Education, was quoted as saying that
the organization will hold its 13th annual conference in Jerusalem
beginning next Tuesday. Scores of lectures will be presented at
the two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee is composed of the Education Ministry
and the Israel Association for Information Technology. In
addition, an exhibition, in which 50 hardware and software
companies are to participate, will be open free to the public.
</P>
<P>
Among the subjects to be discussed are the use of the internet
in schools, interactive lectures using satellite broadcasts,
teaching with multimedia, computer use in kindergartens, computer
preparation for matriculation, development of educational
software, and training teachers for the technological age.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ze'ev Degani, chairman of the program committee of the
conference, said that a serious assessment of existing computer
use in the schools is being carried out to make sure that it meets
all educational criteria. This, too, will be examined at the
conference, Degani added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Egyptian-Palestinian-Israeli Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
has not ruled out the possibility of holding a three-way summit
grouping Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by Egypt's leading
Arabic-language daily Al-Ahram, Moussa said that the possibility
of holding such a meeting does exist although it has not been
examined by the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The summit could be of benefit as long as Israel is committed
to the agreements it signed with the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister urged Europe to play a more active role in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The positive statements issued recently at the European summit
in Florence, Italy, and the Group of Seven summit in Lyon, France,
have paved the way for a bigger European role, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both summits called for resuming Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations on the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Europe's call for a just, comprehensive and durable peace in
the Middle East enables the Europeans to shift from the role as a
financier providing aid to the Palestinians to that as a partner
in the building of peace itself, Moussa said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described as "nonsense" and "unacceptable" Israel's call
for peace with Arabs while keeping the Arab lands it captured by
force.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Allows Debate on Netanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition scored the
first win Wednesday in its embarrassing campaign against new Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by forcing the Knesset (parliament)
to allow the debate on his past years in the U.S., the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Dan Tichon reversed his earlier objection to allow the
debate on recent media reports about Netanyahu's controversial
past in the U.S., which alleged that his U.S. social security file
bore the name of John J. Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
Labor Member of Knesset (MK) Dalia Itzik filed a motion in
Tuesday's Knesset meeting to demand investigating Netanyahu's past
years in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Investigative reports published in local newspapers Ha'ir and
Kol Ha'ir quoted U.S. classified information on Netanyahu's
social file as saying that he used four names in the U.S.,
including that of John J. Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
But Tichon removed the motion from the agenda, citing that it
was based on rumors and "insulting" to the prime minister. Labor
MKs immediately took to the plenum floor to protest the decision,
accusing Tichon, a Likud MK, of repeatedly refusing to accept such
motions to defend Netanyahu's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid later filed another motion in the
Knesset to the agenda under the title "Who are you, John
J. Sullivan?" to protest the ban on debate.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's session of Knesset, Labor MKs continued imposing
pressure on Tichon, who was finally forced to allow the debate on
Netanyahu's past.
</P>
<P>
The fuss about Netanyahu's dubious past years in the U.S.,
where he lived for many years in the late 70's when he received
the higher education before returning to Israel, is not new to the
Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
Before the May 29 elections, local press reports revealed that
Netanyahu had acquired U.S. citizenship and changed his name to
Benjamin Nitai as he intended to settle in the U.S. permanently.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu flatly denied the allegations in the debate
held two days before the elections, counter-charging those "who
try to cast doubt" on his "willingness to fight for this country."

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Urged to Form New FDI Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been urged to
formulate appropriate strategies to further improve its position
in competing for foreign direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Secretary General Ajit Singh said in Shah Alam near here
today that although ASEAN has been and still remains a major FDI
destination in the developing world, its market share was
declining.
</P>
<P>
Opening the ASEAN Investment Agencies meeting, Ajit Singh said
that data from the International Monetary Fund showed that between
1991 and 1994, ASEAN's share in total FDI flows to Asia dropped
substantially from 62 percent to 31 percent, a 50 percent decline
in three years.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, ASEAN share of the total inward FDI stock
in Asia fell from a high point of 71 percent in 1980 to 49 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"If this trend continues, ASEAN economies may find difficult to
sustain their pace of industrial development and economic momentum
in line with our planned national economic objectives," the
secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the two-day meeting, Malaysian Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz urged the ASEAN
members to jointly promote the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation
Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was prepared to attract FDI and intra-ASEAN
investments, enhance the technology base of ASEAN economies,
generate economies of scale and assist in the growth of small and
medium industries.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, Rafidah said, ASEAN members should also look
at expanding investment cooperation with non-ASEAN countries and
regional groups.

<HEADLINE> Israel Toughens Attitude Toward PLO's Office In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani has changed his previous view that
no immediate action was needed against Orient House, the PLO's
office in East Jerusalem, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani claimed that Palestinian officials at Orient House
were violating the ban on activities of the Palestinian Authority
(PA) in the city, and action must be taken by the hard-line Likud
government to halt them.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper after a lengthy meeting
with security officials on Orient House last night, Kahalani
revealed that Faisal Husseini, PLO Executive Committee Member in
charge of Orient House, has asked for a meeting with him
apparently out of concern over the future of the office.
</P>
<P>
"I have not yet decided whether we will meet. I first
want to speak about the matter with the prime minister,"
Kahalani said. He added that an aide to Husseini made the
contact with his office yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani declined to go into details about what action he
would recommend against Orient House. He confirmed, however, that
he had changed the original wait-and-see position.
</P>
<P>
The minister is scheduled to present his recommendations to
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu tomorrow. Kahalani heads the
committee of security officials the government asked to make
recommendations on Orient House, which met for the first time
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
At Knesset (Israel's parliament), Kahalani said the government
is determined to enforce those clauses of the Oslo Accords
which forbid the PA to operate at Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said that Orient House has been turned into a
symbol, "and a place of pilgrimage for people who come from
abroad and want to show their identification with the
Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Palestinians "not to challenge us, and
not to introduce unnecessary tension," and warned that the
government would be forced to close the building if PA
activities continue there.
</P>
<P>
Orient House used to be headquarters of the Palestinian
delegation to the Madrid Middle East Peace Conference and
later to the Washington negotiations. PLO officials have declared
that the activities held in the office are legitimate and in
no way contradicting the Oslo Accords. Israel claims Jerusalem
as its united and eternal capital, but the PLO argues East
Jerusalem is an occupied Palestinian territory, citing U.N.
Resolutions 242 and 338 to prove.

<HEADLINE> Annual Inflation Rate Drops in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 4 (Xinhua)-- Uganda's annual inflation rate for
the financial year ending June 1996 fell from 6 percent in May to
5.4 percent in June, reported local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning was
quoted as saying that this is slightly above the 5 percent
originally targeted by government for the financial year 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the latest consumer price indices show down-
ward trend in food, beverages, tobacco, clothing and footwear
after prices hiked during the presidential elections in May.
</P>
<P>
The monthly inflation rate fell from 0.2 percent to below zero
in June, the sources said, adding the annual underlying inflation
rate fell from 8.5 percent to 7.8 percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
On reseans for the rate dropping, former Finance Minister
Mayanja Hkangi was quoted as saying that prices have remained
steady due to good rains and gradually improving production
levels in the local manufacturing sector which grew by 18 percent
in the last financial year, the highest during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Privatisation has increased competition in the country
especially in beverages, cement and sugar fields, keeping prices
relatively down, local experts said.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese coach Zhou Ming declined to
disclose the names of the first batch of swimmers he led to the
training in an university in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua on Wednesday, Zhou said he
and five swimmers arrived in Alabama on June 30, but he came short
of identifying them.
</P>
<P>
"There are famous swimmers in these early arrivals," he
said. "If I tell you their names, probably more journalists will

</P>
<P>
Zhou also asked Xinhua not to report the location of their
training site.
</P>
<P>
Le Jingyi, one of Zhou's best students, is expected to be among
the early five.
</P>

<P>
LHASA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Tibetan Buddhists
flocked to the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, in Tibet's Xigaze City, for
the annual Buddha exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with religious convention, Buddha exhibitions are
held at the lamasery each year between the 14th and 16th of the
fifth month in Tibetan calendar.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitions, falling between June 30 and July 2 this year,
are believed to be able to bring about blessings to believers and
save them from disasters.

life.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and herds people used to go to the lamasery on foot or
by donkey. Nowadays more families travel to the annual event by
farm tractors.

<HEADLINE> Barclays Bank of Zambia Loses 250,000 U.S.Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank of Zambia has lost
322 million Kwacha (some 250,000 U.S.Dollars) in a massive cash
swindle, ''Times of Zambia'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The money was stolen in four separate occasions between April
and June 26 by the fraudsters who used an account held at Stanbic
Bank in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
''I can confirm with you that there has been a large fraud
which has already been reported to the police. The police are
investigating and i can't divulge details right now for fear of
jeopardizing the investigations,'' the newspaper quoted Barclays
Bank senior inspector Mike Rodgers as saying on wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suspected swindlers used a Barclays Bank clerk in the
audit section and a barclays messenger who ran errands to deposit
and cash cheques from them, the report quoted sources as
revealing.
</P>
<P>
The masterminds of the fraud in the bank supplied the audit
clerk with forged documents used by the bank to transfer money
between its branches. The forged douments looked genuine that
they fooled all senior personnel who believed that they were
normal barclays inhouse transactions they were authorizing.
</P>
<P>
The fraudsters have reportedly disappeared to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the second rip-off that shattered Barclays Bank of
Zambia after the 300 million Kwacha robbery by a driver in June
1993.

<HEADLINE> China, Kyrgyzstan Sign Border Demarcation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Kyrgyz counterpart Askar Akaev today signed an
agreement on the demarcation of the borders between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony, held at the Presidential Palace here,
came after talks between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang, who is
accompanying Jiang, described the signing of the agreement as "an
important event" in the history of the Sino-Kyrgyz relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement is conducive to the consolidation and
development of long-term, stable, good-neighborly and friendly
relations between China and Kyrgyzstan, as well as to prosperity
and stability in their border areas.
</P>
<P>
"It is yet another important positive element, following the
accord on building trust in border areas among China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed in Shanghai in April,
in enhancing regional peace and stability," Shen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China started border negotiations with the former Soviet Union

China and Kyrgyzstan have more than 1,000 kilometers of common
borders.
</P>

borders as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Beef Slumps in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Authorities at the cold storage
company (CSC ) of Zimbabwe are worried by the sharp decline in
the price of local beef on European markets due to the mad cows
crisis that has crippled the British beef industry, the Financial
Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
CSC Chief Executive Lawrence Masanga said price of Zimbabwe's
beef on EU markets had dropped by about 20 percent in some
countries while in others it had slumped by 15 percent since the
worldwide ban on British beef was effected in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Europe is currently experiencing wide-spread consumer
resistance to beef consumption and many people have resorted to
pork, lamb, chicken and other beef substitutes. In the UK,
normal beef consumption dropped by 30 percent while in Germany it
was down by almost half, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Masanga said, ''The situation in Europe has dampened the
demand for beef. This has affected the prices of our beef exports
to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe each year pushes 9,100 tonnes of high grade beef on
EU markets under the Lome Convention bringing income of more than
40 million U.S.Dollars in sales.

<HEADLINE> Chinese University Entrance Exam Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- More than two million Chinese young
people are bracing for the world's largest university entrance
examination this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released here today put the number of those
participating in the unified national university entrance
examination at 2.66 million this year, up 130,000 over 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third will become freshmen, according to the
State Education Commission, which reports that some 1,000 Chinese
universities will enroll 965,000 students this summer, an increase
of 40,000 over last year.
</P>
<P>
China has only one university entrance examination each
year. It is prepared by the state instead of by individual
universities, and is held from July 7 to 9.
</P>
<P>
Universities usually send representatives to select new
students from those who pass the exam, which is one of the most
competitive in the country.
</P>
<P>
This year's hot majors are still not clear. In previous years,
competition has been strong for finance, accounting, trade,
foreign languages, and computer science.
</P>
<P>
About 660 universities or two-thirds of China's universities
have abandonded the previous method of tuition being covered
entirely by the state. According to a new regulation students pay
their own costs, but poorer students can receive government loans
or subsidies.
</P>
<P>
In the past, some parents bribed officials who oversaw the
examination and enrollment to get their children into universities
illegally, so the commission called on local officials to
supervise the exam carefully.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Announces Third Banharn Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government announced here
today that King Bhumibol Adulyadej has approved a new cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
This is the third cabinet reshuffle since Banharn Silpa-archa
took premiership in mid-July last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the five posts affected by the reshuffle, three are held by
the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) party, which pulled out of the
seven-party coalition government on June 15 but decided on June 30
to return to the coalition fold at the request of the six other
parties.
</P>
<P>
The three Prachakorn Thai party cabinet members have all been
reinstated. They are Deputy Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej,
Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Yingphan
Manasikarn, and Deputy Transport and Communications Minister
Chaipak Siriwat.
</P>
<P>
The other two posts involved the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force)
party.  Former permanent secretary for foreign affairs Pracha
Gunakasem replaced Charas Puachuay as deputy foreign minister, and
MP for Nonthaburi province Pimpa Chanprasong replaced Pirapong
Thanompongphan as deputy transport and communications minister.
</P>
<P>
However, main problems in the cabinet quota involving Banharn's
Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Both the Therd Thai faction and the Wang Nam Yen faction in the
party are exerting pressure on their party leader Banharn
Silpa-archa.
</P>
<P>
The Therd Thai faction demands that its two key members Newin
Chidchob and Pairote Suwanchawee, both former ministers, be
reinstated while the Wang Nam Yen faction wants the interior
minister's post, now held concurrently by the prime minister
himself, be given to Snoh Thienthong, leader of the faction and
secretary-general of the party.
</P>
<P>
Banharn reportedly told the two factions that there would be a
reshuffle in the Chart Thai quota as well as in other coalition
partners when the government has completed its one year in office,
as the coalition parties are likely to make adjustments of their
ministers under their quotas to give others a chance to serve in
the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Don't Treat Syria as Rogue State: U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Israel Mark
Indyk today asked Israel not to treat Syria as an outlaw state to
avoid the risk of creating a "new axis of the rogue states across
the region".
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview published on the English daily The
Jerusalem Post, Indyk said that there is a distinction between
Syria and "the rogue states of Iraq, Iran and Libya", because
Syria has been engaged in direct negotiations with Israel for the
purposes of trying to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
"This is a distinction that we believe is worth maintaining,
and I think the prime minister (Binyamin Netanyahu) does too, as
he said he is interested in negotiating with Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indyk warned Israel against the "risk of polarizing the region
and creating a new axis of the rogue states across the region" by
treating Syria as a rogue state.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Syria decides that it wants to go that way, I cannot
believe it is in the U.S. interest to encourage it. As long as
Syria is prepared to negotiate peace based on UN Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, it is important, not only for the sake
of achieving real and lasting secure peace with Israel, but also
in terms of our strategic interest in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indyk made the remarks after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
likened Syria to a terrorist state in interviews last week.
</P>
<P>
When asked about charges that Syria is playing a double game
by negotiating with Israel while supporting terrorism, Indyk
noted that Syria remains on the State Department list of
countries sponsoring terror and this hurts the U.S.-Syrian
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington would seek to resolve the problem
through negotiations and engagement.
</P>
<P>
Inkyk also denied the U.S. has shifted its land-for-peace
policy, even though Secretary of State Christopher said that
Resolution 242 was a "generality." during his visit to Israel
late June.
</P>
<P>
"We have not changed our positions," he said. "just because
there is a new government here, we don't suddenly wake up the
next day and say that everything we believed for the past three
decades is going to change."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S.position remains that peace
agreements must be concluded with a territorial component, which
is the basis of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 and Madrid peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
"It is still our principle. We also have another principle
that is accepted by all the parties, that the issues have to be
resolved in direct negotiations between them," the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington on July 9 to hold
the first meeting with President Bill Clinton since he took
office. The future of Israeli-Arab peace process, especially
Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian peace talks, is top on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Israel has conducted intermittently peace negotiations with
Syria in the past four years, but failed to reach any agreement
because of the dispute over Israeli withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights it seized from Syria in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Risk Insurance for Satellite Launching provided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese insurance companies are to
cooperate with the international insurance world to provide risk
guarantee for China's satellite launches.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today after the successful
launching of Apstar 1A at Xichang Satellite Launching Center in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, Lin Zhongjie, General Manager
of China Pacific Insurance Company said: "The aero-space industry
is high-tech, and also high-risk. Our Chinese insurance companies
have the responsibility, and are capable for supporting China's
aero-space industry."
</P>
<P>
China Pacific Insurance Company is the general insurance
contractor of the Apstar 1A.
</P>
<P>
Lin said his company provided insurance premiums worth 130
million U.S. dollars for the satellite's launch and successful
movement into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of Apstar 1A, with a Long March 3 rocket,
he added, not only delighted China's aero-space circles, but also
greatly encouraged Chinese and foreign insurance companies to
continue their support for the development of China's aero space
industry.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China Pacific Insurance Company, and some other
Chinese companies, have jointly provided insurance for the
launching of seven Chinese and foreign satellites, and paid
compensation for the failed launches of two satellites.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the compensation for Hong Kong's Apstar 2 reached 160
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Fuwei, representative of U.S.'s Johnson &AMP; Higgins, one of
the three biggest insurance consulting companies in the U.S., and
one of the contracted insurance companies for Apstar 1A, said at
the Launching Center that "the successful launching proved again
the strength of China's aero-space industry, and we have much
faith in the aero space industry insurance service in China."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Bomb Suspects Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Interior Minister
Sheikh Ali Al-Sabah has refuted reports that four persons
recently arrested by security authorities at Kuwait International
Airport were related in any manner to the truck bombing at a
military residential complex in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a press statement on Wednesday that the
four men, three of whom are Saudis, were intending to leave for
Pakistan when they were arrested at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The statement was being made to dispel intense speculation in
the region that Kuwait had arrested those suspected of carrying
out the attack which had claimed lives of 19 American servicemen
and wounded nearly 400 others of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Interior Ministry's Public Relations Department
 Adel Al-Ibrahim confirmed that the four men had been detained,
but denied it had any link with the Saudi bombing.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment on whether the four had been released or
if any charges had been filed against them.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here believe the men had apparently been allowed to
fly to Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  OAU Weighs Options on Mission in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
( by Guo Ming )
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) is considering to withdraw or reduce its Observers Mission
in Burundi (OMIB) despite calls by the Tutsi-led authority of the
central African country torn apart by years of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
"We are weighing options," OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim, who had earlier arrived in Yaounde, capital of Cameroon,
the venue of the heads of state summit scheduled for July 8-10,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"They include withdrawing the military component of the
mission and only maintaining an OAU presence at the political
level to monitor developments and assist as the need arises,"
Salim explained in a report to be submitted to the two-day
council of ministers meeting which starts here today.
</P>
<P>
OMIB monitors the activities of the Tutsi-dominated army and
Hutu rebels in Burundi where U.N. officials say they fear
bloodletting will break out at a similar scale to neighboring
Rwanda's 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The OAU on March 21 renewed the mandate of the mission for
just one month for lack of funding and the over-length of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of its Central Organ for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution in Addis Ababa, it was extended for
another three months but outcry rised for cancelling the mandate
for the lack of political will to solve the issue on both
conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Burundian government had asked for the new
mandate to be extended for six months and for its total strength
to be raised from 60 to 118 members.
</P>
<P>
The death of Burundian President Cyprian Ntaryamira and his
Rwandan counterpart Juvenal Habyramana following the downing of
their aircraft in 1994 as they were returning from Tanzania on
its approach to Kigali Airport, started a massive round of ethnic
massacre in Bujumbura and the whole of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies put the death toll last year at about 30 a day.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the deteriorating political and security situation
in Burundi, where majority ethnic group Hutus have continued a
rebel war with the government controlled by the minority Tutsi,
"has reached a critical point", referring the current fighting
which already raised fears of an all-out civil war.
</P>
<P>
"That's why i believe that we should now be prepared to
redefine the mandate, size, and composition of our mission in
Burundi," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim renewed his support for the mediation efforts of fromer
Tanzanian President Mwalimu Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi's ethnic
slaughtering since the 1993 assassination of its first
freely-elected president.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Agricultural Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, the largest special economic
zone in south China, is concentrating on more efficient
agriculture to make it one of the province's three pillar
industries by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
With 42.8 percent of China's 80,000 sq.km. of tropic areas,
Hainan now meets only 20 to 30 percent of the country's needs for
tropical products at present.
</P>
<P>
After years of development, Hainan has set up a number of
market-oriented farm production bases, using more advanced farming
and animal breeding techniques, and encouraging farmers in their
work.
</P>
<P>
According to one survey, by the end of 1995, Hainan was able to
produce 16,800 tons of mangoes, 70,000 tons of pineapples, and
23,000 tons of aquatic products annually.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has 150 Taiwan-funded enterprises in
agriculture, with a total contractual investment of 98.69 million
US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dogs Helping Israeli Soldiers Detect Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers are using
explosive-sniffing dogs in south Lebanon to thwart most roadside
bombing attacks by Hezbollah forces.
</P>
<P>
Chief Engineering Officer Eli Toledano was quoted as telling
Israel Radio the soldiers have been using these specially trained
dogs for the past several months.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully detected some 60 percent of the bombs
that Hezbollah planted," Toledano said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Engineering Corps sources said that Hezbollah has been
concealing its bombs, which contain dozens of small ball
bearings, in fiberglass casings designed to look like rocks,
which makes detecting them difficult.
</P>
<P>
This has led them to use the explosive-sniffing dogs, which it
had previously reluctant to do for image reasons, they said.
</P>
<P>
The dogs have occasionally been able to detect bombs at a
distance of hundreds of meters, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Over several months, we've noticed that on any road where a
dog has been used, and then a patrol or convoy passes, no bombs
go off," said Col. Koby, who commands the Engineering Corps in
the North.
</P>
<P>
Roadside bombing has been a main alternative to the Katyusha
rocket attacks by the Hezbollah forces, who fight the Israeli
occupation, since the April signing of a ceasefire
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Afghan PM Appoints 9 Ministers of Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar Wednesday appointed nine ministers of his cabinet,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the key positions of foreign minister and civil
aviation minister in the cabinet were not announced in the
line-up.
</P>
<P>
Under a decree issued by President Burhanuddin Rabbani late
Wednesday, Rabbani's old cabinet had resigned before the
installation of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The decree said that "with the aim of establishing peace and
security and of attracting other effective forces in the country
to broaden the base of the government and to create an atmosphere
of confidence and security for the people, the new cabinet has
been approved."
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, one of the arch rivals to Rabbani, rejoined hands
with Rabbani recently and took oath as prime minister of a
coalition government in which Rabbani remained as president last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
So far, besides the positions of foreign ministers and civil
aviation minister, Hekmatyar and Rabbani also failed to agree on
the role of Rabbani's top commander Ahmed Shah Masood in the new
regime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report did not disclose the names and the
positions of the ministers who had already been appointed.

<HEADLINE> China's Cosmetics Market Keeps Growing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's booming economy which has
given millions a good life style has brought about a wave of
vanity.
</P>
<P>
Lipstick has become a yardstick in the country's changing
society as observers cast an eye on the growing cosmetics market.
</P>
<P>
In the past year the cosmetics market in China has grown 40
percent and sales are expected to hit 50 billion yuan (about six
billion US dollars) by the year 2000, "China Light Industry News"
has reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributes the rapid growth to better living
standards and new life philosophies.
</P>
<P>
Brand-name cosmetics, which are 30 percent more expensive than
ordinary products, have claimed 80 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, 90 percent of Chinese newspapers and
journals carry cosmetic advertisements, and 40 percent of TV
commercials are for cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper suggests that the domestic market is still
immature and most consumers simply need cosmetics for skin
protection.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicts that market competition in the cosmetics
market will turn even tenser, and manufacturers will develop more
"technology-intensive cosmetics" to gain bigger market shares
rather than simply engage in an "advertising war."

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Staff at the massive Three Gorges
Dam site on China's Yangtze River are on full alert as destructive
floods sweep large areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The construction site, the biggest of its kind in the world,
has been fully prepared for any possible flooding that might occur
in the mid-Summer flood season, an official said.
</P>
<P>
He Gong, vice-president of the China Yangtze River Three Gorges
Engineering Development Corporation said that staff at the site
are keeping a round-the-clock watch on water levels to ensure the
safety of the site.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control Headquarters predicted that there is an
increasing possibility of heavy flooding in the middle and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River in the mid-Summer flood season, which
lasts from June to September.
</P>
<P>
However, since the flood season began, some central and southern
regions have already been hit by torrential rainstorms, causing
mountain flooding and high waters in the middle and upper reaches
of Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain has continued to fall, and crippled railway
transportation in southern Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Heavy floods might occur later this month, and will last till
early September, said a spokesman at the flood control HQ.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of the embarkments on the south
bank of the Yangtze River, the site has stockpiled rocks and
water-proof sandbags along the river, He added.
</P>
<P>
A team, composed of 30 people from different departments,
has been established to coordinate anti-flooding work.
</P>
<P>
Some measures have been taken to improve telecommunication
facilities, as well as some precautions for large buildings
against flooding.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Launch More Than 10 Hughes Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the Hughes Electronics
Corp. Group have agreed to launch more than 10 satellites next
century for the latter by using a remodeled version of Japan's
H-II rocket, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A contract will be signed next month between Rocket Systems
Corp., a Japanese rocket consortium, and Hughes Space and
Communications International, a newspaper quoted Japanese space
industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The contract, the first for using a Japanese rocket to launch
foreign satellites, will also be the first foreign commercial
launching contract for the H-II rocket since it made its first
successful flight in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
The latest deal will signal Japan's entry into the fiercely
competitive business of commercial satellite launching, a market
where the U.S., European, Russian and Chinese companies vie with
each other for about 30 launches a year, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Rocket Systems will use a remodeled version of
the H-II, called the H-IIA, to launch more than 10 satellites
scheduled to be made by Hughes between 2000 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese rocket consortium is involved with 73 local
aerospace firms, nonlife insurance companies and banks. The H-II
rocket is the first major launching platform developed entirely in
Japan and the only rocket in the country capable for launching a
2-ton satellite into stationary orbit. So far, three H-II rockets
have been successfully launched.

<HEADLINE> New Cultural Ruins Found in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Cultural ruins dating back to the
Bronze Age has been unearthed in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Built during the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Spring and Autumn
Period (11th century-476 B.C.), the ruins were found in Gexin
Village, Mazhonghe Township in the province's Changtu County,
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, pottery jars and agate unearthed
in the ruins show that the ruins belong to a new type of
archaeological culture.
</P>
<P>
Since early May 1996 researchers from the Liaoning Provincial
Institute of Culture and Archaeology have been unearthing cultural
relics at the site.
</P>
<P>
They have found pottery jars, pottery spinning wheels, stone
bars and a piece of pottery artistic works in the shape of a dog's
head.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, the relics unearthed in the ruins
are bigger than most relics excavated that date back to the Bronze
Age.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the relics unearthed in the ruins will help
them study the culture of the Bronze Age in northeast China.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Law courts in east China's Fujian
Province dealt with more than 120,000 cases during the 1992-1995
period, increasing at an annual rate of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Effective law enforcement is crucial for the overall
development of the province, " said a senior official at the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
However, some difficult-to-solve cases have, for various
reasons, brought about an unfavorable impact on people's lives and
hindered the smooth economic development of the province.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 80 grass-root courts and nine higher people's
courts in the province have all established their enforcement
courts, in a move to improve law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the province is scheduled to launch
a province-wide campaign this autumn, in the hope of clearing away
obstacles, and creating a better environment for both domestic and
overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Concerned About Fuel Price Hikes in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials and businessmen in
Nepal said that the recent price rise of petroleum products in
India would certainly have an impact on the Nepali market.
</P>
<P>
Fears of price rise in local markets appeared here as the
Indian government announced Tuesday to increase the prices of
petrol, diesel and cooking gas by 25 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Such a big increase in fuel prices would definitely trigger
sharp price hikes in a wide range of goods in India, market
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As Indian goods cover over one third of Nepal's total imports,
any price fluctuation in India could have an impact on the Nepali
market, businessmen here said.
</P>
<P>
Padma Jyoti, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), was quoted by a local newspaper
today as saying that the fuel price rise in India would have a
chain reaction and a big influence in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He even predicted a 10 to 15 percent price increase in the
Nepali market.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Supplies Ministry said the price rise
in India would increase the illegal cross-border trade between
Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government would take measures of distribution
control to curb the cross-border trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would also have to readjust local fuel prices,
which had been increased by around 10 percent just two months ago,
to control possible cross-border trade as a result of the price
hike in India, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Asians Warned of Western Dominance of TV Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the ongoing Asian
Summit on Child Rights and the Media Wednesday called on TV
stations to promote programs and publications with Asian values to
counter the dominance of western TV programs in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Naohiro Kato of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union, based in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, warned that Asian children are in danger
of forgetting their own traditions and cultures due to their
excessive exposure to many western television programs.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that western children programs show mostly western
cultures that are irrelevant to Asia. "Let us be reminded that we
should retain our won values. And more important, we should impart
them to our children," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States controls 85 percent of the world's trade in
audio and video. Among Asian children's programs, US films account
for a large proportion.
</P>
<P>
"But while the US dominates all our markets, it buys and sees
very little of any other products we produce," said Patricia
Edgar, director of the Australian Children's Television
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Edgar, together with some other delegates, branded US dominance
as "a new form of colonialism" or "cultural imperialism" since US
programs are based on a highly competitive commercial philosophy
and tend to be cultural subversive for Asian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The delegates urged the Asian TV producers to produce more
traditional programs that reflect Asian values.
</P>
<P>
At the four-day summit that will end today, the 200 delegates
from 19 countries or regions in Asia also called on TV stations
for more involvement in addressing children issues and problems.
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged that while there was a remarkable improvement
in development, health, and education among Asian children, other
issues like child labor and prostitution have undermined their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Carriere, representative of the United Nations
International Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Bangladesh, cited the
case of India where about 10,000 children die daily. The figure is
the equivalent of a death toll of a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"But unlike the earthquake, it never makes the news," he said,
adding that about 50 to 60 million South Asian children are still
trapped in full-time labor, while tens of thousands of girls aged
10 to 12 are forced into commercial sex every year.

<HEADLINE> Pot Seller Fined For Over the Top Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Hainan Province has imposed
a hefty fine on a Hong Kong business venture for selling mineral
water pots at a greatly inflated price.
</P>
<P>
The firm was fined and suffered media exposure after selling
mineral water pots at a staggering price of 10,239 yuan (1233.61
US dollars) each. The pots, assembled in China with South Korean
parts, actually costs only 4,114 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The island province has punished two other businesses involved
in illegal direct selling.
</P>
<P>
The other two were dealt with because, while with registration
elsewhere, they were illegally engaged in trans-regional
transactions in Hainan, in violation of State rules and
regulations.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Highway Bridge Under Major Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Work started today on a major
repair project on one of the Yangtze River's busiest bridges.
</P>
<P>
The 20-million yuan scheme on the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge
will mean road traffic being cut by nearly one third until the
work is completed in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
It is the first major renovation on the highway bridge since it
opened 28 years ago. The bridge forms a crucial part of a major
transportation hub on China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
With a railway 6,772 meters in length and a highway 4,589
meters in length, the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is one of the
largest dual-function bridges in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 28 years over one million trains, and 200 million
vehicles have crossed the bridge, transporting about two billion
passengers and three billion tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the bridge had been normal until recently. But the
rapid growth in car and vehicle ownership sent the daily vehicle
flow on the highway rocketing to 56,000, almost nine times its
designed capacity.
</P>
<P>
Though yearly repair on the highway has topped 20,000 square
meters, it is far from completely dealing with the wear and tear
damage, making major overall repair work imminent, bridge
authorities said, adding that the project will take two months and
a cost of over 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
From today until September 4, traffic on the highway will be
cut by a third each day by banning some vehicles and limiting
others, by allowing them to cross the bridge only on alternate
days.
</P>
<P>
A new motor vehicle ferry which was put in service in May will
help soak up some of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, capital of economically-important Jiangsu Province,
has built a number of overpasses, and elevated roads in its
drive to increase its road network.
</P>
<P>
In another move, preparation is under way to build a second
bridge on the Nanjing section of the Yangtze.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite increasing fears over his
health, President Boris Yeltsin enjoyed a double-digit lead in
Russia's decisive presidential run-off election on Wednesday,
according to latest election results.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 92 percent of the votes counted, the electoral
commission said today that Yeltsin led communist challenger
Gennady Zyuganov by 54 to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 5 percent of voters exercised a third option of voting
against both candidates.
</P>
<P>
But electoral officials said that the turnout of the run-off
was several percentage points lower than in the first round
election in June 16.
</P>
<P>
About 69.8 percent of the country's registered voters, or more
than 75 million people, cast their votes in the first round,
during which Yeltsin and Zyuganov were the top two runners.
Neither of them won more than half of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Yeltsin voted in private at his rural
resident outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president has not been seen in public for a whole
week. Officials said he was suffering from a hoarse voice or a
cold, but, after two heart attacks last year, the incident has
sparked speculations about his health.

already exist. And, the annual grain production growth rate of
1.34 percent is not keeping pace with the annual population
growth, at 1.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
To feed its 1.2 billion people, China is using advanced
technology to produce more grain. But, ultimately, the country
must preserve its cultivated land, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates of the total area of cultivated land in China
were released in the early 1950s. But the estimates are as
inaccurate as teh surveying instruments used 40-odd years ago. In
the past 10 years, the government has been doing another
survey. The study , expected to be finished soon, already shows
there are 133 million hectares of arable land, a 40 percent
increase compared with earlier figures.
</P>
<P>
But, despite this increase, China still lags far behind world
standards. Per capita area of cultivated land is less than half
the world average.
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse is the fact that a large proportion of
this land is located in areas with harsh natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
Only 12 provinces exceed cultivated land ratios of 0.13 hectare
per person.
</P>
<P>
These provinces, however, are mainly located in the northwest
and north, where the climate is not suitable for grain production.
</P>
<P>
Except for Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which export some
grain, the other 10 provinces can barely feed themselves, and some
require imports.
</P>
<P>
It's unrealistic politically and economically for China to rely
on imported grain to feed its population, said Zou, who believes
China should and must be self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
The country should only use imports to vary stocks and
replenish supplies.
</P>
<P>
Without changes in agricultural methods, it will be impossible
to produce more grain, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Zou said China must save its cultivated land while it tries to
meet demands for more construction and development.
</P>
<P>
But, with efficient, scientific land management, a balance
could be struck between construction and land protection to
achieve sustainable economic development, said Zou.
</P>
<P>
Current construction land use is wasteful. It is estimated
about 40 percent of urban land is not used to its full potential.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, a big proportion of residential areas could be
rezoned for cultivation. At current economic and technical
development levels, 66 million hectares of land could be used
better.
</P>
<P>
Once-arable land destroyed due to road construction, railways,
irrigation projects and mineral exploitation could be reclaimed
in many cases.
</P>
<P>
If the potential for reclamation was fully explored, about 20
million hectares of cultivated land could be rehabilitated in the
next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Thus, land for construction could be guaranteed, while
cultivated land remains untouched, according to Zou.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua)--Reform and opening up have not
weakened the predominance of state ownership in Guangdong, China's
most prosperous coastal province.
</P>
<P>
Results of a four-year study on the state property in the
province shows that Guangdong ranks first among China's provinces
and regions in the number of state-run enterprises, total capital
value of state property, and volume of net capital assets.
</P>
<P>
The revenues generated by state firms in Guangdong also
exceeded all the other provinces and regions, according to the
study, which began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 1995, there were 19,476 state-run
enterprises and 33,100 administrative units in Guangdong, with a
total property value of 306.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprises have total capital assets of 797.9
billion yuan and their debt-liability rate is 67.1 percent, lower
than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Though the number of large and medium-sized enterprises
accounts for 14.6 percent of state enterprises total, their assets
claimed 62 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
According to the study results, among cities and towns in the
province, Shenzhen took the lead in tax revenues turned out by the
state enterprises. Guangzhou, capital city of Guangdong Province,
boasts state firms with the most capital assets, net capital
assets and state property value.

SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A South-China tiger, old enough to

</P>
<P>
Qingqing, aged 14, gave birth to her latest offspring - her
seventh cub - a month ago at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials say data shows the cub-bearing period of female
South China tigers kept in zoos is from age four to twelve
years. Only a few dozen of the tigers survive, either in the wild

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cotton Protected from Bollworms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The prevention and control rate of
cotton bollworms in China has risen to 90 percent, up from 50
percent reported in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Cui Shi'an, director of the Agriculture Ministry's Agricultural
Department, said that the average cost for the prevention and
control of bollworms in one mu (about 0.07 ha) of cotton field
dropped to 60 yuan (7.5 US dollars), while the per unit output
rose from 44 kilograms to 55 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cotton bollworms were rampant in the cotton
fields around the Yellow and Huaihe rivers in 1992, which resulted
in a four billion yuan loss in cotton output that year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the ministry has launched programs
in three ways for preventing and controlling cotton bollworms in
12 major cotton production provinces, including Hubei, Henan,
Shandong, Anhui, Hebei and Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
In those areas, the cost for bollworm control dropped by 20
percent, and the per unit output of cotton rose by 10 to 15
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the exchange of the information on bollworm
control, the communications center of the Ministry of Agriculture
hooked up with computer systems in 11 plant protection stations
within the provinces and regions that produce cotton.
</P>
<P>
The State will grant two million yuan to support the bollworm
monitoring works this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has urged the relevant departments across the
country to prepare for a possible return of the bollworms during
the next two months, since a potentially disastrous number of the
worms could soon breed if the weather and plants are conducive to
their growth.

HANGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Shinian town have
discovered an easy way to overcome poverty: get help from
neighbors who are already rich.
</P>
<P>
This is possible because of an association for achieving common
prosperity, formed by local rich farmers. The group provides
resources for poor farming families, including funds,
technologies, information, and labor forces.
</P>
<P>
Members of the association are farmers who are successful in
managing factories, and farming and breeding animals using
scientific methods. They attribute their own wealth to the
advantages that have come their way due to China's reform and
opening up.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by 1991, more than 1,100 out of 5,415
farming households in Shinian and in Wenling, in east China's
Zhejiang province, have an annual income of more than 30,000
yuan. And more than 100 households each earn more than 50,000 yuan
annually.
</P>
<P>
The association's membership has increased to 376 from the
former 132, since the group formed more than four years ago. With
its help, more than 200 farming households have overcome

COLOMBO, July 4 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's main opposition party,
the United National Party (UNP), has rejected the proposal of the
Tamil political parties for a federal state, UNP sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the UNP Ranil Wickremesinghe told the leaders of five
Tamil parties who met him Wednesday that his party stood for an
indivisible Sri Lanka and any proposal that threatened the unitary
character of the country was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Ranil as saying that on the issue of merging
the Northern and Eastern provinces, the final decision lay with
the people of the Eastern province.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the grievances of the Tamils were well
understood by his party who supported a negotiated settlement to
the ethnic question, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Tamil parties met the opposition leader to
seek his support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
Without the support of the United National Party, the
government will not be able to obtain the two-thirds majority
required for the passage of its devolution package in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The devolution package announced by the president last August
aims to resolve the long-standing ethnic crisis in the country. It

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed into law on Wednesday a bill expanding federal jurisdiction
over church burnings and strengthening federal penalties for such
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I applaud the Congress' swift unanimous and bipartisan passage
of this bill," Clinton said in a statement. "I have signed it
promptly upon its transmittal to me so that the new law can go
into effect as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which comes in response to more than 40
suspicious fires at predominantly black churches in the south over
the last 18 months, had bipartisan support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by Congress last week and sent to the White
House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new law, the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, broadens
the authority of the federal government to prosecute as a federal
crime the intentional defacing, damaging or destroying of
religious property "on the basis of race, color or ethnicity."
</P>
<P>
It doubles to 20 years the maximum prison sentence for damage
to religious property that causes injury to people, and increases
the statute of limitations for prosecution from five to seven
years.
</P>
<P>
The law authorizes money to increase the number of federal
agents investigating, preventing and responding to attacks on
religious property.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill 98-0 last Wednesday, and the House
accepted that version by voice vote the next day. Earlier, the
House had unanimously approved a bill of its own.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended today that a 136-member
U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) should be extended for
another six months despite the fact that the Georgian government
and the Abkhaz separatist cannot agree on a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The core issue in the Georgian/Abkhaz conflict, namely the
definition of a political status for Abkhazia acceptable to both
sides, remains unresolved," Boutros-Ghali said in his report to
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"In the hope that the parties can still be persuaded to help
reactivate the peace process, I recommend that the Security
Council extend the mandate of UNOMIG until January 31, 1997," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the secretary-general also told the council that
the threat of mines in the Gali sector was serious and not only
prevented UNOMIG from fully carrying out its mandate but could
have grave consequences for the repatriation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 Georgians fled Abkhazia in 1993 when separatists
with outside support drove out Georgian government troops in a
lightning campaign.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai judges may stay until 65, but
they will no longer retain their executive positions when they
turn 60.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Extraordinary Committee of the
House of Representatives on Wednesday when it reviewed a bill to
extend judges' retirement age.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that under the committee ruling, all
judges will be allowed to retire at the age of 65, instead of 60
as at present, and they may handle normal judicial work once they
turn 60.
</P>
<P>
Thai Supreme Court President Pramarn Chansue is expected to
lose his position at the end of September. His deputy and some
chief judges will also be among those who will lose their
administrative positions when they turn 60.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Store Blaze in Ohio Kills Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
killed and 12 injured in a blaze erupted today at a fireworks
store in southern Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
Bottle rockets whizzed, strings of firecrackers exploded and
smoke filled the building as about 40 people scrambled for the
front door, the Associated Press quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The eight dead included at least two children. They were found
huddled around an adult at Ohio River Fireworks, in extreme
southern Ohio near the West Virginia line.
</P>
<P>
Five of the injured were taken to Cabell Huntington
Hospital. Three of whom were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The fire was under control in about three hours, but the
building was destroyed, leaving only walls. Some of the victims
were burned so hard that they could only be identified by examing
their dental records.
</P>
<P>
Three people were suspected of starting the fire and were taken
into custody. They had intentionally thrown firecrackers in the
store, reported the WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The store sells small fireworks to the public. But the
fireworks were not allowed to be set off in the state.

<HEADLINE> Payne Says He Will Work Nonstop During Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Olympic chief Billy
Payne, who is recovering after undergoing surgery for a herniated
disc in his neck that ruptured several weeks ago, said here on
Wednesday that he would work nonstop during the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Payne, who had suffered several heart attacks which almost
killed him, told the reporters that he felt great now and enjoyed
being workholic.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have entertainment," he said. "Precisely, work is my
entertainment."
</P>
<P>
As Payne was released from the hospital after the surgery late
June, his colleagues suggested he should take two weeks off from
his Olympic duties to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to the last days and conserving his strength is
important," said Dick Yarbrough, communication director of the
Olympic organizing committee. "I don't think Billy would push it."
</P>
<P>
But it seemed that Payne had forgotten the suggestion. He cut
short his recovering time and threw himself into a packed schedule.
</P>
<P>
Payne also said that he would go to watch quite a few events in
the Games, including the women's air rifle shooting, which will
produce the Games' first gold medal, the baseball match between
the United States and Cuba, as well as the men's soccer final.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Indian Cabinet Expansion Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda is expected to undertake a fresh expansion of his Council of
Ministers Friday, the second of its kind in a week, the local
press said today.
</P>
<P>
Gowda will have a round of discussions with leaders of the
constituents of the United Front before finalizing the number of
fresh entrants to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the Friday exercise would be mainly to
induct Raghuvans Prasad Singh and Satpalji Maharaj, who were
listed as ministers of state but did not take oath or accept his
portfolio last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj was later appointed as a minister of state with
independent charge and is expected to be sworn in Friday.
</P>
<P>
Singh complained that he would not join the United Front
government as a minister of state because people junior to him in
the state politics were made either a cabinet minister or a
minister with independent charge.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the expansion on Friday might see him take
charge as a minister with independent charge.
</P>
<P>
The expansion will also accommodate a couple of members of
parliament for a balanced representation of different states and
minority groups.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Plans to Control Dumping of Dairy Products to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Ministry of Trade and
Foreign Economic Relations will propose that the government impose
export taxes on milk and dairy products exported to the European
Union (EU), Minister Atanas Paparizov said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is designed to curb the dumping of Bulgarian milk
and dairy products to EU markets at excessively low prices, the
minister at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, some Bulgarian exporters, in an
intention to promote sales, have vied with one another in cutting
prices of milk and diary products exported to the EU, which is
detrimental to the interest of Bulgarian producers, Paparizov said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, soft cheese was sold at 1,775 U.S.
dollars per ton until May 10, but the price soon slid down to
1,380 dollars a ton. Solid cheese was sold at 2,290 dollars per
ton before May 10, but now it has fallen down to 1,759 dollars per
ton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said that his ministry will also limit
the imports of milk powder and cheese to protect the interest of
domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria set up a registration system on the import of milk
powder on May 1. The system will remain effective until October
31.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's trade volume with the EU makes up 37 percent of its
total foreign trade volume and the EU is one of the most important
trade partners of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's export volume to the EU in the first quarter of the
year stood at 624 million ECUs (773 million U.S. dollars), and its
import volume from the EU 615 million ECUs (762 million
U.S. dollars), according to statistics from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Paparizov predicted that the foreign trade of Bulgaria will
enjoy a favorable balance this year.

MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Carmencita Reodica said Wednesday that red tide is a true
phenomenon and not a product of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated the warning issued by the Red Tide Task Force
against harvesting, transporting, selling and eating shellfish in
infested areas and asked local officials to destroy remaining
mussel farms.
</P>
<P>
Reodica made these remarks in a hard effort to refute claims by
an organization of fishermen around Manila bay, who questioned the
existence of the plague and the real causes of the deaths
attributed to paralytic shellfish poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Besides these fishermen, residents of coastal towns still
believe there is no red tide.
</P>
<P>
A total of 125 cases of red-tide poisoning have been reported
since June 1, seven of them having died.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Fidel Ramos announced 22 cities and
municipalities in three regions as red tide calamity areas.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Foreign Debt Rises to $32 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Peru's foreign debt rose to 32.061
billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1995 in which 75.7 percent is
owed by the public sector, the Central Bank of the Reserve said
today in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The total debt is composed of the short, medium and long term
debts of the public sector, the private sector and the Central
Bank of the Reserve which provides loans to support the balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign debt disclosed today is 4.547 billion
dollars higher than the one previously published.
</P>
<P>
The increase is due to the addition of generated interests
since 1983, other surcharges and arrears for overdue and unpaid
debt, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Peru stopped paying the service of its foreign debt in
1983. Since then, the country did not include the financial costs
in the statistics until an agreement was reached in 1991 with
creditors to prevent affecting the country's negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the medium and long term public debts in 1991
increased by 2.523 billion dollars over 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The HSBC Markets Hong Kong Bond
Index rose in June to 114.8, an increase of 0.46 percent over May,
according to the latest release by Hongkong Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC) Markets.
</P>
<P>
The bond index for December 31, 1993, was set as 100, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the sub-index for the Hong Kong government papers
was 114.68 in June, an increase of 0.38 percent over May, while
the sub-index for non-Hong Kong government papers was 116.03,
registering an increase of 0.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the level at the end of June 1995, the overall
index increased 7.3 percent, the sub-index for the Hong Kong
Government papers by 5.5 percent and for non-Hong Kong Government
papers by 8.4 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
In June, local interbank interest rates were firmer,
particularly at the shorter end of the market, due to several
public share offers and the effect of the half-year closing.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the passing of the one-year mark before the year
of 1997 had no tangible effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of debt issues was seen during the month, following
the World Bank issue led by HSBC Markets in late May, as
investors' demand remained firm, which has promoted the higher
outright yield levels in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Group comprising
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela has stated its
commitment to negotiate with the South American Common Common
Market (Mercosur) on a rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the five countries reached an agreement to
negotiate with Mercosur within the general guidelines agreed upon
Tuesday by officials of those countries at a meeting of the
Cartagena Accord Commission.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur was formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Conversations between the two groups are being carried out in
two stages, an Andean Group source said.
</P>
<P>
The first stage includes the so-called Historical Heritage,
meaning the signing of agreements between the countries of the two
groups within the Latin American Integration Association.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will seek to define the norms and liberation
programs to reach coordinated agreements to prevent damage to the
diverse subregional accords.
</P>
<P>
A free trade agreement was signed between Bolivia and Mercosur
recently and it was never considered as separated from the
agreements already existing in the Andean Group.
</P>
<P>
"It is logical that there is different rhythms, since we do not
follow the same political time, but what is really important is
that all of us are going to be in the same place at some moment,"
Bolivian Development Minister Manuel Rico said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peruvian Commerce Minister Liliana Canale has
expressed the commitment of her country to Latin American
integration, saying that Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has
proposed to correct those elements that prevent the progress of
the integration process.
</P>
<P>
Besides reinforcing their unity, the members of the Andean
Group approved during the meeting a document on the harmonization
of indirect taxes as incentives to the exports of the group member
countries.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Leads in Early Russian Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite increasing fears over his
health, President Boris Yeltsin enjoyed a double-digit lead in the
preliminary results of Russia's decisive presidential run-off
election on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 14 million votes counted, the electoral commission
said early today that Yeltsin led communist challenger Gennady
Zyuganov by 52.32 percent to 41.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
A further 5.59 percent of the ballots were cast against both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The first results were mainly from the less populated far
eastern regions, where polling ended long before other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
But electoral officials said that the turnout there by midday
Wednesday was several percentage points lower than in the first
round election in June 16.
</P>
<P>
About 69.8 percent of the country's registered voters, or more
than 75 million people, cast their votes in the first round,
during which Yeltsin and Zyuganov were the top two runners.
Neither of them won more than half of the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Yeltsin voted in private at his rural
resident outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president has not been seen in public for a whole
week. Officials said he was suffering from a hoarse voice or a
cold, but, after two heart attacks last year, the incident has
sparked speculations about his health.

<HEADLINE> Former Venezuelan President Expelled From Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez was deprived of his lifetime senatorship today by the
congress after being found guilty of embezzling government funds
by the court in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The National Congress of Venezuela made the unanimous decision
after a hearing attended by major national political parties.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Andres Perez was the president of Venezuela from 1974 to
1979. He was first detained in 1993 and has been under house
arrest since July 1994, as he is already in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, he was found guilty of embezzling as much as 17
million U.S. dollars of secret government funds by the Supreme
Court of Justice, and sentenced to two years and four months in
house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Cristobal Fernandez Dalo said after the
decision that the divestiture is justified under the Venezuelan
constitution.

Observers here pointed out that the Senate's decision is a hard
blow to Perez's political ambitions and entails his political
demise.

However, after learning of the Congress decision, the former

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Agreed on Black Sea Naval Base Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia have finally agreed
on the expiry date of Russian Black Sea Fleet's lease of the
Sevastopol naval base, a senior Ukrainian official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of Ukraine's National Security
Council, told the media that both he and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's aide, Dmitry Ryurikov, have agreed that the Russian navy
could build its own base in the Black Sea under the lease whose
duration is 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement is good for Ukraine because it takes into
account Ukrainian interests.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of Ukraine's new constitution June 28,
Yeltsin sent Ryurikov to Kiev to discuss with Ukrainian officials
rules governing foreign troop presence in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin remarked though that the new constitution does not
rule out the possibility that the Russian navy may use the
Sevastopol base on a 20-year lease.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet issue is believed to be a headache for both
Russia and Ukraine after the latter's independence from Russia.
The setting of an expiry date of the lease will help them finally
resolve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Unveils Its APEC Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has submitted its Action
Plan under the commitment within the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Action Plan, which covers 14 of all the 15 required
areas except tariffs, has already been delivered to the
Philippines which will host this year's informal leadership
conference of APEC in November.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand could not submit its plan for tariff
reduction because it needed to study details more closely, said
Rachane Potjanasuntorn, deputy director-general of the Business
Economics Department under the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Details under some of the headings in the Action Plan would be
worked out later, Rachane said.
</P>
<P>
APEC's 18 members had agreed to complete their action plans
under 15 headings before this year's APEC meeting. The plans are
aimed at mapping out the road toward free trade and investment in
APEC by 2010 for developed members and by 2020 for developing
members.
</P>
<P>
Each APEC member probably would not submit its full action plan
until the last meeting of senior officials, which will be held
immediately before the November meeting of APEC leaders, Rachane
said.
</P>
<P>
Some APEC members want to see more liberalization in specific
sectors. The United States, for example, has been pressing for a
zero tariff rate on information technology products.
</P>
<P>
But some developing members, including Thailand, are urging
caution.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has flown another 193
Vietnamese back to Hanoi from the Galang Island of Riau province,
West Sumatra, according to reports reaching here today from Batam,
Riau province.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese were flown by a Garuda Indonesia jet from Batam
Island Airport near Galang on Tuesday, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has now repatriated 1,185 Vietnamese and Cambodians
from Galang in recent months. A navy vessel will take back the
remaining 300 Cambodians on Sunday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,000 Vietnamese still on Galang island,
according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian authorities want to develop Galang as part of a
multi-island industrial and development zone.
</P>
<P>
Galang, used in the late 1970s to settle people fleeing Vietnam
and Cambodia, has accommodated about 120,000 "boat" people, but

<HEADLINE> South China to Eliminate Snail Parasites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Local governments in the lake areas
of south China are being urged to expand efforts to prevent snail
fever, a parasitic disease rampant in 123 counties in southern
lake areas, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The government is hoping to eradicate the disease by the year
2000, safeguarding the health of the 66 million residents in the
districts, an official with the Ministry of Public Health said.
</P>
<P>
The goal was set after the accomplishment of eight pilot
counties in the past five years were reviewed by the Ministry of
Public Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of
Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Snail fever, or schistosomiasis, is spread by water-born
parasites and is sometimes fatal, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The disease makes the victims' stomachs swell up and harms the
liver.
</P>
<P>
Snail fever was wiped out in the 1950s, but reappeared in the
early 1980s and spread rapidly due to a lack of snail inspections
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The central government launched a snail elimination campaign in
1989.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the Ministry of Public Health, the
infected areas are concentrated in five lake provinces including
Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi and Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
There are currently one million patients with chronic snail
fever, a drop of 42 percent from five years before.
</P>
<P>
About 500 acute infection cases are reported annually, a
reduction of more than 90 percent since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The State and local governments spend up to 60 million yuan
(about 7.2 million US dollars) each year on snail fever control.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the provincial government of Jiangxi poured more
than 49 million yuan (about 5.8 million US dollars) into
prevention.
</P>
<P>
In the five years, snails have been eliminated in a nearly 400
million square-meter area and 4.2 million people have received
medical checks for the fever and more than one-fourth of them have
been treated.
</P>
<P>
This parasitic disease has been basically eradicated in seven
counties in the province.
</P>
<P>
The infection rate of snail fever dropped sharply to 3.8
percent, a 62 percent decrease from 1990, and the acute infection
cases dropped by 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the State Council, pilot work has been
carried out in eight counties in the five lake provinces since
1991.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive measures have been taken to eradicate snails in
fields and in waters and treat patients with the disease.
</P>
<P>
All eight counties have reported a sharp decline of acute
infection cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (xinhua) -- China will use advanced technology
in its fight against poverty in the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will target the northwest Loess plateau, the
southwest Karst areas and the Tibetan high and cold areas,
according to a report in the Hubei-based "Economic Information
News" that quoted a report from the State Sciences Commission.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, many poor areas in the country have greatly
improved their living conditions. But the western part, with its
hostile natural environment, lags far behind.
</P>
<P>
"It is still not enough to provide only funds and materials to
drag residents out of poverty there," according to the newspaper
report.
</P>
<P>
It said advanced technologies may help these areas eliminate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, people in the the northwest Loess
plateau, which has a history of soil erosion and scarce water
supplies, will learn about updated technologies for water and soil
conservation, and for water-conservation in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Practical techniques that have improved the use of abundant
natural resources in the southwest part of the country will be
spread in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Technologies for cold-resistant plant and livestock production
and processing, and for the utilization of geothermal power and
solar energy will be used to help residents in the Tibet
Autonomous Region rise from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 65 million people living in
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Oldest American Olympian Accused of Bribing into Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- American fencer Elaine Cheris, the
oldest U.S. Olympian at age 50, was accused of trying to buy her
way into the Games.
</P>
<P>
A Ukrainian fencer said she was offered 500 dollars by a coach
to lose a crucial bout to Cheris at an Olympic qualifying meet
earlier this year, the charge that the American fencer denied.
</P>
<P>
Cheris succeeded in making the women's epee team, but the
allegations made her the most unpopular in the team.
</P>
<P>
Cheris, who served on a committee that lobbied to introduce
women's epee as an Olympic sport this year, maintains women who
did not make the U.S. spread the allegations out of jealousy. She
said someone was making a last-ditch effort to get her thrown out
of the team.
</P>
<P>
"It just sounds like somebody is doing something just to cause
a stink," said Cheris, a 1988 Olympian in foil who is ranked 64th
in the world in epee. "It's kind of silly thing. Things get crazy
during the Olympics. People do anything to get on the team."
</P>
<P>
But Ukrainian fencer Anna Garina said a "German" coach named
Gabriel Nielaba, offered the bribe on March 17 during the women's
epee World Cup in Tauberbischofsheim of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Nielaba is a native of Poland who has taught fencing in that
city for the past 14 years. Janusz Peciak, who coaches Cheris and
won the Olympic gold medal in modern pentathlon in 1976, is also
Polish. The two coaches are good friends.
</P>
<P>
Cheris said that Nielba approached her 10 minutes before the bout
with Cheris and asked to speak with her privately.
</P>
<P>
"If you lose the bout, you will get 500 dollars," Garina said the
coach told her. "I said no and he said OK."
</P>
<P>
After losing, Garina said she became concerned that someone
would suspect she had deliberately thrown the bout. She blamed her
poor performance on the distraction caused by the offer.

<HEADLINE> Shanghainese Learn American Healthy Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents, known as the
country's pickiest eaters, heard healthy diet tips in a recent
speech by an American nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, titled "Smart Eating in the 90's," Dr. Dorothy
Chou, a chief scientist at the health and nutrition department of
the Kraft Foods, said that Shanghainese shouldn't give up healthy
diets because of their full schedules and pressure from work.
</P>
<P>
Chou said the Chinese people are changing their traditional
diets and putting different kinds of food on their dinner tables
as a result of improved living standards.
</P>
<P>
She recommended a simple and satisfying diet, which is
well-balanced, varied and served in appropriate portions.
</P>
<P>
She also explained the concept of the "food pyramid" in which
corn, rice and flour products form the bottom, fatty foods

<HEADLINE> One-fourth of Uruguayan Population in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one in every four
Uruguayans lives in poverty, according to the results of a poll
published today by the National Statistics Institute (INE).
</P>
<P>
As of May 1995, said the INE, the poor accounted for 24.6
percent of the Latin American country's total population and 22.3
percent of its capital city of Montevideo's residents.
</P>
<P>
The sub-standard economic condition, as shown by the survey of
4,000 households from June 1994 to May 1995, affected 16.9 percent
of households in the urban areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the rate of persons in poverty surpasses that of
the households, the INE report explained, is because poor families
usually have a higher number of members.
</P>
<P>
Actually, in Uruguay's urban areas, the number of households
living in poverty decreased by 8 percent and number of people in
poverty reduced by 9 percent between 1989 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, a slight increase was noticed in 1995, in Montevideo
as well as in the interior of the country.
</P>
<P>
The most extreme situation of poverty, which appears when
income is not enough to cover the basic food needs, represents 1
percent of households and 2 percent of urban population.
</P>
<P>
In Uruguay, the monthly income of an average poor household of
three members does not surpass 500 U.S. dollars, while an average
rich family has at least 1,750 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yangzhou Passenger Car Plant Dominates Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Yangzhou Passenger Car Plant in
east China's Jiangsu Province, has become the largest production
base of the kind in the country after 15 years' hard efforts.
</P>
<P>
The plant recently signed a tentative agreement with the
Volkswagen Group of Germany for the joint management of the
Yaxing-Benz Co. Ltd., which involves a total investment of 100
million US dollars and will mainly produce passenger cars running
on the expressways.
</P>
<P>
The plant turned out 5,200 passenger cars last year, becoming
the first Chinese passenger car factory with an annual output
exceeding 5,000 units.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the plant turned out 2,432
passenger cars and sold 2,360 of them. It earned a sales income of
298 million yuan and a profit of 5.49 million yuan, up 43 percent
and 61 percent, respectively, from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The plant was once an automotive repair shop for the People's
Liberation Army, and was renovated into a passenger car plant in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
To meet market demand, the plant developed 72 styles of
passenger cars in 10 major categories between 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Factory Director Ju Baocai said that to keep up with the rapid
development of expressways in the country, the plant recently
built a production line to make passenger cars designed primarily
for highway travel.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Yaxing Passenger Car Group, with the Yangzhou Passenger
Car Plant as its core, will soon be established in order to
consolidate its large market share.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the group will have an annual
production capacity of 50,000 passenger cars and 32,000 chassis.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, it is also expected to earn 10 billion yuan
in annual sales, one billion yuan in pre-tax profit, and 100
million US dollars in foreign exchange income.
</P>
<P>
The production plant will turn out 7,000 luxury passenger cars
and 12,000 chassis, made in cooperation with Benz of
Germany.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help De-mine in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will take an
initiative to help de-mine in the war-torn former Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia, the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"You know from the experience of our troops in IFOR
(international peacekeeping troops in Bosnia) that mines are one
of the greatest threats not only to soldiers, but to civilians, in
Bosnia," Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press briefing
here.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is going to contribute 15 million U.S.
dollars to help train demobilized soldiers in Bosnia to de-mine;
to take mines out of their towns, villages and their areas," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that of the 15 million U.S. dollars, 5
million U.S. dollars will be used to sustain the Mine Action
Center for a full year. Another 5 million U.S. dollars have been
requested from the U.S. Congress to fund specific demining
contracts. And the final 5 million U.S. dollars will be used for
training and equipping soldiers in their demining activities.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had decided
to take another initiative for creating a blue-ribbon commission
to investigate and document the cases of missing persons from the
four and a half years of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
There were 12,000 certified cases of missing people. Only a
handful of those cases have been resolved.

<HEADLINE> Forty Thousand AIDS Cases Registered in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- France has registered 41,058 cases of
AIDS by March 31, 1996, with 633 of them being those of children,
the National Network of Public Health (RNSP) said today.
</P>
<P>
Six thousand AIDS cases were diagnosed in 1995, compared with
6,400 in 1994, RNSP said in a report quoting statistics in a
weekly epidemiology bulletin published by the ministry of health.
</P>
<P>
Although globally the AIDS epidemic seems to be stabilizing,
the week drop of cases in 1995 is still too recent to tell the
long-term tendency (of the disease in France)," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number of new cases reported among
homosexuals and bisexuals in France stand around 2,500 each year
since 1991, while that reported among drug-addicts stand around
1,500 each year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
It said that number of people infected with AIDS disease
through heterosexual actions continues to rise. In 1995, about
1,400 people in the country were diagnosed to be infected with HIV
virus through heterosexual actions.
</P>
<P>
But the number of people newly infected through blood
transfusion in the country is dropping quickly, said the report.

NEW YORK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks reduced early
losses today as the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations it
wouldn't raise interest rates to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 17.36 points, more than
halving an early-afternoon deficit of almost 38. It closed at
5,703.02.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. Its volume totaled 334.57 million
shares, compared with 387.46 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.64 to 360.37, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.21 to 672.40.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.28 to 1181.87, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.09 to 579.65.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq market showing the worst losses on continuing
concerns about computer-industry profits.
</P>
<P>
Trading had continued at Tuesday's cautious pace until this
afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announced at the end of its
two-day meeting that it had left the central bank's lending rates
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The decision to leave rates steady for now had been expected by
many economists, who argued that Fed officials want to see more
information on the pace of inflation before taking action.
</P>
<P>
Bonds had slipped in the morning after the Commerce Department
reported that orders to U.S. factories jumped 1.9 percent in May,
the third straight advance and the biggest in nine months.
</P>
<P>
But the increase was in line with expectations and wasn't seen
as having much impact on the Fed's deliberations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic announced today that he would not run for the upcoming
elections scheduled in September.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb radio reported that the Serb leader decided
not to run in the elections "despited the request to do so by the
Serb Democratic Party."
</P>
<P>
The radio said Karadzic's decision was "in the best interest of
the Serb people." International community has threatened to
reimposed sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs unless Karadzic was
completely out of political life in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic resigned as Serb president on Sunday and transferred
all his presidential power to Vice-president Biljana Plavsic. But
he remained president of the ruling Serb Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader was twice indicted by the Hague-based
international war crimes tribunal as war criminal suspect. Under
the Dayton agreement, any war criminals charged by the
international tribunal must not participate in the elections in
Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Follow-up of Major UN Conferences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Wang Xuexian, the
acting permanent representative of China to the world
organization, said today that the consensus gained at the major
U.N. conferences on environment, population, poverty and women is
but a new starting point for international cooperation and that it
is even more important to turn the consensus views into concrete
action.
</P>
<P>
"Without effective follow-up actions, the conferences already
convened and the document adopted will inevitable lose their
significance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at an annual 5-week substantive session of
the U.N. Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
With regards to how to carry follow-up actions, Ambassador Wang
said that the very essence of the consensus reached at the
conferences is that economic growth in all countries, particularly
the developing countries, should be promoted, while at the same
time attach importance to social development and environment
protection, so as to pursue development in a coordinated manner.
</P>
<P>
"This should constitute a basic principle guiding follow-up
activities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called for attention on the issues of financial resources,
technology transfer and the international economic environment.
</P>
<P>
"They are only the means for achieving the objective of
strengthening the role of the United Nations in the relevant
fields, and for providing improved services for substantive
follow-up action," he said, referring to institutional issues and
relevant reform measures.
</P>
<P>
"If we devote our attentions only to institutional issues and
neglect the substantive issues such as financial resources,
technology transfer, improving the international economic
environment, etc, follow-up actions can hardly get off the
ground," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic, Bildt Meet for Bosnia Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Serbia's President Slobodan
Milosevic and international High Representative for Bosnia Carl
Bildt held talks here today over Bosnian peace process and the
upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Milosevic and Bildt discussed
the implementation of Dayton accord in Bosnia. Bildt also briefed
Milosevic on his meeting with Bosnian Serb acting president
Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Bildt and Plavsic held a meeting on Tuesday, only two days
after Serb President Radovan Karadzic transferred presidential
power to Plavsic under strong international pressure. But Karadzic
kept the post of president of the ruling Serb Democratic Party and
remained a candidate for the elections in Bosnia, an apparent
violation of the Dayton peace accord which bans any indicted war
criminal from participating in the elections.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer said today in
Brussels that Karadzic's "symbolic withdrawal" from power was not
enough and sanctions would be reimposed to the Serbs unless the
Serb president was totally isolated from political life.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Milosevic and Bildt said the efforts to date
had enabled the process of an all-round normalization of relations
and fulfilment of assumed obligations in Bosnia to unfold in a
positive direction, Tanjug quoted a statement released by the
Serbian presidential office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the full freedom of movement and the
unimpeded campaigning of political forces were indispensable as
part of preparations for the elections in the two entities in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The international community has set September 14 as the date
for elections in Bosnia, a key step in building peace and
reconciliation in the war-torn country.

OTTAWA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy announced today that Canada has recognized the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) under its interim
name and has proposed the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Canada will continue to enhance and strengthen its relations
with Balkan countries," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
"In advancing our bilateral relations with the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, the promotion of human and minority rights
will continue to be a priority," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We can now pursue full-ranging economic, political and other
ties with FYROM", Airel Delouya, spokesperson of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The relations between FYROM and Canada will be covered by the
Canadian embassy in Belgrade, he said.
</P>
<P>
With today's announcement, Canada became the second to the last
among the OECD countries that recognize Macedonia under its
present name. Greece has been opposing FYROM using the name of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"The subject of FYROM's formal name is a matter of negotiation
between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,"
Axworthy noted today.
</P>
<P>
FYROM signed an interim agreement with Greece in September 1995
in New York addressing a number of other bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
FYROM became independent from the former Yugoslavia in November
1991, and joined the United Nations in April, 1993 under the
present name.

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) - The French government has sold six
percent of state-owned shares in the car-maker Renault to 12
institutional investors in biddings that were concluded Monday
evening, Jean Arthuis, minister of economy, said today.
</P>
<P>
This deal, which was pre-announced in May and has brought the
state 2 billion francs (382 million U.S. dollars), has turned

company's shares are now in the hands of private holders.
</P>
<P>
"A third stage of privatization of the enterprise, which will
come up later in accordance with market conditions, will see the
state yield the rest of its shares in the framework of an
operation of investments by individual investors, institutional
investors and salary-earners of the enterprise," said a communique
issued by the ministry of economy.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that the deal has shown the

If current trends hold, the city will experience its lowest
number of murders since 1968 when there were 968 homicides, New
York Times said today.

<HEADLINE> Changes in S. Leone Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- President Tejan Kabbah today
announced major changes in the Sierra Leone army, bringing in
Colonel Hassan Conteh to act as chief of defense staff in place
of Brigadier Joy Toure who was assigned on special duties.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel James Max-Kanga becomes acting chief of army staff
succeeding Colonel Komba Mondeh who is proceeding on a training
program in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
This was made known by Information Minister George
Banda-Thomas at a press briefing here this afternoon. But he
did not give reasons for the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Conteh, 40, undertook training operations and plans at
Defense Headquarters in Freetown. From 1989 to April 1992, he
served as Aide-de-Camp and joined in toppling President Morroh.
He had military training in France in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The new acting chief of army staff, Lt. Colonel Max-Kanga had
been since 1994 National Coordinator and Officer-in-Charge of
Demobilization, Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Banda-Thomas also frowned on what he called
ceasefire violations, saying, "the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) violations have becomed more frequent and serious in the
past weeks. We are concerned over the recent spate of RUF
activities."
</P>
<P>
"The government will find it difficult to continue to tolerate
these atrocities and is determined to act swiftly and decisively
to dismiss those responsible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has been negotiating with the RUF, inviting
the rebels to join in reconstructing the country.

<HEADLINE> English Pupils Perform Poorly in Mathematics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- English 13-year-olds are among the
poorest performers in mathematics in the industrialised world,
according to an authoritative study of standards to be published
later this year, it is reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from the International Mathematics and
Science Study, undertaken last year, place pupils in England 19th
in maths out of 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
The 13,800 English teenagers answered 53 percent of maths
questions correctly, compared with 79 percent in top-of-the-table
Singapore. The average was 55 percent, with Ireland, Belgium,
Switzerland and France all reaching higher standards.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study, the third of its kind, represents a
fall in standards since a similar study in 1990, when English
pupils scored three percent above the world average.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the findings are in line with a series of
gloomy reports suggesting that many children never master basic
numeracy.
</P>
<P>
However, in science, the performance of the English pupils was
an improvement, earning sixth position ahead of all the European
countries apart from the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department for Education and Employment
said Tuesday Ministers were aiming for improvement by a range of
measures including the establishment of 13 numeracy centres around
the country to promote effective maths teaching.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the national curriculum would be
changed to create more time for basic arithmetic.

<HEADLINE> More Carbon Emission to Disrupt Weather Patterns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Increased carbon emission
worldwide may lead to disruptive changes in local weather patterns
during the next decade, according to a study by a leading U.S.
research firm.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the global average temperature set a new record of
15.39 degrees Celsius, breaking the previous mark of 15.38 degrees
in 1990, mainly due to rapid rise in greenhouse gas
concentrations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, carbon emission from the burning of fossil fuels
reached a new high of 6.1 billion tons. says the study available
today.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Worldwatch Institute warns that hotter, drier
climate along with natural disasters could undermine global food
balances in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
A number of industries may also come under heavy pressure in
the process. It cites insurance business as an example. Between
1990 and 1995, the sector paid 57 billion U.S. dollars to
weather-related claims, compared with 17 billion for the entire
preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests that new technologies can help a gradual
shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources. The world
market for solar cells has nearly doubled since 1990 and that for
wind turbines grown sixfold.
</P>
<P>
The study paper notes that "industrial countries have the moral
responsibility, financial resources and technologies to slow
climate change, and should lead the way."
</P>
<P>
The Worldwatch Institute, founded in 1974, is devoted to public
policy research in the field of population, natural resources and
environment.

<HEADLINE> More Canadians Diagnosed with AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of Canadians diagnosed
with AIDS is increasing across Canada and among all risk groups
except blood-product recipients, according to Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
Gays are still most at risk, but infections is rising among
women and intravenous drug users, the federal fact-gathering
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since AIDS made its first appearance in Canada 15 years ago,
about 16,000 Canadians have been diagnosed with the disease and
45,000 are estimated to have been infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of AIDS diagnoses has gone from 1.8 per 100,000
adult population in 1985 to 9 per 100,000 in 1994, the agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Men who have sex with men are still most at risk, but the
proportion of cases attributed to such activity has declined since
1987, when it was 8 out of 10.
</P>
<P>
Heterosexual contact with an infected person accounted for 38
percent of AIDS cases among women and 3 percent among men in 1995.
</P>
<P>
And 15 percent of AIDS cases among women and 3 percent of those
among men were contracted through injection-drug use, and
contaminated needles were blamed for 6 percent of all AIDS cases
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The proportion involving tainted-blood products was 2 percent
in 1994 compared with 6 percent in 1988, thanks to improved
screening of the virus in blood products, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Ready to Consider Renewing Mandate of UNTAES </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council on
Wednesday expressed its readiness to consider favourably an
extension of the mandate of the military observers serving with
the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern
Salvonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
The observers' current mandate expires on 30 July, and
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended an
extension until 15 January 1997, when the current mandate of
UNTAES also concludes.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement read by its president, Alain
Dejammet of France, the council noted with appreciation that the
demilitarization of the region had proceeded smoothly and was
completed on 20 June.
</P>
<P>
It called on both sides -- the Croatian government and the
local Croatian Serb authorities in Eastern Slavonia -- to refrain
from any action that might raise tension and to continue
cooperating closely with UNTAES in maintaining peace and security.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed satisfaction with the work already achieved
by UNTAES to re-establish normal living conditions for all the
inhabitants of the region and welcomed the efforts to begin the
return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed that it was equally important that persons
who fled from their homes in Western Slavonia and elsewhere in
Croatia, particularly the Krajina, be permitted to return to their
homes of origin.
