<HEADLINE> Turkey Sends 30 More Policemen to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey sent a second unit of 30
police officers to Bosnia-Herzegovina today to strengthen the
International Police Force of the United Nations stationed in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish unit will join the multinational 1,720-man police
force to help re-establish law and order in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a group of 51 Turkish police officers were
dispatched to help repatriate refugees from a camp in the Velika
Kladusa region of Croatia to their homes in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The dispatching of a unit of Turkish police officers to Bosnia
marked the first time that Turkish police had been given duties
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The officers are paid between 2,000 U.S. dollars and 2,500
dollars a month, and most of the Turkish police officers in the
joint police force can speak a foreign language.

<HEADLINE> East African Standard Meeting Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting of directors
of bureaux of standard of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda opened here
today with a call to them to ensure that their organizations are
vigilant against the dumping of sub-standard, under-priced or
harmful commodities in East African markets.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, the Ugandan Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Trade and Industry Francis Kasirye observed that an
efficient standards body is not only a guarantee for the smooth
flow of international, regional or domestic trade by generating
confidence between the buyer and seller but also plays an
important role in industrial development.
</P>
<P>
He said the creation of such an efficient body calls for the
building of the necessary expertise and capacity particularly in
this era of liberalized global trade.
</P>
<P>
Kasirye told the participants that the government of Uganda is
committed to strengthening the Ugandan National Bureau of
Standard for efficiency though it is hampered by the high costs
involved.
</P>
<P>
He said it is for this reason that the renewed spirit of East
African Cooperation is welcome as it will facilitate
consultations and the sharing of expertise and testing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Uganda National Standards Council, Edward
Katiti, challenged the participants to come out with one
standards action body to embrace the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a result of the directive of the permanent
tripartite commission for the East African Cooperation which was
set up early last year in Nairobi. It is aimed at removing
technical barriers to trade in the East African region by
harmonizing and synchronizing standards of commodities sold in
all the markets in the region.

<HEADLINE> Iran Regrets UAE Official Remark on Nuclear Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed regret over
the remarks made by a high-ranking UAE official on Iran's nuclear
power plant.
</P>
<P>
UAE First Deputy Foreign Minister Bin Saed recently said that
the Iranian efforts in getting nuclear weapons and building
nuclear power plants have concerned not only his country but also
other countries in the region and around the world.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of Iranian Foreign Ministry,
termed as "irrelevant" the concern of the UAE official over Iran's
access to atomic power plants.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UAE had better express its concern over the
destructive potential of the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
"This is regretful that the UAE official does not feel the
atomic danger of the Israeli regime but expresses concern over the
possibility of access to nuclear power by Iran in the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Such expressions are influenced by a joint propaganda campaign
of the United States and the Israelis against the Islamic Republic
of Iran, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran is against any investment in nuclear
weapons, stressing that Iran is the first country which proposed
to declare the Middle East free from mass destruction weapons at
international forums and spares no efforts for the realization of
the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Lebanese Summit to be Held in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian-Lebanese summit will be
held in Damascus within a few days to come, diplomatic sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting between Syrian president Hafez al-Assad and
his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi will focus on regional
developments and the Israeli military escalation in south Lebanon,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss a meeting of the follow-up committee of
the recently-held international anti-terrorism summit in the
Egyptian resort town of Sharm el Sheikh. The follow-up committee
meeting is due to take place in Washington Thursday, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss the coordination of the two
countries' stances, future moves and a joint plan of action to
deal with upcoming developments, under the circumstances that both
Syria and Lebanon are seeking to revive the peace process in
conformity with the Madrid formula.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit will also examine ways and means of
bolstering and further consolidating bilateral relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese summit is of special importance as it takes
place at a time of explosive tension in south Lebanon, as the peace
process on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks are
facing a stalemate, despite a pressure being exerted on both
countries to control the resistance against Israeli occupation
forces.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon boycotted the Sharm el Sheikh follow-up
committee meeting.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Becoming Stable: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's economy is
now leveling off, Director General of the South African Chamber
of Business (SACOB) Raymond Parsons said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual general meeting of the Zululand Chamber
of Commerce in Empangeni, Kwazulu/Natal province, Parsons said
the economic upturn is now entering its fourth year, and that
there is evidence emerging in the manufacturing sector that the
business cycle has peaked.
</P>
<P>
"While agriculture and mining will make a more positive
contribution to overall economic growth this year, the rate of
expansion in the manufacturing sector has slowed down," Parsons
said.
</P>
<P>
This would give the South African economy an expected growth
rate of 3.5 percent to four percent in 1996, which would be the
best economic performance in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Last year the South African economy enjoyed an annual growth
rate of 3.3 percent with the recorded low inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, Parsons said the latest economic data, including
SACOB's survey of the manufacturing sector, strongly suggests a
slowing down in the rate of overall economic expansion this year.
</P>
<P>
Much would also depend on trends in the world economy over the
next 12 months, he added.
</P>
<P>
With a satisfactory economic performance enjoyed last year,
the South African government, business and industrial sectors are
hopefully looking forward to a even better one this year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the South
African economy would achieve an annual growth rate of six
percent by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers of Egyptian Plane Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The hijackers who seized an
Egyptian passenger plane today have surrendered to the Libyan
authorities, said Egyptian official sources.
</P>
<P>
The three hijackers left the plane followed by passengers. The
Cairo Airport Tower said the hijackers only spoke Arabic when
being contacted by the tower.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said earlier that the
hijackers, who spoke Arabic, said in a message sent through the
pilot of the hijacked plane that they wanted to present a message
from God to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, President Hosni Mubarak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, demanding the lifting of the
siege on the Palestinians and a solution to the issue of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The plane of EgyptAir, with 145 passengers and seven crew
members on board, landed in the Libyan Mediterranean city of
Tobruk near the Libyan-Egyptian border at 6:05 p.m. local time
(1605 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The hijackers told Tobruk airport tower that they wanted to
negotiate with Gaddafi directly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri formed a
ministerial working group over the hijacking of an Egyptian
passenger plane today.
</P>
<P>
The working group will closely follow up the developments of
the incident and report them to Mubarak, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A-320, carrying 126 foreigners and 19 Egyptians, was
en route from the Saudi city of Jeddah to Cairo via Luxor. It was
hijacked immediately after taking off in Luxor, Egypt's southern
resort city famous for temples and tombs left over from the
Pharaonic era.
</P>
<P>
The sources at the Cairo international airport were quoted by
MENA as saying earlier that one man entered the cockpit 15 minutes
after takeoff and forced the pilot to head for Libya.
</P>
<P>
The nationalities of the hijackers have been unknown so far.

<HEADLINE> 100 State-Owned Companies In Zambia To Be privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 100 state-owned companies
in Zambia are earmarked for privatization this year while over
120 other companies have already been sold in the past four years
under the on-going privatization program, a Zambian senior
official disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Siamukayumbu
Syamujaye made the revelation here while meeting a Nigerian
delegation which arrived in Zambia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye said the privatization of the companies is open to
both Zambian and foreign inventers.
</P>
<P>
He urged Nigerian businessmen to come and invest in Zambia
by taking advantage of Zambia's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the businessmen intending to invest in Zambia
that the country's economic reform is on course and therefore the
foreign investors should take an active interest in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, header of the Nigerian delegation
Brigadier General Remi Suara said his country is also privatizing
most of its parastatal companies.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslim-Croat Police Arrest Serb Interpreter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokesman Alexander Ivanko
said today the police of the Muslim-Croat federation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina have arrested a Serb who worked for the U.N.
police as an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency said the Serb interpreter was arrested
10 days ago at the entrance into Serb sector Grbavica in Sarajevo
on the eve of the transfer of power of the Serb sector to the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Grbavica was the last of the five Serb sectors that were turned
over to the Muslim-Croat control by March 19 in line with the
Dayton agreement. For fear of reprisals from the Muslims after the
transfer, more than 90 percent of the Serbs living in these
affected areas have fled their homes and moved to other Serb
territories.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said no precise details about the arrest were available
for the time being and the U.N. learned about the arrest only on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the police of the Muslim-Croat federation refused
to cooperate with the U.N. or to explain the motives for the
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nigerians Thirsty for Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The large crowds of voters
thronging the local government election on non-party basis
through three rounds of voting nationwide between March 16 and
25, indicated the yearning of Nigerians for democracy.
</P>
<P>
The polls at the grassroots recorded a milestone on March 16
with a massive turn-out all over the country. The voters who
turned up to cast their ballots for the ward delegates were so
overwhelming in most centers that electoral officers ran out of
supplies within a short time due to inadequate preparation.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria
(NECON), about 20 to 24 million people have voted nationwide,
accounting for almost 60 percent of the Nigerians of voting age.
</P>
<P>
This figure has stunned the government and NECON, as well as
foreign observers and dissident groups.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent two rounds, the election of councillors and
local government delegates, and chairmanship election, went on in
good order and in a peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The active and enthusiastic participation in the local council
elections, political analysts viewed, demonstrated Nigerians'
deep yearning for democracy and the right to choose those who
will run their affairs.
</P>
<P>
The local government council election on non-party basis, the
first of a series of elections under the three-year transition-
to-civil-rule program announced by General Sani Abacha's military
government last October, will be followed by the creation of new
states and local governments, the registration of political
parties, and the local government elections on party basis later
this year.
</P>
<P>
The non-party local councils election also served as an
opportunity to test how calm the country's political waters are.
</P>
<P>
Some Nigerian dissident groups had called for boycott of the
polls. They dismissed government's three-year transition program
including the non-party council polls as "unnecessary and
wasteful."
</P>
<P>
However, the government insisted that the poll was a necessary
prelude to its phased democratization program.
</P>
<P>
Commending the Nigerians for their conduct toward the local
council polls, leader of a U.S. observer team to Niger state Jim
Martin said voters had waited patiently for hours under the
scorching sun to participate in the election, noting that this
showed the Nigerians were eager for democracy.
</P>
<P>
On the massive turn-out of voters for the council polls, Roy
Innis, a visiting U.S. civil rights leader, said that it was
indicative of the confidence Nigerians have in the transition
program of the government.
</P>
<P>
The president of the U.S. National Newspaper Publishers
Association, Ms. Torothy R. Leavell, who is leading a
fact-finding team in Nigeria, pointed out that there was relative
peace in the country contrary to various media reports of
political instability.
</P>
<P>
However, on the other side of the story, quite a number of
councillorship and chairmanship aspirants have complained loudly
about being disqualified from contesting the council elections
because "their political views were different" from the
government's.
</P>
<P>
The official explanation was that common reasons adduced for
the disqualification of the aspirants were non-payment of taxes
as at their due, certificate forgery, alteration of documents and
adverse security reports.

<HEADLINE> Ireland May Seek Military Role in NATO, WEU:  White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland has made
it clear that it may change the long-standing policy of military
neutrality and seek a role in NATO and the West European Union
(WEU).
</P>
<P>
A foreign policy white paper, released in Dublin Tuesday, said
that the government believes Ireland must be a "constructive
participant" in any debate within the forthcoming European
Union's inter-governmental conference on a common defense policy,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"When the time came, Ireland would be willing to enter into
negotiations on a common defense policy," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the white paper, Dick Spring, the Irish foreign
minister, gave the broadest of hints that his country would seek
to join NATO's partnership for peace program, a policy devised to
bring the eastern and central European countries into the western
European security umbrella.
</P>
<P>
He indicated for the first time that Ireland intended to
discuss with the WEU the possibility of taking part in
humanitarian and rescue tasks as well as peacekeeping missions, on
a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Irish government would consider, along
with other EU neutrals, a new institutional arrangement with the
WEU without entering into mutual defense pacts.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he made it clear that Ireland was not
contemplating full membership of either NATO or the WEU, nor was
it proposing to assume the mutual defense obligations of the two
blocs.
</P>
<P>
Spring and John Bruton, the Irish prime minister, will leave
for Turin Thursday for Friday's launch of the inter-governmental
conference on the future of the EU.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Launches Presidential Campaign Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni launched his presidential campaign manifesto here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 supporters of Museveni, including cabinet members,
representatives of all districts across the country and
diplomatic envoys took part in the launching cerenony.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his manifesto, museveni announced his three guiding
principles for the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The first principle is to set up as many factories and
enterprises as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
Through industrialisation, Ugandans can get more employment
opportunities, because employment is a big and serious problem in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second principle is to set up as many service industries
as possible, he said, since the service industries create
employment.
</P>
<P>
The third principle is to modernize the country's agriculture,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To realize the above three principles, work must be well done
in the fields of infrastructure, education and market building,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said infrastructure means constructing more roads and
putting up more telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
On education, he said, if he is elected, he will use more
revenue to develop education.
</P>
<P>
On market building, he said if he is elected, he will make
efforts to get in touch with leaders of Kenya and Tanzania to
form an east african federation so that the people of the three
countries will have a market with 70 million people.
</P>
<P>
On combating corruption, he noted that he will coniune to
carry out the privatization policy on state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said this is an effective measure to fight against
corruption. Except the anti-corruption committee he set up last
year, he will appoint one person in his office to read newspaper
reports on corruption for him so that he can take measures to
fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
On the election process, he said for the Ugandans he will
commit himself to make free and fair the elections scheduled for
next May.
</P>
<P>
He said he opposes activities to buy votes and destructive
enthusiasm that is hooliganism. enditem

<HEADLINE> Suspected Terrorists Against Mubarak Charged In Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Prosecutor
General of Ethiopia has filed charges against the three alleged
terrorists who attempted to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Addis Ababa on June 26, 1995, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said that after thoroughly investigating police
reports, the office of the Prosecutor General has referred the
cases of the three alleged Egyptian terrorists under arrest in
Ethiopia to the Federal High Court in accordance with the
criminal code of the country.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine terrorists who tried to assassinate President
Mubarak in Addis Ababa on June 26, 1995, five were killed by the
Ethiopian security force, three were arrested while one managed
to escape to the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The report recalled that the Sudanese government has given
shelter to Mustefa Hameza who managed to escape to that country
on exactly the same day on board a Sudan Airways plane. Mustefa
was at the forefront of the whole process of the assassination
attempt.
</P>
<P>
According to previous announcement made by the Ethiopian
government, another group of two terrorists who controlled the
assassination operation from outside Ethiopia is hiding in the
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The report said, Ethiopia has asked the Sudan to extradite the
three terrorists in line with the extradition agreement signed
between the two countries in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Attaches Condition to Permanent Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud
Barak hinted today that the permanent status talks with the PLO,
due to begin May, might be delayed unless the Palestinian
Authority (PA) cracks down harder on Islamic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Barak, the former army chief of the general staff and known for
his hawkish views in the Labor Party, made the statement when he
was addressing the on-going international media conference in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Barak said, Israel also cannot consider pulling out
of Hebron. Under the Oslo 2 agreement, Israeli redeployment out of
most parts of the West Bank city will take place on March 28.
</P>
<P>
The peace process with the Palestinians has virtually been
bogged down since four terrorist suicide bombings which occurred
successively since late February.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to stop work on the Hebron-Jerusalem
bypass is meant to emphasize Israel's resolve not to evacuate
Hebron on time unless the Palestinians change their covenant
calling for the destruction of Israel, and bring to trial Mohammed
Dief, leader of the armed wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), Iz a-Din al-Qassam.
</P>
<P>
The Labor-led coalition can hardly afford to see more
terrorist suicide bombing attacks in the Israeli street before
the general elections scheduled to begin on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Sunday that the Labor
Party will resume peace talks with the Palestinians, Syrians and
Lebanese after the elections if it wins.

<HEADLINE> UK Economy Grows 2.5 Pct, Current Account Gap Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The British economy grew by 2.5
percent in 1995, slightly less than 2.6 percent previously
estimated, while the current account deficit widened by far more
than expected.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Central Statistical Office
Tuesday, growth in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter
was left unchanged at 0.5 percent, but service sector output,
investment and consumer spending were all revised down.
</P>
<P>
Most notable of these was that investment, far from rising 1.2
percent, actually fell 0.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's figures also contained downward revisions to consumer
spending last year. Taking the fourth quarter 1995 against a year
earlier, the latest estimate shows spending up 2.2 percent against
2.5 percent previously reported.
</P>
<P>
But downward revisions in consumer spending, investment and
service sector output were partially offset by an upward revision
in exports.
</P>
<P>
Separate figures showed that the current account deficit
widened sharply to 6.7 billion pounds (10.2 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1995, more than three times the 2.1 billion pounds (3.2 billion
dollars) recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth quarter, the current account gap was 1.8
billion pounds (2.7 billion dollars) compared with City
expectations of a deficit of 1 billion pounds (1.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy was largely due to the fact that Britain's
annual contribution to the European Union (EU) soared to a record
4.1 billion pounds (6.2 billion dollars), almost double the
previous year's figure, which stood at 2.1 billion pounds (3.2
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, transfers to EU institutions rose to a
record of 2.5 billion pounds (3.8 billion dollars) from 1.8
billion pounds (2.7 billion dollars) in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Ban on British Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today decided to ban the export of all live cattle, beef and beef
products from the United Kingdom to other European Union (EU)
countries and to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
EC Commissioner of Agriculture and Rural Development Franz
Fischler made the announcement at a press conference here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said this decision was taken following consultations with
the EU Scientific Committee and the Standing Veterinary Committee.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the ban is of "a provisional nature," Fischler
said the export ban covers live cattle, their semen and embryos,
beef and beef products which are liable to enter the animal feed
or human food chain, and materials destined for use in medicinal
products, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, as well as
mammalian derived meat and bone-meal.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC has asked member states to amend the measures
they apply so that they conform to this decision.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom is demanded to send the EC every two weeks a
report on the application of the protective measures taken against
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
Fischler laid particular stress on the fact that the only
product about which a doubt exists is UK beef and "in no way is
there any scientific doubt about milk products or other meat
products."
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner, the EC will reconvene the
Veterinary Committee "at the latest in six weeks time" to review
all elements including whether the ban should be continued,
modified or lifted.
</P>
<P>
"Future activities on this issue will also include
comprehensive and thorough inspection by the EC of the control
measures applied in the UK," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the EC is prepared to consider "any means of
assisting the UK in either a technical and/or financial way on the
basis of a UK proposal" aimed at safeguarding British farmers'
incomes and further control measures against BSE.
</P>
<P>
Fischler also announced that a special group of BSE scientific
experts is to be established immediately which will focus on the
question of transmissibility of BSE to humans BSE, control aspects,
examination of existing research results and the establishment of
research priorities.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Faster Drug Production to Treat Sleeping  Sickness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said here today that it has made an urgent appeal to a
French drug company to step up production of melarsoprol, the only
drug on the market that can treat patients in the advanced stage
of African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima to
the Lyon-based Rhone-Poulenc, the only company that makes
melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of the drug are currently exhausted due to increased
demand and technical problems in the production process, which
resulted in an unprecedented shortage of the drug. In the absence
of alternative treatment, hundreds of patients are desperately
waiting for melarsoprol to become available again, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the appeal, Rhone-Poulenc had assured that
melarsoprol deliveries will resume in early April and that any
outstanding orders will be met by the end of May. The company had
also declared itself ready to establish a security stock of
melarsoprol in collaboration with the WHO.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, sleeping sickness, when untreated, is
almost always fatal. It is one of the most difficult tropical
diseases to diagnose, and affects almost 300,000 people in 36
countries of sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 55 million people in
the world are at the risk of infection.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Increase Rapidly In Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government has been
urged to pay more attention to the spread of tuberculosis
disease.
</P>
<P>
The National Leprosy/Tuberculosis Program Chairman, Dr Daniel
Kibuga said tuberculosis cases have increased to 28,800 in
Kenya this year from 11,000 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Kibuga said this alarming trend might continue
unless more attention is given to the control of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kibuga was speaking on Tuesday during a special public
lecture on tuberculosis in Nairobi, which was organised as part
of the activities to mark the first World Tuberculosis Day which
falls day.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that despite the availability of effective drugs
to cure the disease, its toll in the recent past has confounded
optimists in the medical field who in the past had thought the
disease had been conquered.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Kenyan Government had embarked on the
implementation of the tuberculosis control programs to fight the
spread of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Greece Rejects US Allegations on Airport  Safety Issue (by Chen Dechang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece has repeatedly rejected
American allegations that the security conditions at the Athens
International Airport were "among the three worst in the world,"
insisting the reality is just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the American allegations, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said "the security conditions at the airport are
good."
</P>
<P>
In a report published last Thursday, the U.S. Transportation
Department singled out the airports of Athens, Lagos (Nigeria) and
Bogota (Colombia) as not being up to par with international
security standards.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Transportation Department later ordered all air
tickets from the U.S. to Greece must bear a sticker cautioning
travelers that the Athens airport "does not maintain and carry
out effective airport security measures."
</P>
<P>
Greek Development Minister Vasso Papandreou met with U.S.
Ambassador to Athens Thomas Niles today to express Greece's
displeasure over the warning "which does not reflect reality."
</P>
<P>
Papandreou reiterated that security at the Athens airport was
quite adequate, underling that major airline companies such as
Lufthansa and Swissair had stopped using private security firms
because of satisfaction with the services provided by the Greek
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Greek hoteliers and transport officials are furious at the U.S.
move, fearing the Greek tourism industry would be adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
The Greek concern has been raised by estimates that an
increased number of Americans were planning to vacation in Greece
this year, bringing the number of visitors to above last year's
figure of over 300,000. A U.S. travel advisory in 1985 produced
devastating results: the number of visits that year dropped to
just 100,000 from 600,000 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis reportedly intervened to
stop the U.S. from issuing a travel advisory but Greek tour
operators say that even with the less formal warning stickers,
years of effort to regain trust in the U.S. market could be
wasted.
</P>
<P>
Other senior officials, including the country's Transport
Minister Haris Kastanidis, have also lashed out at the American
action. Speaking to the press earlier, Kastanidis said Washington
was using the warning as a means of political pressure on Athens,
and warned that Athens considered the issue of warning stickers
"a hostile act against our country."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans should first take a look at their own statistics
of the terrorist actions taking place at their airports and then
concern themselves with the Athens airport, which is among the
safest in the world," Michalis Perros, head of Greece's Civil
Aviation Union was quoted as saying by local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a group of U.S. travel experts are due to
come to Athens to inspect the airport but the Greek Transport
Ministry was considering whether they would permit the visit.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Reppas said Prime Minister Simitis had
requested the lifting of the U.S. warning during a meeting with
Ambassador Niles today and Niles promised that every effort would
be made to "resolve the issue within 30 days."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Parliament Speaker Calls For Selling Govt Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's parliament speaker
Cyril Ndebele today called for selling some government assets
which he said would be used to repay the foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
"This is a political question which needs to be addressed. And
whatever the government decides, I believe a balance should be
struck between what is economically wise and what is politically
correct," he told a seminar on privatisation here today.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele said selling state assets to the highest bidder will
also marginalise participation of the majority indigenous
population in the mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
The speaker added that the funds could be channelled into a
trust fund, and eventually offloaded to the indigenous people to
enable them to buy a stake in national economy.
</P>
<P>
The government, which launched wide-based market reforms in
1990, intends to privatise public enterprises to reduce its
involvement in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Fights Uphill War Against Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe police is fighting
an uphill war against new crime trends in armed robberies and
corruption, Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing over 40 military and police
officers from Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe
who are attending a training course at the Zimbabwe Staff
College.
</P>
<P>
He said the cases of armed robberies are increasing in the
country, particularly on the eastern border with Mozambique, as a
lot of arms had been smuggled into the country from that country.
</P>
<P>
"The latest incidents of armed robberies show different
characteristics from ones we used to know. These days robbers
shoot first and then take the goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
And a rising number of white-collar workers are conducting
corruptive practices in the financial sector including
over-invoicing, smuggling finished goods without going through
proper Customs channels as well as other fraudulent activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the home minister stressed that the police officers
are operating under immense pressure due to lack of financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
Reports showed that in the country, there is one policeman out
of every 800 people. And in some areas, the ratio is one to
1,500.
</P>
<P>
The acceptable world standard was one policeman for every 500
people.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Comgress of Trade Unions
(ZCTU) President Fackson Shamenda revealed today formal
employement in Zambia had declined by an average of two percent
per annum since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Shamenda said the country was losing about 8,000 jobs every
year as effects of the on-going structural adjustment program
while poverty had grown to unmanageable propotions.
</P>
<P>
Shamenda made the revelation in his opening address at the
ZCTU Council meeting in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Though it was true that some of those economic reforms had had
a positive empact on certain macro-economic parameters, their
negative impact far outweighed the positive ones, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the loss of jobs in the country had threatened the
existence of the ZCTU.
</P>
<P>
However, he welcomed the government's suspension of the
public sector reform program this year, adding that it had come
as a great relief to the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Finance Minister Ronald Penza announced the
government had postponed the public service reform program until
next year due to financial straits. enditem

<P>
Reports from Portage, Indiana, said two more workers were
reportedly missing after the early morning explosion blown out a
corner of the Beta Steel mill.
</P>
<P>
The blast, sending a huge mushroom-type cloud into the sky,
also brought down part of the roof of a Beta office complex about
50 feet away.
</P>
<P>
Officials said several employees were inside the steel mill at
the time of the blast about 7 a.m. local time. They said normally
about 15 people worked in the area where the explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
Bill Fritchley, a senior official with the Indiana Port
Commission, said emergency personnel were "still unable to get
close enough to the situation to determine either the cause or
whether the missing individuals are deceased."
</P>
<P>
So far at least one was confirmed dead and four injured,
including two treated for broken bones at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Beta Steel, a five-year-old mill located in a port on Lake
Michigan, is about 30 miles southeast of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Pro-League Example for Asian Football:  Blatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The professional football
league blooming in Japan should be a good example for other Asian
countries and regions, a senior International Football Federation
(FIFA) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that football in this (Asian) region develop
very well, with the J. League in Japan and semi-professional
league now in China, and we have more in such countries as
Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia," said Joseph
Blatter, secretary-general of the sport's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
Blatter had earlier attended the general congress of the
Oceanian Football Confederation in Auckland, New Zealand. He
stayed in Hong Kong for a four-day break before flying back to
Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"It (J. League) is an example all around the world," he said.
"It was promoted as a product, with marketing survey, public
appeal, marketing partners, commercial partners, television and
spectacle," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA secretary-general is obviously impressed by the
Chinese pro-league. "I think they are doing it very well. There is
a lot of publicity and promotion.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that it will be a success in China. And it will do a
lot of good for China's national teams if their national football
is better organized in this way," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
But the FIFA official thinks the other way as to the current
situation in Hong Kong's football. Hong Kong has claimed it had
started a pro league as early as the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"We are just waiting for Hong Kong. But for the time being, I
haven't seen any professional league here," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's league "is not the same league in other Asian
countries and regions as I have mentioned," he said. "Because at
professional level, football is a product and you have to promote
it in a marketing way, not just play the game.
</P>
<P>
"It's a product and you have to get a target. It needs
marketing partners, television and, of course, good players," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They should copy the example of Japan, the J League," he
concluded.

JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela was conferred today an honorary fellowship of the
Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town after accepting the

<HEADLINE> Fastest Economic Growth Forecast In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Ltd said
today the country will this year experience its fastest economic
growth in 15 years, helped by the revival of the key agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the second largest bank of Zimbabwe said the
outlook has not looked better in at least three decades, and an
average growth rate of six percent was now a possibility over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
''Given an absence of drought in the 1996/97 growing season,
GDP growth of five percent is projected for calendar year 1997.
This would give an average growth rate of more than six percent
over the next two years, a very satisfactory performance by any
standard,'' the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, whose economy is heavily dependent on the
agricultural sector, this season experienced its heaviest rains
in more than a decade, with some areas recording the highest
falls in over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, output in the agricultural sector was expected to
rise by over 18 percent and its economic growth, which declined
by three percent in 1995, was expected to improve by six percent,
according to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwse figures released on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
''However, the relatively heavy debt burden and concerns that
high levels of climatic variability may persist could limit the
economy's medium to long term growth potential to the four to six
percent average,'' the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Orders for Durable Goods Down in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Orders for durable goods to
U.S. factories plunged 2.5 percent in February, the biggest
decline in 10 months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said orders for durable goods
totaled a seasonally adjusted 165 billion dollars, down from a
sharply revised 169.2 billion in January. It was the fourth
decline in the last five months and the largest since orders fell
4.6 percent last April.
</P>
<P>
Durable goods are products such as appliances and automobiles
expected to last more than three years. They are considered a key
gauge of the nation's manufacturing sector, since an increase
could lead to greater production and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that orders in January were much weaker
than previously thought when it revised an increase of 0.2 percent
announced earlier to a fall of 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A survey of U.S. purchasing executives in early February had
suggested that manufacturing weakened in February. But the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its sampling
indicated the seven-month decline had slowed.
</P>
<P>
The February's fall of orders was led by a decline of 11.6
percent in transportation orders, the biggest drop since an 11.8
percent decline last October. A huge fall in aircraft orders more
than offset a small increase in automobile orders.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve, in belief that the economy including
the labor market has been strengthened recently, left the
short-term interest rates unchanged when its policy-making panel
ended its meeting Tuesday without any announcement.

<HEADLINE> Greece Opposed to Two-Speed Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece is opposed to any form of
revision of the Maastricht Treaty which will lead to a two-speed
Europe, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister George Romeos said today.
</P>
<P>
In statements on the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) which
formally begins Friday in Turin with the meeting of European Union
leaders, Romeos said procedures for discussion must be established
concerning "when, how and with what procedures member states not
participating in the third phase will participate, so that we do
not create a two-speed Europe."
</P>
<P>
He said the EU must be based on democratic principles,
transparency and citizen participation and "this means that the
role of the European Parliament must be strengthened while national
assemblies must participate in the decisions and initiatives of
the EU."
</P>
<P>
Romeos expressed regret that the European Parliament would not
be participating in the IGC even as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the common foreign police and
security policy for Greece, Romeos said "we shall be seeking the
enactment of a clause on mutual assistance and the recognition of
borders."
</P>
<P>
"When you have economic borders, they are also territorial and
geographical," Romeos said, adding that "the union is a single
European area without internal economic borders."
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of measures to combat
unemployment in the EU.
</P>
<P>
"If the IGC ends without answers having been given to the major
problem of unemployment, we will have achieved a revision which
will not create greater cohesion in the eyes of the public and an
institutional structure which does not meet the expectations of
European citizens," Romeos said.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Pulls Forces Out Of Lower Shabelle Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leaders Osman
Hassan Ali Atto withdrew all his forces from Dhanane and
Jilib-Merca in the Lower kshabelle Region to the capital this
morning, without any clashes with the soldiers of his rival Gen.
Mohamed farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Armed with more than 28 technical war wagons, Atto's
militiamen have now occupied the strategic positions in and near
South Mogadish, such as the former US Embassy compound, the
University compound, the Sward base and the K-7 junction.
</P>
<P>
At K-7 Junction, Atto's men have erected a check point without
disturbing the civilian traffic.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that General Aidid's men would not
hesitate to attack the check point since K-7 junction is the only
entrance to Mogadishu from southern Somalia. General Aidid forces
are currently stationed in Baidoa, Huddur, Merca and its
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the withdrawal is not yet known, but supporters
of Osman Atto have said the move is a military tactic.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a large number of the militiamen of General
Aidid have also moved into the capital of Mogadishu from Lower
Shabelle. The reason is also unknown, but supporters of Aidid
said his control of South Mogadishu is now a problem to be dealt
with.
</P>
<P>
Even though no militia movement have been made yet by any of
the rival militiamen, there is still a growing fear that there
will soon be bloody clashes between the followers of Atto and
Aidid in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the militiamen of Atto withdrew safely
from their bases in Lower Shabelle Region since the armed clashes
between his militiamen and those of General Aidid began there
last week. enditem

Around 20 new drugs developed by the company are in clinical

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia will end its large-scale
combat operations in the breakaway Chechnya before March 31,
commander of the Russian troops stationed in Chechnya General
Vyacheslav Tikhomirov said today.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, the general
said that the move is designed to create a basis for peace process
because President Boris Yeltsin is expected to announce a
political solution to the Chechen crisis on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, the Russian troops have intensified their
operations to "wipe out" the armed Chechen rebels loyal to their
separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in mountainous regions of the
rebellion republic.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow-backed Chechen Government expects the tension to
ease considerably across the republic in the next three days ahead
of Yeltsin's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Yeltsin has announced that he will tell the
nation in a TV address on March 31 his plan on political solution
to the 15-month Chechen crisis.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Asked to Form Caretaker  Government Within 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 30 secretaries of various
Bangladeshi ministries today asked President Abdur Rahman Biswas
to form a caretaker government within 24 hours for holding next
general elections, reliable sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The secretaries, government officials of high rank just below
the cabinet ministers, gave the ultimatum when they met with the
head of state and said that if the demand is not met by then they
would resign from their posts, an diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, a large number of government officials,
including some secretaries, held a joint rally, raising the
similar demand and threatening to stage a sit-in in front of the
VIP (very important persons) gate of the secretariat, the central
administrative center of various ministries.
</P>
<P>
The rally was coincided with the opposition demand for
immediate resignation of the present "illegal" government and
holding of fresh general elections under a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the ruling party-elected parliament already
passed a constitutional amendment bill, paving the way for the
formation of non-party caretaker government for future general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the situation is getting complicated
as the opposition has not recognized the present parliament and
the cabinet although the opposition-demanded caretaker government
bill was passed.
</P>
<P>
But since the high-ranking officials have exerted big pressure,
the present government elected in the February 15 6th
parliamentary polls may resign very soon, the observers said,
adding that it was learnt that Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia
would meet the president tonight and something important may
probably happen.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Visit to Ukraine Likely to Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The state visit by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to Ukraine, scheduled for April 4-5, may
be postponed again due to the row between Moscow and Kiev over the
Black Sea Fleet division, a Kremlin source said today.
</P>
<P>
The visit, during which a friendship and cooperation treaty
between the two large former Soviet republics is to be signed, has
been put off several times due to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
In Kiev, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Dmitry Markov did not
rule out such a possibility, noting that the possible postponement
was discussed at a Tuesday meeting in Moscow between Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his Ukrainian counterpart Yevgeny
Marchuk.
</P>
<P>
There still remain some problems with the division of the
fleet, even after the long-time talks between the two premiers.
</P>
<P>
However, the two agreed to continue talks on the basis of three
existing agreements concerning the split, the Interfax news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the Russian and
Ukrainian defense ministers are expected to finally settle the
dispute and divide the fleet later this week in the Ukrainian
resort of Tysovets.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Minister Cheng Siwei on Chemicals Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China today unveiled its
blueprint for the country's chemical industry until the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The formula for the industry includes building new major
chemical plants, undertaking crucial projects, and attracting more
overseas chemical giants to have a stake in the industry's future.
</P>
<P>
The development plan for China's chemical industry in the Ninth
State Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) and the years up to 2010
may be summarized as three focal points, six points of strategy
and seven projects, said Cheng Siwei, vice-minister of chemical
industry.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, vice-minister Cheng said
that the first focal point is the development of chemicals for
agricultural use. These include fertilizers, pesticides, plastic
films, feed additives and food additives.
</P>
<P>
The second focal point is the development of petrochemicals,
such as ethylene and aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene,
toluene, and their derivative products, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The third focal point is the development of fine chemicals, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that the chemical industry will be
developed according to the following six-point strategy:
</P>
<P>
-- to restructure the chemical industry, particularly the
petrochemical industry;
</P>
<P>
-- to readjust the regional distribution of the chemical
industry by building, or expanding, 18 large chemical industrial
bases, and 15 fine chemical industrial bases, such as the chemical
fiber base in Yizheng, the biochemical and dye base in Suzhou, and
the large chemical bases in Jilin and Dalian;
</P>
<P>
-- to open wider to the outside world, striving to bring the
total amount of overseas capital actually used to 10 billion US
dollars, with the export value increasing to 10 billion US
dollars, and the number of export-oriented enterprises up to 100.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has approved 5,000 foreign-funded chemical
industrial enterprises. It has also signed contracts with the 13
biggest foreign chemical companies for long-term cooperation. More
and more large chemical firms are investing in China.
</P>
<P>
-- to strengthen research and development, and education;
</P>
<P>
-- to train more chemical industrial entrepreneurs and academic
leaders;
</P>
<P>
-- to develop new technology that will make the use of
resources more efficiently, while protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that China will undertake seven major
chemical projects. They will be chemical fertilizers, pesticides,
fine chemicals, petrochemicals, ion film caustic soda, radial-ply
tire and chemical industrial equipment.
</P>
<P>
The chemical fertilizers project is aimed at increasing the
national annual output of pure chemical fertilizers to 28 or 29
million tons, from the present 24.5 million tons. To reach the
goal, a batch of old enterprises of chemical fertilizers will be
upgraded, while some new plants will be built in Hainan and
Xinjiang, to make use of the locally available rich deposits of
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The pesticides project is aimed at developing highly-efficient,
low-toxic pesticides, which protect the environment. For this
goal, southern research bases will be built in Shanghai, Zhejiang,
Jiangsu and Hunan with the help of the State Science and
Technology Commission, while northern research bases will be built
in Shenyang and Tianjin, with the help of the State Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The project for fine chemicals is aimed at increasing the
national annual output of ethylene to 4.2 million tons by 2000,
from the present 2.43 million tons, to provide more raw materials
for production of synthetic fibers, as the country's production
output of cotton will not increase by a big margin during the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The project for ion film caustic soda is aimed at bringing the
proportion of ion film caustic soda in the total caustic soda
output, up to 25 percent by 2000, as against the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The project for radial-ply tire production is aimed at boosting
radial-ply tire manufacturing to 35 percent of the total tire
output in the country, as compared with 11 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The project for chemical industrial equipment is aimed at
raising the output of the equipment, and adopting advanced
technology, such as distribution control systems and computer
integrated manufactured systems.
</P>
<P>
In science and technology, vice-minister Cheng said, emphasis
will be put on popularizing 30 items of mature technology,
building demonstration plants with eight items of domestic
technology, tackling ten technical problems, including coal
chemical industrial technology, and strengthening research on nine
items of key technology, which include new catalytic technology,
new separating technology, new biotechnology, computer technology
for chemical industrial use, precision processing technology, new
energy-efficient technology, and new environment-protecting
technology.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Lower House Passes Stopgap Budget After Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese House of
Representatives today passed a 50-day stopgap budget after a
three-week opposition blockade of a Diet (parliament) room that
made parliamentary debate impossible.
</P>
<P>
The decisive lower house immediately sent the emergency budget
of 11.6 trillion billion yen (116 billion U.S. dollars), covering
April 1 through May 20, to the House of Councillors, where it is
expected to be approved Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced
to adopt the stopgap budget as a result of the 22-day blockade
of the House of Representatives Budget Committee room by lawmakers
of the leading opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto deputies had formed the human barricade since March
4 to protest the government's plan to spend 685 billion yen (6.85
billion dollars) of taxpayers' money to help liquidate seven
crippled housing loan companies known as "Jusen."
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto lifted its sit-in Monday and agreed to put
legislative business back on track, after reaching a vague-worded
compromise with the tripartite ruling coalition over continuing
debate on the fiscal 1996 budget bills which include the "Jusen"
liquidation scheme.
</P>
<P>
Debates on the 75.1 trillion yen (751 billion dollars) state
budget for the 1996 fiscal year are expected to resume in early
April.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Reach Agreement on Air Cargo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States reached
a basic agreement today in their bilateral air cargo talks to
increase sharply the number of flights to the United States by
Japan Airlines (JAL) and Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA), Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that U.S. cargo carrier United Parcel Service
will be allowed to provide flights to Asia via Kansai
International Airport, western Japan, the news service said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Japanese government officials as saying that the two
sides, however, remain at odds over the most controversial issue
of "beyond rights" to fly to third countries after stopovers
unconditionally and without limits.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have therefore decided to extend their
three-day talks for another day to try to finalize the agreement
on Thursday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and U.S. negotiators are scheduled to formalize a
memorandum of understanding to be signed in Washington early next
month, according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
The newly acquired flights will effectively redress the balance
of Japanese and U.S. aviation interests, which Japan has
complained of being tilted too much toward the U.S. under the 1952
bilateral aviation treaty.
</P>
<P>
The move will represent a major development in
Japan-U.S. relations because the U.S. has argued that the air
cargo dispute is one of the four priority trade issues in which
progress should be made before President Bill Clinton's state
visit to Japan in mid-April.

flight takes takes less than nine hours.
</P>
<P>
Alfred W. Brader, the airline's China manager, said the opening
of the Beijing-Vienna route "has dramatically improved the influx
of tourists from Austria to China", adding that the number of
Austrian tourists to China increased by three times last year,
making Beijing one of the most demanded tourist destinations for
Austrians.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline hopes to continue its cooperation with Air
China, China's flag carrier. Air China, in accordance with an
agreement between the two carriers, currently sells tickets for
80 seats, or one-third of the total, on each flight.
</P>
<P>
Brader expected that more flights will be operated between
the capital, with new routes opened between Austria and other
Chinese cities, the most likely next one being the east China
city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Airlines also announced today that starting from April
1, the Vienna-Beijing flights will adopt a new schedule, under
which the airplane will depart from Vienna every Sunday and
Tuesday, and leave Beijing every Monday and Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Mauritanian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen tonight held talks in Beijing with his Mauritanian
counterpart Cheikh Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers reached an extensive consensus on
issues of bilateral ties, as well as international and regional
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Qian said that Sino-Mauritanian
friendly ties have stood the test of time since the two countries
established diplomatic links more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Whatever changes in the international situation, the two
governments and peoples have all along trusted and supported each
other, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Mauritania-China friendly cooperation as "fruitful"
and a "model" of South-South collaboration, Ahmed thanked China
for its support and aid to Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that there is only one China in the world, and
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. Some people in Taiwan are
engaged in "Taiwan independence" activities, and some foreign
forces are also intervening in the Taiwan issue, to which China is
firmly opposed, Qian told Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed reaffirmed that his country would adhere to "one China"
policy, for which Qian expressed his appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Touching on human right issues, both foreign ministers held
that the priority in human rights are rights to subsistance and
development. They also voiced objection to the use of human rights
issues by some states to interfere with the internal affairs of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed stated that the Mauritanian government supported China on
issues of human rights, for which Qian expressed his thanks.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers attended a signing ceremony for an
agreement on economic and technological cooperation between the
Chinese and Mauritanian governments.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed arrived today on a visit to China as guest of Qian.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Local Banks to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Local bank interest rates in
Indonesia will probably fall by up to one percentage point within
a few months due to the abundant funds currently held by
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy of slowing down the growth of banking
credits this year has caused over-liquidity at banks, predicted
noted banker Indra Widjaja, president of the publicly-listed Bank
Internasional Indonesia (BII), at a workshop here today.
</P>
<P>
The fact that inter-bank interest rates currently touch 11
percent per annum indicates that banks are flooded with excessive
funds.
</P>
<P>
In its drive to cool down the overheated economy, the
government believes that credits extended by the country's
commercial banks should grow by no more than 16 percent this year
as compared with last year's growth of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides the government's target on credit expansion, the
presence of such excessive funds in the banking industry was
driven, among other things, by the booming local capital markets.
</P>
<P>
As most banks hold excessive funds, Indra forecast that banks
will soon cut their deposit and lending rates by a half or one
percentage point to reduce the losses incurred by the idle funds
they hold.
</P>
<P>
Deposit interest rates offered by commercial banks currently
range between 12 percent and 17 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
At present, all banks are adopting a wait-and-see strategy. No
one wants to take a risk by cutting rates because once one cut
rates, especially deposit rates, one risks loosing its customers.

JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided not to grant logging permits to 68 concessionaires in the
1996-97 fiscal year starting next month, an official of the
Forestry Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Forest Management Department Titus Sarijanto
said the 68 concessionaires failed to meet the ministry's

</P>
<P>
The concessionaires are required to help the development of
nearby villages, develop timber estates in cooperation with

crops.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's 490 concessionaires, 120 have been granted
logging permits, 251 are having their logging plans assessed by
the ministry and 51 have not yet submitted their annual plans.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's total log production is predicted to increase to
more than 36 million cubic meters in the 1996-97 fiscal year from
31 million cubic meters in the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Leads Chinese Cities in Savings Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Coastal city Dalian has become
China's savings capital. In just nine months savings deposited in
the city in northeast China's Liaoning province smashed through
the 10 billion yuan barrier.
</P>
<P>
It used to take at least a year, and at one time up to three
years, for savings to reach the 10 billion yuan level.
</P>
<P>
The city now has more than 40 billion yuan in savings
deposited. It represents an average level of savings per person of
7,906 yuan, an increase of 2,225 yuan over 1995, putting Dalian in
the lead in the country's large and medium-sized cities in per
capita savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly attributed to a local speedy economic growth in
recent years. Local gross domestic product in 1995 rose 14.9
percent over 1994, with annual per capita salaries of employees in
urban areas rising 13.9 percent over 1994, to exceed 6,600 yuan in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The city now has more than 2,000 offices providing savings
deposits services, with more than 8,000 staff.
</P>
<P>
Of local total deposits, savings deposits account for 58
percent, with almost 62 percent of local loans funded from savings
deposits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Boutros Boutros Ghali said today that there is no possibility
of Taiwan joining the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Boutros-Ghali said
that the fact that Taiwan is a part of China was made clear as
early as December 1, 1943 in the Cairo Declaration, and that
Resolution 2758 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in
1971 also states that there is only one China.
</P>
<P>
"This is the position of the United Nations and the position of
the majority of member states of the United Nations," he said.
Certain member states over the past few years tried to put the
question of Taiwan on the agenda of the UN General Assembly.
However, he said, "The majority of UN member states refused this"
on the basis of the above-mentioned resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, and its leaders, have always hoped that
the Taiwan question will be settled peacefully. "This is the
official point of view that I have heard" during the visit,
Boutros-Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his ongoing visit to China as a success, the
secretary general said that he had "very constructive and
positive" meetings with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and
Vice-Premier and foreign Minister Qian Qichen.

policy, and recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of
China as the sole legitimate government representing China.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Have Enough Rice Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice stock will be
enough to feed its civil servants and armed forces personnel as
well as to stabilize domestic prices until the general election in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The State Logistics Agency's (BULOG) domestic procurement in
the 1996/97 fiscal year, starting April, is expected to reach two
million tons, according to an estimation report by BULOG received
here today.
</P>
<P>
BULOG had bought 100,000 tons of rice domestically so far this
year, bringing the current rice stocks to two million tons, which
will be sufficient until next year as local harvests have now
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, once the biggest rice importing country in the
world, became rice self-sufficient in 1974. However, it turned to
imports of rice in late 1994 after adverse weather conditions hit
domestic harvests.

is an unswerving policy of the Chinese Government.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's parks have become focal
points for millions of city residents with leisure time on their
hands.
</P>
<P>
Strolling to the park has become such a popular pastime that
city authorities have created almost 50 new parks in the past five
years alone, bring the total to 120.
</P>
<P>
They provide a green and pleasant oasis from the hectic hustle
and bustle of everyday city life.
</P>
<P>
And people flock to the parks for different reasons. Some just
go to walk and enjoy the scenery. In particular, parks have become
favorite places for the old, who go there leisurely for dancing,
swaying swords, practicing shadow boxing, performing Beijing
opera, playing chess, and strolling with their singing pet birds.
</P>
<P>
China's capital city now boasts 120 parks which cover more
than seven hectares each, 49 of which were established after 1990.
</P>
<P>
With two leisure days each week, people have more time to
relax, and more choice of things to do. But investigations show
that parks remain the most popular and convenient places for
leisure-seekers in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The parks feature beautiful gardens, imperial structures,
colorful living styles of China's minority ethnic groups, or
embodying noted tourist resorts in China and the world.
</P>
<P>
In some old parks, such as Summer Palace, Heavenly Temple and
Beihai Park, the municipal government has been setting aside large
sums of money for improving green areas and repairing cultural
sites and ancient buildings.
</P>
<P>
Even well-off farmers in the outskirts of Beijing regard it as
fashionable to stroll in parks. In suburban Fengtai District,
there is at least one garden in each township.

<HEADLINE> Call for Reform of China's Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Faster reform of China's port
administration system, in an effort to cope with increasing
international trade, was urged at a national conference in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by customs officials, commodity
inspectors, and other port authorities from across the country,
concluded that the reform of the present port administration
system is a constitutional part of China's economic reform, and
that the operation of ports must be efficient and in accordance
with international practices.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called for strengthening the comprehensive
administration of ports, and improving co-ordination between
different port authorities. It also demanded that local
governments grant port authorities the necessary means for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
China had already opened 229 border crossings and marine and
airports to foreign people and vessels by the end of 1995, which
has been very helpful to China's trade, tourism and other
international exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, the conference pointed out, some of the ports have not
been running very well economically, as their passenger and cargo
flows had been very slim.
</P>
<P>
The conference called on the authorities to improve the planning
of ports, and be prudent in the approval of new ports.
</P>
<P>
As to the demands for opening inland cargo transport ports in
central and western China, the conference considered that
experiments must be done before large-scale work projects can be
started.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Australia air memorandum
signed here this week is expected to dramatically expand the air
service links between the two countries, Australian official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, based on a 1984 China-Australia Air
Services Agreement, scheduled flights from each side of the two
countries will be increased from once a week to nine times a week
immediately and to 13 times by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The number of airlines flying the China-Australia route will be
increased from two to six in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Australian Minister for Transport and Regional Development John
Sharp said Brisbane and Perth in Australia and Shanghai and
Shenzhen in China would be added as new destinations to Australian
and Chinese airlines.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the maximum carriage quota of each side to
1,800 passengers every week in direct flights between the two
countries. By 1998, the quota will be increased to 2,600 a week.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement released today, Sharp said the updated
agreement was a breakthrough in aviation links between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It was also the first important economic cooperation agreement
signed between China and the newly elected coalition government of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"China is already a substantial and growing aviation market for
Australia and its potential is enormous. Obviously, the previous
arrangements were totally inadequate to meet current and future
demand and it was essential that they be expanded," Sharp said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Before the agreement was signed, many business travelers had to
travel indirectly between China and Australia via Hong Kong,
Singapore and Japan, which was both costly and inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
Air China, the flag carrier of China, and its Australian
counterpart Qantas, are flying the only route linking Beijing,
Guangzhou, Melbourne and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese airlines, such as China South and China Eastern
as well as Ansett of Australia, are considering the possibility to
serve the route.
</P>
<P>
"This expansion in aviation rights restores a strong aviation
relationship, and is a major step forward in our efforts to
develop the full potential of our wider relationship with the
People's Republic of China, one of the fastest growing economies
in the Asian region," Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the Civil Aviation General
Administration of China, the Chinese authority in charge of air
services, and the Australian Ministry for Transport and Regional
Development.

MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 percent of the
establishments now operating in Metro Manila evaded fire safety
inspections in 1994, Director of the Philippine Bureau of Fire
Protection (BFP) Bonifacio Garcia said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said this at the second public hearing called by the Senate
Committee on Housing and Urban Planning chaired by Senator
Gregorio Honasan on the Ozone disco fire tragedy that claimed more
than 150 lives last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Garcia told the committee that the Ozone disco was one of the
establiments that did not pass the BFP inspection in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said all establishments were required to present a clearance
from the BFP before their permits were renewed, but only half of
them passed the inspection while the others managed to operate
without the clearance.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Interior Department, at least 95
commerical establishments in Metro Manila, including disco joints,
motels, inns and other entertainment places, are recommended for
closure because of violation against the building code and fire
safety rules and regulations.

MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Filipino businessman Lucio Tan
will be able to get an almost 67 percent stake in Philippine
Airlines (PAL) under a stockholders' agreement.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed separately today by Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo and Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) President
Jesli Lapus.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement that is being drafted by lawyers of the

be able to increase his direct stake in the PAL to 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
A minimum of 10 percent would be set aside for a new investor.
</P>
<P>
However, a new investor would have to be found within 60 days

Otherwise, Tan would have the option to get an additional 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Bigger Share in Overseas Market for Traditional Chinese Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medicine could provide a
perfect tonic for the country's export industry by the end of the
century, experts have predicted.
</P>
<P>
They believe that exports of traditional Chinese medicine could
earn a healthy two billion US dollars annually by the year 2000 if
a national project is adopted.
</P>
<P>
At a recent session of the State's top advisory body, 38
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who are also experts on
traditional Chinese medicine, put forward the idea of a national
project to promote and develop TCM.
</P>
<P>
The ideas were contained in a working document entitled
"Proposal for the establishment and implementation of a national
project of developing the Chinese Traditional Medicine".
</P>
<P>
The proposal was based on a study on the strategy and policy of
Traditional Chinese Medicine exportation, conducted by the
Information Center of the State Science and Technology Commission,
and a information branch of the Traditional Chinese Medicine
Institute of China.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the total sales volume of the traditional
Chinese medicine on overseas markets in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan,
as well as Southeast Asian countries, and western countries topped
14 billion US dollars in 1993, and was rising by an annual rate of
ten percent.
</P>
<P>
As a major exporting country of the medicine, China, only sees
an annual export volume of one billion US dollars, according to
the study.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons hindering exports were the low scientific
basis of traditional Chinese medicine, and the lack of an
integrated set of scientific statistics for the quality and
effectiveness of most medicines, concluded the study.
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped forms of drugs and medicine packaging have led
to a situation for a long period in which most profits from
traditional Chinese medicine production go to overseas
manufacturers. This is because medicinal materials for traditional
Chinese medicine make up most of the export from China.
</P>
<P>
To solve those problems, the medical experts suggest that the
Chinese government grant an initial investment for the project,
and the State Council set up a co-ordinative organization to form
a centralized management of exports of the traditional Chinese
medicines.

JINAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has
emphasized the need for state-owned enterprises to grow in a sound
manner.
</P>
<P>
The growth, he said, should be achieved by a "fundamental
shift" in China's economic structure and economic growth model.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, was
speaking during an inspection of coastal Shandong Province from

</P>
<P>
He asked leaders of governments at all levels to increase

improve management.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Shandong, the leader visited Weifang,
Shouguang, Zhucheng, Wulian, Rizhao and Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
He praised Zhucheng for taking various action to invigorate
small state-owned enterprises, by introducing joint-stock
systems, utilizing foreign funds, transfering property rights,
leasing, mergers, and letting some loss-making enterprises go
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to enterprise executives, he repeatedly stressed that
to ensure state-owned enterprises grow in a sound way, it is
necessary to supervise enterprise managers.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard we must pay particular attention to measures to
prevent enterprise managers from earning excessively high incomes,

</P>
<P>
Zhu visited grain and vegetable production centers, and
vegetable wholesale markets in Shouguang and farmers in Luohuading

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's assassin was sentenced to life imprisonment plus
six years at Tel Aviv District Court today.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was announced as the court had found Yigal Amir
guilty of murdering Rabin and wounding Rabin's bodyguard, Yoram
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Reading the verdict, the presiding judge, Edmond Levy, said
that Amir had displayed a premeditation and staunching composure
in his decision, which led to the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin at the end of the peace rally held in Tel Aviv on
November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that since psychiatric examination had found Amir to
be a sound mind, there was no justification to lessen his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Amir did not express remorse for his actions, claiming that he
did for the good of the country, the Jewish people and the land of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Amir's lawyer said that he would appeal to the Supreme Court
for the verdict.

<HEADLINE> Grachev Reiterates Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Counting on the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) to guarantee the security of Europe is
unacceptable to Russia, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of defense ministers of the
member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The worst influence on the security of the 12 CIS members is
the NATO strategy to enlarge its boundary in Europe by admitting
former Soviet bloc states in eastern Europe and the Baltics into
the western alliance, said Grachev.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the members of the CIS, formed in 1991 when
the Soviet Union broke down, to coordinate their defense policies
on the issue of NATO's eastward push.
</P>
<P>
Russia remained firm on its stance against NATO's expansion
when NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher visited Moscow last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China Travel International
Investment Hong Kong Limited (CTII) has obtained a syndicated loan
of 800 million HK dollars (102.5 million US dollars) to expand
its core business of tourism.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held here today for the signing of the five-year
loan agreement. The loan will be provided by a group of 13 leading
international banks and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
CTII, a listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will
use 424 million HK dollars (54 million US dollars) to purchase 51
percent interest of a theme park -- the Window of the World -- in
Shenzhen, a Chinese city bordering the territory. The park
comprises 118 scenic spots, which are replicas on real or
condensed scales of places of interest all over the world.
Originally invested by China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Limited,
the park opened to the public in 1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, CTII has had three theme parks in Shenzhen under its
flag-- Splendid China Miniature Scenic Spot, China Folk Culture
Villages and the newly acquired Window of the World. The company
owns 51 percent stake of each park.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the loan will be used as the company's general
managing capital, said Shen Zhuying, managing director of the
CTII, who believed that the merge will improve the profit
contributions from the tourist attraction operations. Since it
went public in Hong Kong in 1992, CTII has been focusing its
business on tourism, hotel, freight forwarding and transportation
services.
</P>
<P>
Both CTII and China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Limited are
subsidiaries of China Travel (Holdings) Hong Kong Limited, one of
the oldest Chinese establishments in the region.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Ban Imports of All Beef Products From Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to ban imports of all
beef products from Britain, because of fears of "mad cow" disease,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Ichizo Ohara said
today.
</P>
<P>
"At present, no beef and cows are imported from Britain, but
there is the possibility of pet foods containing them," the
minister said, "I would like to ban imports of those, other than
prohibited items, for a while."
</P>
<P>
Ohara made the remarks at a session of the House of
Representatives Budget Committee, a Kyodo News report said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry decided Tuesday to
order food importers to stop importing beef from Northern Ireland,
main source of Japan's beef imports, after reported "mad cow"
disease cases created a health scare in Europe and other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The European Union on Monday imposed a total ban on beef imports
from Britain, where about 143,000 cows contracted the disease from
1986 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Japan has banned imports of beef from Britain since 1951, out
of fear of the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have said that the "mad cow disease," formally
known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), might have links
to a fatal human brain disease.

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Output to Top 14 Million Tons This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce 14
million tons of offshore oil and 3.15 billion cubic meters of
natural gas this year, a 66 percent and 700 percent rise over the
1995 figure, respectively, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
And by the end of the century the country's oil and gas
industry will be a billion-dollar earner for the country.
</P>
<P>
This year's production targets represent a major breakthrough
in the 14 years of the country's offshore oil development, said
Wang Yan, president of the China National Offshore Oil
Corp.(CNOOC), in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC president said China is enjoying a sustainable and
effective development in offshore oil production, with all 19
offshore oil-gas fields operational in the waters of the Bohai
Sea, Yingge Sea and Beibu Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Wang expects the ratio of offshore oil output in the country's
annual total oil output to rise sharply from 6 percent in 1995 to
10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's offshore oil production is entering a harvest
phase, and bigger achievements are expected for the next five
years, in which, another 10 offshore oil and gas fields will be
put into operation in the waters of Bohai Sea and the South China
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Predictions are that 54 million tons of crude and 26 billion cu
m of gas will be produced during that period.
</P>
<P>
To boost oil production, the CNOOC said, the decision makers of
China's offshore oil industry are planning to invest 26 billion
yuan in the next five years in 23 offshore oil derricks,
500-km-long submerged pipelines, five onshore oil terminals, and
240 offshore oil wells.
</P>
<P>
In addition, utilization of offshore oil and gas resources will
also be stimulated in the same period. As part of the drive, a
huge ethylene petrochemical project, with a total investment of
6.5 billion U.S dollars, and a large fertilizer project with a
total investment of 2.5 billion U.S dollars, will be launched this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC has gained huge economic returns, the official said,
adding that the total output value this year is forecast to hit 10
billion yuan, twice the figure of the previous year, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, The CNOOC will be able to pay off all its
loans, and, even after production costs are deducted and creditors
paid, its offshore oil sector is expected to have a net income of
4.5 billion U.S dollars by the turn of the century.

<HEADLINE> Property Rights Reform in Rural Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China's rural enterprises have
made headway in property rights reforms, providing a basis for
more sustained and rapid economic development, by helping the
enterprises optimize production, diversify and improve management,
and increase vitality, "China Township Enterprises Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The reforms began in the early 1980s as a means of transferring
part of the property rights to the township level by selling
shares to local people. The practice helped many industries with
their financial difficulties by allowing them to buy imported
equipment to accelerate technological reforms and structural
readjustments.
</P>
<P>
The principal form of property rights exchange, the issuing of
stock, was used in three million township enterprises across China
after successful experiments were done at selected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To increase competitiveness and expansion, some efficient rural
firms set up enterprise groups by merging with other companies, or
by leasing, or putting themselves up for sale.
</P>
<P>
With the reforms, many rural enterprises have improved
management, worked out regulations on recruiting personnel,
quality control, finances, and old-age benefits, and opened
training courses for new workers. Others have improved the
appraisal of their assets, or the use of their property.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangsu Province, where rural industry is
highly developed, the majority of rural enterprises have issued
stock and smaller ones have been encouraged to merge with
foreign-funded firms or profitable domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Anhui Province, they have been using
mortgages and a modern enterprise system in township-run
enterprises on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million rural enterprises have taken root across
the country since 1978, providing jobs for more than 100 million
unemployed farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Enterprises Department
expects the annual growth to slow down to around 15 percent in the
sector over the next five years, instead of the 30 percent average
annual growth for the past 17 years. But, by the year 2000, they
are expected to have an output value of 10 trillion yuan, with 150
million employees, a Rural Enterprise Department official says.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Jockey Club has
confirmed the positive results of the drug tests carried out
earlier this month on French trainer Patrick Biancone's horses,
Lyphard's Lad and Charming Guest.
</P>
<P>
Four more of his horses also tested positive for banned
substances, but the Club has not yet confirmed the tests,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
And another batch of 20 positive samples from the trainer's
horses was reported to the Club management.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest drug-related scandal in the 24-year history
of professional horse racing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Following the earlier six tests, all of Biancone's runners were
barred from racing pending further investigation.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry into the drug scandal scheduled for yesterday was
adjourned indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The same banned substance of Dembrexine was found in the two
horses. A drug banned by the Club, dembrexine is not considered
performance enhancing and is widely used by Club vets on horses
suffering minor throat infections.
</P>
<P>
However, under the Club's rules, the Board of Inquiry appointed
by the Club has ordered an amendment to the results of the races
involving the Biancone runners.
</P>
<P>
The amendment thus changed the placings for the Match 10 races
and the original winner runners tested positive had their prize
money taken away as a consequence of the confirmed tests.

Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, with the assistance of the Office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the Chinese
government, the refugees have become a part of the local cultures.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Guangxi had received a total of 31 million
US dollars in loans from the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees to be used for 159 programs in industry, agriculture,
medical care, education, and others areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Larger Number of Vegetables for Beijing Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Beijing expects to have 43,300
hectares of vegetable farms and more than 13,300 hectares of
protected land, as the municipal government takes measures for its
"vegetable basket" project in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the number
of pigs is expected to reach three million to 3.5 million, output
of eggs to be around 2.5 billion kilograms, and fresh water fish
ponds will be expanded from the current 22,700 hectares.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the municipal government will introduce a
stock-issuing program for agricultural firms and encourage
competition, merge low-profit or money-losing enterprises, and use
technology to increase production.
</P>
<P>
The city will also cultivate high-quality vegetables, develop
methods for raising beef, mutton, and chickens, as well as build
high-yield fruit farms.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the government will allocate special
funds for vegetable planting, developing animal husbandry and fish
breeding, and for key projects and basic facilities. Importance
will also be attached to the food-processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 31,900 hectares of vegetable farms, with
vegetable output of 3.97 billion kilograms. The annual pig
production increased to 3.4 million head in 1995 from below three
million head in 1990, and annual egg output is 285 million
kilograms and milk, 220 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The city will produce 81,000 tons of fresh water fish and 470
million tons of fruit annually.

<HEADLINE> SADC Workshop Calls For Improved Information Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A two day workshop for
Southern African Development Community (SADC) media co-ordinators
ended here on Tuesday, with a call for improved dissemination of
information to help speed up economic integration in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the workshop noted that the ultimate
objective of the SADC is to improve the standard of living of the
12 member states through economic integration and cooperation#,
most of the member states are among the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
They said without efficient flow of information through mass
media institutions, there will be a danger for the organization
to be looked at by the people as " a club of presidents and
political elites" in southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, at the workshop the partici-
pants stressed the need to strengthen the information and public
relations unit at the SADC secretariat in Gaborone, Botswana, as
well as offices of media co-ordinators in the member states.
</P>
<P>
The participants also noted that the SADC media co-ordinators
were mostly not well equipped lacking basic facilities such as
motor vehicles, computers and telecommunication systems like fax,
telephones and telex.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which opened on Monday, were attended by over
30 representatives from SADC member states: Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nambia, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Role of Science Societies in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Non-governmental science societies
are playing an active role in economic development in China,
expecially in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hubei Province alone, there are more than
6,000 technology associations organized by and for farmers,
covering the fields of farming, husbandry, processing and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
The associations have a membership of over 300,000 farm
households, accounting for three percent of the province's
total. Nearly one-third of the societies have developed into
economic entities as well, combining scientific research with
agriculture and business.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of research societies organized by farmers began
to appear in this agricultural province in the early 1980s, and
grew beyond the confines of the neighborhood to the township and
then the county.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government supports the move to "revitalize the
nation with science and technology", different science societies
have become more prominent and well-known and formed a connection
between the government and the people.

JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's assassin was sentenced to life imprisonment plus
60 years at Tel Aviv District Court today.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was announced as the court had found Yigal Amir
guilty of murdering Rabin and wounding Rabin's bodyguard, Yoram
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Reading the verdict, the presiding judge, Edmond Levy, said
that Amir had displayed a premeditation and staunching composure
in his decision, which led to the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin at the end of the peace rally held in Tel Aviv on
November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that since psychiatric examination had found Amir to
be a sound mind, there was no justification to lessen his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Amir did not express remorse for his actions, claiming that he
did for the good of the country, the Jewish people and the land of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Amir's lawyer said that he would appeal to the Supreme Court
for the verdict.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- After two days of talks in the
Ivorian city of Yamoussoukro, outgoing Sierra Leonean military
leader Julius Maada Bio and leader of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) Foday Sankoh agreed that further talks on peace
should continue with Sankoh meeting President-Elect Tejan Kabbah
next week.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the talks did not say where
the talks will be held but political observers said today that
Yamousoukro "is more likely".
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in the Ivorian capital said, ''Much is expected
from the talks particularly the signing of an agreement for
permanent peace to end the five years civil war".
</P>
<P>
In the communique, both leaders agreed that the two months
ceasefire announced a week ago will strengthen the peace process
and ''enable relief supplies to reach war affected areas that
have been cut off'' by the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the military government gave the go ahead to
the International Committee of the Red Cross to deliver food
assistance to some 30,000 people who were on the verge of
starving behind rebel lines.
</P>
<P>
Many Sierra Leoneans have welcomed the end of the talks and
expressed optimism that a ''permanent peace is on the
horizon''.
</P>
<P>
''We hope Sankoh can come out of the bush to join the
political process,'' says a senior official of the Sierra Leone
People's Party (SLPP) which won the recent elections.
</P>
<P>
A trader in the capital notes, ''The fact that Bio and Sankoh
met give us the hope that permanent peace is not too distant and
it has once been.''
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers on Wednesday hailed the result of the talks
calling it ''a hopeful sign of peace''.
</P>
<P>
Correspondents here say Bio's sister, who was seized by the
RUF in an attack on Matrru Jong in the south two years ago, is
now a high ranking official of the RUF and part of the
negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the S.Leonean parliament is to meet on April 2 for
the first time since the military toppled the civilian government
on April 29, 1992. Kabbah is to present the list of cabinet
ministers at the session for the nominees to be probed by
parliamentarians before approval, parliamentary sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation is playing
unique roles in preventing conflicts, peace-keeping and
peace-building, and in providing a forum to help tackle global and
transnational issues.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here today by visiting UN Secretary General
Boutros Boutros Ghali in his speech to hundreds of Chinese
scholars and experts on international issues.
</P>
<P>
To achieve collective security, to promote friendly relations
among nations based upon shared values, to promote human rights
and fundamental freedoms, and to engage in cooperative
problems-solving of economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
issues -- these were the goals of those who created the United
Nations 50 years ago and they are the goals of the United Nations
today, Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
However, the world of today is not the same as that of 50 years
ago. In the new world environment, the UN, as a unique instrument
in the service of the member states, is more than ever essential,
Ghali said. The UN has "a unique set of mechanism for preventing
conflict", "a unique mechanism for keeping peace", "an essential
framework for building peace", and a unique forum for all
countries to forge consensus and agreements on global issues. In
addition, Ghali noted, the UN conferences and summits have become
an essential mechanism for bringing together all the relevant
states to focus on particular transnational issues.
</P>
<P>
China has in recent years played a "key role" in UN
activities. Unprecedented examples of the role is in Rio de
Janeiro in 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and development,
the human rights conference in Vienna in 1993, the population and
development conference in Cairo in 1994, and the conference on
poverty, unemployment and social dislocation in Copenhagen in
1995. The successful convening of the 4th World Conference on
Women held in Beijing last year has resulted in achieving new
recognition toward the solution to long-standing problems of human
development -- Women's issues, Women's progress and their status
in social and economic development, Ghali stated.

<HEADLINE> Maritime Industry Areas in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- In a move to make full use of
resources, environmental conditions and technology along the
3,100-km coast of east China's Shandong Province, five maritime
industrial areas have begun to take shape.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, provincial authorities worked out a plan to start with
maritime cultivation and the fishing industry and gradually work
up to the salt chemical and petrochemical industries. Shandong has
some 40 percent of China's marine engineering technicians.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, Dongying, and Weifang cities will
emphasize marine science research and education, aquatic hi-tech
development, cultivation, shallow-sea oil exploration, and
petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, provincial finance department began setting aside ten
million yuan every year to support the maritime industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, it set up 253 marine science research
programs for aquatic cultivation, salt chemical technology, and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The province is now planning a national maritime pharmaceutical
technology research center in Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is becoming a national base for maritime husbandry,
the salt chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, food, transportation,
energy, oil and petrochemicals. The Shengli Oilfield has become
the nation's largest shallow-sea oilfield, with a yield of 550,000
tons last year. Weifang is now the country's largest crude salt
production base.
</P>
<P>
in 1995, the province's maritime industry reported 50 billion
yuan worth of output value, the largest in China.

<HEADLINE> Growth in China Sales for US Computer Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A leading American computer
company, NCR, had a sales volume of 60 million US dollars in China
last year, giving it a growing share of the computer market here.
</P>
<P>
James Chen, president of the company's China division, said
that the company sold 16 million US dollars' worth of automatic
teller machines in China last year, up 70 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said the company's products are widely used in major
financial institutions in China, and it will expand its computer
applications business for the fields of finance, retail sales, and
telecommunications in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that NCR is developing an electronic payment system
designed for Chinese banks. It will be put into production by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
NCR's ambitious expansion plans could bring more competition
for integrated computer systems, putting pressure on the major
players, such as DEC and Hewlett-Packard, say computer market
analysts here.
</P>
<P>
Ranking fifth in the world in computer companies, NCR was
merged with AT&AMP;T in 1991, but will become independent again by the
end of this year, when AT&AMP;T is restructured.

<P>
ANKARA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel leaves here today for a 4-day state visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from Ankara Esenboga Airport, Demirel said
that Turkey has attached special importance to
Turkey-U.S. relations since the two countries established
diplomatic ties 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Demirel told reporters that Turkey is sparing no efforts for
developing the bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade,
economy, science, culture and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president said that he would hold talks with his
U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton on bilateral and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that Demirel would underline the fact that
Turkey is a strong, stable and reliable country that the U.S. can
count on.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hoped that the United States will adopt more concrete
measures against Syria, such as economic sanctions or restrictions
on trade by third-parties, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq have complained that reduced and polluted water
is flowing into the downstream countries as a result of the
construction of several dams inside Turkey on the Euphrates
River. These countries insist on taking the dispute to
international platform.

<HEADLINE> Police Catch Giant Panda Skin Peddler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Police in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province confiscated a giant panda skin and arrested the
person selling the skin, Shanghai's "Wenhui Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police in Chang'an County are investigating the case further,
the report said, but gave no details about the other suspects and
particulars of the case.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2-meter-long skin was different from ordinary
black-and-white giant panda skin and had black and white hair on
the head, neck and back, and brown hair on its stomach, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Xi'an Zoo, in the provincial capital, came to
examine the skin, and found a tuft of golden hair in the left rear
part of the skin.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the experts as saying that this is the first
three-color giant panda skin they have seen.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists announced last August that they have
identified three different types of panda - black-and-white, grey,
and white - in the Fuping Nature Protection Zone in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda, native only to China, mainly lives in western
China's Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. The number of the
rare animal living in the wild is estimated at 1,000.
</P>
<P>
China has classified giant pandas at the highest level of
protection and passed very strict legislation with stiff penalties
for those who kill or sell the animals.
</P>
<P>
A Shaanxi farmer, who was found guilty of killing a panda in
1993, was sentenced to life imprisonment last June.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon against Violence, Terrorism: Hrawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
stressed here Tuesday that his country is against violence and
terrorism, adding, however, that violence could not be eradicated
by more infringements of the legitimate right, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi held a banquet in the Beirut Presidential Palace Tuesday
night in honor of the visiting former U.S. President, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome speech, the Lebanese president expressed the
hope that Bush's presence in Beirut could be regarded as an
announcement of the lift of a ten-year-old travel ban on American
citizens to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi did not forget to recall that the travel ban was imposed
during the days of (former U.S.) President Ronald Reagon when
George Bush was the vice president in Reagon's administration.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Lebanon's commitment to the peace process based
on the implementation of U.N. Security resolutions 242, 338 and
425 and the principle of exchanging land for peace. "On this
base, Lebanon entered the Madrid peace conference," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president stressed coordination of positions
between the Lebanon and Syria in the peace process track, noting
that the coordination is a guarantee for peace itself, and a
guarantee for the Arab honor.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is against violence and terrorism", Hrawi underlined,
"but violence can not be eradicated by more infringements of the
right, but by treating the real political reasons for the breakout
of violence or the reaction it causes."
</P>
<P>
He added that during the 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanon had
suffered from violence, so it knows the meaning of peace and
upholds the goals it is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Israel is still occupying a
precious part of the Lebanese land in south Lebanon and western
Bekaa, continually bombing Lebanese villages, destroying houses,
blocking the southern Lebanese coasts, arresting Lebanese citizens
and jailing them in prisons on the occupied land or in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all this, Hrawi said, Lebanon has started
reconstruction instead of waiting for the liberation of all its
land.
</P>
<P>
In a reply speech, former U.S. President Bush expressed his
pleasure for his presence in Lebanon, and his appreciation of the
"first class job" of the Lebanese leaders in rebuilding and
reconstituting a free lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Bush ended a nine-nation tour of the Middle East and left here
for home today.

investment in the lucrative China market.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the company set up Merck Sharp &AMP; Dohme (China) Ltd. in

</P>
<P>
It joined a company in Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province, in setting up the Hangzhou MSD Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd. in 1994, its first joint venture in China.
</P>
<P>
With total investment of 26.26 million US dollars, the joint
venture began operations in July of last year, producing "Proscar",
"Zocor", and "Sinemet", which had sales of 18 million yuan in the
second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to produce 100 million tablets this year to
double its output value.
</P>
<P>
Merck is looking for more partners in China to produce
antibiotics, vaccines, and medicines for ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
Merck Sharp &AMP; Dohme (China) also set up service organizations
and a scientific research fund in China to improve its development
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands Release of Three Hijacked Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry demanded
today the "speedy return to Iran" of three Iranian nationals
hijacked Sunday by two Sudanese to the Eritrea capital of Asmara,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three Iranians were hijacked together with some 40
passengers on board a Sudanese airliner en route from the Sudanese
capital Khartoum to port Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The rest passengers and crew on board returned to Khartoum
Monday evening following the surrender of the hijackers in
Asmara. But the three Iranians were detained because of their
unidentified nationalities.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi, the three Iranian nationals were actively engaged in
the economic sector of a private gas supply company in port Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to Eritrean sources, the three Iranians
were not carrying sufficient identification cards. However, he
added that the three Iranians were in fact taking an internal
flight.
</P>
<P>
The report did not specify whether the Iranians were carrying
passports or not.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud said that Iran's Foreign Ministry has informed Eritrean
officials of the Iranians' true identity through diplomatic
channels and has asked for their immediate release according to
the international norms and practices.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Khartoum, a high ranking Sudanese
official said that talks were under way between officials of Iran
and Sudan for securing the release of the three Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Tajani Saleh Fassil, director of the Political Affairs
Department of Sudan's Foreign Ministry, said at a press interview
that the three Iranians were on their way to the place of their
work in port Sudan, about 1,000 kilometers from Khartoum.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: France Envisions "Two-Tier Europe"  (By Shen Xiaoquan) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The French government has recently
envisioned what it called a "two-tier Europe" in regard to the
future development of the 15-member European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
According to Prime Minister Alan Juppe, as it expands, a
broader-based EU should contain a "second tier" to serve as a
nucleus that is small but adjustable in size.
</P>
<P>
The nucleus, he said, could enlist France, Germany and some
other nations ready to take onto the fast lane in resolving issues
related to building unified monetary and defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The newly-revised vision, made clear at a European Democratic
Union meeting and during French National Assembly hearings, was
consistent with France's stance on EU's future.
</P>
<P>
The French government has called for a "multi-speed Europe" or
a "nucleus Europe" that allows EU member nations to adapt their
own paces towards a common goal.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, in the document released after
meeting German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the end of last
year, said each nation could ride at a different speed.
</P>
<P>
However, as Kohl stated, the "slowest car" should not slow down
the entire train.
</P>
<P>
Britain, in response to the position jointly held by France and
Germany, has charged that the two nations are building a "hard
core" within the EU to maintain superiorities over and issue
orders to other nations.
</P>
<P>
In the "two-tier Europe" proposal, tabled up largely to soften
the British criticism, France emphasized that the "nucleus" is
adjustable and therefore is open to all nations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was also in preparation for EU's upcoming
inter-governmental conference in Turin, Italy, on the revision of
the Maastricht Treaty effective since late 1993.
</P>
<P>
France was eager to promote, hopefully at the Turin gathering,
the formation of EU's common external and security policies that
could ultimately lead to a European political union.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Chirac proposed providing France's nuclear weapons
for EU's defense, and decided to take major steps to reform the
French military to meet EU's defense needs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as a gesture of moving itself closer to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), France discussed recruiting a
European force of 250,000 to 300,000 men to strengthen Western
European Union's (WEU) role as "a military arm" in the EU.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the French President said the EU Council of
Ministers should have a highest representative to produce "one
voice" out from the EU on external and defense matters.
</P>
<P>
As for the European political union, France has drawn support
from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg. But
down onto details, Germany has had reservations over WEU's
relationship with NATO, and has been against setting up a high
representative position within the Council of Ministers, for fear
that the role of the Council itself will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
On the Council's voting mechanism, France and Germany, two
European giants, have held that "big nations" should be given more
voting powers; while Britain, another giant, has insisted on
reaching consensus through consultation before any decision is
made.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany and Britain have been the pivotal forces in
EU's operations. Analysts here believe that their differences
could complicate the Turin conference, EU's efforts to revise the
Maastricht Treaty and the document's implementation.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Prime Minsiter Dismisses Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- External military
intervention in Burundi political crisis is " unacceptable" since
it will not solve the problem but creat "war lords" similar to
those of somalia, Burundi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Antoine Nduwayo said, "If
military intervention can solve the Burundi crisis it will be
welcome. But i am positively convinced that it will escalate the
problem."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized that solution to the Burundi
problem is " for the people of Burundi themselves to come to terms
with each other and adopt a workable common stand that will take
into account the wishes of the different political groups".
</P>
<P>
He said external imposed solutions will only complicate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi crisis is a deep and complex political problem
which needs a political solution and that the country's political
partners have already committed themselves to dialogue, said
Antoine Nduwayo.
</P>
<P>
He called on neighbour countries to continue their help in
resolving the Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are in favour of solutions decided upon within Burundi but
also ready to accept positive external contribution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Paying attribute to former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere's efforts for solving the Burundi prolem, Antoine Nduwayo
said: " He is the most able person to play this role."
</P>
<P>
The Burundi prime minister has ended a two-day official visit
to Tanzania during which he held talks with his Tanzanian
counterpart Frederick Sumaye.

<HEADLINE> Dole Claims Victory to Win Republican Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Bob Dole Tuesday
claimed victory in the battle for the Republican nomination for
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"The battle for the Republican nomination is over," news
reports quoted Dole, the Senate majority leader, as saying at a
celebration gathering.
</P>
<P>
Early returns in California, Washington and Nevada primaries
showed Dole defeating Pat Buchanan by big margins.
</P>
<P>
"The votes aren't in yet...but all the signs look pretty good,"
Dole said.
</P>
<P>
Setting his sights on President Bill Clinton, Dole said, "The
battle for America's future is beginning tonight."
</P>
<P>
In California, Buchanan conceded that Dole "will be the
Republican nominee and we have to congratulate him on his
victory." But he said that he would "go to San Diego," the site of
the Republican convention in August.
</P>
<P>
Dole claimed the 165 delegates in winner-take-all California --
the biggest single-state prize in the nomination race -- and won
all 14 in Nevada. He was on pace to pick up at least 11 of the 18
delegates at stake in Washington. That would give him 1,195
delegates, more than the 996 needed for nomination.
</P>
<P>
Early counts showed Dole getting 67 percent in California, to
15 percent for Buchanan. In Washington, it was 63 percent for
Dole, 18 percent for Buchanan. In Nevada, Dole had 52 percent to
19 percent for Steve Forbes, who quit two weeks ago after the
mail-in balloting was under way. Buchanan had 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Kansas senator locked up the nomination with a four-state
primary sweep last week, but he waited a week to declare victory.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had given no serious thought to picking a
running mate, and that while he considered it unlikely, had not
ruled out making his choice well before the August Republican
convention.

<HEADLINE> GCC May Impose Taxes on Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Economic experts said the Gulf
Cooperation council (GCC) states are considering imposing taxes
on foreign companies in oreder to reduce their deficit in the
budgets.
</P>
<P>
Today's newspaper Emirates News quoted Mohammed al Asumi, chief
economist at the state-run Emirates Industrial Bank as saing that
"it is time for GCC countries to consider new measures, including
imposing taxes on foreign companies operating in the region as
such companies pay taxes in their countries with full
satisfaction."
</P>
<P>
"As Gulf citizens have accepted the hikes in services fees,
these companies could accept payment of 5 percent taxes on their
profits," Asumi said.
</P>
<P>
Asumi said the combined GCC budget deficit is projected to
grow by some 19 percent in 1996 compared with 1995. He gave no
figures, but the the deficit in 1995 was estimated at some 9.6
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It reduced sharply from a record 62 billion dollars in 1991,
when GCC states, mainly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, paid over 65
billion dollars to finance a U.S.-led coalition during the Gulf
War in the year, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the first quarter of 1996, the six Gulf Arab
countries will earn more from oil due to higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,
Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), earned some 1.4 billion
dollars more in oil export income in the first quarter compared
with the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise in income was calculated on the basis of their
combined output of some 13 million barrels a day, and the OPEC's
average price for a barrel of crude rose to 18.27 dollars Monday
compared with 17 dollars in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But experts said oil prices will not remain high throughout
the year, pointing out a possible drop in seasonal demand in the
second and third quarters and the possibility of Iraq's return to
the oil market.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Fruit Export on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's fruits export fell
27.06 percent to 19.726 million US dollars during the first eight
months of the fiscal 1995-96 from 27.044 million dollars during
the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released recently by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics, Pakistan exported 61,617 tons of fruits from July to
February 1995-96 as against 90,281 tons during the same period in
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
"This fall in exports is mainly due to low supply of mangoes,"
said a spokesman for Fruits and Vegetables Exporters and Importers
Association.
</P>
<P>
Mangoes constitute more than 40 percent of Pakistan's total
fruit export.
</P>
<P>
"Increase in sea and air freight rates plus rupee devaluation
and enhanced prices of petroleum products have made fruit export
costlier," said one dealer.

BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Croatia beat Israel 2-0 in a
soccer friendly at Varazdin, Croatia, on Tuesday.
</P>

The host team played without its star players that helped it
qualify for the European soccer championship but still gained an
upper hand over its uninspiring Israeli team.

<P>
Yet the host team failed to score until late in the second
half. Igor Stimac netted in the 74th minute and Goran Vlaovix
scored his first goal for his national side two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Most of the star players of Croatia team, like Alen Boksic in
Italy's Lozio, Davor Suker in Spain's Sevilla and Zvonimir Boban
of AC Milan, didn't took part in the match which served as
Croatia's tune-up game for the European championship.

<HEADLINE> Snow City's First Spring Snowfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- This winter, the "holy city of the
high snow" actually had a winter without snow, then the snow came,
but at the beginning of spring.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of winter, Lhasa had not seen any snow until
Tuesday. The white covering on the budding branches of trees, drew
many people to parks to take photos.
</P>
<P>
It has long been accepted that wintertime Lhasa is a
snow-covered icy world. In recent years, however, the climate has
grown warmer and there is less snow during the winter.
</P>
<P>
Last year, winter temperatures in Lhasa were higher than ever
before, except for a few cold days in early January. The rest of
Tibet was also as much as five degrees warmer than the same period
the year before. Many other places are experiencing a decrease in
the amount of snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
The level of humidity was only 50 percent of what it had been
the previous winter, with the weather quite dry in many places.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, climatic changes such as these are the result of shifts in
the polar vortex in winter to the south, causing air currents
across Asia in winter to bring less cold air to the region and
winds at these altitudes to be stronger.
</P>
<P>
Snowstorms in the southern and northern parts of Tibet in the
past year were caused by two typhoons in the Bay of Bengal, which
resulted in damage to these areas, the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Passes Bill on Caretaker  Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi parliament has
passed an amendment bill on the much-talked non-party caretaker
government for holding future general elections.
</P>
<P>
Official sources confirmed today that the bill was passed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the caretaker government will be
composed of a chief advisor and 10 advisors, who will be appointed
by the president of the country within 15 days of the dissolution
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government, headed by the chief advisor who must
be a retired chief justice and will enjoy the status and
privileges of a prime minister, will hold office until a new
elected prime minister takes over and shall not make any policy
decision.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's ruling party and the opposition have long been
locked in a dispute over the issue of the caretaker government.
But since the ruling party held the 6th parliamentary elections on
February 15 despite all opposition parties' boycott, the
opposition has put a precondition of cancellation of the polls for
talking about the issue of the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that although the bill was passed, the opposition
may not recognize the passage as they considered the newly-elected
parliament as "illegal" because of the "farcical" February polls.

NEW DELHI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's new Foreign Minister
Yuvgeny Primakov will visit India on March 30-31 and hold talks
with Indian leaders to enhance bilateral relations, it is learnt
here today.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's visit to India will be the first by a Russian
foreign minister since the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he is expected to hold talks with his
Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao on bilateral ties as well as on regional and
international situation, an official said.
</P>
<P>
India and Russia enjoy good relations, especially in economic
and military fields. The majority of India's weapons and military
equipment is from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Minister Mukherjee has just returned from a
three-day official visit to Uzbekistan. The main thrust of the
talks he held at Tashkent with his counterpart A.H. Kamilov and
President Islam Karimov was on the situation in Afghanistan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
As the situation in Central Asia is of equal interest and
concern to the Russian federation, which has its troops stationed
in Tajikistan, the matter is likely to figure in Primakov's
discussions in New Delhi, the same official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany have agreed to
establish an exchange mechanism linking EU members inside and
outside the future single currency system, said French Finance
Minister Jean Arthuis today.
</P>
<P>
"We agree on an exchange mechanism," said Arthuis after a
meeting of the Franco-German Economic and Financial Council held
with his German counterpart Theo Waigel.
</P>
<P>
The proposed European currency, to be called the Euro, will
come into force on January 1, 1999. But to qualify for the
currency, EU members have to meet criteria on their deficit,
public debt, inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism, to link the exchange rates of the monetary
system's "insiders" and "outsiders," will try to avoid competitive
devaluations between EU members, said the French finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis added that the future mechanism would provide for
interventions by the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in the western French city of Laval, is aimed
at coordinating the two countries' stands on the single currency.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says CIS Economic Integration First Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia regards economic
integration as the basis for the overall integration of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a Russian senior
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Valery Serov, Russia's minister for CIS
cooperation, said President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian
government are working on a timetable for the steps that Russia
will take in the next phase of integration with other CIS members.
</P>
<P>
Serov said the first priority for CIS members is to even up
their pace of economic development.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said, the CIS Interparliamentary Conference
should draw up new legislation that would be acceptable to all
members, enlarge the tariff union between Russia, Kazakhstan and
Belarus and coordinate the structural policies of CIS member
states.
</P>
<P>
The integration accord that Russia will sign with Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on March 29 aims to coordinate their
pace of development, standardize economic legislation and draw up
a regulatory framework for a monetary union, said Serov.
</P>
<P>
He said the accord also aims to adjust Russia's credit policy
with other CIS members, to establish a unified energy and
transportation system and to unify education and social welfare
standards.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's planned union with Belarus, Serov said an accord to
be signed on April 2 will help improve bilateral trade and
industrial relations dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The accord was announced last Saturday after talks between the
presidents of Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Serov disclosed that Kyrgyzstan is considering joining Russia's
tariff union with Kazakhstan and Belarus, and that Tadzhikistan
and Uzbekistan have shown interest in it.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been vigorously promoting CIS integration since
Yeltsin mapped out Russia's foreign policy for other CIS member
states last September.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Resolve Air Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States today
agreed to end a tit-for-tat transatlantic airline dispute and to
negotiate a longer-term aviation pact.
</P>
<P>
Junior transport ministers of the two countries agreed that Air
France would be allowed to make 500 extra flights to the U.S. this
summer in exchange for France dropping a threatened cut in
U.S. airlines' landing rights.
</P>
<P>
French Secretary of State for Transport Anne-Marie Idrac said
they had agreed to reverse "the unpleasant decisions" made last
week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Transport Secretary Charles Hunnicutt expressed
his satisfaction at a press conference following their meeting and
stressed the U.S. position of reaching an "open sky" accord with
France.
</P>
<P>
Air France asked last week to have 500 more summer flights,
amounting to 176,000 seats, to the U.S. from April 1 to October 31.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. refused the request on March 21.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, France ordered an equivalent cut of 170,000
seats on flights to France by six American airlines.
</P>
<P>
France and the U.S. arrange their flight schedules twice a year
after a previous air transport pact expired in 1993.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 10 Billion Dollar Loan to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a new three-year loan of 10.087 billion
U.S. dollars to Russia, nearly doubling Russia's debt to the
financial institution.
</P>
<P>
It is the IMF's second-biggest loan in its 51-year history,
exceeded only by a 17.8 billion dollar loan package to Mexico last
year.
</P>
<P>
The loan, equivalent to 160 percent of Russia's quota in the
IMF, aims to help Russia to achieve sustained growth, including
real GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 1996, five percent in 1998 and
six percent annually for the rest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Russia already owes the IMF 10.8 billion dollars, and the
country's total debt last year stood at 115.9 billion dollars,
according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Russia is due to pay out 6.9 billion dollars this year in
principal and interest.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Prime Ministers Unlikely to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite efforts at reconciliation,
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis is unlikely to meet his
Turkish counterpart under current conditions, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
Greece has urged Turkey to accept a European Union (EU)
statement issued on March 25 which appealed to both countries to
settle their territorial dispute without threatening to use force,
Reppas told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had written to
Simitis inviting him to visit Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Simitis told Turkish Ambassador to Greece Umit Pamir, who
delivered the letter, that Greece wanted to develop friendly
relations with Turkey and asked Turkey also to take firm steps to
promote friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
However, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos has said
that relations between Turkey and the EU would not be smooth as
long as Turkey continued to claim sovereignty over Greek territory.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos stressed that Greece, an EU member, would veto all EU
economic aid to Turkey until it renounces any claim to Greek
territory.
</P>
<P>
Tension flared between the two traditionally hostile neighbors
at the end of January over their conflicting claims to the islet
of Imia in the Aegean Sea.

WELLINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Telecom
company will start a word dialing system for its business
customers from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Business customers, now using numbers starting with 0800, will
be able to replace the sequence numbers with words. The service,
called 0800 WordNumber telephone service, is the first for New
Zealand, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
"Many people find it easier to recall words than they do
numbers. For example, a bungy jump firm might use 0800 JUMP NOW!"
Telecom's 0800 product manager Brent Matthews was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses can use 0800 WordNumbers to promote their
operations, support their brand name or reinforce a key message,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
No new equipment is needed but as not all telephones have the
same keypad letter-number layout, a new international standard for
telephone keypad layouts will be introduced from April 1.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banker Calls For Long-Term Stable Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital is essential
for economic growth in Latin America, but governments should
encourage the use of long-term debt to ensure stability, a senior
Japanese banker said today.
</P>
<P>
Kosuke Nakahira, the Japanese acting governor to the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), said governments should pay
more attention to the management of foreign capital. Although they
should encourage capital inflows, they should keep a close watch
on the current account balance and foreign currency reserves, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Mexico which erupted in December 1994
was caused by a current account deficit aggravated by a severe
contraction of foreign currency reserves. A large proportion of
foreign capital in the country was short term and hence easy to
get out once trouble emerged.
</P>
<P>
Nakahira, attending the 37th annual meeting of the IDB in
Buenos Aires, also urged governments to encourage growth in
domestic savings, which are currently relatively low in Latin
American economies.
</P>
<P>
These savings should play a crucial role in providing the
necessary capital for the economic development of a country, and
to achieve sustain economic development, said Nakahira. A good
combination of financing from private capital and official funds
is a must.
</P>
<P>
Mr Nakahira said the priorities of the IDB's financing
policies should be the social sector, including education, health,
environment, and infrastructure, such as transport, energy and
telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Economy Grows By Seven Percent up to March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban economy will have grown
at seven percent by the end of March, which exceeds the five
percent predicted for the whole year, Cuban Vice-President Carlos
Lage said.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the fifth plenary session of the Central
Committee of the Cuban Communist Party (CPP), which was published
today, Lage added that the growth was due mainly to greater
outputs in agriculture, mining and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The production of nickel, citric fruits, sugar cane, cement and
fertilizers led the growth, with sugar cane harvest approaching
three million tons this week, out of a goal of 4.5 million tons
set for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
As for tourism, Lage said, Cuba reported 45 percent growth in
January and February.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that the budget deficit continues to
decrease, which was reduced by 88 million pesos (88 million
U.S. dollars) in the first two months.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded fifth plenary session, presided over by
Fidel Castro, analyzed the most important aspects of the
political, economic and social situation on the island.

NEW DELHI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Commerce Minister P.
Chidambaram has said that the import of consumer goods would be
liberalized over a five-year period once the country has ensured a
sufficient cushion of foreign exchange reserves.
</P>

In an interview with "Business Standard" which was released

<P>
IMF serves as part of the balance of payments consultations in
India.
</P>
<P>
"The balance of payments consultation is a World Trade
Organization (WTO) obligation. We have to go back and back and
convince them that we continue to require balance of payments'
cover. In order to continue such cover, they want us to give them
a time-frame. We declined last October and said that there was no
question of giving you a time-frame now. So, those consultations
were adjourned to next October," the minister said.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia will link revision of the
nuclear disarmament treaty with NATO's planned eastward expansion,
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov said today.
</P>
<P>
Russian nuclear experts believe that if Russia's Eastern
European neighbors join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it
could raise tensions between Russia and NATO, whose military
capacity is well above Russia's, and see a return to the Cold War
era, Itar-Tass quoted Mikhailov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if NATO expanded to Russia's western border and
stationed nuclear weapons aimed at Russian military and industrial
installations, the signed international treaty banning nuclear
tests and reducing nuclear arms would be revoked and the arms
race renewed.
</P>
<P>
Russia would have to station air defense and anti-warship
nuclear weapons in the border area, Mikhailov told visiting Briton
Joseph Rotblat who, together with his Pugwash Conference on
Science and World Affairs organization won the 1995 Nobel Peace
Prize.

NEW DELHI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Delhiites are deeply
dissatisfied with their elected representatives and the political
parties putting them up, according to an opinion survey conducted
by a women's voluntary organization here recently.
</P>
<P>
63 percent of the respondents to the survey felt their elected
representatives (to the local bodies, the state assembly and
parliament) are not committed to the public interest, but are
"self-serving and only interested in amassing wealth by any cost".
The voters largely blame the political parties for putting up
undeserving candidates and leaving the public with no real choice.
</P>
<P>
A large majority (as much as 93 percent of slum-dwellers and 87
percent of the lower middle-class) felt that government works in
the interest of only the rich and the influential.
</P>
<P>
Elected representatives themselves do not respect the rule of
law and, for common citizen, justice is mostly inaccessible, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents believe woman's representation in legislatures
is inadequate and needs to be enlarged, the survey added.

YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior General Than
Shwe today warned against internal destructionists who, aping the
external cohorts, are perpetrating acts to disturb and hinder
national construction.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Senior General Than Shwe, who is
commander-in-chief of the Myanmar defense services, at a dress
parade of columns of the defense services marking the 51st
anniversary of the Myanmar Armed Forces Day which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe warned that the danger posed by the internal and
external destructionists is great and the armed forces must,
together with the people, ostracize, oppose and remove the
obstructionists.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar is today enjoying stability and peace and has
laid firm political, economic and social foundations.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign destructionists are resorting to instigation to
cause destruction, he accused.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that 15 armed groups have returned to the legal
fold, followed by drug warlord Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army
(MTA).
</P>
<P>
He welcomed sincere cooperation with the international
community in combating the narcotic drug menace. Even without
cooperation, Myanmar will do its best, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe also stressed that the 51st anniversary of the
Myanmar Armed Forces day is observed with four objectives,
namely, giving priority to national defense for stability of the
state, community peace and tranquillity and prevalence of law and
order; directing efforts toward modernization of the Tatmadaw
(armed forces) to be able to provide full protection to the
emerging new, modern and developed nation; actively contributing
to realization of the political, economic and social objectives
of the state; and unswervingly accomplishing the aim for the
Tatmadaw to be able to participate in the national political
leadership role of the future state.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is to call international
tenders for construction of a 144-megawatt hydropower project in
West Nepal from next week, according to officials of the Nepal
Electricity Authority (NEA).
</P>
<P>
At a consultation program on the Kali Gandaki-a project
organized here Tuesday by the NEA, officials announced that the
government was committed to starting the 367 million US dollar
project in the near future despite criticism from
environmentalist organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Kali Gandaki-a project, located about 180 kilometers west
of Kathmandu, has been a prime item on the government's priority
list of hydropower development for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Under the project design, a diversion dam would be constructed
on the Kali Gandaki river to channel water through a six-kilometer
tunnel into the power plant with three turbine generators.
</P>
<P>
According to the project implementation program, the contract
on the project is expected to be signed at the end of this year
and construction work will be initiated in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
An 28-km-long access road linking to the project site has
already been constructed after detailed project design was
completed in 1993, NEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the Asia Development Bank and the Japanese
government will be major financiers of the multi-million dollar
project.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
ended his two-day state visit to Norway today, hoping his host not
to participate in NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, he
discussed the issue of NATO's enlargement to incorporate the
former Soviet bloc states, according to sources from Norway.

border with Russia, will play no role in the military bloc's
expansion. He said Russia wants to live in peace and friendship
with countries.

Yeltsin stated that Russia's door remains always open to
Norwegian enterprises and mutual cooperation in petroleum and
natural gas production could be deepened.

<HEADLINE> Germany Raps Britain's Stance on EU Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today criticized Britain for denying the Euro-Parliament's formal
presence at the coming EU intergovernmental conference and
refusing to countenance the incorporation of the Western European
Union (WEU) into EU.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that Britain's position hampered the EU's move into
integration, and expressed his disappointment at British attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Britain also refused to give more power to the Euro-Parliament
and objected WEU's becoming the military arm of the EU, both
advocated by Germany, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of EU decision-making system, however, Britain
moved closer to Germany that advocates majority rule on most
issues in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also noted that Germany, Italy, Spain and the Benelux
three of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands take similar
stand on foreign and security policies, judiciary cooperation, as
well as on streamlining the EU's decision-making machinery.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Germany wants to be "the motor of integration
with France in as many areas as possible" and tries to preserve
the Bonn-Paris coordination does not mean there is absolutely no
difference between them.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel confessed that Germany does not agree to France's
proposal on EU's employment policies reforms, noting that there
are already enough agreements in this field.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exporters to Benefit from Japan's Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 95 percent of Thai products
exported to Japan worth 185 billion baht (7.4 billion US dollars)
will benefit from Japanese tariff reductions under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules, according to the Business Economics
Department of the Thai Government.
</P>
<P>
While Japan had announced tariff cuts on 2,499 items, Japan is
committed to waiving tariffs on 30 items from Thailand, the export
volume of which has been high, Krirk-krai Jirapaet, the Business
Economics Department's director-general was quoted by today's
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are smoked rubber, natural rubber, gypsum, telephone sets
and integrated circuits. The exports of products in this group
were worth 21,800 million baht (872 million US dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Japan has also promised to waive tariffs on 71 items which
previously faced import duty collection.
</P>
<P>

baht (2.29 billion US dollars). They are color television sets,
machinery parts, rubies and cat and dog food.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Calls for Reduction of Poverty in Latin  America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The reduction of poverty in
Latin America continues to be its most important task, the German
governor of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Jurgen Hedrich, German federal minister of Economic
Development and Cooperation, was speaking during the 37th annual
meeting of IDB governors, which is assessing economic and social
progress in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He said that the gap between poverty and wealth is too wide in
most countries and especially in Latin America. He called on Latin
American countries to take steps to attack the root of the problem
in each country with support from the IDB.
</P>
<P>
The German minister asked the IDB to fulfill its special
responsibility toward small and poor countries and to ensure that
loans are made available to the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the bank should concentrate less on backing
the balance of payments and more on investments in infrastructure
and in social sectors.
</P>
<P>
He listed the German government's four priorities in its
cooperation with its Latin American partners: the reduction of
extreme poverty, the improvement of economic potential and
competitiveness, the establishment of an effective teaching system
and the conservation of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers and more than 4,000 bankers, business
executives, economists and observers from the 34 IDB member
nations are attending the three-day IDB meeting beginning
Monday. Representatives from the International Monetary Fund are

<P>
VIENNA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky said Monday he opposed strict criteria for joining the
European Unions' proposed single currency, arguing that as many
member countries as possible should be allowed to join the EU's
monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Austrian Bank for Labor and Economy, Vranitzky
said European Monetary Union (EMU) can only be brought into full
play when more EU countries accede to EMU.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky also said he opposed plans put forward by German
Finance Minister Theo Waigel to penalize members which exceed the
criteria, adding that the Maastricht Treaty allows members to do
so temporarily.
</P>
<P>
All EU members must meet the criteria of three percent
deficit-to-GDP and 60 percent public debt-to-GDP by 1997 in order
to qualify for membership of the single currency which is
scheduled to come into force in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Czech doctors and health workers
went on a nationwide strike on Monday and Tuesday, demanding the
government raise their pay and reform its health care policy.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, some 20,000 doctors and health workers from all over
the country gathered to demonstrate in Prague's city centre.
</P>
<P>
They demanded the government raise their monthly pay to
9,000-28,000 Czech Koruna (333-1,036 U.S. dollars), to match the
pay levels of other professions.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, organized by the Health Workers Union (LOK),
was the largest this year.
</P>
<P>
Czech doctors last year went on a one-day strike for higher pay,
but failed due to bad organization and inadequate support.
</P>
<P>
The country's health care system is in deep trouble as many
health insurance companies have run into debt, estimated by local
press at around 219 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Health union leaders condemned the current system of health care
financing as irrational and called for a complete overhaul.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is likely to add pressure on the government ahead of
national elections in May.

The Argentine president said today that "if the two sides believe
that my mediation is convenient, we will see in which way, to what
degree and what steps should be taken."
</P>
<P>
Menem said he was confident that mediation would succeed
because of his friendship with both the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders. He has told Interior Minister Corach, who is visiting
Israel, to convey Arafat's call for a lifting of the blockade on
the Gaza strip to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Promote Its Pasture-fed Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will launch an
international campaign next week to promote its disease-free beef,
an Argentine minister said today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will tell consumers that Argentina's cattle feed
on pasture instead of the offal of other animals which has been
found to be the cause of mad cow disease in British cattle, said
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Minister Felipe Sola.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will begin in Germany and spread to the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The decision to promote Argentine beef was made after the ban
adopted by the European Commission Monday against the sale of beef
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Argentina is now aiming to replace Britain in the beef market.
</P>
<P>
The Animal Health Service in Argentina has confirmed that
Argentina is free of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow
disease because it has taken preventive measures in animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Argentina has banned all imports of live animals,
semen and embryos from affected countries since 1990 when the
disease was first detected.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper Tuesday appeared before a legislative committee for
questioning over alleged irregularities in his 1994 presidential
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Samper was scheduled to answer more than 100 questions from
Henyne Mogollon, chairman of the House of Representatives'
Accusation Committee.
</P>
<P>
The questioning began in the morning at the presidential
residence, adjourned for lunch at noon and resumed in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mogollon said the questioning could go on until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Samper has been called before the
Accusation Committee. He was first questioned last December, also
at the presidential residence, and subsequently acquitted by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
But former Defense Minister Fernando Botero, one of Samper's
closest aides, has publicly accused the president of receiving
funds for his election campaign from the Cali drug cartel, forcing
the president to be questioned for a second time.
</P>
<P>
General Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso has filed broad
accusations against Samper before the Accusation Committee.
</P>
<P>
The charges included fund-raising from criminal activities,
excessive spending, election fraud, improper procurement of state
resources and tactics to cover up the above deeds.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Wednesday, Interior Minister Horacio Serpa,
Communications Minister Juan Manuel Turbay and Foreign Minister
Rodrigo Pardo will also submit themselves to questioning by
prosecutors in relation to the case.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been mired in a political crisis following the
accusations by the former defense minister that Samper knew about
the use of drug-related money in the election campaign that
brought him to power in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chile's integration into the
Southern American Common Market (MERCOSUR) cannot be reversed,
Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Aninat was speaking during the 37th annual meeting of
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) governors, which is
assessing economic and social progress in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chile's imminent membership in the Mercosur is
irreversible and agreement remains to be reached only on certain
technical aspects with the grouping's four member
countries: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the IDB should play an important role in
supporting efforts at hemispherical economic integration approved
by the summit of presidents of the Americas held in Miami, the
U.S., in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers and more than 4,000 bankers, business
executives, economists and observers from the 34 IDB member
nations are attending the three-day IDB meeting beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chile had an economic growth rate of 8.5 percent in 1995 and an
inflation rate just over 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean economy has been expanding for more than 12 years
with an average annual growth rate of 7 percent during the
1986-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Aninat said that the economic growth is being led by
investments and exports, adding that Chile's policy to reduce the
volatility of foreign capital is based on the promotion of
domestic savings.

<HEADLINE> Asia Tops Europe in Sugar Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Asia has replaced Europe as the
world's leading sugar consumer, said reports from the World Sugar
and Sweeteners Conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The per capita sugar consumption in Asia rose during 1988-94,
while Europe saw a slight decline.
</P>
<P>
Sugar consumption increased in all the seven-member nations of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with Singapore
ranking the top with a per capita consumption of 75.1 kilograms
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Growth in sugar consumption in developing countries, in
particular, is underpinned by the increasing demand for soft
drinks, ice cream and confectionery.
</P>
<P>
Yet in the West, sugar use is moving from direct household
consumption to food and beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
Thai sugar producers have been highly competitive in the world
market in recent years, said the reports from the ongoing event
sponsored by the Netherlands' Rabobank. During the 1980s, Thai
sugar exports rose 170 percent despite historically low prices.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is one of the leading sugar exporters in the world.
Its sugar production reached 2.11 million tons last month, nearly
up 41 percent from February in 1995. The country is expected to
gain a record 54.6 million tons of cane in the 1995-96 harvest
period.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croats Threatens to Boycott Talks on Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 26 (Xinhua) - The ruling Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) of the Bosnian Croats threatened today to boycott
talks on the reintegration of Sarajevo because of its dispute with
the Muslims over the city's future governing body.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Carl Bildt, the high representative for the
implementation of the Bosnian peace treaty, the HDZ Sarajevo
branch said that "the Muslim side keeps on imposing its will."
</P>
<P>
"Unless we get assurances that, as a constitutional people,
we will be treated equally during talks, we will cease to further
participate in the commissions," it stated.
</P>
<P>
"We are sorry to point out that all decisions are being
violated callously and on a daily basis before your eyes, and the
rights of Croats are being limited and impaired," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also complained that the future legislative body of
Sarajevo would consist of 35 Muslims, but only one Croat and one Serb.
</P>
<P>
However, the Muslim side said that the seats in the canton
assembly must be divided in line with the election results before
the war, in which the HDZ only won four percent of votes in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Suggests NATO Accept Macedonia, Albania First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia has called on NATO to
start its planned eastward expansion from its southern edges,
admitting Macedonia and Albania first.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski made the
proposal to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher when the
two met during 12 eastern European foreign ministers conference
earlier this month, reports from Macedonian capital Skopje said.
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the developments after the Dayton agreement, the
Kosovo situation and Greek-Turkish ties, it's important to
regional stability for NATO to accept Macedonia and Albania as its
members," said Frckovski.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was quoted as saying the idea was "a very
interesting suggestion." He also stressed that NATO should be the
security safeguard for the whole of Europe, and "we should not
create a second or third Europe."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said Macedonia has now fallen within the U.S.'s
sphere of interests although Russia is also exerting influence on
the country, which declared independence from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has 500 U.N. peacekeeping troops in Macedonia and the
U.S. embassy to Macedonia was officially inaugurated on March 23.

<HEADLINE> Chemists Break New Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese chemical industry
will keep pursuing the aim of creating rather than imitating, as
previously, in a bid to develop advanced science and technology of
its own.
</P>
<P>
"At least 800 million yuan or 96 million US dollars in direct
profits have resulted from the successful application of
scientific research outcomes gained over the last five years,"
said Minister of Chemical industry Gu Xiulian, noting that 80
percent of 288 priority subjects set by the central government
have achieved notable progress on schedule, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as many as 100 advanced state-of-the-art
technological results have also been applied in popularization
moves initiated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95),
putting comprehensive business earnings at three billion yuan or
361 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of these efforts, several new products have substantially
upgraded the former technological structure and products mix in
the industry by reaching the production capacity of 5,000 tons a
year.
</P>
<P>
These include polyvinyl chloride, used in the production of
building materials and cyanuric trichloride, a key catalyst used
in producing pesticides and dyestuffs.
</P>
<P>
Progress in developing farm chemicals like fodder additives,
herbicides and pesticides, dyestuff, coatings, and rubber
chemicals have also escalated the competitiveness in related
industries such as agriculture, textile, automobile, and
construction.
</P>
<P>
Another important scientific breakthrough involves phosphorus
gypsum resolving, where numerous tests as to methods have led to
efficient and clean use of massive wastes, including sulphuric
acid, cement and phosphate fertilizer, thus reducing significantly
the costs of construction and energy consumption.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Fourth-seeded Michael Chang
struggled to win a quarter-final berth at the 4.1 million
U.S. dollar Lipton Championships with a victory over Petr Korda of
Czech Republic in Key Biscayne, Florida, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-ranked Chang faced a serious challenge from the
50th-ranked Korda before winning a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 fourth-round
match.
</P>
<P>
Chang, the 1992 Lipton champion, could only keep his
first-serve efficiency 50 percent, which made him work hard to
hold serve.
</P>
<P>
But the American's consistent baseline play and astonishing
energy forced the less known Korda to throw in the towel after one
hour and 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Former world number one Stefan Edberg of Sweden ended his run
at the Lipton with a disappointing 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 fourth-round
loss to 15th-seeded Arnaud Boetsch of France.
</P>
<P>
Also moving into the men's quarter-finals were two Americans,
71st-ranked Michael Joyce and 90th-ranked Vince Spadea.
</P>
<P>
Joyce upset 11th-seeded Marc Rosset of Switzerland 6-4, 6-1
while Spadea defeated 26th-ranked Richard Krajicek of the
Netherlands 7-6 (7-1), 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in World's Worst Hit Erosion Area Win Poverty Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the world's biggest
soil erosion area are winning the battle against a problem that
has brought misery and poverty to millions of farmers for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
A large number of farmers live and work in the Loess Plateau,
noted for its chronic problem of water losses.
</P>
<P>
Now they have made headway in controlling the erosion and water
problems that have plagued their lives for so long.
</P>
<P>
Building terraces and facilities to conserve water and increase
farmland, and planting grass and trees on sloping farmland, are
the major ways that farmers in Shanxi province have used to tackle
soil erosion and water loss. They have managed to bring under
control over half of the province's loess land.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.6 billion tons of soil has been washed down into
the Yellow River from the plateau each year for many centuries,
causing serious degradation of farmland in the 640,000 sq km
plateau, covering Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu provinces and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The erosion has also led to rising of the river bed because of
silting, and devastating flooding in the middle and lower reaches
of the river in Henan and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
Shayan, a village in Zhongyang county, is one of the villages
in the plateau which fell victim to the soil erosion. About 90
percent of the villagers in Shayan did not have enough to eat and
wear in the past.
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the first villages to benefit from soil
erosion control. Farmers in the village are not only able to
secure enough food and clothing, but also double their per capita
income during the past two years, through building terraced land,
growing fruit trees, such as apple, pear and apricot in its loess
land.
</P>
<P>
The loess land in Shanxi totals 108,000 sq km, or nearly 70
percent of its total. It is also the place where most of the
province's poor people live.
</P>
<P>
To date, the land-use rights of 570,000 ha of uncultivated
hills, slopes and wasteland suitable for afforestation only, has
been auctioned for afforestation in a bid by Shanxi to harness
soil erosion and water loss.
</P>
<P>
The land has been bought by 199,000 rural families, 520
institutions and units and 3,400 government employees, and one
third has already been covered with trees.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the efforts by farmers, agricultural and water
conservancy departments of the central and provincial governments,
have been working hard to control soil erosion in the past few
decades.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank provided 150 million US dollars in the country's
largest project to control soil erosion in the plateau, involving
Shaanxi, Gansu and Shanxi provinces and Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the project has yielded economic,
ecological and social benefits, since it was launched about a year
ago with per-unit grain output doubled.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) assisted Shanxi in a soil erosion
project in three counties during the past three years, involving a
total investment of 72 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the project, the grain output in the WFP projected
area increased by 34 percent over three years ago, and the per
capita income jumped by 170 percent, and 95 percent of the poor
families have secured enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that soil erosion in 5.39 million ha has
been brought under control, accounting about half of the
soil-eroding land in the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
is to speed up the pace of its agriculture modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to promote large-scale production and
introduce advanced agricultural techniques.
</P>
<P>
An ambitious agricultural plan for the province will see the
introduction of major farming, and sideline products produced in a
specialized and intensive manner.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, with its advantageous natural conditions, has
registered a higher rural economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the total agricultural output
reached 53 billion yuan, while the per capita income of its
farmers hit 2,966 yuan, both taking a lead in the country.
</P>
<P>
To meet targets for the year 2000, the provincial government
has decided to introduce market mechanisms, and encourage the
whole society and overseas investors, to participate in
agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Protects Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province has laid a strong foundation for a good grain harvest by
sparing no efforts to protect farmland.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the province adopted a series of
economic and legal measures to strictly control the illegal
occupation of farmland for non-agricultural construction.
</P>
<P>
The province introduced 13 laws and regulations on land
protection, as well as 20 related rules.
</P>
<P>
Non-agriculture construction in the province in the period used
120,000 hectares of land, including 50,000 ha of farmland, less
than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the past few years, local departments in charge
of land protection raised nearly 900 million yuan to develop
170,000 ha of land suitable for farming.
</P>
<P>
So far, two million ha of farmland has been delimited as basic
cultivating land protection zones.
</P>
<P>
The province also strengthened checks on land
protection. During the first half of last year, the province
carried out a large scale check on idle farmland. After the checks
crops were planted on 35,000 ha of previously idle arable land.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Steady in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence of the U.S.
held steady in March, according to a report of the Conference
Board released here today.
</P>
<P>
The current reading of the Consumer Confidence Index is 97.7,
just 0.3 points below February of this year and 2.5 points under
March of Last year, according to analysts from the private
research group.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's monthly Consumer Confidence survey is
based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
"Overall confidence levels continue to follow the general trend
prevalent throughout 1995," said Edgar R. Fiedler, vice president
and economic counsellor at the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
News from the Labor Department earlier this month said that the
705,000 jobs were added in February, which rocked markets,
sparking a massive sell-off of both stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
The news has not been translated into a less apprehensive
outlook about jobs, according to Fiedler.
</P>
<P>
However, people being surveyed by the group who feel jobs are
difficult to get increased from 23.4 percent to 26.5 percent in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Fiedler said that "the uneasiness about the job market coupled
with concerns about future levels of income do not suggest that
consumers are ready to spend more freely."
</P>
<P>
Consumers remain quite positive in their assessment of current
business conditions, according to the survey by the group. The
proportion of survey participants who feel that ongoing business
conditions are "good" increased from 22.3 percent in February to
23.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Requests Departure of Mujahideen from Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia (IFOR) protested against the
presence of mujahideen today and demanded their immediate
departure.
</P>
<P>
Although a public statement was issued on the departure of
mujahideen before, "IFOR believes that foreign forces remain in
Bosnia in violation of the peace accord," IFOR spokesman Mark Van
Dyke told a press conference in Pale, administrative center of
Serb state Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic said Monday that 50 to
60 allegedly demobilized Iranian mujahideen remained in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke underlined that the deadline for the departure of
foreign fighters had expired last January 20 in line with the
Dayton accord, and that all such forces must be expelled
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic however said that Bosnian Muslims believed it would
be immoral to expell people who had been fighting on their side
and who are unable to return to their own countries.
</P>
<P>
IFOR has proof that foreign forces are still present in Bosnia
and that they are engaged in training. "This must stop," Tanjug
quoted Van Dyke as saying.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops raided on February 16 a terrorist training center
in Fojnica in central Bosnia and arrested three Iranian
instructors.
</P>
<P>
Washington has recently assessed that about 150 Iranian
fighters remained in Bosnia who might pose threats to the American
IFOR troops now stationed in Bosnia to enforce the peace accord
signed in Paris last December.

<HEADLINE> EU Ban on British Beef Is Disappointing: UK Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg said today the decision by scientists of the European
Union to maintain their call for a total ban on British beef
exports is very disappointing.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the BBC, Hogg said the decision by the EU
was +wholly disproportionate+.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Standing Veterinary Committee in a meeting in Brussels
supported the indefinite ban on British beef exports recommended
by the European Commission on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee, reconvened today at the request of British Prime
Minister John Major did not accept British assurances that its
beef was safe.
</P>
<P>
And the recommendation on a complete ban on British beef is
expected to be formally approved on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Major has convened a cabinet meeting this evening to discuss
how to deal with the EU's ban.
</P>
<P>
BBC TV predicted that partial cattle cull may be announced
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
It is reported EU Consumer Policy Commissioner Emma Bonino told
BBC Radio that the EU could provide financial help to Britain's
crisis-hit beef industry.
</P>
<P>
She promised her commission will do its best to be helpful with
UK people as to demonstrate a solidarity with Britain.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Pleased with His Norway Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) --Russian President Boris Yeltsin
expressed his satisfaction today with the results of his two-day
state visit to Norway.
</P>
<P>
While returning to Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters: "I am
pleased with the results of my visit to Norway. We succeeded to
solve many issues."
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with Prime Minister of Norway Gro Harlem
Brundtlad as "an exceptionally constructive dialogue." Instead of
two documents, as planned, four were signed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Among the signed documents are a declaration on the basis of
relations between Russia and Norway, and agreement on trade and
economic cooperation, an agreement on the reconstruction of
Russia's Pechenganichel company and an agreement to avoid double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry called the
agreement on trade and economic cooperation "one of the most
important documents ever signed between Russia and Norway," a
source of the Russian Foreign Ministry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin admitted, over the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's eastward expansion "the dialogue was tough." But
we are not in a hurry, we have agreed to consider and discuss it
together later," the Russian President noted.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that he had invited King of Norway
Harald V, Queen Sonja and Prime Minister Brundtland to visit
Russia at any convenient time.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Talks End without Reaching Truce Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- - Talks on ending civil war in
Sierra Leone closed in Cote d'Ivoire today without a permanent
truce pact to give a civilian president taking over this week a
clean start, a report from Ivorian capital Yamoussoukro said.
</P>
<P>
But an official statement issued after the two-day meeting
in Cote d'Ivoire said rebel leader Foday Sankoh had agreed to meet
president-elect Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who takes over on Friday, to
continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers seized power in 1992, accusing the elected
government of not doing enough to end the rebellion. With an
indisciplined army unable to crush rebels attacking close to the
capital by early 1995, the military offered a truce, talks and
elections as a peace package.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has shattered the economy whose mainstays were mining
for titanium, bauxite and diamonds and growing cocoa and coffee.
Over 10,000 people were killed during the civil war and half the
population of four million has been displaced.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks in Cote d'Ivoire focused on a future role for
the rebels after the army hands over power to a civilian
government, mediators said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The talks were the first between Sankoh and a Sierra Leone
Head of State since civil war started in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Ask Rehn to Resolve Issue of Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb authority today
asked U.N. special envoy for human rights Elisabeth Rehn to make
investigation on which side in Bosnia was concealing figures of
prisoners and missing persons.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Serb State Commission for Prisoner
Exchange, Dragan Bulajic, said during a meeting with Rehn at Serb
stronghold Pale that non-registration of prisoners of war was a
flagrant violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted Bulajic as saying that "nothing is
known about the fate of 2,000 Serbs reported missing" after the
Muslim-Croat offensives against Serb territories in central and
western Bosnia last autumn but there were indications that about
200 Serb soldiers were still held in prisons in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting which was also attended by families of
missing Serbs, Rehn pledged to do her utmost in the following days
in an effort to resolve the acute problem in a satisfactory way.
</P>
<P>
Both sides in Bosnia claimed that the other party was
responsible for thousands of persons missing during the three and
half year civil war that was ended last November. Muslim
government said around 8,000 Muslims were missing last summer in
the eastern enclave of Srebrenica when the Serb army attacked and
occupied the town.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Rehn left Pale for Sarajevo to discuss the
same issue with the Bosnian government officials. The human rights
envoy has been in Bosnia for several times in the past few months
to look into human rights issues such as the prisoners of war and
the missing persons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens Tough Measures Over Russian Stand  on Poultry Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States may take tough
measures in response to Russia's tough position over the import
of U.S. poultry, the Interfax news agency reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a Russian government source as saying that U.S.
Vice-President Albert Gore warned in a letter to Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that if the issue of Russian
resuming poultry imports is not resolved before the middle of
this week, Washington intends to apply U.S. laws that would set
100 percent customs duties on Imported Russian products.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side believes that proceeds from such a measure
would total 600 million U.S. dollars a year, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Gore said he was concerned about the
"contents and the tone" of the first round of Washington talks
with officials of the Russian veterinary authorities led by
Vyacheslav Avilov.
</P>
<P>
Gore stressed that Avilov had reneged on agreements reached
earlier during telephone conversations between the U.S.
Vice-President and Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Avilov refused to work with the basic provisions of the U.S.
side regarding the fulfillment of requirements in the
coordinated certificate on the quality of U.S. chicken, Gore
said, adding that Avilov wants to decide personally and
unilaterally which U.S. poultry companies are permitted and
which are not permitted to deliver their products to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Avilov is ready to unveil a "personal" list of
such exporters, Gore told Chernomyrdin in the letter, stressing
that this is unacceptable for the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Vice-President said he regretted that Russia had
sent "an incomplete team" to Washington to resolve the problem.
He noted that a more powerful Russian delegation could hold
talks on the size of the customs tariff levied on U.S. poultry
imported by Russia along with talks on meeting the requirements
of the veterinary certificate.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-U.S. "Chicken War" broke out on February 16,
when Moscow decided to stop importing of the U.S. poultry,
accusing the U.S. poultry of failing to meet Russian quarantine
demands.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Holds short-term Interest Rates Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
today decided to hold short-term interest rates steady amid
evidence that the economy has overcome a weak spot early this
year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Fed's Open Market Committee (FOMC) closed its meeting
today with a decision to leave short-term interest rates
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. central bank, Joseph Coyne, said the
Fed's monetary policy-making panel ended its regular meeting and
"there is no further announcement".
</P>
<P>
When Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared before U.S. Congress
on February 20 and 21, he was able to give the hint that he might
soon trim interest rates to spur the faltering economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But since then some positive economic reports, including a
surprising surge of job creation in February, have convinced the
Fed that no further cut of short-term rates is imminent at
present.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Department reported earlier this month that American
employers added 705,000 new jobs last month, the highest monthly
increase in 13 years, pushing unemployment rate down to 5.5
percent from 5.8 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
With more positive economic news lately, including gains in
retail and home sales and factory orders, most analysts believed
recently the Fed would not cut rates at its policy-making meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
At the last monetary policy meeting on January 31, the U.S. Fed
cut the federal fund rate--the interest rate that banks charge
among themselves on overnight loans--from 5.5 percent to 5.25
percent. It was the third cut in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Banking Committee of the U.S. Senate began a
hearing today to confirm the reappointment of Greenspan as the
chairman of U.S. Fed for next four years.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Northern Ireland To Eschew Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa hoped that all
parties involved in resolving the Northern Ireland question would
participate in negotiations and eschew violence, South African
President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet at his official Cape Town
residence in honor of visiting Irish President Mrs Mary Robinson,
Mandela said: ''We would not presume to offer any solutions, but
we make available any experience of our own that may contribute
towards a resolution of the problem by peaceful means.''
</P>
<P>
''We do know that our experience taught us that any problem
can be settled through discussion and negotiations if all the key
parties to the conflict are involved and can talk directly to
each other, and if all are willing to seek solutions in the
broader interest,'' said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
While in her speech, Mrs Robinson highlighted the historical
links between the two countries and said these went back to the
early 19th century when two Irishmen were involved in an abortive
slave rebellion in the Swartland in the Cape.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Robinson reiterated her government's commitment to help
South Africa achieve greater access to European markets.
</P>
<P>
Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Union in July.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Robinson, accompanied by her husband Nicholas Robinson,
arrived in South Africa yesterday for a four-day state visit to
the country.

<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,000 of the reported
8,000 cerebro-spinal meningitis (CSM) patients in Bauchi State,
northern Nigeria, have died.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted the Director-General
in the State Health Ministry, Alhaji Garba Lili, as saying that
the government had taken measures, including enlightenment
campaign and immunisation, to contain the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there was an initial delay in the take-off
of the immunisation exercise due to a lack of funds, but he said
that the state government finally commenced with the procurement
of 50,000 doses of vaccines worth 10 million naira (about 120,000
US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Health Ministry, in conjunction with
the World Health Organisation, have already sent a
team of medical experts to monitor the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a non-governmental organisation from France has
also sent some medical experts to offer assistance on combating
the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the government had also commenced a mass
vaccination on cholera and measles to prevent an outbreak of the
two diseases. enditem

<HEADLINE> Democratic Convention Likely to be Shortened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
considering a proposal to shorten the Democratic National
Convention to three days, the executive director of the
non-partisan host committee said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's brother, William Daley, made the
proposal, saying since there is no competition for the
presidential nomination that the convention could not be kept
interesting for four nights, said Leslie Fox of the Chicago '96
committee.
</P>
<P>
The convention is scheduled to run August 26-29 at the United
Center.
</P>
<P>
Daley made a suggestion that the convention be cut by one day
to deputy White House Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, last month and
it was passed on to Clinton, the United Press International
reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton-Gore '96 campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said they are
considering the request.
</P>
<P>
The convention committee, however, reportedly is against the
proposal but had no immediate comment.

<HEADLINE> Life-Threatening Demonstrations must Stop: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The government could not
continue tolerating demonstrations that threatened innocent
lives, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was reacting to a proposed Zulu march on Thursday in
Johannesburg to commemorate the killing of Zulu marchers outside
the African National Congress (ANC) headquarters Shell House in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Nine Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) supporters, who marched past
the ANC's Shell House headquarters on March 28 last year, were
shot dead by ANC guards outside the building.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with visiting Irish President Mary
Robinson at his official Cape Town residence, Mandela said, "very
effective precautions" would have to be taken to ensure that
there would be no repetition of the bloodbath that took place
during the 1994 Zulu march.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on reports that Zulu marchers would defy the
government's newly-imposed ban on carrying traditional weapons in
public, the president said he would not specifically confirm
whether attempts would be made to disarm them.
</P>
<P>
But police spokesman Andy Pieke said earlier in the day that
thousands of police and defense force troops would be deployed in
Johannesburg's city center and had been instructed by Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi to arrest anyone carrying
dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said in Cape Town
that marchers would be carrying "cultural accoutrements" in
demonstrations, because "that's what Zulus do."
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said there would be no problem if the authorities
tried to disarm marchers who were armed with firearms, but any
attempt to remove cultural weapons would "stretch the issue."
</P>
<P>
However, in his reaction to the issue, Deputy President F. W.
de Klerk appealed to all sides to exercise restraint to prevent
violence which could threaten lives.
</P>
<P>
"It seems it can be a very explosive situation," said de
Klerk.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 dangerous weapons act, the South African
government banned the display and possession of dangerous weapons
in public throughout the whole country. Dangerous weapons listed
in the act include spears, assagis, swords, knobkerries, pangas,
daggers, axes, clubs or batons, sharp pointed sticks ad petrol
bombs.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Ukrainian Prime
Ministers,Viktor Chernomyrdin and Yevgey Marchuk, failed to resolve
all the remaining issues between the two countries earlier today
and continue their "tete-a-tete" talks tonight, Deputy Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Krylov said.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the three-hour talks between the two
premiers in the evening, Krylov told reporters that a full-scale
treaty between Russia and Ukraine is ready for signing, although
the work on an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet has not been
completed yet.
</P>
<P>
"There remain several difficult issues, which were discussed at
the Prime Ministers' meeting in detail," he said.
</P>
<P>
Krylov tressed that the talks proceeded with difficulty. A
full-scale treaty between the two countries will not be signed
without an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it will take one or two more meetings at
various levels to resolve all the remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking Russian diplomat told reporters that the two
premiers resumed their talks tonight, with the main purpose to
agree on still unresolved problems of the Black Sea Fleet. The
meeting is building on agreements concluded by the joint
Russian-Ukrainian commission for cooperation in Moscow on March
20.
</P>
<P>
Between the two rounds of talks, Marchuk told reporters that
two of the three raft agreements had been agreed, noting that they
cover the status of the Russian Fleet in the Black Sea and the
naval base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The conditions on which the Russian Fleet would use Ukrainian
infrastructures and payment conditions remained unsettled.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian premier is expected to return to Kiev later
tonight.

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
said today that Tanzania is genuinely interested in making sure
that peace and stability return in Burundi as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He told visiting Burundi Premier Antoine Nduwayo here that
Tanzania hopes to facilitate the resumption of normal cooperation

<P>
"Let me assure you hon. Prime Minister that Tanzania has no
hidden agenda in the Burundi issue apart from the genuine desire
to assist the country's process to achieve peace and stability,"
the president said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed that the solution to the crisis in Burundi
would only be triggered by willingness of all groups in the

has expressed support for the increased efforts toward a peaceful
solution to the Sierra Leonean civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Defense Information, Fred Chijuka, was quoted

commencement of negotiation between the Sierra Leonean government
and the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) was a "good

<HEADLINE> UN Brings into Force Monitoring Mechanism on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today unanimously adopted a resolution bringing
into force a mechanism to monitor sales or supplies to Iraq of
dual-use items which could be used for the production of banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided that all states shall transmit to
the joint unit constituted by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
and the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) with the data from potential exporters and all other
relevant information when available to the states, as requested in
the mechanism on the intended sale or supply from their
territories of any items or technologies which are subject to such
notification in accordance with provisions of the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
All states shall report to the joint unit any information they
may have at their disposal or may receive from suppliers in their
territories of attempts to circumvent their mechanism or to supply
Iraq with items prohibited to Iraq under the plans for ongoing
monitoring and verification approved by Security Council
resolution 715, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that Iraq shall provide to the joint unit
of UNSCOM and the director general of the IAEA with the
notifications in respect of all items and technologies referred to
in the text of the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that the information provided through the
mechanism shall be treated as confidential and restricted to the
UNSCOM and the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been banned from having nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. The Security
Council resolutions also call for the UNSCOM and IAEA to monitor
Iraq's compliance with its obligation not to reacquire banned
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the monitoring of Iraq's indigenous dual-use
capabilities were adopted by the Security Council in October 1991
through its resolution 715 and are currently being implemented.
</P>
<P>
A UNSCOM press release said, "The mechanism adopted today
relies on notifications both by Iraq and the supplier states of
planned supplies of dual-use items to Iraq and on inspection of
those items in Iraq and monitoring at the end-user site."
</P>
<P>
Iraq will be required to make detailed declarations about its
intention to import a dual-use item before import occurs,
according to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The government of the supplier company will be required to
notify the intention to supply such items prior to export and
again at a later stage provide details confirming the export of
the item to Iraq, UNSCOM said.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism also makes provision for governments to provide
information which they may receive from within their territories
of any attempts by Iraq to acquire items which are prohibited to
it under the Security Council resolutions and the monitoring
plans, such as dedicated use items for production of banned
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The requirement for Iraq to provide notifications begins sixty
days from the adoption of the resolution. States other than Iraq
will be required to provide notifications from a date the
secretary-general and the director general of the IAEA, following
consultations with members of the Security Council and other
interested states, report to the Security Council that they are
satisfied with the preparedness of States for the effective
implementation of the mechanism," UNSCOM noted.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM also noted that the mechanism is not a licensing system.
"Iraq, and the states with which it trades, are only required to
send notifications to the joint unit in respect of items which
Iraq may legitimately import under the Security Council
resolutions and the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification.
Thus, there will be no delays or interference with legitimate
trade".

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A total ban on
anti-personnel mines is the only solution that would stigmatize
them and result in a strict enforcement regime, spokesman of the
South African Campaign to Ban Landmines Noel Stott said today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Defense Portfolio Committee in parliament, Stott
said the international community has taken a strong stance of
this kind in limiting the use of chemical and biological weapons.
The same should apply for landmines.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was a signatory to the 1980 United Nations
Inhumane Weapons Convention and would be one of the 50 states
attending the review Conference on the Landmine Protocol in
Geneva in April.
</P>
<P>
This was a "last chance to ban landmines," added Stott.
</P>
<P>
The South African delegation would, among others, recommend
the meeting abandon its current course of discussion which
focuses on technology aimed at improving anti-personnel mines and
call for a discussion of a total ban on production and use of
anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which was responsible for planting millions of
landmines in neighboring states during the apartheid era,
declared an indefinite moratorium on their sale and export in
1994.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 countries worldwide supported a total ban on all
anti-personnel mines. They are Austria, Belgium, Cambodia,
Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Ireland, Malaysia,
Mexico, Mozambique, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Peru,
Philippines, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay.
