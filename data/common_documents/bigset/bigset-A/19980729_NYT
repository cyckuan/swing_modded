THEY GET ALONG LIKE CATS AN DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Th pink cat, Mickey, likes to trifle with the bird dogs while
they eat.
</P>
<P>
   It is not recommended behavior, since Pete and Bear regard
mealtime as an occasion of profound seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   They look through the back door glass until they see me appear
from the basement with their filled bowls. Then great joy overtakes
them, and they do a kind of whirling dance until the door is
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the pink cat, hearing the rattle of food being
portioned out, comes from wherever he's been to wait for them in
the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   He weighs at most five pounds, they 40-some. In all other ways
they are brave creatures, bold and tireless afield. In Mickey's
presence, though, their alarm is pitiful to see.
</P>
<P>
   The canned food is mixed with the dry, and the bowls are put
down side by side. They begin to eat. Then Mickey advances to lie
between them.
</P>
<P>
   He reaches out a paw to lightly touch Pete's nearest hind foot.
The dog moves a bit to the side. The foot is touched again,
provoking another retreat. Soon Pete is revolving around his food
bowl like the Earth around the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   It must amuse the little cat to find how slight an effort is
required to set so large a beast in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he walks directly under the dog, causing Pete's
chewing _ possibly even his heart _ to stop. Or he will shoulder
close and press his cheek against the dog's, intending to share the
ration.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the pup just backs away in despair. He's hungry, but
eating isn't worth the trouble and the risk.
</P>
<P>
   So Mickey has to be picked up and carried to another room,
allowing the dog to be nourished in order that he may lead the way
to quail when autumn comes.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately the cat is back, though, turning his attention to
Bear, who has a pricklier nature.
</P>
<P>
   The cat moves forward one step at a time _ just close enough to
elicit a growl. Bear's tail is wagging, but the front end of him is
making that unpleasant sound.
</P>
<P>
   Causing the growl is the whole point, of course. It confirms
that Mickey has achieved exactly that proximity which will produce
the greatest possible anxiety, without provoking a charge. He lies
down precisely there, watching the dogs wolf down whatever of their
breakfast is left.
</P>
<P>
   Bear used to be a finicky eater, dawdling over his food,
sometimes looking first at his bowl, then up at me, resentful as
some peasant faced with another year of nothing but potatoes and
cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   But now Bear doesn't loiter.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, out of these dramas at the breakfast hour has
come an understanding that, while not quite a friendship yet, is on
the way to being one.
</P>
<P>
   In the evenings, when food isn't the issue and all the various
shapes and species of us are together in the bedroom _ no great
tension can be detected.
</P>
<P>
   Five-pound Mickey still can herd the pups around the room pretty
much as he likes. If he decides to occupy a chair that one of them
prefers to sleep in, there's no hope of reclaiming it.
</P>
<P>
   The one who feels misused just whines piteously and finds
another place.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise there's a fair amount of nose-touching and
strategic sniffing. It will not be very long, I think, before we
find two of them (ITAL)sharing(END ITAL) a chair.
</P>
<P>
   That will not happen with the older, larger cats. (ITAL)You're
dogs,(END ITAL) their manner says. (ITAL)We're a different family
of creatures, and we're all better off just keeping our
distance.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   But little Mickey seems not to put much stock in such
distinctions. He's breaking new ground _ crossing lines, making new
friends, which always entails a bit of risk. And courage makes all
the difference.

   Dawson quiet &QL; 
about role in &QL; 
Comets' birth
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CARROLL Dawson won't talk about the birth of the Comets. All he'll
tell you is he just got ``real lucky,'' because he doesn't know a
darn thing about women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true. But basketball is basketball, and Dawson, a
lifelong honor student of thump-thump, knows a player when he sees
one.
</P>
<P>
   And a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson isn't much for taking credit. Never has been. He's the
consummate back-room kind of guy. The truth is, however, that he
quietly helped nurture Rudy Tomjanovich into one of the NBA's elite
coaches, and the groundwork he laid for the Comets was so
incredibly solid that they may already be the finest women's team
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, name a better one. You can't. The USA's 1996 Olympic
gold medalists? While they clearly had more star power, they didn't
have anywhere near the worldliness or the experience, much less the
cohesiveness, the Comets have developed through winning the WNBA's
first title and an encore season that thus far has been a
hard-to-equal sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fine folks in Columbus, Ohio, would probably cast a
bunch of votes for their two-time American Basketball League
champions, the Quest never reeled off 14 victories in a row or
built a 19-1 record like the Comets have. The Quest has its stars,
to be sure, but it doesn't have stars quite like Cynthia Cooper and
Sheryl Swoopes, or anything approaching the Comets' depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets are so amazingly good, they can look godawful for the
longest while against a solid, fired-up foe like Phoenix and still
make winning look simple in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can do it the way we did it tonight,'' coach Van
Chancellor said, ``I guess that means we're a pretty good
basketball team. I began to think we weren't ever going to score.
But we've got players who make plays, who step up when they have
to. That's how we're doing what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets fell behind 9-0 Tuesday night, missing seven shots in
a row at the outset before Cooper _ who else? _ drove the lane and
flipped in a nifty little lefthanded layup with more than six
minutes gone. And they wouldn't finally go in front until Cooper _
who else? _ drained a 3-pointer with 2.4 seconds left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury hung around awhile longer, making a nuisance of
itself, but the Comets would have none of such insolence and wound
up on top 72-62, rewarding the rowdy sellout crowd of 16,285 for
its boisterous support.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-and-one. Fourteen in a row. And SRO. In a word, wow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely proud of what Van and his team have
accomplished,'' Dawson will say, but that's it. End of interview.
Somebody else is going to have to tell us about the hundred hours
of video C.D. watched before concluding that Cooper, 34 and almost
forgotten in America because she had been playing elsewhere for so
long, was a franchise player, the player Houston absolutely had to
have.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Dawson who presented Coop a ceremonial ball
before the game Wednesday night, honoring her as the league's first
1,000-point scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody else is also going to have to tell us about how C.D.
nearly burned up his VCR, then his phone line, learning everything
he could about Chancellor before he concluded that Van was the,
gulp, man to pull everything together.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson tried to hire a prominent female coach, as per the
strongly worded ``advice'' coming down from the WNBA's higher-ups.
He called Texas Tech's Marsha Sharp and Tennessee's Pat Summitt,
among others, but they weren't interested. Chancellor, a veritable
institution himself at Ole Miss, was a tad skeptical as well, but
his ego was still in check once he committed.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't come to Houston intending to steal the Rockets'
thunder, or trying to one-up Rudy T. It has, well, just sort of
happened that way of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play hard, and they practice just as hard,'' Dawson says
of the Comets. ``You watch Van work them, and it's not surprising
what kind of season they're having.''
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise is they aren't 20-0. Yes, Phoenix stole one
early out there, but the Comets have replied with victories at
America West and at Compaq Center. Perhaps the Mercury will get
another shot in the playoffs _ coach Cheryl Miller has already
predicted a Phoenix win _ but the Comets would have no reason to
fear another such planetary encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In the solar system of women's hoops, they are hardly a fleeting
interloper. If anything, they have become the sun itself. So ol'
C.D. should feel proud of himself, too. The Comets are very much
his baby, even if he politely refuses to concede paternity.

Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky received a sweeping grant of
immunity from federal prosecution Tuesday, in exchange for a
promise to testify that she and President Clinton had agreed to
deny that they had a sexual relationship, two lawyers familiar with
her account said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky did deny under oath that they had
a sexual relationship. But in discussions leading to the immunity
deal, Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors this week that she and the
president had a sexual relationship that began in 1995. The
25-year-old former White House intern now admits she lied in the
sworn affidavit she submitted in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
suit in January.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers said Tuesday that Ms. Lewinsky had indicated
to prosecutors that the president discussed with her hypothetical
explanations that would help them keep their relationship private.
In one aside, two lawyers with knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's proposed
testimony said, the president told her: If there are two people in
a room and something happens and they both deny it, there is no way
to prove it. Ms. Lewinsky has said that Clinton told her that in
mid-December, after she was listed on the witness list in the Jones
case but before she had received a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions were crucial to reaching the broad immunity deal
with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr announced Tuesday. Ms.
Lewinsky pledged her ``full and truthful testimony'' in exchange
for freedom from the threat of prosecution. Ms. Lewinsky's mother,
Marcia Lewis, received a similar grant of immunity Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the immunity arrangement, Ms. Lewinsky is prepared to
testify that the president told her that he planned to deny a
relationship and if they both denied it, no one would know the
truth, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is also prepared to say that the president
encouraged her to say that her many visits to the White House after
she lost her job there in 1996 were to see Betty Currie, Clinton's
private secretary, and not the president himself, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's proposed testimony contradicts Clinton's
assertions in public and under oath about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after the alleged affair became public, Clinton
emphatically denied in a public statement having sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky or encouraging her or anyone else to lie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton did not comment in public about the immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Mike McCurry, said Clinton told aides he was
``pleased that things are working out'' for Ms. Lewinsky. The
president had nothing more to say about the matter, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal _ which protects Ms. Lewinsky from virtually
any possibility of prosecution except for perjury in her future
grand jury testimony _ poses serious problems for Clinton if he has
been less than truthful in his previous public and sworn
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's assertions go beyond the question of whether they
engaged in some form of sexual behavior and reach the marrow of
Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is seeking to learn whether Clinton or close advisers
committed perjury, witness tampering or obstruction of justice in
seeking to conceal his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers familiar with her account say Ms. Lewinsky is
prepared to testify that she wrote the ``talking points,'' a
three-page document that she gave to her colleague, Linda Tripp,
that were intended to influence Ms. Tripp's testimony in the Jones
case. She also will testify that no one at the White House helped
her prepare them, the lawyers said. White House aides expressed
jubilation at this development, saying that news accounts and
allies of Starr had said the talking points would form the
foundation of an obstruction of justice case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly refused to discuss Ms. Lewinsky's
potential grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity deal came after months of fitful negotiations
between Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers and lawyers from Starr's office.
William Ginsburg, the California medical malpractice lawyer who
represented Ms. Lewinsky in the early months of the inquiry, openly
mocked Starr's prosecution team and all but dared them to indict
her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family dismissed Ginsburg in early June and her
new legal team of experienced Washington defense lawyers quickly
opened talks with Starr that led to Tuesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Ms. Lewis, whose grand jury testimony
last winter was suspended after she broke down on the witness
stand, also reached an immunity deal with prosecutors Tuesday, said
her lawyer, Billy Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants Ms. Lewis' complete story because Ms. Lewinsky
shared with her mother many details of her dealings with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis' lawyer sought immunity to protect her from any
charges that might arise from advice she gave her daughter about
how to respond to the Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, McCurry said in a testy and abbreviated briefing for
reporters, was not concerned about Ms. Lewinsky's impending
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her lawyer said that she's going to give complete and truthful
testimony and if she does, that should present no problem to the
president, obviously,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that he believed Clinton's earlier denials of a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Lewinsky contradicts those denials, McCurry was asked, is
she lying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would presume so, yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's account of her conversations with Clinton in
which she said he urged her to deny a sexual relationship recall an
account told by Gennifer Flowers in the 1992 presidential campaign.
Ms. Flowers said that Clinton told her to deny a relationship if
reporters asked and he would do the same and no witnesses could
contradict them.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denials, Clinton admitted in his January
deposition in the Jones case that he had had sex once with Ms.
Flowers, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, remained in
negotiations with prosecutors over how the president would respond
to a subpoena for his testimony. White House officials and others
involved in the inquiry indicated that Clinton is seeking to delay
his testimony for several weeks, citing the heavy demands of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, seeking to justify the president's desire for delay,
said, ``He's going to be a busy guy. He's the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not return telephone calls seeking comment. He was
seen at the federal courthouse this afternoon but the reason for
his visit could not be learned. ``It's under seal so we're all in
Kabuki-land,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that has become familiar since the sensational
sex-and-perjury allegations became public in January, reporters
gathered outside the office of Ms. Lewinsky's lead lawyer, Plato
Cacheris, in downtown Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, arriving in a taxi, was escorted through the
surging throng by Judy Smith, her spokeswoman. Ms. Lewinsky arrived
in Washington this morning after spending five hours with several
of Starr's deputies in Manhattan on Monday reviewing her proposed
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris and his co-counsels, Jacob Stein and Nathaniel
Speights, reached the immunity agreement with the office of
independent counsel Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 p.m., Cacheris walked to the bank of microphones
outside his office and delivered a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as counsel for Monica Lewinsky,'' Cacheris said, ``reached
an agreement today which provides that Ms. Lewinsky's full and
truthful testimony is the basis for the OIC's grant of full
transactional immunity from prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Transactional immunity is a rarely granted full guarantee that a
witness cannot be prosecuted for any crime related to the matter
under investigation, in exchange for full disclosure. But the
witness could face perjury charges and a revocation of immunity if
a prosecutor believes that the witness has lied about a material
fact in sworn testimony.

 WASHINGTON: sworn testimony.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's family is happy that she finally reached an
immunity deal with prosecutors after six months of uncertainty
about her status. There was frequent speculation that prosecutors
would seek to indict her on perjury charges if she did not offer to
testify fully on her relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's parents and stepfather are ``relieved that their
daughter is out of harm's way,'' Ms. Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse Tuesday, Ms. Tripp, onetime friend of
Ms. Lewinsky, who tape-recorded 20 hours of their conversations,
appeared before the grand jury for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coughter, Ms. Tripp's spokesman, said that she is
expected to return to the grand jury Wednesday, perhaps for the
last time. Coughter said that he interpreted the immunity agreement
between Ms. Lewinsky and Starr as ``corroboration of Linda's
testimony before the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Ms. Tripp as saying, ``I am encouraged by this
development. It now appears that Monica Lewinsky is prepared to
tell at least a portion of the truth. I encourage her and all other
witnesses not only to tell the truth, but to tell the full truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Three uniformed officers of the Secret Service also gave
testimony; several other officers have been called to appear
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is apparently finished taking testimony from Larry
Cockell, the plainclothes agent in charge of the Secret Service
detail that guards the president.
</P>
<P>
   Cockell, who removed himself from the protective detail after he
was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury three weeks ago,
returned to the job Tuesday night. He accompanied Clinton to two
political events in Washington as lead agent.

TESTS LIFT HOPES FOR OFFICER SHOT IN HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though a bullet remained lodged in his brain, the
police officer shot in a Staten Island housing project Sunday
showed some encouraging signs during tests Tuesday, and doctors
began to express cautious optimism about his condition.
</P>
<P>
   As the tense vigil continued Tuesday for the wounded officer,
the 17-year-old ex-convict being held in the case was arraigned on
charges including the attempted murder of the officer and the
murder of another man two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gerard Carter, 28, remained in critical but stable
condition Tuesday at the St. Vincent's Campus of the Sisters of
Charity Medical Center on Staten Island. Doctors had initially
given Carter only a 50 percent chance of survival, but hospital
officials said Tuesday that they were heartened that he had
survived the first 24 hours. But they added that the next few days
would be crucial in determining whether he would suffer serious
brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Carter exhibited signs of basic brain activity during a series
of tests performed Tuesday: his pupils dilated when doctors shone a
light into his eyes, and his reflexes worked when they pricked his
fingers and toes with pins. ``It's still too early to give any
prognosis, but we have every reason to be optimistic.'' said Bill
McCann, a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were most concerned that damage could be caused by the
swelling of the brain, which occurs after a serious injury like a
gunshot wound, McCann said. To reduce and contain the swelling,
they removed dead brain tissue and used a catheter to drain excess
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The young man accused of shooting him, Shatiek Johnson, was
arraigned in Staten Island Criminal Court on charges of the
attempted murder of the officer and of second-degree murder in the
July 16 slaying on Staten Island of Eric Trotman, 20, who was shot
more than 15 times in the head and torso.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carter, who was patrolling the West Brighton Houses on Sunday
night in a van with his partner, Officer Eric Storch, had
recognized Johnson on a path as someone detectives wanted to
question in the Trotman case, police said. After driving past him
and checking a picture that was distributed to many officers in the
precinct, the officers returned to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could, police said, the man opened fire through the
windshield of the van, striking Carter in the temple. Storch
returned fire but did not hit the gunman, who then fled.
</P>
<P>
   After an intense manhunt and a five-hour armed standoff, Johnson
was arrested Monday morning, hiding in a closet of an apartment in
a building adjacent to the crime scene. Later that morning, two law
enforcement officials said, Johnson signed a statement admitting
the shooting of Carter. That afternoon, he signed another statement
admitting the shooting of Trotman, according to the law enforcement
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's lawyer, Alex Shulman, acknowledged that his client had
signed the statements but said he would argue to have them ruled
inadmissible in court because, he said, Johnson had initially been
denied his right to see a lawyer. Shulman said Johnson told him
that he had asked to speak with a lawyer before being interrogated
but was never given one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted a lawyer, but they made believe they didn't
hear it or they ignored it,'' Shulman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to law enforcement officials who have seen the
statements, both begin with the statement, ``I have been advised of
my rights'' _ a reference to Miranda rights, which give suspects
the right not to speak with detectives and to confer with their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Johnson tried to portray the shooting as an
act of self-defense in the statement, contending that he saw Storch
drawing his service pistol and that he wanted to be the one to
shoot first. He claimed in the statement that he had been aiming at
Storch, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being sought in the murder case, Johnson was
wanted on two other arrest warrants: officials said he had skipped
a day of community service he had been sentenced to after being
convicted of subway fare-beating in Times Square, and he had
stopped seeing his parole officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he was wanted,'' said Chief Assistant District
Attorney David Lehr. ``The police had been to his house a number of
times on fare beating and the parole violation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's statement about the Trotman case, he said he fired
his gun only after Eric Trotman pointed a gun at him, the law
enforcement officials said. Trotman was shot between 15 and 18
times, the police said. No guns were recovered at the scene, they
said.

JURORS URGED TO SILENCE BRAWLEY ADVISERS THROUGH LARGE DAMAGE
AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Shortly before the jurors began discussing
Tuesday what damages to set in the Tawana Brawley defamation case,
the lawyer for the plaintiff urged them to punish the three Brawley
advisers with an award large enough to ``shut them up.''
</P>
<P>
   After the summation from the lawyer, William Stanton, and legal
instructions from the judge, the jurors deliberated for about three
hours before they asked for some testimony to be reread and for
certain documents to be supplied in the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   The court was adjourned without a verdict just after 3 p.m.
Deliberations are to continue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton employed the staccato style he has used throughout the
eight-month trial, implying that it was obvious that there should
be a large assessment against the three Brawley advisers, the Rev.
Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said the advisers had subjected his client, Steven
Pagones, to humiliation, mental stress and physical suffering by
falsely asserting that he had raped Ms. Brawley in 1987. ``The only
way you can shut them up,'' he said, ``is by returning a verdict in
a large sum of money that will teach them a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors are considering what compensatory damages to award
Pagones, a former assistant district attorney, for such losses as
pain and suffering. In his instructions, Justice S. Barrett Hickman
of state Supreme Court said the jurors were required to award him
at least $1 in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the jurors are weighing whether to assess punitive
damages, which are intended to punish wrongdoers and to discourage
others from engaging in similar conduct. Hickman said they could
award any amount they deemed appropriate, including no punitive
damages. In his complaint, Pagones is seeking $150 million in
damages, but Hickman did not specify any upper limit in his
instructions to the jurors today.
</P>
<P>
   The final arguments in the case were laced with the
argumentative oratory that has typified the long trial. But the
demeanor of the lawyers suggested exhaustion more than efforts at
exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Maddox completing the summation that he began
on Monday afternoon. He contended that he should not be punished
merely for expressing his ``beliefs'' about Pagones. He sought to
evoke the spirit of the country's Founding Fathers in asking the
jurors to preserve American liberties by giving Pagones only
nominal damages.
</P>
<P>
   And he insulted Pagones, although not with the energy he
displayed months ago. Maddox argued, for example, that Pagones did
not suffer stomach irritation, as he claimed, because he was
anxious over the advisers' public accusations. Instead, Maddox
theorized, it was because Pagones consumes too much food. ``He
doesn't eat to live,'' Maddox said. ``He lives to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stanton took the lectern, his first move was an effort to
show that Maddox was still hurling gratuitous insults at Pagones.
As lawyers do at the start of a summation, Stanton greeted the
judge, his opponents and the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he greeted Pagones. ``And Fatso,'' he said politely.

MORE SYRINGES AND VIALS FOUND ON BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lifeguards found more needles and crack vials on
Rockaway Beach Tuesday, prompting city officials to declare New
York City's longest beach off-limits to swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Department officials said that the flotsam appeared to be
drug paraphernalia and not illegally dumped medical waste. And
while city officials were still investigating the sources of the
syringes and vials, three theories had emerged Tuesday, said Henry
Stern, the parks commissioner: that they had been lying on the
ocean floor and had been stirred by recent choppy waters and winds;
that they came from the city's sewer system, or, least likely, from
recent illegal dumping.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Stern stressed that the amount of waste was
relatively minor; nothing of the magnitude, certainly, of a
situation in the late 1980s, when syringes, hazardous medical waste
and dead rats washed ashore in Rockaway and at several other city
beaches, sometimes for days on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small thing,'' Stern said of the current incident,
``but we have zero tolerance for beach defects. We will open the
beaches as soon as the coast is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five days, officials have recovered 53 hypodermic
needles, 92 crack vials, assorted needle caps and an intravenous
pouch over a 5-mile stretch, from Beach 30th Street to Beach 130th
Street, with the bulk in the Beach 90s.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, city officials on Monday closed sections of
Rockaway Beach. After cleaning up the beach Tuesday morning, city
officials reopened it to swimmers for a few hours, but quickly
closed all 6.4 miles of the beach when lifeguards spotted more
syringes and crack vials.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, lifeguards are expected to follow the same
pattern: Head to the beach at 5 a.m., inspect the area, clean it up
if necessary, and determine whether the water is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The beach closure Tuesday was the first caused by needles
washing ashore since 1988, when Rockaway Beach, Fire Island and all
the municipal beaches in Brooklyn and on Staten Island were closed
for days, or weeks in some cases, because of medical waste and
sewage that had washed ashore. The scare was so widespread that
some beaches in New Jersey and Connecticut were closed for several
weeks as well.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the garbage and medical waste that washed ashore was
later traced to the Fresh Kills Landfill on the western shore of
Staten Island. In addition, driftwood, plastics and other items
floated from New York Harbor and landed on New Jersey beaches or
Long Island's South Shore.
</P>
<P>
   For a time thereafter, many swimmers were reluctant to venture
into the water _ or even to go near the beach, fearful that they
might come into contact with HIV-infected materials. As a result,
businesses tethered to the summer beach economy lost millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact was felt in other ways, too. The closures
received widespread national attention, and quickly became a
metaphor for all that was perceived to be wrong with New York City
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the amount of beach debris has declined somewhat,
said Cynthia Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, a
coalition of groups dedicated to cleaning the waters off New York
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of accidents involving the needles
that have washed up at Rockaway in the last five days, said Ed
Skyler, a spokesman for the Parks Department. Even so, the
Department of Sanitation is testing the debris, and the Department
of Health is encouraging anyone who gets pricked by a needle to get
a tetanus shot.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether people will follow that advice.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, after the lifeguards went off duty at 6 p.m., at
least a dozen people played in the strong surf of the Beach 90th
Street area, where most of the detritus had been found. Some people
said they had not seen signs indicating that swimming was
forbidden; others said that they could not resist a dip on a warm,
humid day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care,'' said Kelly Tien, 25, of Valley Stream,
N.Y., who was with her 3-year-old son, Aaron. ``I've loved the
beach ever since I was a little girl, and it doesn't matter if
there's medical waste. I'll still come and swim.''

LACKING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, REPUBLICANS SCRAP WHITMAN'S GAS-TAX
RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman was dealt a major setback
Tuesday as members of her own party officially scuttled her plan to
raise the state's gasoline tax to pay for new mass transit and
highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   With traffic congestion a significant concern of voters in the
state, Whitman had made increasing spending for transportation a
top goal of her second term. But in the end, her efforts to push
through a 4-cent-a-gallon rise in the tax over three years failed
mainly because she had helped bolster anti-tax sentiment in New
Jersey by emphasizing tax cuts in her first term.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow came late Tuesday afternoon, when Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem County, formally announced that he
had canceled a scheduled vote on the proposed tax increase because
of a lack of bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between the Whitman administration and Republican
lawmakers to raise the gasoline tax began to fall apart Monday when
Democrats in the Assembly surprised their Republican colleagues by
banding together to oppose the tax increase. After they reiterated
their position Tuesday, Collins said that Assembly Republicans
would not support a tax increase alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have indicated again that there would be no
support,'' Collins said in a statement. ``It is unfortunate that
partisan politics has scuttled this important legislative
initiative and placed future transportation infrastructure projects
and jobs in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Anthony Impreveduto, D-Secaucus, who led the debate
on the gas tax for his party, said no Democrats would change their
minds before Thursday. ``It is over,'' he said. ``It is a done
deal, as far as we are concerned. My Democratic caucus is
steadfastly opposed to increased taxes at this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans control the Legislature and Collins said
that he personally approved of the tax increase, some Republican
lawmakers were reluctant to support any tax increase because they
feared reprisals from Democrats during next year's re-election
campaigns.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democrats pointed out that they were badly punished by New
Jersey's tax-weary voters, losing the Legislature in 1991 and the
governorship in 1993, after supporting Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8
billion package of tax increases in 1990 without bipartisan
support. And Democrats said they were not going to provide cover
for their Republican colleagues who have been branding Democrats as
tax-and-spenders for years.
</P>
<P>
   What cemented their opposition, some Democratic lawmakers said,
were comments that Whitman made over the weekend at the Republican
National Committee meeting in New York. At the meeting, Whitman
told her fellow Republicans from across the country that the party
needed to emphasize its commitment to cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that she is saying that Republicans need to
reduce taxes, she is asking us to increase a tax on gasoline in New
Jersey,'' Impreveduto said. ``We're not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was trying to win legislative approval before Aug. 3 to
meet a constitutional deadline to put a referendum on the November
ballot, asking voters whether they wanted to dedicate motor vehicle
taxes to transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman had put together an unusual coalition of labor leaders,
environmental advocates and business owners to help lobby
legislative support for her plan. She had initially recommended a
5-cent-a-gallon annual increase to increase spending for
transportation projects and an additional 2-cent-a-gallon increase
for her plan to preserve 1 million acres of undeveloped land over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers said the 5-cent-a-gallon increase, which would
have raised state taxes on gasoline to 21.5 cents a gallon from
14.5 cents, was too high. And they opposed using any gasoline tax
revenues for her open space proposal.
</P>
<P>
   To address their objections, Whitman agreed with Republican
legislative leaders to scale back her proposal. They agreed to
raise the gasoline tax a penny a gallon this year, 2 cents in 2000
and another penny in 2001. Even so, there remained some opposition
in the Assembly. But Senate lawmakers said that they were prepared
to approve the tax increase if it first won passage in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also abandoned using a gasoline tax increase to buy
undeveloped land and agreed instead to borrow up to $100 million a
year over the next 10 years to buy the 1 million acres. The
borrowing plan would be paid for with existing sales tax revenues
over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the borrowing proposal to preserve open spaces was
approved by the Assembly's Appropriations Committee on Monday, its
fate remains uncertain in the Legislature on Thursday, lawmakers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Tuesday that she was disappointed by the recent
turn of events but that she remained hopeful that her proposal
would still be considered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very hopeful that at the end of the day there will be
enough Democrats that will come across and vote for this because
this isn't a political issue,'' she said. ``It's not something to
be used by one party against another. I'm the tax-cutting governor.
I've cut taxes 17 times. I came into office talking about cutting
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talking about a tax increase, but there are times
when you need substantive dollars to be able to accomplish
something that is very important for the future of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration's five-year transportation plan, the
gasoline tax increase would have allowed the administration to
increase spending to $900 million from $700 million this year for
transportation projects. Spending would have been at $900 million
the next year, and then increase to $950 million a year over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are passing up is the opportunity to increase the pace
and expand the number of projects that need to be addressed,'' said
Pete McDonough, the chief spokesman for Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Democratic Leader Joseph Doria argued that the Whitman
administration could use part of the state's $850 million budget
surplus to cover the cost of expanding transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Whitman did not help her lobbying efforts with
her comments over the weekend. ``The actions and comments of the
Whitman administration in recent weeks has poisoned the well of any
potential Democratic support of a gas tax hike,'' he said.

SCHUMER SAYS D'AMATO IS NO FRIEND OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an assault on what has been the heart of Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato's political appeal, Rep. Charles Schumer challenged
the image of D'Amato as an advocate of New York on Tuesday,
asserting that he regularly voted with Republicans against New York
interests on issues ranging from crime to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, trying to find an appeal that will elevate himself in
the three-way Democratic primary, described D'Amato as an
undistinguished incumbent who had sat by as fellow Republican
leaders curbed programs that benefit the Northeast. The Brooklyn
congressman, in an early-morning speech to a group of young
Democrats, asserted that D'Amato's votes in the Senate would be his
downfall as he sought to win a third term this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to let every voter in New York know about your
record in Washington,'' Schumer declared, addressing an absent
D'Amato. ``You can count on that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said D'Amato was ``playing the champion for New York when in
reality he was working and voting against New York interests.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, one of
Schumer's opponents in the primary, offered a somewhat different
prescription for unseating the senator. Green said the key to
Democratic victory was to remind voters aggressively of what he
described as the senator's history of ethical lapses, while
attacking his voting record at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Schumer had argued that there was limited benefit
to questioning D'Amato's ethics, since voters were familiar with
the issue, and that Democrats would win by spotlighting D'Amato's
record. But Green's attack seemed to have succeeded in changing
Schumer's mind somewhat: he peppered his speech with questions
about D'Amato's ethics as he tried to combine the two themes.
``Even if he did deliver for New York, his ethics alone would be
repulsive enough to deserve defeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato declined to comment on Schumer's comments. But the
senator's spokesman, Harvey Valentine, said: ``It's unfortunate
that Mr. Schumer has nothing positive to say to the people of New
York, and so he's attacking Senator D'Amato. It's getting
tiresome.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The third candidate in the Democratic primary, Geraldine
Ferraro, the former Queens congresswoman and vice presidential
nominee, continued to keep a notably low public profile,
notwithstanding her advisers' assertions that she would be
campaigning more aggressively with the Sept. 15 primary
approaching. Her aides said she was spending this week raising
money to pay for television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   There were new signs of friction between Schumer and Green on
Tuesday, this time over what Congress should do to protect the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Green, echoing President Clinton, said that any national
budgetary surplus should go toward shoring up Social Security, and
that there should be no discussion of other uses of a surplus until
that is done.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has also said the surplus should be directed to helping
Social Security. But as he has campaigned, he has repeatedly
invoked the surplus as a source of funds to pay for programs he has
proposed, including more spending on education and making college
tuition tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Tuesday that Schumer was being misleading in saying
he could do both; Schumer's aides said he had made clear that
Social Security was the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   In making his case against D'Amato before a group of young
Democrats known as the Democratic Leadership for the 21st Century,
Schumer pointed to D'Amato's opposition to the Brady Law, which
imposed a waiting period on the purchase of handguns, and his
opposition to the ban on assault weapons as examples of positions
on criminal law that he said were out of step with most New
Yorkers. He noted that D'Amato supported the Republican leadership
in pushing huge cuts in Medicaid and Medicare that would have
particularly hurt New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Pothole is a myth,'' Schumer said, referring to the
nickname the senator has embraced as a way of telegraphing his
concern with issues of local concern. ``Senator Pothole is a
fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer departed from his text to argue against the contention
that D'Amato was a skillful politician who was invulnerable to this
type of attack because he moderates his positions as elections
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a notion _ it's usually held, when it's held at all,
in elite circles _ and that is that Al D'Amato is a brilliant
politician because he switches his votes around election time,''
Schumer said. ``This is not political brilliance of any kind. It is
crass chicanery.''

NEW YORK CITY GIVEN MONTH TO LIST HAZARDOUS SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following a state court's ruling that New York City
does not properly inspect and maintain its schools, a judge in
Manhattan has given city officials 30 days to list all schools with
hazardous conditions and to create a plan to fix them promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The order, issued late Monday by Justice Barry Cozier of state
Supreme Court, raised the possibility that the board of education
would be publicly identifying hazardous buildings just before they
open for the start of school in September. In the past, such
hazards have included things like falling bricks, masonry and
plaster.
</P>
<P>
   But board officials said Tuesday that any hazards would be
eliminated by the first day of school. ``We would not leave a
condition that could harm a human being,'' said Chiara Coletti, the
board's public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   She said that conditions in some schools were still unrepaired
but that school officials had taken steps to keep them from
endangering students. If any more hazards are found, she said, ``we
may have to put up netting'' or sidewalk bridging if ``the job is
just too big to complete by the beginning of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a number of accidents, including one in which a
16-year-old girl was killed by a falling brick, drew public
attention to efforts to fix the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The city has yet to say whether it will appeal the decision.
Tuesday afternoon, city lawyers said they were studying the order.
</P>
<P>
   Cozier's order also covered nonhazardous building code
violations and set a 90-day deadline for the city to create a plan
to make its inspections and repairs a continuing process.
</P>
<P>
   The order results from a 1994 lawsuit by the city teachers'
union, the United Federation of Teachers, which maintained that the
board had failed to keep school buildings safe for students and
teachers. In March, the union won a strong ruling in which the
judge scathingly criticized the ``sorry state'' of city school
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The union's suit had cited a 1996 memo by Robert Buxbaum, the
board's former director of school facilities, saying there were
hazardous conditions in 237 school buildings, about one in five.
Since the memo was written, board officials have said, the hazards
have been addressed by emergency measures _ including sidewalk
bridges _ and are no longer an immediate danger to students.
</P>
<P>
   The poor condition of city schools is a result of decades of
deferred maintenance in which aging buildings were allowed to
deteriorate. More than half the 1,200 city school buildings were
built over 50 years ago, and many remain in bad condition even
though the city and state have spent billions on repairs to city
schools in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The March decision on the union lawsuit also ordered the union
and the city to work out a plan for inspecting and repairing the
buildings. Tuesday, union officials complained that the city had
not been cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary when the City of New York has to be sued
to keep its schools free from hazards and in good repair,'' said
Randi Weingarten, president of the union, at a news conference.
``It's even sadder when, in the face of a court decision affirming
its responsibility to do so, the city continues to drag its feet
rather than take the most common-sense steps to assure the safety
of one million schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said she hoped the city would not appeal the judge's
order, saying it would just drag out a matter that has been pending
for several years. ``This order is good for parents, it is good for
schools, and it is good for school kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement released Tuesday, Chancellor Rudy Crew
said the board would comply with Cozier's order to list schools
with hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could possibly be of more importance to us than the
safety of our students and staff,'' Crew's statement said. ``The
city and the board have been making every effort to address the
issues raised in the court's determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said the board was working to make permanent repairs to all
237 schools cited in the 1996 memo and had repaired 98 other
schools in recent months. He said the board was planning to make
permanent repairs in 73 more schools not listed in the memo, and
had spent $285 million on repair projects last year.
</P>
<P>
   The board has commissioned an engineering survey of all city
school buildings. Board officials said the engineering study was in
its final review but was not ready for release. The last such
survey was done in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said that even before Monday's court order, ``the board had
begun compiling a list of other city schools with conditions in
need of immediate attention.''
</P>

   ``Therefore,'' he said, ``we will have no difficulty in
complying with Barry Cozier's order today requiring that such a
list be ready for submission to the court before school opens this
fall and that a plan be prepared to address those conditions in a
timely manner.''

   TURTLE-WOMAN (Dalyan, Turkey) _ On many nights this summer, a
mysterious and wondrous spectacle has been unfolding on the beach
of this Mediterranean town. Beginning soon after dark, dozens of
giant loggerhead turtles, some a century old or older, emerge from
the waves, lumber up the sand, dig 3-foot-deep holes and deposit
100 or more eggs before returning to the sea. Not far from the
shoreline, a British-born woman who has made Turkey her home sits
contentedly in a house made largely of driftwood. Without her, the
sea turtles might have lost their breeding ground here, one of the
most important in this part of the world. By Stephen Kinzer.

deal structured as a merger of equals. At the end of the day's
trading, the Bell Atlantic-GTE combination looked more like the pin
that burst the telecommunications stock bubble than a go-go

   EAST-GERMANY-RESTAURANTS (Dresden) _ In Dresden, which is
rapidly repairing the physical damage from the hideous allied
fire-bombing of 1945, if not the psychological damage of the dismal
decades that followed, the dining room of the Bulow Residenz, a
small hotel in a stunning canary-and-white Baroque mansion, has won
a richly deserved Michelin star for cooking that would pass muster
in Paris. Gun-toting cops are long gone, replaced by shining
crystal and fresh flowers. In eastern Berlin, one is spoiled for
choice; indeed, many knowing visitors turn their backs on the
fading glamour of the Kurfurstendamm in the western part of town to
stay and eat in Mitte, the heart of the east. There, too, is a
Michelin-starred restaurant, called Vau, a handsome room with a
modern barrel-vault ceiling, sharp service, and fresh, light German

U.S. HIGH COURT DECLINES TO BAR NYC SEX ZONING LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch appeal
Tuesday by a coalition of sex shops that had sought to block New
York City from enforcing a new zoning law against X-rated
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawyers for the sex shops said they would continue to
press their challenges, the court's refusal to grant an injunction
cleared away the last legal hurdle to enforcement of the law. The
court issued a one-line order, without dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Building inspectors have already been entering establishments to
see whether performers are complying with the law, a city official
said, and lawyers for 107 shops affected by the law predicted an
onslaught of litigation by owners seeking to keep individual shops
open.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a big victory for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
said Tuesday that the city could now proceed with what he had set
out to do three years ago, ``which is to reduce and regulate the
sex shops that were ruining the neighborhoods of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the shops and their customers, who had fought their
legal battle against the zoning law for 28 months, reacted with
disappointment and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that these inspectors would be better off
inspecting scaffolding in buildings where a woman was killed and a
whole section of the city is tied up for days,'' said a lawyer for
the shops, Herald Price Fahringer, ``rather than going around and
checking sex shops to see whether they are in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer and Beth Haroules, a lawyer with the New York Civil
Liberties Union, each said they would ask the Supreme Court to
review the constitutionality of the law in the fall term. But even
if the court were to agree to hear the case, they said, and order
the law stayed pending its consideration, the damage would have
been done, with shops closing or changing their inventories or the
nature of their business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Haroules, whose organization had challenged the zoning law
on behalf of four customers of sex shops, said that even without
shutdowns, the impact of the law was already being felt.
</P>
<P>
   Stores have been getting rid of sexually explicit videotapes and
books, she said, and covering up nude dancers, thus denying such
entertainment to customers as well as violating the rights of the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, with customers aware that undercover police
officers or building inspectors may be conducting surveillance
inside a theater or an X-rated business, ``obviously that has a
chilling effect on people's choices to partake of sexually explicit
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer said he had been advising clients to bring shops into
compliance immediately to avoid shutdowns or criminal charges. He
said he had not heard from any of his clients that the city has
moved to padlock an X-rated establishment.
</P>
<P>
   City officials continued Tuesday to refuse to provide details of
enforcement strategies, or say when they might seek a court order
to close a shop. But Giuliani expressed satisfaction at the court's
ruling, telling reporters that this was a battle that former Mayor
Ed Koch had once ``bet us that we would never win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't paid his bet yet,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said Tuesday night that he did not remember such a bet, but
that if the mayor could produce any ``credible evidence'' that he
had, he would be happy to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate the mayor in getting this done,'' Koch
said by phone. ``I approve of exactly what he's doing here.''

PARCELLS ISN'T WORRIED ABOUT FOLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Glenn Foley's eyes grew wide when he imagined
how the New York Jets' offense would perform this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, come time, the offense is going to be a juggernaut,''
Foley said after Tuesday morning's workout at Hofstra University.
</P>
<P>
   Juggernaut was not a word uttered by Bill Parcells. The coach
stopped the morning workout, ordered the first offensive unit off
the field and told it to run to a far corner of the field and back
before resuming practice.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes committed may not have been all Foley's, but as the
starting quarterback, he has the responsibility of getting the
offense in sync. So far, he has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has given Foley the benefit of the doubt, acknowledging
that Foley is still feeling the effect of last season's sprained
ligament in his left knee. Parcells speculated that Foley could be
tired from taking the majority of the snaps. And the coach admitted
that the offense usually lags behind the defense early in camp.
</P>
<P>
   When it was suggested that he might be providing excuses for his
inexperienced quarterback, Parcells' eyes grew almost as bright as
Foley's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making excuses for anybody,'' he said. ``I'm just
telling you the circumstances. I'm not usually one to make excuses
for players. I must be mellowing out a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a mellow Parcells would be news to his players,
particularly the offensive unit that drew his wrath Tuesday.
Parcells said his decision to get the unit running came because
Keith Byars committed two mental errors and missed an assignment on
the first three plays. But Foley accepted the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, positively, I take it personally,'' Foley said.
``It's really my huddle. As quarterback, you want to think it's
your team. Everybody's performance, if somebody screws up or if
somebody is doing something right, everything's a reflection on the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time this year that we've had to run. It's a
daily thing. We're getting hundreds of plays a day, and if Bill
doesn't like it, somebody is going to be running. Today it was the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my fifth camp. I've seen some pretty good quarterbacks
come through here and work and go through the same problems I've
been going through now. But, again, it's the process. It takes a
while to iron things out. I'm not worried about it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Foley was handed the job when the team waived Neil
O'Donnell, his experience last year included only four games of
significant playing time. And this is the first training camp that
he has entered as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff we do now, maybe you get one-hundredth of it during
a game,'' Foley said. ``Our playbook is pages and pages long. There
is a lot mentally and a lot going on physically. It's a grind. You
just have to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said: ``All I can tell you about Glenn right now is
that this is a different set of circumstances for Glenn Foley. He's
getting the majority of the reps. He gets tired. He hasn't had this
many reps in five years. All I can tell you is it's different.
People that haven't been involved in it don't appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems I've got right now is that the defense is
ahead of the offense. We have put a lot of stuff in, and that
affects the receivers. Bill Belichick has got some schemes in that
are neutralizing some of the things we're trying to do. It
exasperates you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foley still wants the job and remains confident that he and
the rest of the offense will work through the kinks. ``It's just a
matter of executing,'' Foley said. ``I don't have any doubt that
another couple of days, another week or so, this is going to be a
high-flying offense.''

FASSEL PUTS AN END TO TEAM FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the first three days of Giants training camp,
there were fights between scrimmaging players during every one of
the team's two-a-day workouts. The total had reached seven.
</P>
<P>
   To revise an old joke, one could go to a fight and expect a
Giants training camp to break out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Giants coach Jim Fassel reached his boiling point. At a
team meeting Monday night, Fassel ripped into his players,
reminding them it was a very public, on-the-field spat between
defensive players that contributed to the Giants' downfall in their
playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about poise, keeping your head and keeping your focus,''
Fassel said of his address to the team. ``I'll never stop getting
on them about that.''
</P>
<P>
   As an additional reminder, Fassel told his players _ who later
described Fassel's harangue as ``a lot of yelling and screaming'' _
that starting immediately, any fight would mean an extra 15 minutes
of sprints for the entire team at the end of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Two fights would mean an extra 30 minutes of end-of-practice
sprints, which are called gassers.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the extra work did not only apply to the combatants _ a
fight meant the whole team would run.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel got his message across. Tuesday, for the first time since
training camp opened, there were no fisticuffs in either the
morning or afternoon sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, players on both sides of the line were encouraging each
other, occasionally helping each other up off the ground. ``I liked
what I saw,'' Fassel said. ``And I liked what I didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Flare-ups by 300-pound players in full pads practicing under a
hot summer sun are hardly new to pro football. But in the context
of how the Giants' season ended last year _ with defensive players
engaged in hostile on-the-field quarrels as the team was
squandering a 9-point lead _ it was interesting to note how quickly
Fassel reacted when he spotted a flaw in his team's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings debacle, and the sight of players losing their cool
in the middle of the field on national television, is never too far
from Fassel's agenda. Fassel considered those squabbles evidence
that his young team showed a lack of maturity at a big moment. He
was convinced that several players lost their focus, helping to
create an atmosphere that led to the late-game collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Giants opened their 1997 season with a 1-3 record, a
time when they frequently argued with officials and with each other
during games, Fassel has emphasized that he wants his players to
show more poise. A year later, he is doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giants players, on Monday Fassel told the team: ``I
want a team that's feisty _ I don't want to curb your
aggressiveness _ but you have to be smart. There will be no more
fighting here in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The tussles in practice this week have been borne by the
dominance of the Giants' defense, a unit that is the team's
strength. Last year's Giants defense ranked seventh in the National
Football League, and it's no surprise that the Giants' offense,
which ranked 27th, has initially had trouble making yardage against
their defensive counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   This has bred frustration. Affecting the situation are the
feelings of several Giants defenders, who want the defense this
year to play with a certain cockiness. These Giants believe that in
1998 the defensive unit can take the next step and become one of
the elite defenses in the NFL. They have decided to start staking
that claim in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it generated some ill-tempered, touchy moments on
the practice field. And Fassel addressed the brewing bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   Today was another steamy, humid day on the practice fields of
the SUNY-Albany campus. But the mood was different, with an
all-for-one feel. Every player kept his cool.
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-practice sprints were no longer than usual.

METS SURPRISE TOUGH PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets stare at the San Diego Padres and
they become envious. The Padres have a gigantic lead in the
National League West and are destined to play post-season games.
Any team other than the Yankees and the Braves should probably envy
them. The Mets wish they were as confident about their plans for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night the Mets eliminated their envy, at least for
one night, and felt confident about the present as they shocked one
of the best pitchers in baseball and defeated San Diego, 7-3, on a
humid evening at Shea Stadium. Andy Ashby had a 3-0 lead in his
quest to become the first 15-game winner in the major leagues, but
the plucky Mets forced him to unravel and started their pivotal
10-game homestand splendidly.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's three-run homer, his 14th of the season, sparked a
four-run fifth inning. It came one pitch after manager Bobby
Valentine's decision to send two runners had helped the Mets avoid
what would have been an inning-ending double play. Instead, the
inning barely continued on the grounder to shortstop. Instead, the
Mets hung on to their lead behind a nail-biting bullpen and with
the help of another homer from Brian McRae.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these games are going to be like playoff games,'' Brian
McRae said. ``For the remainder of the season, if we stay in
contention or stay close, it's going to be like that. If we want to
get to the playoffs, we've got to treat them like playoff games.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine pinch-hit for Hideo Nomo in the fifth inning after he
had permitted three runs while striking out eight, and the Mets
needed a sturdy effort from their relievers. They received it.
</P>
<P>
   Four relievers followed Nomo and held the Padres scoreless, even
though San Diego had men in scoring position in all four innings.
Nomo (5-8) won his third start in a row and is 3-1 in nine outings
with the Mets. Ashby is now 14-6.
</P>
<P>
   Mets reliever Greg McMichael pitched one and two-third innings,
recorded his second save of the season and struck out Greg Vaughn
to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets clinging to a 4-3 lead and two on and two out for
the Padres in the seventh, Dennis Cook was gutsy in a battle
against Ken Caminiti. After Caminiti fouled off three two-strike
pitches, Cook fired a fastball on the inside corner that left the
lethal hitter staring and shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of big pitching in that game and a lot of big
pitches,'' Valentine said. ``They're a good team. We were a good
team tonight, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Lopez added: ``This is a good team. When we play together,
things take care of itself. We're a good team. Watch out for the
Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae helped the Mets relax by poking his 16th homer, and his
sixth in his last 17 games, in the seventh. He celebrated by
raising his arms in triumph as left the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets used smart strategy and expert execution to clobber
Ashby for their four runs in the fifth. After Luis Lopez's one-out
double to right-center field, Valentine inserted Bernard Gilkey as
a pinch-hitter for Nomo. Gilkey walked, and McRae then singled to
drive in Lopez and slice the Padres' lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and a 3-2 count on Edgardo
Alfonzo, Valentine instructed Gilkey and McRae to move with the
pitch and it proved to be pivotal. Alfonzo grounded to shortstop
and the Padres just missed being able to turn a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being out of the inning, Ashby had to face Olerud
with runners on second and third, and Olerud sent the first pitch
into the right-field seats for a three-run blast that put the Mets
ahead, 4-3. Valentine's little dose of daring had kept the critical
inning alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo began the game by stranding two Padres in the first inning,
when he retired Wally Joyner on a fly ball. But he began the third
ominously by walking Ashby on four pitches. It was a mistake Nomo
would regret. After Quilvio Veras sacrificed Ashby to second, Tony
Gwynn did not give Nomo much of a chance to ponder the perilous
situation; Gwynn hammered the first pitch over the
right-center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The ball sailed over the 371-foot mark, traveling a total of 378
feet, and gave the Padres a 2-0 lead. The shot also gave Gwynn two
homers in his last three at-bats against Nomo and 10 hits in 19
career at-bats off the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo rebounded to strike out Ken Caminiti, who was the National
League's most valuable player in 1996, and Greg Vaughn, who might
be the MVP this season. It simply made the walk to Ashby more
mystifying.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth inning also started poorly for Nomo, as Joyner lashed
a ball into the Mets' bullpen for his ninth homer and the 1,000th
run batted in of his career. The second homer off Nomo in a span of
four batters gave the Padres a 3-0 cushion. Nomo left after the
fifth, which is when the Mets arrived and stopped being envious of
the Padres.

NEW COMPANY HURT BY SPECIAL LILCO PAYMENTS, EXECUTIVE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGDALE, N.Y. _ The president of the newly formed Marketspan
company testified Tuesday that it has been seriously damaged by the
furor over the $67 million paid to executives of its predecessor,
Long Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning at a state legislative hearing here, the
president, Robert Catell, said that the dispute had dragged down
Marketspan's stock price, hurt staff morale, caused internal
tension, hurt the company's image and hampered its efforts to get
organized and expand.
</P>
<P>
   His comments placed on public display the turmoil and power
struggles that Marketspan has suffered since it was formed on May
28. When the state's Long Island Power Authority bought most of
LILCO's electricity service on that day, the rest of LILCO merged
with Brooklyn Union Gas and its holding company, Keyspan, to form
Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the takeover and the merger, state officials
disclosed that LILCO had made special payments of $42 million to
its departing chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, and $25 million to
25 other executives. They all assumed new jobs at Marketspan, with
Catacosinos as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Catell, who had been chairman of Brooklyn Union and Keyspan,
became president of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing, conducted by the State Assembly at the State
University at Farmingdale, gave a platform for the first public
statements on the payments by both Catell, who has been critical of
them since they were first disclosed, and his merger partner,
Catacosinos, who continues to defend them.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who had pushed for the LILCO takeover to
enable an average 20 percent cut in the highest electricity rates
in the continental United States, has denounced the executive
payments as ``a secret act of greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has demanded that Catacosinos return the money and
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos said the payments were benefits that he and the
other executives were legally entitled to under their contracts. He
added that the payments had been publicly disclosed in advance,
although not the exact amounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Catell testified that he did not know about the payments
until Catacosinos informed him at a breakfast meeting on May 22,
five days before the secret LILCO board meeting at which they would
be approved. ``It came as quite a shock and a surprise to me,''
Catell said, especially since a LILCO executive had told Brooklyn
Union officials months earlier that there would be no executive
payments.
</P>
<P>
   He said he should have been notified sooner, and if he had known
he might have been able to change the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Catell said he opposed the payments because none of the LILCO
executives were losing their jobs but instead were automatically
getting new positions at Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   He called an emergency meeting of the Brooklyn Union-Keyspan
board the day before the deal closed. It decided to go along with
the merger but insisted that Marketspan's new officers be appointed
only temporarily until the new board reviewed the issue of the
LILCO payments.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's board, which hired a law firm to study the problem,
will meet on Friday. Many politicians have joined Pataki's call for
Catacosinos' removal and are hoping for a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Catacosinos claims he has the support of major institutional
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't put Marketspan, the new company, in the
positive light we would have hoped,'' Catell said of the dispute.
Marketspan's stock price has dropped more than a fourth, to 27 5/8
from 37 5/8, which he conceded ``is a very significant drop, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Catell expressed concern about the chill that the dispute has
placed on Marketspan's relationship with the Power Authority, which
is controlled by Pataki and which hired the company to run the old
LILCO system. ``Lipa is our largest single customer,'' Catell said,
``and obviously it's important to have a good working relationship
with our largest single customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on tensions at Marketspan, Catell said, ``It's
certainly strained at the upper levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The morale of the former Keyspan officers is low,'' he added,
``based on a feeling they haven't been treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   And asked whether the company is troubled, Catell said: ``It's a
very fair statement. We have not advanced the company the way we
would have hoped. The stock price has suffered significantly, and
we have not been able to move forward aggressively as we had hoped.
Certainly the company has been negatively impacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos argued that the payments should not be a concern to
the state since they came from stockholder funds and did not affect
the value of what the state took over.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the executive entitlements had been disclosed in
public filings over the years and that no one from the state
inquired about them.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded, however, that the exact amounts were never listed,
that the most significant number in calculating his benefits was
not decided until the very end and ``you would have to have an
actuary'' to figure out the amounts.
</P>
<P>
   He himself had a major disagreement with the LILCO board,
claiming he was entitled to $63 million instead of the $42 million
he settled for.
</P>
<P>
   As for his future, Catacosinos said, ``I have not made a
decision to resign.'' Asked if that meant he has decided against
resigning, he did not clarify. Asked if he would abide by the
Marketspan board's decision, he was noncommittal. ``Obviously we
will look at it,'' he said, ``and then we will make a
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are Marketspan's top two officials, the two came
and left here not as a team but separately, each accompanied by his
own set of aides.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting his turn to speak, Catacosinos slipped into the audience
during Catell's testimony. Catell, apparently unaware of
Catacosinos, departed along a side aisle, just a few seats away
from him. The two men did not greet each other or even exchange
glances.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Catell played down the significance of their separate
ways. ``We're both busy guys,'' he said. ``We have a big company to
run.''

AMENDMENT SEEKS TO DELAY RULES ON COMBUSTIBLE UPHOLSTERED
FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Va.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly four years, the federal government's top
consumer agency has been working to fashion regulations to make
upholstered furniture more fire resistant. The agency, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, acted after a group of fire marshals
filed a petition in 1994 that said fires from upholstered furniture
accounted for hundreds of household fire deaths in the nation each
year, many of them children.
</P>
<P>
   But this month a legislative rider suddenly appeared on a House
appropriations bill that would stop the commission from putting
rules into effect any time soon. The provision was inserted by Rep.
Roger Wicker, a Republican from Tupelo, Miss., which is known, with
some justification, as the upholstered furniture capital of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker acted after consultations with the American Furniture
Manufacturers Association, which has asserted that there has not
been enough testing on the flame-retardant chemicals that its
members would be obliged to use to meet any new agency standards.
Wicker said the chemicals could be dangerous, even cancer-causing,
for both the people who will use the furniture over many years and
the factory workers who handle the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the rules would raise the price of furniture,
furniture lobbyists said, and may make the upholstery stiffer and
less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates like Mary Ellen Fise, general counsel of
the Consumer Federation of America, said the furniture industry was
merely playing for time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about delays on an issue that clearly needs
action by the federal government,'' Ms. Fise said. ``We're talking
about a lot of deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fise said she believed that the furniture industry was
hoping that if it could delay any regulations for a few years, the
political composition of the consumer agency might change and the
costly regulations might never get adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a pitched political battle in Washington has involved
lobbyists for consumer groups, the furniture industry, fire
marshals and even major chemical companies. The combat has ranged
across the fiefs of several committee chairmen and has largely
occurred behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened here is clear and is something that happens
all too often in Washington,'' Ann Brown, chairwoman of the
consumer commission, said in an interview. ``The lobbyists came in
in the dark of night and inserted this horrendous language, which
is designed to delay the process of finding a way to prevent
hundreds of deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown who said more than 100 deaths occurred annually from
highly combustible upholstery and accused Wicker and the furniture
trade group of trying to sabotage her agency's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Wicker insisted that his last-minute provision was not
intended to block rules to make upholstered furniture safer.
Rather, he said in an interview, he does not trust the consumer
agency to judge which chemicals are safe.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 workers make upholstered furniture in the United
States, the furniture makers trade association said, and Wicker's
office staff estimated that 30,000 were in his congressional
district, in northern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   His rider would block the agency from proceeding with any
regulations until after extensive testing from the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a part of the National
Institutes of Health in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker's proposal would also require the agency to appoint a
panel of scientists to evaluate the issue for at least a year
before any action could be considered. Consumer groups estimate
that the requirements would delay any regulations until 2002,
although Wicker's staff contends that the delay will be less than
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Medford, an official at the consumer agency, said that
although both steps appeared reasonable, they duplicated work
already under way and that their only purpose was delay. Medford
said the agency had already enlisted the Environmental Protection
Agency to examine possible flame retardants.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker's rider was tacked on to a bill authorizing
appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, both of which have
nothing to do with consumer issues.
</P>
<P>
   The bill may be voted on this week, but the issue will probably
be fought again in the fall when the House and Senate versions must
be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   As Wicker was moving to satisfy the furniture industry's
concern, the chemical industry, which is an even more powerful
lobby, informed their allies in Congress that they were eager to
have the federal government require furniture makers to buy the
flame-retardant chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical industry had a powerful ally of its own, Rep.
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who heads the House Commerce Committee, which
has jurisdiction over the consumer agency, and whose district is
home to Albemarle Corp., a leading manufacturer of flame-retardant
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley agreed to allow the legislative rider to go forward as
long as the chemical industry's concerns were taken into account,
congressional aides said. One chemical industry lobbyist said a
compromise was worked out in a meeting in the Capitol on July 13
under which the chemical industry would not have to wait so long to
sell its products.

   DeBUONO TO DEPART AS N.Y. STATE HEALTH COMMISSIONER  
 (bl)  
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Barbara DeBuono said Tuesday that she would step
down as the New York state commissioner of health, a position she
has held for nearly four years in a time of great change in the
state's health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeBuono, 43, will become what amounts to the No. 3 executive
at New York Presbyterian Healthcare System, the new conglomeration
of 28 hospitals, nursing homes and other health care agencies
assembled around one of the nation's most prestigious medical
institutions, the New York and Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She will stay in office virtually through the re-election
campaign of her boss, Gov. George Pataki, and begin her new job
Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Both blunt and politic, Dr. DeBuono was viewed in the
administration as a tough and loyal administrator who oversaw some
of the most ambitious initiatives of the Pataki administration. Her
critics complained that the initiatives were inspired too heavily
by the budgetary goals of the Pataki administration and that she at
times did not consult with advocates for patients and poor people
before making big decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Just after his election in 1994, Pataki lured Dr. DeBuono away
from her job as the top state health official in Rhode Island to
oversee what he described as one of his major goals: to enroll
millions of the people on Medicaid into managed care plans. She
also was charged with negotiating the governor's positions with the
Democrats in the Legislature earlier this year in a major expansion
of a program to provide health insurance to children.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she oversaw the deregulation of the state's
hospitals and the rates they were paid.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeBuono will be leaving just as the Medicaid program begins
to enroll large numbers of people into managed care. While she
would not discuss her new salary, she said it was more than her
$152,000-a-year government salary. ``It was an opportunity that was
very hard to turn down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pataki praised her as the state's first female
health commissioner and for showing ``consummate professionalism.''

EDITORIAL: THE RETURN, ALMOST, OF TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   The blare of traffic is back. Sidewalks along Broadway are full
_ the usual mass of people buying, selling, gawking, pushing, all
at different speeds and in different directions. A small ark of
animals has been rescued from a building on 44th Street, including
12 cats, two illegal ferrets, several goldfish, one cockatiel, a
guinea pig, a gerbil and a hamster.
</P>
<P>
   Except for those areas in the shadow of the Conde Nast building,
where loose scaffolding caused part of an elevator tower to break
away a week ago, crashing into a residential hotel and killing an
elderly woman, Times Square is almost back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the city's crossroads reopened, and with the
breakaway scaffolding slowly being secured with what one television
reporter called ``our giant nylon stocking,'' this is a good time
to find out what really happened. Speculation is now focusing on
the possibility that beams holding the scaffolding to the building
on the 21st floor may not have been properly fastened by
contractors working on the facade. Workers often remove the beams
holding the elevator tower while they apply the facade. The
question is whether someone neglected to re-attach the beams or
whether they were somehow wrenched from the building in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and insurance companies are now circling the site,
undoubtedly setting the stage for a number of lawsuits. The U.S.
Commerce Department, meanwhile, is investigating whether some of
the bolts used in the scaffolding are counterfeit. And the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration is looking at safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, the primary responsibility for discovering causes of
the accident, and making sure that construction can safely proceed,
lies with New York City. City officials announced plans Tuesday to
hire an outside company that specializes in figuring out the causes
of construction accidents. That is a good start, but the city must
make certain that the report is finished quickly and used to help
prevent any similar accidents in this high-density area.
</P>
<P>
   At another hour and on a busier street, this accident could have
taken a far greater toll on human life.

EDITORIAL: KEEPING THE CAPITOL SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   When tragedy strikes, it is natural for people to ask themselves
if there was any way it could have been averted. That is even more
true when the awful event takes place at a site as familiar and
freighted with symbolic import as the Capitol in Washington. Since
a gunman opened fire there last week, members of Congress have
offered suggestions for improving security that range from
requiring guards to wear bulletproof vests to building an
underground entrance where the public could be screened for
weapons. Fencing off the Capitol grounds is another frequently
mentioned option.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol has developed a fairly extensive security apparatus
over the years, with additional protections often being added after
a violent incident. Visitors must walk through metal detectors, and
officers from the 1,200-member Capitol police force are everywhere.
Last week the gunman, Russell Weston Jr., was able to get only a
short way into the Capitol before he was brought down by police
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it would be foolish to dismiss an incident in
which two officers died and gunshots reverberated through the halls
of Congress as proof that the system works. Lawmakers have an
obligation to conduct a thorough inquiry into how safety might be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the security searches at every door, the Capitol has an
air of openness and accessibility that members of Congress
rightfully treasure. It is impossible to walk past the White
House's tall fences, guard posts and traffic barriers without being
reminded that ours is a society that has learned to worry
constantly about the president's safety. But even though the
Capitol has seen sporadic violence, its crowded corridors,
meandering tourists and open lawns speak of a government of the
people. That is a symbol in itself, and one that should not be
given up lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's shooting has revived talk about creating an
underground entrance for tourists that would serve both as a
security stop-point and orientation center. Such a facility would
not necessarily prevent a disturbed gunman from trying to charge
past metal detectors, and shooting guards or tourists in the
process. But it would put the security clearance procedures well
away from the Capitol interior, where the proximity to members of
Congress and the actual House and Senate may incite a deranged
visitor with a grudge to action.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor center might also be helpful in giving tourists a
useful preparation for what they are going to see. The idea was
first proposed after a bombing incident in 1983, but was eventually
shelved due to objections to its cost. Some Republicans in Congress
are now suggesting that the center be paid for with private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   A commemorative coin issue has already raised almost $25 million
of the estimated $125 million construction price. But any idea of
collecting the rest from private donors should be dropped
immediately. The United States is certainly capable of coming up
with the money to provide security for the home of its legislature.

EDITORIAL: HALLUCINATIONS ABOUT IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   Awash with money from Congress for covertly promoting Iraqi
opposition to Saddam Hussein, the Clinton administraton is once
again dreaming about engineering his ouster. The only problem is
that no one in Washington has figured out how to do so. Instead the
administration is preparing to renew its courtship with Massoud
Barzani, a Kurdish factional leader who betrayed Washington and
other opposition groups by forming a temporary military alliance
with Baghdad in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There are no magic strategies for managing Saddam Hussein,
parrying his threats against neighboring countries and blocking his
efforts to develop mass-destruction weapons. That will take patient
diplomatic containment and occasional shows of American military
force. Washington should also overtly encourage credible opposition
forces that could one day rescue Iraq from the international
isolation, internal terror and blighted development hopes of the
Saddam Hussein era.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of covert operations is that they are relatively
cheap, do not require American troops and can proceed without
Washington's skeptical gulf war allies. In recent months, Congress
has pressed the administration to step up covert activity against
Baghdad. But Iraq's opposition groups are even more divided and
discredited now than in 1996, when Barzani invited Iraqi troops
into the Kurdish region to thwart a rival leader, Jalal Talibani.
The soldiers smashed the CIA's operations center and executed
opposition activists. Yet for want of a better alternative,
Washington has invited Barzani, along with Talibani, to new
planning talks.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious internal opposition to Saddam Hussein comes
from Iranian-backed Shiite groups in southern Iraq, from which the
United States keeps a healthy distance. The Iraqi National
Congress, which Washington once hoped would create a broad-based
opposition, has little remaining support. Iraqi military officers,
meanwhile, are understandably reluctant to plot against Saddam
Hussein without clearer promise of American military backing than
Washington is prepared to offer. The United States should learn
from past mistakes and steer clear of covert operations in Iraq. &QL;

U.S. WOMEN SWIMMERS TROUNCE CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ The world's fastest women's swimming team
represents the United States. If China has faster swimmers, they
stayed at home and missed Tuesday night's Goodwill Games debacle in
which the Americans ran away with their rare dual meet, 88-34.
</P>
<P>
   This was an old-fashioned grudge match, at least for the
Americans. They believe the Chinese women won 12 of the 16 gold
medals in the 1994 world championships because they had used banned
bodybuilding drugs. With random drug testing, the international
federation has clamped down on the offenders, and in January's
world championships in Australia the American women won eight gold
medals, the Chinese three.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Americans and the Chinese met in 14 events. But only
17-year-old Yen Chan _ a world champion and world record-holder _
and 16-year-old Xue Han were here from China's 1996 Olympic team,
and most of their teammates here were just as young and less
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The tone for this meet was set in the first event, the 400-meter
medley relay. The Americans won by almost half the length of the
50-meter pool in the new Nassau County Goodwill Games Swimming and
Diving Center.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the near-capacity crowd at the 1,700-seat pool watched
the Americans win 11 events. Each team had two swimmers in each of
the 12 individual events, and the Americans finished 1-2 in eight
of them. That was especially impressive because the Americans are
preparing for their national championships in two weeks, and some
are not fully rested.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive performances came from Cristina Teuscher, a
20-year-old Columbia University junior from New Rochelle, N.Y., and
Jenny Thompson, a 25-year-old Stanford graduate from Dover, N.H.
Teuscher set a Goodwill Games and personal record for the 200-meter
freestyle, winning by 15 feet in 1 minute 59.63 seconds. Then she
won the 400-meter freestyle by 10 meters in 4:12.16.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a world champion, won the 50-meter freestyle in 25.77
seconds, beating her teammate Ashley Tappin by a hundredth of a
second, or less than an inch. Then she beat Tappin in the 100-meter
freestyle in 55.56 seconds, a Goodwill record. Then she, Teuscher
and Tappin swam on the U.S. team that set a Goodwill record of
3:43.98 in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meet, Thompson expressed how she and her teammates
felt about the Chinese drug issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're on the blocks,'' she said, ``it's not an issue.
They are our competitors. We have to beat them. All we can do is
race.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly did that Tuesday night.

BASS FANS FINALLY GET A NOVEL FROM THE FORMER HOUSTONIAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``WHERE THE SEA USED TO BE''; By Rick Bass (Houghton Mifflin, $25) 
 
By MICHAEL BERRYHILL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Houstonian Rick Bass has had plenty of preparation for
writing his first novel, publishing 11 volumes of personal essays,
short stories and environmental tales, all dominated by his urgent,
passionate and vulnerable voice.
</P>
<P>
   Bass is a man we feel we know. We know about his Texas
upbringing from ``The Deer Pasture,'' a book about an annual family
deer hunt in the Hill Country. From his book ``Oil Notes'' we know
how he courted his wife, Elizabeth, making her BLT sandwiches in a
park, using a microwave he carried in his car trunk for weeks while
looking for an opportunity to ask her for a seemingly casual date.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Winter'' we know how he and Elizabeth moved to the Yaak
Valley, in the far northwestern corner of Montana near the Canadian
border, and how Bass at last found his home and vowed never to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   And we know how much he loves the wilderness, and understands
it, from his books about the Yaak Valley and wolves and grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   If Bass never wrote a line of fiction, his literary reputation
would be secure in his essays and memoirs. Yet he has also
persisted in writing short stories, with his most ambitious ones
collected in ``Platte River.'' But a major literary reputation
(though reputation is not, assuredly, what drives Bass) can
scarcely be built on short stories. We demand the big thing, and it
was inevitable that Bass would persist, like a man building a rock
wall in the forest, hauling a truckload of boulders a day,
insisting that he eventually would get it built.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent reading, Bass said he took 14 years and made eight
major revisions before he had a novel worth publishing, and the
effort was sometimes humiliating. After what he thought was the
final and best revision, his editor and agent told him to try
again, and he wondered whether he knew any longer what writing was
about.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort, on his part, and the wait, on his readers' part,
have been worth it. With ``Where the Sea Used to Be Bass'' has
almost single-handedly created North American magical realism, part
Paul Bunyan, part Herman Melville, and all of it solidly,
believably his.
</P>
<P>
   Texas readers will recognize Old Dudley, the obsessed Houston
oil geologist who is the driving force of the novel. Nearing the
end of his life and plenty rich, Old Dudley wants nothing more than
to find oil in a remote Montana valley where he has already punched
18 dry holes.
</P>
<P>
   Having burned up one young geologist in his quest, he recruits
another, sending him to map the valley again and to befriend his
estranged daughter, a biologist who has been tracking the
activities of a pack of wolves for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dudley is a mix of Glenn McCarthy, Hugh Roy Cullen and
Michel Halbouty, with a lot of wolverine thrown in, and Bass has
made him both perfectly recognizable and comically exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   He is Bass' Ahab in a book that deserves comparison to
Melville's symbolic epic about a hunt for a white whale. Like Ahab,
Dudley has only one name, and, like Ahab, he has his humanity. This
is a mythic novel, and in myth, all the forces, voices, demons and
urges a person can have become characters, and we watch these
characters act as though impelled on iron rails, to use Ahab's
description of why he must kill the white whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Sea Used to Be'' is about hunting of all sorts. In a
brilliant set piece near the end of the book, the two geologists
embark on a two-week-long epic elk hunt in which they nearly die.
Mel, Old Dudley's daughter, hunts wolves, but only for information
about their lives. Wallis, the new geologist who falls in love with
Mel, hunts for oil. His technology is mapping, studying the
formations above the ground in order to imagine the structure
beneath the earth, where the sea used to be, where organic material
has been trapped under pressure and turned into oil.
</P>
<P>
   As with most myths, the structure is simple: A vulnerable hero
is sent into a mythical place, a valley like the Yaak Valley, and,
aided by various figures, retrieves some magical thing that will
heal the wounded world he has left behind. The basic plot is so
well-known that Hollywood script writers are required to consult it
as formula.
</P>
<P>
   So the magic lies not in plot but in our recognition of what is
eternal and in details, the things Mel knows about wolves, for
instance, and how people of the valley pull together against the
forces of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   In the isolation of the valley, people are freed to become fully
themselves, which is to say fully obsessed. An isolated carpenter,
for example, lovingly creates painted coffins in sculptural animal
shapes for every person who lives in the valley. Shades of
Queequeg, building his own buoyant coffin that will save Ishmael at
the end of ``Moby Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   As does Melville, Bass offers a good deal of realistic detail.
You can learn the fundamentals of hunting for oil or elk, just as
you can learn the fundamentals of hunting whales from Melville. But
such information is transformed alchemically into spiritual
knowledge. Eventually, Mel quits tracking the wolves and starts
teaching what she knows to the children. It is a change that she
doesn't really think about. She just does it.
</P>
<P>
   For this is not a book about what people think, as in, say,
Richard Ford's ``Independence Day,'' but a book about what people
do. There is no internal psychology here, little pondering and
weighing of motive, little rumination on what it all means. These
are characters who are taking action for better or for worse and
who are seeking how to live and how to die when that is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The act of mapping for oil, a geologist assures me, is just like
writing a book. You are hoping to find something down there, but
you don't know where it is, and you need all the data you can get
in order to make a good guess. Sometimes you can make a map as good
as you can make it, believe in it completely and get a dry hole, as
Wallis does. Or you can figure out the history of geology and
evolution and declare unequivocally, as Old Dudley does, that man
belongs at the top and deserves to dominate the earth and
everything on it. Such maps, no matter how carefully and rationally
created, can be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Sea Used to Be'' does what a great myth does; it
maps the human psyche of a man we have come to know, Rick Bass:
geologist, naturalist, lover, hunter, lover of the wildest places
of all, in the human heart, brains and guts.
</P>
<P>
   For all its mythological structure, this book is deeply
personal. Bass is a fabulist, a brave but necessary choice, it
seems, in a world that is being devoured by our obliviousness to
its inherent beauty and mystery.
</P>

BOB HOPE MAKES MORE MEMORIES WITH STARBUCKS VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An elderly gentleman at a Starbucks counter
quietly sipped a small black coffee-of-the-day -- and made everyone
else's day.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hope arrived Tuesday morning in a white sport-utility
vehicle and waited on a bar stool at the window counter while his
driver got him a small drip coffee and a pastry.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed comfortably for a hot day in cream-colored slacks and
matching button-down shirt, the legendary comedian noshed and
sipped while heads started to turn his way.
</P>
<P>
   Soon one customer asked for Hope to autograph a brown paper bag.
Another placed a comic strip hastily torn from the morning
newspaper in front of the 95-year-old entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you'd get a laugh from this, after all the laughs
you've given us,'' the man said to Hope, who read the comic and
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Hope's 20-minute visit to the suburban Sherman
Oaks coffeehouse, just about everyone had figured out that a legend
was in the joint.
</P>
<P>
   As Hope and his driver rose to leave, four men sitting at a
couple of tables put down their coffee and newspapers to break into
a spontaneous and heartfelt rendition of Hope's theme song, first
introduced in ``The Big Broadcast of 1938,'' his 1934 film debut.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little off-key, but the words rang through the room:
``Thanks for the memories . . .''

DOMINANT PITCHING KEYING YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Twenty or so years from now, when baseball
historians reflect on 1998, there's a good chance they'll declare
it the Year of the Home Run.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. have seen to that.
</P>
<P>
   The current members of the New York Yankees will probably have
cause to smirk and plea for some revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   The Year of ``The Pitching Staff,'' offers Darryl Strawberry,
their most potent slugger to date _ with a paltry 16 homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are bucking convention in the American League,
building their fortunes on their starting pitchers and not
troubling themselves over the fact they have no particular big gun
in the heart of their lineup. And yet their success is astonishing:
a record of 74-26 following Tuesday night's pounding of the Angels
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have those types of players here. We don't have big
home run hitters,'' said manager Joe Torre. ``This ballclub is more
of a line-drive, contact-type team. More of a productive team. We
get a lot of walks. We put the ball in play. We don't sit around
and wait for one guy to do something....
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a pitching staff like ours, you don't
necessarily have to think in big terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees prefer to think microscopic _ as in 3.38, the
combined ERA of starters David Cone, Andy Pettitte, David Wells,
Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing against the guys having success hitting home runs,
chasing records,'' said Strawberry, New York's designated hitter
and occasional left fielder, ``but you've got to be realistic about
what teams are, and the intentions of winning and going to
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that (a formidable home run threat) going to get you to
where you have to get? Normally, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball might be fascinated with the exploits of McGwire and
Griffey, who had combined for 85 home runs. But their teams, St.
Louis and Seattle, have also combined for a .462 winning percentage
_ 278 points behind that of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning through different ways,'' said catcher Joe
Girardi. ``It's not typical of Yankee teams. You think of bombers.
But I think this is more exciting for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't really happen by design, in that the pitching has
exceeded its reasonable expectations and the power hitting has
fallen short of its forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez hit 44 home runs with 141 RBI last
year, but he is nowhere near that homer pace now (14 homers, 78
RBI). Meanwhile, Chili Davis, who had 30 home runs with Kansas City
last year before signing with the Yankees as a free agent, has been
out since the first week of the season after suffering an ankle
injury that required reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Torre says he feels Martinez's current output is closer to what
should be expected of him, and the career stats bear him out
(Martinez had averaged 22 homers per year over his previous seasons
with Seattle and New York).
</P>
<P>
   As for the starters, with the exception of Pettitte, it would
have been difficult to imagine they'd perform as they have.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Cone (15-3, 3.33):!off! In '97, one year after overcoming
surgery to remove an aneurysm in his right arm, he broke down
again. Cone suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder that
ultimately knocked him out of the playoffs and required surgery at
season's end. How much was left in that arm at age 35?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, apparently. ``He wasn't ready to say, `I'm getting
older, maybe I can't do this anymore,'' said Girardi. Cone, indeed,
has impressed the Yankees not only with his effectiveness but his
staying power. He has worked seven innings or more in 10 of his
last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Pettitte (13-6, 3.70):!off! The ace of New York's staff
last year got off to a rough beginning in '98, compiling a 6-5
record and 4.88 ERA through May. Pettitte later admitted that his
mind wasn't entirely on baseball but on his wife, who was home in
Texas preparing to give birth to their second child.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Irabu (9-4, 3.19):!off! He had a rocky indoctrination to
American baseball in '97, putting up a 7.09 ERA despite striking
out 56 in 531/3 innings. Girardi says Irabu is more ``relaxed''
this year, and it's evident in the production. This is more what
the Yankees anticipated when they agreed to part with promising
outfielder Ruben Rivera to pry Irabu's rights away from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Wells (12-2, 3.68):!off! It happens now and then _ an
aging warhorse of a pitcher puts up a career season when least
expected. Wells, who turned 35 in May and has never been mistaken
for a fitness enthusiast, was 27-24 with a 4.68 ERA over the last
two years, which were split between Baltimore and New York. And now
this?
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Hernandez (5-2, 2.43):!off! Like Irabu, he was something
of an unknown quantity _ just from a different country. After
defecting from Cuba, Hernandez has made so smooth a transition to
the American pro game that he bumped Ramiro Mendoza out of the
rotation and is impressing observers with his array of pitches and
his savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the adversity he went through (in getting out of
Cuba),'' said Girardi, ``anything he experiences on the mound is
going to be minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre knows only to accept the prosperity of this staff. And
appreciate it profoundly. When reminded that his team is brazenly
defying baseball fashion _ 12 teams have hit more home runs than
his Yankees _ he said only, ``Good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pitch well,'' Torre went on, ``that means less runs
win the game. We try to think small. It's a lot easier to go into a
slump when you're sitting around waiting for a three-run home run
than when you're trying to manufacture something.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it from a team that has required only 100 games to
manufacture 74 wins. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

SETBACK HAS YOUNG SITTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PHILADELPHIA _ Second baseman Eric Young did not come off the
disabled list Tuesday after experiencing tightness in his strained
left thigh muscle over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Young, among the league leaders with 33 stolen bases despite
being sidelined on four separate occasions, did some light running
Tuesday but probably won't be back until Friday, when the Dodgers
open a four-game series against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping he can be back by then, but we're really going to
have to wait and see,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``He had been
coming along well but had a setback on Friday when he tried to push
it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he wasn't holding Young out because of the
artificial surface at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who is in the first season of a four-year, $18.5 million
contract, was mentioned in trade speculation in Toronto. But the
Dodgers denied the report, which had Young headed to the Blue Jays
for pitcher Juan Guzman, a former Dodgers minor-leaguer who has
struggled recently. Guzman is earning $5 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   A player cannot be traded when he is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Worry about Valdes: Although Ismael Valdes is scheduled to
miss only two starts while on the disabled list for a strained left
side, there is concern the injury could keep him out a few weeks
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, injured while pitching in Sunday's 5-3 Dodgers victory
against Arizona, does not have arm problems. But side injuries can
throw off pitching mechanics, which can lead to arm injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's back in L.A. working with (physical therapist) Pat
Screnar and we should know better where we stand in a week,''
trainer Charlie Strasser said. ``We'll see how he is responding to
treatment. Could it be longer? It all depends on how he responds.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Judd for now: Right-hander Mike Judd, scheduled to start
Saturday in place of Valdes, has had his own physical problems this
season. He started the season at Triple-A Albuquerque and went 1-7.
For the first month, Judd, 27, suffered from the flu and lost most
of the velocity on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded to win his last four decisions, but the team is
looking at him as a spot starter until a pitcher is acquired before
Friday's trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy pitch as sick as he was,'' said Hoffman,
Albuquerque's manager until June 22, when he replaced Bill Russell.
``For the longest time he just didn't get better. But when he
finally recovered, he pitched very well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd, one of the pitchers former executive vice president Fred
Claire protected in last November's expansion draft, also will
pitch Thursday in Montreal if a trade is not made.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Local guy: Westlake High product Mike Lieberthal was placed
on the 15-day disabled list last Friday by the Phillies, but he
could be there a lot longer. Lieberthal, the Phillies' starting
catcher, suffered a stress fracture to the pelvic region, which
makes it difficult to squat or run or even walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are using the injury to look at rookie catcher
Bobby Estalella, who was called up when Lieberthal went on the DL.
Estalella came into Tuesday's game with four hits in eight at-bats
in his first two games. Against the Dodgers, he batted fifth and
went 1 for 4 with a double.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance if Estalella plays well the rest of the
season, the Phillies could trade Lieberthal during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Quick hits: Wilton Guerrero is hot at the plate but not
exactly a classic leadoff hitter. He entered the game with 11 hits
in his past 20 at-bats, but his first-inning walk was just first in
26 games and 100 at-bats.... Catcher Charles Johnson is expected to
rejoin the team today after his wife, Rhonda, gave birth to the
couple's first child in Los Angeles.... Phillies first baseman Rico
Brogna went 2 for 5 with an RBI single. He entered the game 8 for
12 against the Dodgers this season.

CLEMENS, BLUE JAYS DOWN RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It appeared to be a double-play ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   A form of the word ``appears'' often serves as a disclaimer on
any ground ball put into play toward the Rangers' infielders these
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, of course, failed to record an out, and the Blue
Jays erased a rare, three-run deficit for right-hander Roger
Clemens and beat their struggling visitors, 8-3, last night at
SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we turn that double play in the second inning,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said, ``who knows where the ballgame goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have lost four in a row, know the direction it
took.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who pitched despite a temperature in excess of 100
degrees and symptoms of the flu, surrendered three runs in the
first two innings. That represented more than the Rangers scored
during 32 innings against the four-time Cy Young Award recipient in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it would go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers third baseman Fernando Tatis and second baseman Mark
McLemore botched a potential inning-ending, double-play grounder
off the bat of third baseman Ed Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Aaron Sele (12-8) then surrendered a single to
shortstop Alex Gonzalez, a run-scoring walk to left fielder Tony
Phillips and a two-run single to outfielder Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis fielded Sprague's grounder cleanly, but his high-and-wide
throw pulled McLemore off the bag. McLemore caught the ball, but it
fell from his glove as he attempted to touch the bag with his left
foot and throw simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work,'' said McLemore, who was given the error on
the play.
</P>
<P>
   Sele also shared in the blame for not minimizing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to deal with the situation at hand,'' said Sele,
who will enter his scheduled start Sunday with a 4-6 record and
6.62 earned-run average during his past 12 appearances. ``It's my
job to get another double-play ground ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates dismissed Tatis' throw as the inconsistency with which a
manager lives with a young player in the lineup.Clemens (13-6) took
advantage of the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who allowed run-scoring groundouts to left fielder
Rusty Greer and designated hitter Lee Stevens and a run-scoring
double to Tatis in the first two innings, surrendered only a single
and issued two walks during the next four innings despite being
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes him one of the great pitchers,'' Sele said.
``That's what separates the great pitchers from the good ones. He
just figures out a way to win. If you told him to go out and throw
the ball left-handed, he'd figure out a way to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague and Gonzalez ignited the Blue Jays' three-run sixth
inning with a one-out double and a run-scoring single,
respectively, on weakly hit balls. Right fielder Jose Canseco later
laced a two-run double that gave the Jays a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays manager Tim Johnson removed Clemens after his 99th
pitch with two runners aboard and two outs during the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' said Clemens, who vomited
shortly before his first pitch. ``My temperature has been going
crazy. I was laboring out there all night long. It was a tough game
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' final two runs crossed the plate on an
eighth-inning, inside-the-park home run by center fielder Shannon
Stewart, who replaced Canseco during the seventh inning. On the
play, Greer missed a diving attempt for Stewart's sinking liner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers had decided the outcome well before then.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least it appeared that way.

SEAHAWKS WORK ON HYDRATION TO BEAT THE HEAT

<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ As the temperature was pushing toward triple
digits, Michael Sinclair was pushing his way past another 325-pound
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, the Seahawks' Pro Bowl defensive end had
been dropping 10 yards off the line to provide blanket coverage and
force an incompletion to a tight end in the end zone. A few minutes
later, he would be running wind sprints at the end of another
training-camp practice.
</P>
<P>
   In between, however, Sinclair made his way to one of the water
caddies stationed around the practice field. Sinclair didn't just
drink, he squirted water onto his sweat-drenched face and hosed
down his steaming shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get this far, you're not just a top athlete, you're a
commodity,'' Sinclair said later. ``Water for me is like oil for a
racing car. I need that or I'm going to burn my engine out.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is not the Eastern Washington University
training camps of the late 1970s and early '80s that were ruled
with a clenched fist and an even tighter jaw by Jack Patera, the
team's first coach who banned water from the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the players are not only urged to drink, they're prodded to
replenish lost fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question there's a conditioning effect training in this
heat,'' strength and conditioning coach Dana LeDuc said. ``But you
have to be smart about it. The main thing is hydration, and our
trainers have done a great job of educating the players and then
making sure that there's water at every turn _ coming on the field,
off the field; on the field; at the dining hall; in the dorms.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Sperber, the team's assistant trainer, ordered 350 cases of
Gatorade before camp started, and had to endure barbs about being
on the company's payroll. Well, another 350 cases of the stuff was
delivered Tuesday, along with 350 cases of bottled water to replace
the 350 that already have been consumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that might last us another week,'' head trainer Jim
Whitesel said of the new shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair estimates that he alone was responsible for draining
three cases of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are drinking fluids like crazy. You have to,'' Sinclair
said. ``Last year, I was like, `Ah, I don't feel like drinking.' I
cramped up. This year, I've been hitting the fluids and I've had no
problems. You live and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   And drink.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing fluids actually began during the team's offseason
conditioning program, when Sperber offered hydration seminars.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Despite practicing 16 times in
96-degree-plus heat during the first nine days of camp, there have
been only two cases of leg cramps _ rookie running back Ahman Green
and reserve fullback Oscar Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of a lot of things,'' LeDuc said of the
lack of cramping and other dehydration problems. ``It's the fact
that the players worked extremely hard in the offseason. It's that
they're continuing to work hard here. But a big part of it is
stressing hydration.''
</P>
<P>
   Patera, coach for the first 6{ years of the franchise, drew a
lot of heat for his no-water edict. And the day Patera surprised
his troops with Popsicles on the practice field in 1982 is a
cornerstone of the team's training camp lore.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the norm in those days. It was then considered a
training benefit to subject players to rigorous workouts without
allowing them to drink water during practice. Honing mental
toughness, and all that macho stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised somebody didn't die in those days,''
Sperber said, ``because your body will shut down without water.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brown remembers that, if not fondly, at least with a sense
of pride. One of the original Seahawk players, Brown now coaches
the team's defensive backs and remains the only Seahawk cornerback
ever voted to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing. I remember it being hot, and there was no
water on the field _ (begin ital) no water (end ital),'' Brown
said. ``I also remember being very thirsty at times and having
unbelievable cotton mouth. We chewed a lot of gum.''
</P>
<P>
   But they never drank water on the practice field.

LOPEZ MAKES MOST OF HIS VARIOUS CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In spring training of 1997, the San Diego Padres
traded Luis Lopez to the Houston Astros. Fifteen days later, the
Astros traded Lopez to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of confused,'' Lopez recalled on Tuesday night.
``Definitely I was confused. It took me a little time to settle
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, with whom Lopez began his professional and major
league careers, are the ones who needed settling on Tuesday night
after Lopez played a pivotal role in the Mets' 7-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the Padres ahead, 3-0, and Andy Ashby having thoughts of
becoming the first 15-game winner in the majors, Lopez drilled a
fifth-inning double that ignited a four-run outburst. Two innings
later he beat out an infield grounder for a single and scored on
Brian McRae's home run. Then, in the eighth inning, he singled home
the Mets' final run. Not a bad night's work for a utility player
filling in for the ailing Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose Rey Ordonez and Luis steps in and does the job,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``It's great to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets acquired Lopez in a trade of convenience. Tim Bogar
wasn't going to make the team that spring, and he was out of
options. Lopez had options left and could easily be sent to the
minor leagues. Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, had
been with the Mets and liked Bogar. Joe McIlvaine, then the Mets'
general manager, had been the San Diego general manager and liked
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets didn't think enough of Lopez to rush him to the
majors after Ordonez broke his hand June 1. First they made Manny
Alexander the shortstop, but he tore cartilage in his right knee.
Then they declared Shawn Gilbert the shortstop, but before he had a
chance to make his first start, he came down with a staph infection
in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lopez, whose right knee was healthy, became the
substitute shortstop. ``It was confusing,'' Lopez said, sitting at
his locker in the Mets' Latin quarter. ``But that's past. I was
ready. I just waited for my time. I worked my way back.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Puerto Rican, who looks younger than his 27 years, is
confused this season, it's only because he has to remember where to
head when he goes on the field. A utility infielder before this
season, he has started games in left field and right field as well
as at second base, shortstop and third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have even asked him to play winter ball this year so he
can gain more experience in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis asks people what his best position is,'' related Omar
Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager. ``I told him his best
position is where they put him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has started the past four games in place of Ordonez, who
strained an abdominal muscle in the first game of a doubleheader in
Chicago last Friday. His temporary starting role, however, doesn't
alter his routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take pride in my job,'' he said. ``I go early to the ball
park and take my grounders at third, short and second and then go
to the outfield and work out there, too. My job is to be a
defensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez contributes, too, offensively. His performance against
the Padres was his fourth three-hit game of the season, and it
raised his average to .280 in 78 games and 175 times at bat. His
first hit on Tuesday night was especially critical. ``He was my
teammate in San Diego when I played there,'' Lopez said of Ashby,
who began the game with the third lowest earned run average (2.49)
in the National League. ``He's a very competitive guy, one of the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   After striking out Todd Hundley with two on and two out in the
first inning, Ashby looked like he was going to be tough to catch.
But then Lopez rapped the hit that prompted Ashby to begin to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a good pitch to hit,'' Lopez said. ``He threw me a
fastball inside, then he threw another fastball over the middle of
the plate. I think he was going to bust me in and the ball just
stayed out in the middle. I got pretty good wood on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That he lined that pitch to right-center field for a double,
then added a pair of singles was satisfying enough. But to do it
against the Padres added the chocolate icing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling,'' he acknowledged, ``but that's past. I'm
looking forward to tomorrow.''

SAHALEE ERECTING `THREE-RING CIRCUS' FOR UPCOMING PGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS CONKLIN AND ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND Wash. _ The serenity of Sahalee Country Club has been
shattered.
</P>
<P>
   The gentle murmur of geese fluttering overhead and golf balls
plunking off towering Douglas firs have yielded to the sound of
hammers, saws and drills.
</P>
<P>
   A city is emerging, a lavish tent city springing up between the
fairways.
</P>
<P>
   This City on the Course is complete with 23 TV-camera towers,
1,200 phone lines, 9,000 grandstand seats, 31 air-conditioned
corporate chalets, 300 toilets, 5,000 pounds of salmon and shrimp
and more than $48,000 worth of hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the 1,500 kegs of beer on order, or the
five-plus miles of chain-link fence that now surrounds the wooded
course. Or the 100-by-215-foot structure built to hold 1,000
members of the national and worldwide media.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary event.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong 80th PGA Championship that begins Aug. 10 has been
in the making for a solid two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a circus. It's many circuses. This is a
three-ring circus of major proportions,'' said Richard MacIntosh,
Sahalee's assistant vice chairman for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot help but be impressed and amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive is the level of intricate detail involved in
this mammoth undertaking. Marketing plans had to be devised,
security plans concocted, transportation schemes worked through.
Nearly 600 people had to be hired, and several training sessions
scheduled for the more than 2,500 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coming to Sahalee for the first time, and holding a major
championship for the first time (in the Northwest in more than) 50
years, we've got one shot to do this thing right,'' said PGA
tournament director Andy Odenbach.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA staff has secured contracts with hundreds of vendors.
Many of them are local, like Gretchen's Of Course, a catering
service north of Boeing Field that is leasing out its
23,000-square-foot kitchen to the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Food will be shuttled in refrigerated trucks, much of it being
delivered to the 3,300 people who will be reveling inside those
corporate chalets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of hospitality (in the chalets) will be unequaled.
Beyond the Super Bowl,'' said Mike Kalian, who chairs the marketing
committee. ``There's linens, flowers, landscaping, plush carpeting
and decks with covered verandas. And we'll be doing beanies and
weeners to lobster and Dom (Perignon).''
</P>
<P>
   The guts of the operation flow from a vast army of some 2,500
volunteers who will be continually on the move. These are serious
golf junkies for the most part _ many of them retirees or junior
golfers _ who paid $155 to the PGA to be part of the action. You
won't miss them in their striped white, navy and wine-colored
shirts and stone-colored slacks and skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been left to chance. Some 1,000 volunteers will be
marshaling the course, keeping spectators in their proper places
and clearing paths between holes for the players to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   Another 350 volunteers are assigned to the 13,000-square-foot
PGA Golf Shop where 47,976 hats ($11 to $25) will be on sale, along
with 20,680 golf balls and thousands of jackets and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000 pounds of merchandise are being warehoused at Lincoln
Moving &AMP; Storage in Kent. Susan Hickman, who handles the retail
efforts for the PGA, figures it will take five moving vans to get
all the goods to Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   Another 250 volunteers are charged with meeting the 156 PGA
players at the airport, getting them to their hotels and assisting
them in picking up the brand-new Oldsmobile the PGA customarily
provides each player free of charge during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, 40 Sahalee groundskeepers have spent months
raking bunkers, mowing fairways and chiseling greens down to a
linoleum-hard [-inch. And Craig Rogers has been meeting with his
caddies committee. It's up to him and his crew of 18 to secure the
bag room, take care of the caddies' credentials and collect and
distribute the bibs that the caddies will wear during the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bob McFaddin, a Sahalee club member, is overseeing a
group of 64 adult volunteers who will be supervising a litter
patrol of 100 teenagers. They call it the ecology committee.
Anything that doesn't make it into the 500 garbage bags posted
across the course and fastened to metal tripods is up to McFaddin's
troupe.
</P>
<P>
   It seems they have formed a team for just about everything.
There's a crew devoted to providing refreshments at the tee, a team
of 80 walking scorers, along with a leaderboard squad and a platoon
of greenside reporters who will stand inside the ropes recording
hole-by-hole scores with hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a group of volunteers assigned to keeping order in
the gallery, and another cast overseeing the 150 golf carts that
will be whizzing around.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is Bob Kelliher. He is the locker room chairman. He
has 15 people charged with showing the players where their lockers
are, suggesting good places to dine, taking their messages and
keeping their shoes shined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to make them happy,'' Keliher said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Bain, a Sahalee real estate agent, co-chairs the player
accommodations committee. She has been working for more than a year
lining up homes for the couple of dozen players _ most of them with
families _ who plan to stay at private houses rather than at nearby
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Bain said the house hunters are willing to pay Sahalee residents
around $3,000 for the week for the use of their home. For security
reasons, none of the residents, Bain added, are allowed to disclose
the name of the pro golfer using their dwelling until the
tournament is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the people renting out their homes plan to use
the money for furniture or a vacation trip,'' Bain said.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee general manager Tom Halsey said that meticulous
preparation has been a prelude to the rapid deployment going on
now. ``The past three years have been drudgery. The past 3{ weeks
have been great fun,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   If all is done well, MacIntosh doesn't believe many of the
25,000 spectators will even realize the effort it took to put the
tournament together.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not going to notice the facility,'' he said. ``They
are going to notice that it is a great event.''

CAREW NO STREAKS FAN

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Hitting coach Rod Carew now shares the Angels
club record for longest hitting streak at 25 consecutive games with
Garret Anderson, who singled in the ninth inning Tuesday to tie the
mark. It is the longest streak in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox hit in 24 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Garret Anderson putting together a run for the record,
Carew said he isn't one to get excited about hitting streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't mean much to me,'' said Carew, a seven-time batting
champion. ``I would rather get a bunch of hits in a short span of
time than a long hitting streak with 1 for 4's and 1 for 5's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if you're thinking about it, if you get a hit your
first time up, you're satisfied. But if I'd get one hit, I'd want
two and three.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Anderson has had his share of 1-for-4 games during his
streak, Carew said the Kennedy High graduate doesn't get
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his streak, a lot of his 1 for 4's have been big
hits,'' he said. ``Garret wants a hit every time up there. That's
his outlook. He's not satisfied. If he gets four at-bats, he wants
four hits. With that attitude, it takes all the pressure off the
hitting streak.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Trade deadline looms: Manager Terry Collins knows that Friday
is the trading deadline. But he prefers not to worry about what
might happen, even something as big as the rumored Jim
Edmonds-to-the-Mets-for-Mike Piazza deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Billy's (Bavasi, general manager) problem, not mine,''
Collins said. ``It can't be on my mind. I've gotten phone calls
about the Piazza thing, but I tell them I'm the wrong guy to talk
to. It's one thing to say, `Would you like to have him?' Who
wouldn't? But until someone new comes out here in an Angel uniform,
I can't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having the best record in baseball, the Yankees also are
looking to improve themselves with a trade, and even Randy
Johnson's name has been mentioned. But while Johnson would make the
Yankees seemingly unbeatable, Yankees manager Joe Torre says the
club has to be smart about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, a guy like that would be nice to have,'' Torre said.
``But if you make a deal to make yourself better, are you going to
hurt yourself somewhere else? That's treading water. You still have
to find out what the other end of the equation is.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Greene hitter: Todd Greene, playing first base and DH at
Triple-A Vancouver, is hitting .300 and ready to be promoted to the
big club. The problem is there is no room for him on the Angels'
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter from the (Pacific) Coast League, and they said
to get him out _ he's hit five or six home runs in 10 days,''
Collins said. ``I just talked to him (Monday) and told him we don't
have any spots. With what's happened to Chuck (Finley, hit on left
arm by line drive Friday), we've got to hang on to 12 pitchers. If
we stay healthy, in the next three or four days we've got to decide
what way we're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Randy Velarde (elbow) will begin a rehab
assignment at Triple-A Vancouver today. Pitcher Jack McDowell
(elbow) threw Tuesday and will begin a rebab assignment at Single-A
Lake Elsinore in the next three days. Pitcher Ken Hill (elbow) has
begun to throw split-finger fastballs, but there has not been a
date scheduled for him to begin a rehab assignement.

DODGERS TAKE CARE OF PHILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ While Tom Lasorda worked the phone Tuesday night
from his front-row box, the Los Angeles Dodgers worked over the
Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The players know the trade deadline is just three days away, but
they also know the Phillies are one of the teams ahead of them in
the National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Their 7-3 victory in front of 24,828 at Veterans Stadium wasn't
without a little ninth-inning tension. But in the end, the Dodgers
opened a critical 10-game road trip with the confidence of a team
making a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things aren't won in July, but you do things now that
can get some momentum going,'' said Eric Karros, who hit a two-run
homer in the first inning. ``This is a team that is ahead of us. If
we play well, things will take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda tried to do his part, talking to eight clubs about
everything from a No.1 or 2 starter to a left-fielder and a
left-handed hitter. With Ismael Valdes on the disabled list for two
weeks and probably longer with a strained left-side muscle,
pitching depth could be a major need down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   So far the players like what they've seen in Lasorda's
aggressive style. The acquisition of closer Jeff Shaw at the
All-Star break sent a message this difficult season was not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he made the Shaw trade, I think it showed us that he
wanted to win now,'' said Karros, critical in past seasons when the
team failed to make second-half moves. ``Players like to see that
and I think the feeling is he is trying to make the club better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's July 10 trade for left-hander Brian Bohanon (4-6)
showed more dividends Tuesday night. Bohanon allowed one earned run
in a season-high seven innings for his second consecutive victory.
Bohanon, who has made four starts since coming over from the New
York Mets, has a 2.78 ERA during that span and has limited opposing
batters to a .210 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Glenn Hoffman thinks Tuesday marked Bohanon's best
effort yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his first start (a 6-3 loss to San Diego), I said wait
until the next start,'' Hoffman said. ``After the second (a 4-1
loss to St. Louis), I said wait until the third. That one was
better (a 6-4 victory over Houston). But this one clearly showed us
what he can do. He got a lead and kept them off balance all night.
He threw over 100 pitches (111) and had his strongest inning at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon was bolstered by a three-run first inning, the highlight
of which was Karros' two-run homer against right-hander Tyler Green
(6-8). For Karros, it extended his hitting streak to seven games
(13 for 26) and gave him 58 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who had more than 30 homers and 100 RBI the past three
seasons, is on pace to drive in 89 runs. He has 13 homers.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers first, the Phillies never recovered. And this
is a team that had a couple of comeback victories while taking
three of four from Florida in its last series.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi had a two-run homer in the fifth, his 23rd, and the
Dodgers' 3-4-5 hitters (Mondesi, Gary Sheffield, Karros) finished
the game 6 for 9 with two doubles, two homers and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' No.1-2 hitters, Wilton Guerrero and Juan Castro,
combined for three walks and scored each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, those were the big guys,'' Hoffman said. ``We got the
long ball tonight, but we also manufactured runs. We've got to do
that to win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, who gave up a run in the first on Scott Rolen's 21st
homer and one in the second after an error by Guerrero at second,
was not surprised by his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the Mets last season, they gave me a chance to
make 13 consecutive starts,'' he said. ``I went at least five
innings in all of them. Knowing that you are going to go out there
every time is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as a fourth starter. I look at myself as a
guy who can do the job for you every time out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon turned the game over to Antonio Osuna, who walked a
batter but pitched a scoreless eighth. Scott Radinsky pitched the
ninth and Hoffman felt good enough to let newcomer Sean Maloney
throw in the bullpen. But when Radinsky allowed a run on three
hits, Maloney sat down and Shaw started throwing.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky recovered and the Dodgers went four games over .500 _
at 55-51 _ for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I see,'' said Mondesi, whose homer landed in the
seats just below the second deck. ``These are the teams we have to
beat.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over two solid days, the cream of this city's
civic leadership has courted the Democratic Party's national
convention for 2000 with every carrot at its command, and somewhere
between the margaritas and the mariachis, the exploding wall of
balloons and the flying angel, the intensity of the effort took on
a sweetly comic small-town air.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a chorus of irresistible inner-city children
serenaded the 50-odd members of the party's site-selection
committee Tuesday morning with the soothing strains of ``California
Dreamin,''' the message was clear: The Democrats would be safe and
warm ... if they were in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   For this much-mocked metropolis, winning a national political
convention for the first time since John Kennedy was nominated here
in 1960 would mean more than playing host to thousands of delegates
and journalists, with their attendant tourism and perhaps $150
million in spending. It would also amount to a kind of massive
international coming-out party for a city that has largely
rebounded from the economic, natural and social disasters of the
early '90s and is bursting to tell the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city frankly gets a bad rap in the Eastern press and the
international press,'' said Eli Broad, the billionaire chairman of
Sun America Inc. and one of a bevy of high-powered local leaders,
including the entertainment mogul David Geffen, recruited to lead
the city's lobbying effort and $35 million public-private pledge of
financial support for the convention. ``They think of the Simpson
trial, the recessed economy, the loss of aerospace and defense
jobs, and perceptions lag reality. We want the opportunity to show
what L.A. is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is not alone in wanting the psychic and economic
boost that a convention would bring, and though party officials say
it has a very good chance, senior Democrats both here and in
Washington say that Vice President Al Gore _ who will get the final
say _ has a definite fondness for Philadelphia, where his old
friend Mayor Edward Rendell is making his own strong pitch to
revive a city beleaguered by economic and social woes.
</P>
<P>
   The site-selection committee, which is also considering Denver,
Boston, Minneapolis, New Orleans and Miami and is to make a
recommendation late this year, was supposed to visit Philadelphia
last month. But it arrived only to find picket lines in place for a
bitter transit strike and decided to postpone its visit just hours
after it arrived. The strike has since been tentatively settled and
the visit is to be rescheduled for this fall, but the Angelenos are
pressing every perceived advantage, chief among them California's
54 electoral votes, which all experts agree any Democratic
candidate must now have to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we get it,'' said Susan Estrich, who managed Michael
Dukakis' 1988 campaign and is now a professor at the University of
Southern California law school, as she munched crispy rolled
taquitos at a welcoming reception for the committee in downtown Los
Angeles on Monday. Her reasoning: The nominee ``either comes here
in the summer, or he spends the whole fall here campaigning. He's
got to spend the spring here anyway raising money, so he might as
well come in the summer when he can do both effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, as the committee members toured the sprawling
Convention Center downtown, which would serve as media work space
and staging area for the convention, and saw a spiffy video on the
new Staples Arena, the state-of-the art stadium that is being built
just across the street and that would house the convention itself,
the visitors all got Los Angeles Kings hockey jerseys emblazoned
with their names and the number 54.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee members entered the cavernous convention center
through a wall of hundreds of balloons, which spelled out ``LA
2000'' and exploded on cue to let them pass, then sat down to a
breakfast of golden raspberries and other fresh fruits, smoked
scallops and salmon and wild mushroom hash with poached egg. Broad
stood up to welcome a performer, who was slowly lowered, feathery
angel wings and all, from the rafters of the glass-domed center,
bearing the city's official bid to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the committee had dinner on a converted sound
stage at Universal Studios. Tuesday afternoon, it toured the new
Getty Center and prepared for a dinner at Mayor Richard Riordan's
home before heading off to dance at the Conga Room, a new Latin
music nightclub partly owned by the actor Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city that has been the master of self-promotion since
colorful orange crate labels lured frozen Midwesterners here at the
turn of the century, the overall effect was oddly low key, low tech
and homey. The organizers missed no chance to emphasize the city's
racial and ethnic diversity, as a string of union workers from
various trades stepped up to make brief speeches beginning, ``I
want the 2000 Democratic National Convention because ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know what the outreach is in a city to minority
business, we want to know what the labor situation is,'' said
Rosalind Wyman, a Los Angeles native and the doyenne of California
Democratic politics, who is a member of the site-selection
committee and confesses a preference for her hometown. ``We care
about having an environmentally sensitive city, and whether there's
access for the disabled and whether the host committee is
broad-based. Obviously, I think we would put on an incredible
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are said to be leaning to cities in old-line
swing states like Chicago and Philadelphia, and at least some
Democratic officials have worried that the risk of coming to Los
Angeles is that liberal celebrities might overshadow the
proceedings. Then again, since no one expects conventions to decide
anything of importance in an age of primary elections, why not come
to the home of show business in hopes of at least producing
interesting television?
</P>
<P>
   ``The good reason to come here would be if you wanted to try and
re-invent the convention,'' Ms. Estrich said. ``That would be the
exciting challenge. Because the truth is, if they do it the old
way, no one will watch anyway.''

ANGELS LESS THAN PERFECT VS. YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If there is a formula for beating the New York
Yankees, it is to play perfect baseball. Obviously not an easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   On a pace to win a major-league record 120 games, the Yankees
make opposing teams pay for their mistakes, and Tuesday night
before 36,241 at Edison Field, they did just that to the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hit three home runs off Angels starter Jason Dickson
and took advantage of three Angels errors to come away with a 9-3
win. Yankees starter David Cone gave up three runs (one earned) and
six hits in seven innings to become the first 15-game winner in the
majors (15-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees improved to 74-26, their best record through 100
games in franchise history, one game better than the 1927 club and
only one game behind the best start by any team this century (the
1902 Pittsburgh Pirates were 75-25).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had been the only team in baseball with a winning
record against the Yankees this season _ winning two of the first
three _ before Tuesday. Now the season series is tied at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels remained alone in first place, one
game up on Texas in the A.L. West. The Yankees lead the A.L. East
by 15 games over Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made all three of their errors in the sixth inning,
including one by the usually sure-handed shortstop Gary DiSarcina.
Going into the three-game series against the Yankees, DiSarcina
said he knew that there was no room for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is you have to play error-free, mistake-free
baseball,'' he said. ``They're a team that constantly takes
advantage of everything you do wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can bring out the best in you, or make you fold up the
tent. They either bring you up to their level, or you go home.
That's what they do to you, they can embarrass you.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Darryl Strawberry and Bernie Williams homered off
losing pitcher Jason Dickson (9-8). Dickson gave up eight runs (six
earned) and 11 hits in 51/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only good signs were Tim Salmon's second-inning home
run _ his second homer in two days coming after a 30-game drought
without a homer _ and Garret Anderson's ninth-inning single, which
extended his hitting streak to 25 in a row, tying Rod Carew's club
record.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the Yankees starting lineup either drove in a run or
scored one. And that has been typical of the Yankees season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an incredibly talented team,'' DiSarcina said. ``They
don't have an MVP-type candidate on it. The thing you have to look
at is the depth they have. They've got guys coming off the bench
left and right. And the guys on the bench are just as good if not
better than than some of the starters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Jeter's home
run but did more damage in the second making the most of the little
things.
</P>
<P>
   The first six batters in the second inning reached base, but
only one hit the ball out of the infield _ Strawberry _ with a
two-run homer. The other five had three infield singles, a
bases-loaded walk and a batter who reached base when Dickson threw
too late trying to get the lead runner on a sacrifice attempt.
</P>
<P>
   It added up to four runs in the inning and a 5-0 Yankees lead,
but Dickson managed to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels cut the Yankees' lead to 5-1 when Salmon led off the
second inning with his 17th home run of the season. Singles by Jim
Edmonds and Darin Erstad _ with help from an error by Williams in
center field _ resulted in a run for the Angels in the third,
cutting their deficit to 5-2. But that would be as close as the
Angels would get.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' solo homer in the fifth off Dickson increased the
Yankees' lead to 6-2 and they scored three unearned runs in the
sixth, thanks to the errors by third baseman Dave Hollins,
DiSarcina and catcher Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored their final run after Erstad doubled and
scored on a throwing error by Jeter at shortstop.

AGASSI SERIOUS ABOUT REGAINING FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andre Agassi's week in Los Angeles began Monday
night with a comic doubles match for charity. He and Robin Williams
took on Patrick Rafter and Billy Crystal. Paparazzi lined the court
and for a change Agassi wasn't their No. 1 target.
</P>
<P>
   Williams played in goggles and camouflage pants. Crystal used a
tennis racket and a baseball glove. By the time anybody paid
attention to the score, Rafter and Crystal led 3-1. Agassi barked
at Williams in mock anger, ``Quit screwing around and get it
together!''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, about to serve, stared back at his straight man and
said sarcastically, ``Just 'cause you won WASHINGTON.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of Westsiders laughed at the gentle dig. Not
Wimbledon. WASHINGTON. The man who won Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S.
Open in '94 and the Australian Open in '95, came here as the winner
of last week's Legg Mason (who?) Classic in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Washington is not what made Agassi the most familiar
name in U.S. tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is winning matches like the one Tuesday night in which
Agassi defeated 20-year-old Bob Bryan of Camarillo 6-4, 6-3 in the
first round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at the Los Angeles Tennis
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But victories like these, and the 15 straight winning sets since
his second-round dismissal from Wimbledon in June, are what will
make another Grand Slam splash possible.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing his ranking drop as low as No. 141 in the world
last year, mainly through neglect, Agassi is moving quickly down
what he calls ``this road back.'' Convinced he has recaptured the
skills that made him No.1 before the '95 U.S. Open final loss to
Pete Sampras, he strives now for consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game is as good as it's ever been,'' Agassi said after
Tuesday night's victory. ``It's become a question of consistency,
so it can come out match after match.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Agassi lost to Justin Gimelstob in the first round of
the Los Angeles tournament, ``somewhat embarrassing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That and other on-court embarrassments inspired him to call an
end to the ``sabbatical'' that covered most of 1996 and '97,
coinciding with his engagement and marriage to Brooke Shields.
Well, who wouldn't be distracted?
</P>
<P>
   The comeback took him through places farther from Wimbledon than
even Washington. At his low point last December, he won a
minor-league tournament in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, now 28, though you're excused if you assumed he was 10
years older, has been the Truman Burbank of the tennis world since
he came on the scene in 1986. The first star to have grown up
entirely in the era since Connors and Evert and
tennis-as-soap-opera, he's a sweet-natured guy who has been made to
face all of life's temptations, distractions and corruptions with
the camera rolling for our entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas upbringing, the prize-fighter-size entourage, the
incredible wealth, the ``Image is Everything'' commercials, the
Hollywood romances, the wild fluctuations in weight and hair length
_ all are topics for our discussion and judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the wild fluctuations in Agassi's world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he lost in the semifinals in Adelaide to
now-156th-ranked Lleyton Hewitt, in round one at the French to No.
75 Marat Safin, and in round two at Wimbledon to No. 40 Tommy Haas.
</P>
<P>
   But victories in San Jose (beating Sampras in the final) and
Scottsdale, Ariz., and his current streak have lifted his ranking
to No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Agassi has been blowing through matches as if his
private 727 is double-parked. In his seven straight match
victories, he has needed barely more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, the NCAA singles champion from Stanford, gave his boyhood
hero a tougher _ and longer _ time than Agassi might have expected.
Any of five break points against Agassi could have made it 4-4 in
the second, but he finally put that game away with his 11th ace.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi will play Jan-Michael Gambill in the second round of the
four-round tournament at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing very well. I think I can step on the court with
anybody and expect to win,'' said Agassi, who plans to play
tournaments in Toronto, Cincinnati and Indianapolis between now and
the start of the U.S. Open on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely worked myself into enough of a hole where I had
some doubts about whether I could come back. (But) I think it's
realistic to go to the Open and expect to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   He quit screwing around and got it together. Now, is there any
hope for Robin Williams?

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A single player stands between George Steinbrenner and
the 1998 World Series. And unless Mariner ownership loses its guts
again, he just pitched his last game in a Seattle uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee owner has long coveted Randy Johnson, for reasons
evident Tuesday night. In a valiant finale, Johnson struck out 12
and gave up four hits. But since two were home runs, he lost 4-3 to
the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the end of an epic sports career in Seattle, 31,124
stood and pounded palms for Johnson's last long strides from the
Kingdome mound. Regardless of the bitterness of the last year and
its 9-10 mark, the legacy is grander than the ledger: He helped
change forever the fate of major league ball in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems destined to be the hood ornament on the Yankee
steamroller. Steinbrenner almost always gets what he wants. Even
when he doesn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   At 74-26, the Yankees have been so smashing this season that
even Godzilla is two skyscrapers behind in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner knows baseball history is littered with
regular-season dreadnoughts whose ribs poke from the postseason
mud. He also knows if the eager Indians get Johnson, or even if he
stays in Seattle while the Mariners finally play to their
capabilities, the Yankees could face in the postseason the one
pitcher who can shut down their formidable lineup in the first and
fifth games of a division series.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly all that was built _ one of the great seasons in Yankee
and baseball history _ would be in jeopardy. For the tempestuous
Steinbrenner and New York's perpetually hyperventilating fans and
media, it would be better to never have gone at all than to enter
the postseason with magnum expectations and fail.
</P>
<P>
   So acquiring Johnson is Steinbrenner's insurance policy against
the biggest player threat to a second World Series appearance in
three years. Remember, too, that Steinbrenner is in an extortionist
caterwaul with Big Apple politicians over a new stadium, so the
stakes are higher. In New York, leverage is as valued and hard to
come by as a parking space.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Mariner management, after ham-fisting the
Johnson affair for more than a year, might be afforded an
opportunity to salvage something worthwhile because in New York,
too much is never enough.
</P>
<P>
   Any trade won't be Johnson's equivalent, of course. That doesn't
exist. But given how ownership and Johnson's own petulance have
diminished him in Seattle, the prospect of getting a quality
starter such as Hideki Irabu would be a move that not only doesn't
represent a surrender of the '98 season, it might be an improvement
in team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella claimed Tuesday he is out of the loop
regarding trade talks until a deal is in hand, but acknowledged
that ``it will be a very interesting four days'' up to Friday's
non-waiver trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the hypothetical about the dicey prospect of trading
superstars, Piniella said, ``The final determination is what you
get in return. I don't have to get sold on a trade. It's my job to
get the best out of the talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization will do what is best for the ballclub. I'm
very confident with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many share Piniella's view, given the decision-making
paralysis that has gripped ownership since it has been on the hook
for the breathtaking cost overruns on America's most expensive
ballyard.
</P>
<P>
   But this little nuisance of the 1998 season has reached a
crossroads that begs ownership's attention. Even though the Big
Unit's fate should never have come down this way, it's obvious that
his place on the team is beyond rescue.
</P>
<P>
   His rambling monologue Monday on a Seattle radio station was
riddled with defensiveness, confusion, contradiction and silliness.
Just imagine what might happen to the next teammate who commits the
clubhouse crime of TURNING UP THE STEREO!!!
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's time in Seattle has come to an end, which is sad and a
shame. He was, and is, the greatest pitcher in club history, one of
the nation's most compelling sports figures who made each
appearance a happening.
</P>
<P>
   The causes for his decay have been well-chronicled. Blame has
been fervently dished. Anxiety is profound and well-deserved, given
what has happened when the Mariners trade stars (see Omar Vizquel
and Tino Martinez).
</P>
<P>
   But the last three trading deadlines have seen the Mariners swap
youngsters for veterans in failed attempts to make the World
Series. The well of expendable talent has dried up. The club has to
get younger and fill multiple holes.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions and the baseball history around Johnson have to
become secondary to a reloading project, in order to avoid a
rebuilding project.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland GM John Hart has consistently rattled the baseball
world with his trades of marquee players. But the Indians have
remained among the elites because most of his risk-taking has
worked by gaining talent of equal or greater value.
</P>
<P>
   If reports of Steinbrenner's eagerness are accurate, ownership
needs to take the handcuffs off Woody Woodward, endure the wrath of
Johnson's many fans and the loss of some electric history, and take
the risk that Irabu likes loud music.

   So one only wonders what dark emotional depths the Croation was
exploring Tuesday afternoon after a straight-sets loss to France's
Guillame Raoux at the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all anyone could do was wonder, because Ivanisevic the
Irritable wasn't talking after Raoux ousted him 6-4, 6-4 in a
first-round match at Los Angeles Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Ivanisevic had already said it all DURING the match,
when he held an impromptu debate with umpire Bjorn Bork, muttered
to linesmen and on one occasion slammed his racket into the
sea-blue Pacific Pave.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear is that Ivanisevic had barely touched a racket
since Pete Sampras beat him in England, an event so devastating
that the Croat said afterward, ``I cannot cheer anybody now. I can
only kill myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Only his game was dead Tuesday, to the delight of Raoux, who
registered the tournament's second upset of the day by knocking off
the No. 3 seed. Sixth-seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa also
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like someone who practiced hard for three
weeks,'' said Raoux, who beat Ivanisevic for the first time in
three tries. ``It was very tough for him to lose the (Wimbledon)
final. Maybe he's still thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic never had control of his game, or his emotions, and
his vaunted serve was erratic. His 14 aces were offset by eight
points lost on double faults in the second set, including three
straight in the third game (which he won anyway).
</P>
<P>
   It was during that marathon game, which went to deuce five
times, that Ivanisevic began to unravel. He kicked the ball after
squandering the advantage the second time, and after the third lost
opportunity he sat on the net post and chatted with Bork, while
Raoux waited patiently at his end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion ended after Ivanisevic grabbed a bottle of water,
opened it and handed it to the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for his mistakes,'' Raoux said. Of Ivanisevic's
antics, he said, ``It's part of the game. I don't care. I just
concentrate on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, ranked 17th in the world, was scheduled to play an
evening doubles match, paired with Paul Kilderry against Doug Flach
and Michael Tebbutt.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Henman of England, a Wimbledon semifinalist, was only the
third seeded player to win this week. The No. 2 seed easily
defeated Grant Stafford of South Africa 6-3, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   With seeded players falling, and two having dropped out with
injury (Sampras and Thomas Enqvist), Henman's first L.A. appearance
might become a memorable one. He's not assuming anything, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are very good (seeded) players that have lost.... Those
are so-called upsets, but when you've got (Andre) Agassi and
(Patrick) Rafter in the draw, that shows the depth of men's
tennis,'' Henman said.
</P>
<P>
   In other matches Tuesday: Sargis Sargsian of Armenia defeated
Ferreira 6-1, 6-2; eighth seed Vincent Spadea of Chicago defeated
Marcos Ondruska of South Africa 2-6, 6-3, 6-3; Manhattan Beach's
Jeff Tarango defeated Mexico's Alejandro Hernandez 6-2, 6-2, and
Santa Monica's Michael Joyce defeated Australian Michael Tebbutt
7-5, 2-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the late match, No. 1 seed Patrick Rafter of Australia beat
Ramon Delgado of Paraguay 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Australian Sandon Stolle (subbing for injured No. 4
seed Thomas Enqvist) defeated 17-year-old Taylor Dent of Newport
Beach 6-3, 6-2.

YANKEES TROUNCE ANGELS, 9-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Before David Cone falls asleep, he carefully
positions his body, lying on his left side or back, so that his
right arm rests free. When he wakes each morning, Cone will slowly
lift his right arm, to see how it feels.
</P>
<P>
   It's pitchers' roulette, in a sense, for there may come a day
when Cone won't be able to raise his arm above his head in the
morning, like last year, when he needed surgery. But now Cone is
throwing as well as he ever has. He became the first 15-game winner
in the major leagues on Tuesday night, giving up six hits in seven
innings as the Yankees whipped the Anaheim Angels, 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   In their 100th game of the season, the Yankees achieved their
74th victory, and if they win merely half of their remaining games,
they will finish the year with 105 victories. Their magic number
for clinching a playoff spot is down to 40.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who opened the season here with back-to-back
losses, barreled into Edison Field and flattened the Angels with
absolute precision and purpose. Derek Jeter launched the game's
fourth pitch for a home run, and Paul O'Neill lined the fifth pitch
off the rump of Anaheim's Jason Dickson. The Yankees added four
more runs in the second inning _ Darryl Strawberry blasting a
two-run homer, his 16th _ and three in the sixth, all of it far
more than Cone required.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (15-3) allowed more runs on Tuesday night than he had in
any start in more than a month, but he was in total command. He
never went to a two-ball, no-strike count in the first six innings,
and only twice did an Angels hitter work the count to 3-1 in that
time, never 3-0. Cone was never forced into a situation where he
had to throw a fastball, where he had to throw a pitch the hitter
was anticipating. The Angels were guessing all night long, and
faring quite poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out six, continuing his recent success. Over his
last 11 starts before Tuesday night's, Cone compiled a 9-2 record
and a 1.96 earned run average, walking only 15 batters in 731/3
innings and striking out 86. Opponents batted .192 in that time,
with just 5 hits in 44 at-bats (.114) with runners in scoring
position. His era has decreased in every start but one since May
19, and his pitches per inning _ a barometer of his control and
effectiveness _ had dropped from 20.93 on April 18 to 16.08 before
Tuesday night.

JOHNSON FANS 12, BUT INDIAN HOMERS DO HIM IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Brilliant, but fallible.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson was all of that Tuesday night. His longwinding
Mariner career could be summed up in a similar fashion as well.
Finally, it might be time to write the epithet.
</P>
<P>
   In what easily could have been his Seattle farewell, the lefty
threw one too many fastballs to Manny Ramirez in the sixth inning
and David Bell in the eighth, and watched as their home runs
carried the Cleveland Indians to a 4-3 victory at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the unhappy one toyed with a no-hitter, then a
shutout. He permitted only four hits. But befitting his crumbling
image in Seattle, Johnson came away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Pinstripes, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   With rumors ripe that Johnson might be bound for the Big Apple
and the Yankees, he locked in a superb pitching duel with
Cleveland's Charles Nagy. For 52/3 innings, they kept everyone
scoreless. Ramirez and Bell spoiled the going-away party, if that
is what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching a complete game, Johnson left to a standing ovation
from the 31,124 in the stands. The reception inside the Mariner
clubhouse, however, more resembled a funeral procession as players
considered the possibility of life after the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but feel it,'' designated hitter Edgar Martinez
said. ``He's a friend. He means a lot to people in this clubhouse.
You think about all the good times we've had, and it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ken Griffey Jr.: ``Until they say he's traded or done
something else, he's still part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of course, had nothing to say. He quietly dressed, took
a swig of a beer and avoided postgame interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners (48-57) squandered a great opportunity to pick up
ground in the AL West race, as front-running Texas and Anaheim were
both losers Tuesday. Instead, they sit nine games back. The
repercussions of the latest Seattle setback might have speeded
Johnson's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shame to lose this game,'' Mariner pitcher Jeff
Fassero said. ``If we can win the next two and be 6{ games out of
first, I can't see them getting rid of him. I think what happens
the rest of this series will dictate what they do with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Lou Piniella: ``Whatever happens is going to
happen. We'll just have to wait and see. ... I think it's been a
distraction, but outside of that, we've still got to go out and
play. One way or another, it will be over soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Against a watered-down Indian lineup _ Kenny Lofton, among
others, didn't start _ Johnson was at his best the first two times
through the order. Then he ran into a few trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez leaned into a 2-0 pitch and sliced one onto the aisleway
in right, where a balding man in shorts made an awkward grab. Bell,
who had reached on a fielder's choice, and Omar Vizquel, who had
walked, scored ahead of the slugger, who collected his 23rd homer,
and the Indians had an instant 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners made it 3-2 in the seventh when Jay Buhner singled
home Martinez and David Segui with no outs, causing Nagy's exit.
But a double-play grounder snuffed more possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, as he has all season, then suffered a critical letdown
against an unlikely opponent in the eighth inning. He served up a
first-pitch homer to Bell, Cleveland's No. 9 hitter, and what would
be the game-deciding run. The ball sailed about 10 rows up in the
left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners pulled within one in the bottom half of the inning,
when Griffey reached on a high chopper to second, stole his 14th
base and scored on Martinez's single to center. But the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson faced the minimum number of hitters through four
innings, permitting just one baserunner, Vizquel. Leading off, the
former Mariner walked and was caught in a rundown after Ramirez
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The no-hit bid ended in the fifth. Leading off, Travis Fryman
slugged an 0-2 pitch high off the blue wall in right, off a credit
card advertisement, for a double. Buhner, the Mariner right
fielder, conceded the hit early in its flight, backpedaling from
the wall almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (9-10) finished with 12 strikeouts, the 95th time he has
done that in his career. He whiffed former Mariner Mark Whiten
three times.
</P>
<P>
   His final batter Tuesday, was Bell, whom he retired on a popup
to second. Of course, he made things difficult to the end, loading
the bases after retiring the first two hitters. Then he walked off
to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very nice gesture,'' Piniella said. ``We'll see if
it was ill-founded or not.''

   The last gunslinger: Legendary Texas Sammy Baugh
</P>
<P>
   is final link to football's Hall of Fame pioneers
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ROTAN _ Sam Baugh is not sure about the exact day he received the
telephone call at his ranch, only that it was in June of 1997. An
officer with the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, was
calling to tell him that Don Hutson had died.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh thanked him and hung up the telephone. He sat down in the
recliner in his den, and for a few moments he thought about Hutson,
the Green Bay Packers receiver who was one of the greatest players
in pro football history. Then, he thought about some of the others
_ Red Grange, Jim Thorpe, Bronko Nagurski, George Halas, Ernie
Nevers and Curley Lambeau.
</P>
<P>
   Like Baugh, they were pioneers of pro football and among the 17
members of the original class of inductees into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame. But there was one difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already seen on television that Hutson had died,'' Baugh
says now, pausing to spit a stream of tobacco juice into a large
cup. ``But when he said, `You know, Sam, you're the last survivor,'
I was shocked. I knew a lot of the others had died, but I sure
didn't know I was the last. You know, it feels kind of strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh, 84, is quiet for a few seconds as he runs a hand through
his thinning gray hair. When he is asked how it feels to be the
last survivor, he leans forward, slaps his thigh and says with a
laugh, `Well, in this case, last is a hell of a lot better than
first.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Adrian Baugh, ``Slingin' Sammy'' in football lore, is a
genuine Texas legend. Born in Temple, he played all sports through
his first year at Temple High School. Then, the Santa Fe Railroad
moved his father to Sweetwater, where Baugh continued to play
football, baseball and basketball. Back then, he was better at
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh got the nickname ``Slingin''' from a Fort Worth
sportswriter when he played at TCU. The nickname didn't come from
the way he threw a football. It came from the way he threw a
baseball from third base to first.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh played for Dutch Meyer at TCU at a time when the Horned
Frogs were a national power. His understudy was Davey O'Brien, who
won the Heisman Trophy his senior year. By then, Baugh had already
become one of the best and most famous pro football players in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh became an almost mythical figure in the Washington, D.C.,
area during his 16-year career (1937-52) with the Redskins. He is
the greatest player in Redskins history. He led Washington to two
league championships and five division titles. His number 33 is the
only number the Redskins have retired. Before Jack Kent Cooke died,
he named a level of the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium that opened last
year after Baugh, who still owns 11 team records and shares four
more. The Redskins invited him to the opening ceremonies, but Baugh
never spends a night away from the ranch anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met Mr. Cooke, but I'm honored,'' he says. ``I truly
am. I appreciate everything people want me to do, but I just don't
want to leave home any more than I have to. And I don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Baugh has been out of football for 46 years, he is
still the NFL record-holder in five categories, and he is tied for
first in five more.
</P>
<P>
   NFL historians say Baugh was the first great passer, and his
rambunctious, daredevil style changed the game. The Redskins used
the single-wing formation early in Baugh's career. He was the
tailback who took the snap and had the option to throw, run or hand
off. Usually, he threw. From all over the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been the first one to realize that if you stayed in
the pocket waiting for a receiver to get open, you could get
killed,'' Baugh says. ``That's why I threw on the run so much. Give
me a quarterback who can move to avoid the rush any day. That's why
if I were picking one today, it would be Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the league, not only were helmets optional,
but you could hit the quarterback until the whistle blew. If I
threw a short pass to a receiver and he zigged and zagged 75 yards
for a touchdown, I had four sumbitches chasing me in the other
direction. All defensive linemen were told to knock me in the dirt
to get me out of the game. Another rule said that if you were
injured and left the game, you couldn't return until the next
quarter. If you could walk, you stayed on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '40s, the Redskins finally switched to the modern
T-formation, and Baugh was even better. He and the Chicago Bears'
Sid Luckman were the premier quarterbacks of their era, and they
remain two of the greatest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Teams had 23-man rosters in those days. Baugh played safety and
punted, too. He is still the NFL's all-time punting leader,
probably the best in history. In 1943, he had perhaps the greatest
season of any pro football player. He led the league in passing
(133-of-239 for 1,754 yards, 23 touchdowns), punting (45.9 yards
per kick) and interceptions (11). He played every minute of every
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To his friends and business associates, he is just Sam Baugh.
That's how he signs his name to the hundreds of pieces of
memorabilia that fans and collectors still send him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always wanted me to sign `Slingin' Sammy Baugh,'''
he says as he carefully signs three footballs. ``But I can sign
`Sam Baugh' twice as fast. And I try to sign everything. It just
may take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The requests are stacked in a corner of his den, sometimes to
the ceiling. Every month or two, his daughter or one of his four
daughters-in-law will spread out everything on a table for him to
sign. Baugh gets many offers to attend card shows that have become
so lucrative to so many former players, but he politely declines
them all.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh has been offered as much as $20,000 to sign his name for
two hours in Dallas and Fort Worth but, smiling, he says, ``I
wouldn't trust any sumbitch that claimed he was going to pay me
that much money to sign my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh hasn't flown since his two-year career as an Oilers head
coach and assistant coach ended after the 1965 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had four bad experiences on planes,'' he says. ``The last
one came my last year with the Oilers. We had a bad flight to
Oakland, and I said, `God, if you just get me through this flight,
when the season's over, I'll never fly again.' And I haven't. And I
hate trains almost as much as airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, executives from the Pro Football Hall of
Fame tried to lure Baugh back to Canton for the annual induction
ceremonies. They offered to bring him by plane, train or
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, it didn't seem like such a big deal,'' he says
about his enshrinement. ``It was the first year, and there was only
one building. I don't remember there being a particularly big
turnout. I appreciate it more now than I did then. I'd really like
to go back and see it now because I've heard so much about it, but
I'll never do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invited me for a long time, but I think they finally gave
up. I haven't been back since the year they inducted me (1963).
Shoot, I haven't even been back to Washington since my career
ended. I mean, damn, why would I want to leave here?''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh doesn't go anywhere he can't be back at home by sunset.
Since his wife, Edmonia, died in 1990, he has lived alone on his
8,000-acre ranch outside of Rotan, a town of 1,913 about 40 miles
east of Snyder and 25 miles north of Sweetwater. He has two dogs
and a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh owns three ranches in three counties, about 22,000 acres
in all. But the one he lives on is special. He bought it in 1940.
His five children, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren
meet at his ranch every Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The Double Mountains form the backdrop. One sits on his
property. The Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos is near his front
gate. Not too far away is Post, where the caprock begins. The
caprock escarpment is the dividing line between the High Plans and
the Lower Rolling Plains of West Texas. This red-brush country is
part of Baugh, whose hobbies are golf and dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive to Snyder to play golf three or four days a week,'' he
says. ``I took up golf in my 50s, when I couldn't get on and off my
horse any more because of a bad knee. God, I love the game. I never
play on weekends, though, because I like to watch golf on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to watch pro football, too. I still love the game. But
I don't like crowds. You can't find a better seat than right in
front of my television.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baugh played, he was called a long, tall Texan. He was 6-2,
190. He weighs less now, but his lean body is as solid as rock. His
face isn't as weathered as you might expect from someone who has
spent so much time in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh's ranch isn't a museum to his pro football career. Even
though he played 16 years with the same shoulder pads, he didn't
take them when he retired. A visitor wouldn't even know Baugh
played pro football if not for a small room at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The small bookshelf is covered with trophies and awards, some
hidden behind others. One wall has plaques and pictures
commemorating Baugh's career. When he is asked which one he
treasures most, Baugh reaches behind a huge football trophy and
pulls out a certificate and $10 bill that have been framed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one,'' he says proudly about his first hole-in-one.
</P>
<P>
   He hesitates a few seconds, looks around the room and says,
``Well, I guess if I could save only one, this would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh holds up a trophy he received for being named to the NFL's
75th Anniversary Team. He didn't attend that ceremony, either.
Actually, the last night he spent away from home was in 1993 when a
friend drove him to Fort Worth so TCU could retire his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Aggies just beat the hell out of us,'' he says,
bursting into laughter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baugh laughs easily. To say his language is salty is an
understatement. He uses curse words like most people use ``the,''
``and'' or ``but.'' But the words aren't offensive. They actually
add flavor. He is a master storyteller, and when he gets wound up,
he uses his hands for emphasis, slaps his thigh a lot and shakes
his head at the freshness of the memories. A chaw of tobacco is
always in his cheek, and he stops from time to time to spit.
</P>
<P>
   Time may have dimmed the exact years, but the actual moments are
as clear as if they happened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Baugh talk about such legends as Cool Papa Bell,
the Gashouse Gang, Ted Williams, Babe Ruth, Bronko Nagurski and
Gene Autry is like being in a time machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I took my last exam at TCU, I didn't wait to get my
diploma,'' Baugh says. ``I told them to mail it to me. I couldn't
wait to get to Pampa and play on a semipro all-star team, the Pampa
Roadrunners. I'd played third base my whole life, but the manager
moved me to shortstop so he could put this guy at third base. I
don't remember his name, only that he'd been cut by the Washington
Senators and he was trying to make it back. As it turned out, that
was a good move for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, we went to Denver for a big national semipro
tournament that was played every year. If you lost one game, you
went home. As soon as I saw this one team from the east, I knew we
weren't going to win that tournament. It was a team from the Negro
League. Turns out they had won that tournament every year. No
wonder. They had players like Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige and Cool
Papa Bell. I've never seen a finer collection of ballplayers
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won our first two games, and then we played the Negro
League all-stars. During that game, Cool Papa Bell hit a line drive
to left-center field. He was so damn fast. He rounded for first and
headed for second, but when the ball bounced high and the center
fielder knocked it down, Cool Papa took off for third. The ball and
Cool Papa arrived at third base at the same time. He went in with
his spikes up and hit that sumbitch right in the face. The third
baseman rolled backward a few feet and was out cold. Blood was
gushing out of his face like oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, players from both teams came charging out of
the dugouts with bats. They start swinging at heads. Hell, I don't
mind telling you I've never been so damn scared in my life. I'd
never seen anything like that. Guys without bats would throw up
their arms to keep from getting hit in the face, and their arms and
fingers would be broken. I've never seen a bloodier bunch of people
than I saw that day. There were only four or five policemen, and
they couldn't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This big guy about 6-6, a pitcher I think, came after me at
shortstop. I thought, `What in the hell am I going to do?' When he
got to me, he grabbed my jersey. I grabbed his jersey. We just held
on to each other and watched the fight in front of us. When we took
a step, it would be backward. When the fight finally stopped, so
many people were hurt. They canceled the game and the rest of the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh returned to Sweetwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually signed a baseball contract before I signed a
football contract,'' he says. ``I had been scouted by Rogers
Hornsby. The Cardinals wanted to sign me. He told me he couldn't
sign me, that I'd have to go to Greenville, S.C., where Mr. Branch
Rickey was and sign with him. So I did. But I told Mr. Rickey that
I was going to play football first, and he agreed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After moving from Boston, the Redskins played their first season
in Washington in 1937. Baugh was their No. 1 pick. The owner,
George Preston Marshall, was a promoter and innovator who was
loathed by many of his players. The Redskins were the last team to
integrate, and Marshall was praised in some circles and vilified in
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Marshall got asked all the time when he was going to get
some black players for the Redskins, and his response was the same
every damn time,'' Baugh says. ``He'd say, `The Redskins will have
black players when the Harlem Globetrotters have white players.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Marshall always treated me well. After they drafted me, he
called and offered me $5,000 to sign. At the time, their star
players were making $2,750 a year. We were coming out of the
Depression years, and no one made a lot of money at that time. I
called my coach at TCU, Dutch Meyer, and asked him what I should
do. He told me that was a lot of money, more than they'd paid
anybody. So I called up Mr. Marshall and asked for $8,000. He asked
if I'd sign then, and I said yes. He agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me when I arrived in Washington, he wanted me to be
wearing a 10-gallon hat and cowboy boots. I told him hell no. I
could see what was coming. I told him I didn't own any, but I
really did. He told me to go to the store and get some, and he'd
pay for them. So I got a new hat and boots, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baugh's rookie season, the Redskins beat the Bears in Chicago
to win the league championship. Baugh was the toast of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we won the title, Mr. Marshall and Mr. (George) Halas
scheduled three exhibition games in January to make extra money,''
he says. ``Near the end of the game in Miami, I broke my sternum.
I've still never felt such pain. I couldn't let them operate
because I was supposed to report to spring training with the
Cardinals in March. Naturally, when I got to spring training, I
couldn't throw or hit because of my sternum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said my baseball career ended after one season because
I couldn't hit a curveball, but hell, who could have hit with a
broken sternum?''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh went to spring training in St. Petersburg, Fla., to play
shortstop with the Cardinals, a time when they were known as the
Gashouse Gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I roomed with Joe Medwick,'' he says. ``He was the best hitter
the Cardinals had. They said he was the only hitter in their system
who could hit any pitch a pitcher could throw. They told us to
watch him in batting practice. Dizzy and Paul Dean were down the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy that really tried to help me was their third baseman,
Pepper Martin. He'd played football somewhere, and he'd bring a
football to pr to practice and ask me to throw it to him. We'd
throw it before practice, and he could really catch that ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That season, my minor-league career started at Columbus, Ohio.
Edmonia and I had just gotten married, and one of my new teammates
had also just gotten married. We lived on the same street and
became good friends. His wife still sends me cards every birthday
and tells me about their grandchildren. Who was he? Let me put it
like this: When I watched Marty Marion play for the first time, I
knew I'd never play shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been while he was with the Cardinals, or it may have
been later _ Baugh isn't exactly sure _ but he did form an opinion
about Babe Ruth, the greatest player in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something,'' he says. ``His image wasn't too
damn good. He did just what he wanted. If they went back and
checked into everything he got into, they might throw him out of
the Hall of Fame. They won't let Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame.
Hell, I've talked to a lot of people who said Babe Ruth did a whole
lot worse than Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh will never forget the first time he laid eyes on Ted
Williams, who had yet to become known as The Splendid Splinter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Columbus, we played the Red Sox farm team,'' he says.
``Williams was a big kid, but he was only 17 or 18. We had a bunch
of older players on our team, and they hated that sumbitch.
Williams played right field. Now, I'd never seen anything like
this, and I still haven't, but when they were in the field,
Williams would take off his glove, put it in his back pocket, turn
his back to the infield and start doing exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh jumps out of his chair and starts doing jumping jacks.
He's laughing so hard he starts coughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm serious,'' he says. ``That sumbitch would do that when the
batter was walking to the plate. When the pitcher was ready to
pitch, Williams would turn around, put on his glove and be ready. I
couldn't believe it. We wondered why his manager would let him get
away with antics like that. We finally figured it out. The big boys
in Boston must have told the manager to leave that kid alone
because they knew they were going to make a good living off him for
a long time. And they were right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, could that kid hit. He hit line drives you could hang
clothes on. He'd smash balls so hard we'd hear planks coming out of
the outfield fence before we could turn around. He could do
anything he wanted on a baseball field.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baugh didn't need baseball because he was a star in football,
but he did need extra money to help pay for the ranch he and
Edmonia bought in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I wouldn't turn down a chance to make money,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he accepted an offer to go to Hollywood to star in
King of the Texas Rangers, a serial that ran for 12 weeks on
Saturday mornings in movie theaters around the country. The story
line had Baugh going from Texas to California to avenge the death
of his father. His sidekick was Duncan Renaldo, who went on to
become famous as the Cisco Kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, we couldn't film because Duncan had gone to the
courthouse to be sworn in as a U.S. citizen,'' Baugh says. ``He was
a big enough star at that time to attract a lot of media attention.
When he came out of the courthouse, he stopped on the steps for a
press conference. Someone asked Duncan what he had to say about
becoming a U.S. citizen, and I'll never forget what he said: `I
think we should keep all the foreigners out of the country.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When we'd take lunch breaks, I never ate with the other
actors. I always ate lunch with the technicians because they told
me some great stories. They had all the gossip. I've never
understood this, but they all hated Gene Autry. I don't know why.
Gene Autry was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny because those technicians told me they knew a
young guy who was going to be as big as Autry in a couple of years.
They told me I'd never heard of him, but that I would because he
was going to be a big star. And they were right. His name was Roy
Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh loved baseball, and he took that acting job for the money,
but he excelled at football like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Povich, the legendary Washington Post sports editor who
recently died at age 91, chronicled Baugh's career. Baugh was sad
to learn about Povich's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Shirley got me in trouble my rookie year,'' Baugh says,
chuckling at the memory. ``He asked me if I'd write a column for
the Post. I told him I could hardly talk, much less write. He said
he'd write it for me and put my name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went fine at first, but one time he had me writing about a
quarterback from Oklahoma State, I think, and he had me saying that
guy was better than David O'Brien. Are you kidding me? After that,
I was lucky to be able to come back to Texas, much less TCU. I
canceled that column right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Flaherty, also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
was Baugh's first and best coach in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dutch Meyer was the best damn coach I ever had,'' Baugh
says. ``I learned everything from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Football historians say Baugh was never blessed with great
receivers. Bones Taylor, who followed Baugh as a coach with the
Oilers, was the best. Baugh made average receivers look good. He
could be cantankerous on occasion, but he also had a sharp wit and
a great sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a Redskins rookie offensive lineman was introduced to
Baugh, the lineman said, ``Gee, whiz. I've always dreamed of
playing with the great Sammy Baugh.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Baugh responded, ``You knock the hell out of those
defensive linemen, and I'll dream of you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most lopsided championship game in NFL history, the Bears
beat the Redskins 73-0 in 1940. The Redskins had beaten the Bears
7-3 three weeks earlier. On the opening drive of that championship
game, Baugh drove the Redskins down the field and threw a perfect
pass that would have been a touchdown, but the receiver dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked now what the score might have been if the Redskins had
scored first, Baugh smiles, spits and says, ``73-6.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bears never had a bad team in the 16 years I played,'' he
says. ``Halas was a great coach, and he had great players. Unlike
other teams, when we played the Bears, they didn't assign anyone to
block me at free safety. I didn't understand it. One year, I asked
Bronko Nagurski, who was a hell of a nice guy off the field, why
they didn't have anybody try to block me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bronko said, `Because Mr. Halas wants to use the extra blocker
to help me get through the line. Then, I'm supposed to run over
you.' Halas didn't think I could tackle Bronko, who was real big
(6-2, 225) back then. Most of the time, he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   As a safety, Baugh had to tackle such backs as Nagurski,
Cleveland's Marion Motley, Philadelphia's Steve Van Buren,
Detroit's Doak Walker and the Chicago Cardinals' Charley Trippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nagurski was the toughest,'' Baugh says without hesitation.
``He was big, strong and powerful. He had a way of dipping his
shoulder so you couldn't get a big lick on him. He'd use his arm or
turn his body a certain way. When the field was frozen, I just
tried to run up and hit him like I was blocking him, and I always
hoped I could knock him off balance. If you tried to tackle him,
he'd knock the living hell out of you. Hell, I used to get hurt
more on defense than offense.''
</P>
<P>
   One memory remains especially vivid to Baugh. In his fifth
season, the Redskins were playing a late-season game against
Philadelphia at Griffiths Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat the Eagles, but that's not what I remember most about
the game,'' he says. ``What I'll never forget is how the (public
address) announcer kept interrupting play by calling out people's
names. We kept on playing, but that hadn't happened before, not
when we had the ball. I'd be calling signals, and he'd be calling
out names and saying some other stuff. Hell, I couldn't tell what
it was. We talked about it on the sideline and tried to figure it
out, but no one had any answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I picked up the paper the next morning that I
realized he'd been calling out officers and telling them to report
for duty because Pearl Harbor had been bombed. The coaches had been
instructed (by the owners) not to tell us about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Baugh's career, he was helping develop his
replacement, Eddie LeBaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably stuck around a couple of years too long, but Mr.
Marshall wanted me to help Eddie,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   LeBaron was only 5-7, but he was a master ballhandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Bones Taylor one time how Eddie was doing,'' Baugh
says. ``Bones said, `He's doing real good, but he's so short, it's
like he's throwing from a well.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, treasure hunters _ professional and amateur _
stop by Baugh's house and tell him they think there is gold and
silver in the Double Mountains. They ask for permission to dig in
his mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I tell them is that if they strike it rich, I get a cut,''
he says. ``If there's four of them, I get a fifth. If there's five
of them, I get a sixth. I get a kick out of them. You know what? I
don't think there's any damn gold or silver in those mountains. The
only sumbitch getting rich is the guy who makes the maps.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of days of telling tales, Baugh escorts two
visitors to their car parked at the side of his house. He has made
them two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he says as he gazes across the landscape, ``people
say, `Sam, why don't you just move into town?' Well, why would I
want to move into town? I can walk out any door of my house, step
off the porch and pee any damn place I want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do that in town.''

   1. SCREAM GIRL : THE RETURN OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS In 1978,
``Halloween'' launched Jamie Lee Curtis on the road to stardom, a
road which took her to ``Trading Places,'' ``A Fish Called Wanda,''
and ``True Lies.'' Now she's back in 'Halloween H20,'' a
20-years-later sequel. Curtis talks about the new movie, why she
won't let her children watch it, how her mother (actress Janet
Leigh) kept her from seeing ``Psycho'' as a child and why she sees
``H20'' as both a terrifying slasher film and a serious look at
victimization and a woman's struggle to rebuild her life after
being terrorized. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo. 2. ADRIAN
LYNE BRAVES A HURRICANE CALLED ' LOLITA' Since the 1950's, no work
of art has been able to raise as much of a stir as Vladimir
Nabokov's classic novel, ``Lolita,'' the story of a man's erotic
obsession with a 12-year-old girl. Now the book has been made into
a film for the second time, and proven so controversial that it
couldn't get an American distributor. Director Adrian Lyne talks
about the new film, his past controversial films such as ``Fatal
Attraction'' and ``Indecent Proposal,'' why he felt it essential to
retain the film's sex scenes between Jeremy Irons and young
Dominique Swain and why he thinks that there is a fine line between
protecting and over-protecting children. By Jeanne Wolf and Shep
Morgan. 1,400 words + photo. (N/A in England.) 3. NICOLAS CAGE
KEEPS THE ACTION COMING Nicolas Cage has a Best Actor Oscar for the
prestigious 1996 film ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' and all the esteem
that carries. But he's also an action hero, with a string of hits -
and a $20-million-per-film paycheck - to prove it. Cage talks about
his latest thriller, ``Snake Eyes,'' whether he's sobered from his
days as one of Hollywood's edgier actors, how he got along with
often-criticized director Brian De Palma on ``Snake Eyes,'' and why
he doesn't regret having set his family - and wife Patricia
Arquette - to one side during his recent blitz of hit films. By Ian
Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.

FACE VALUE : PUSHING HIS LUCK? By Ricardo Castaneda In this new
cartoon feature from The New York Times Syndicate, artist Ricardo
Castaneda offers an hilarious depiction of the upcoming film
``Snake Eyes,'' with Nicolas Cage holding a pair of dice. 5. NIKITA
SERGUEVITCH MIKHALKOV, RUSSIAN CINEMA'S NEW TSAR There are signs of
a renaissance in Russian cinema. ``We should unite to restore
Russian cinema to its former glory,'' exclaimed Nikita Mikhalkov
recently during the closing ceremony of the ninth Open Russian
Festival. His message was loud and clear : If professional Russian
film-makers want to get their industry out of the doldrums in which
it has been languishing for the past ten years, they will have to
forget their divisions and rally to a single leader - Makhalkov
himself. By Pierre Daum. From Le Monde. (English translation
available.) 1,500 words. 6. IN THE POST-POLITICALLY CORRECT ZONE
WITH 'SOUTH PARK'
</P>
<P>
   AND 'BASKETBALL' With their new movie, the sports parody
'Basketball,' Trey Parker and Matt Stone are waging a two-man
offensive against sensitivity. ``This is what every guy lives
through - the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull - and we're
making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys talk.'' By
Jonathan Van Meter. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,000 words.

DIONNE WARWICK FINDS HER HEART'S HOME IN RIO DE JANEIRO With over
30 years in music, and legions of fans and awards, Dionne Warwick
is the grande dame of pop and R&AMP;B. However, even with such fame,
she still lives by the principles she grew up with : God, family,
friendship and music. And when she recently found a house
overlooking Rio's beach front and the giant statue of Christ the
Redeemer, she knew she was 'home.'' ``Living here I feel like the
weight of the world is off my shoulders,'' she says. ``I found in
Brazil what used to be the priority in America : values, standards,
regard for one another. They care about God.'' By Sabrina Lamb.

MAKING 'PRIVATE RYAN' Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have been
friends for years, but the two Hollywood heavyweights hadn't worked
together until ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the World War II epic about
a platoon sent to rescue a soldier whose three brothers have died
in combat. Both men committed themselves to creating the most
authentic war movie ever made, and the controversy surrounding the
film's brutual battle scenes suggests that they have. By Joshua

BAY STATE STIFFENS INCINERATOR EMISSIONS RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts environmental officials are stepping up
their crackdown on six trash incinerators whose smokestack mercury
emissions have contributed to fishing bans in more than 50 lakes,
ponds and rivers around the state.
</P>
<P>
   New regulations announced Tuesday include an apparent
first-of-its-kind provision that will restrict not just daily
pollution but the cumulative emissions of dioxin, mercury, cadmium,
lead and acid-rain gases that build up in soil and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the other 49 states, they're nowhere close to
addressing this issue the way we are,'' said David B. Struhs, the
state environmental protection commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, by 2000 or soon after, Struhs said, the new rules
should cut emissions by 85 percent from 1995 levels and encourage
bigger, better-publicized programs to recycle mercury-containing
products such as batteries, thermostats and fluorescent light
bulbs. The rules cover plants in Fall River, Haverhill, Millbury,
North Andover, Rochester, and Saugus and will take effect next
month.
</P>
<P>
   However, their effect will be limited: Nearly 60 percent of
mercury landing on Massachusetts blows in from other states,
principally from midwestern power plants that burn huge quantities
of coal containing trace amounts of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   The six Bay State incinerators generate about 20 percent of the
state's mercury pollution. The rest comes from local medical waste
incinerators, whose regulations will be toughened this fall, and
from coal- and oil-burning local power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very glad they went as far as the technology allows, but
we still don't feel that these regulations overall will protect
public health,'' said Lee Ketelsen of Clean Water Action, who
critiqued early proposals. ``We still feel that these incinerators
will pose a threat to people.''
</P>
<P>
   State Environmental Affairs Secretary Trudy Coxe was especially
enthusiastic about part of the regulations allowing the DEP to
toughen a plant's emission restrictions if it decides its emissions
``alone or cumulatively with other'' plants violate environmental
laws, as environmentalists charge the cluster of Merrimack Valley
plants has.
</P>
<P>
   But John Rumpler, an attorney with Roxbury-based Alternatives
for Community and Environment, an urban public health advocacy
group, said that proviso should have been made tougher and more
specific, saying it provides only ``a glimmer of hope that the
state will move towards ensuring environmental justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach incinerator operators familiar with the rules
failed Tuesday. In June, Ogden Corp. shut down its Lawrence
trash-to-energy plant, saying even before the new rules were
officially announced it would cost too much to comply with them.
The other plants are expected to spend about $100 million
installing new mercury-control devices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, total mercury emissions in air from the
incinerators should drop from about 5,200 pounds annually to 900.
But just one gram of mercury _ 1/70th of a teaspoon _ can
sufficiently contaminate a 10-acre lake to make its fish unsafe to
eat, Struhs aide Andrea Carneiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health warns
pregnant women not to eat freshwater fish because of the likelihood
they contain mercury, which can cause birth defects and retardation
in children.

   WASHINGTON _ In May, President Clinton named career diplomat and
National Security Council official Richard Clarke as the first
national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and
counter-terrorism. Clarke spoke recently with Cox Newspapers White
House Correspondent Bob Deans about the new generation of terrorist
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you say that terrorism poses a greater risk today than
five years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A. If terrorist groups acquire weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological and nuclear _ then it would pose an
inordinately greater risk than it has before. If terrorist groups
or countries acquire the ability to damage our telephone exchanges,
our power grid, our banking system, by computer warfare attacks,
then itwould pose a much greater threat than it's ever posed
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we don't know specifically that terrorist groups have
weapons of mass destruction, we don't know specifically that they
have prepared computer warfare attacks. But, given the fact that
most of the nations that sponsor terrorism also have chemical
weapons or biological weapons, we have to be concerned that one day
a terrorist group will get that kind of support, or that they will
buy a chemical weapon or a biological weapon or steal one.
</P>
<P>
   We know there are countries that have offensive computer warfare
capabilities, so we know that threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which ones?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't tell you which ones, and moreover we probably don't
know all of them, but we know of some specific ones.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there some surprises in there, or are they the
technologically advanced countries you would suspect?
</P>
<P>
   A. They're technologically advanced, but it's also the case that
offensive computer warfare doesn't take a lot of people , and it
doesn't take enormous computers. What it takes is an understanding
of computer networking and certain popular software. So, a small
number of smart people with equipment that you can buy in K-Mart
could engage in offensive computer warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the technological sophistication of the United States
make it more vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. We are more reliant on computer-controlled networks and
systems than any other country in the world. Your electrical power
is coming to you over a network that is computer-controlled. Your
telephones are all computer-controlled. Most American banking moves
on computer-controlled networks, whether it is the ATM machine or
large-scale inter-bank transactions. The stock market, airline
reservation systems, virtually everything we do all day long
depends upon computer controlled networks.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that the U.S. military relies upon
civilian-owned and civilian-operated computer-controlled networks.
Most military bases get their telephones and their electric power
from privately owned and operated infrastructure providers. So it's
not just our economy which is at risk to offensive computer attack,
it's also our defense capability.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How aware is private industry of the need for security, and
how vigilant is private industry being?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think industries are aware of the threat of vandalism, of
extortion by disgruntled employees. I think they're probably aware
of the threat of industrial espionage. They don't tend to think
about computer attack for the purpose of large-scale destruction or
large-scale disablement.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, most American industries probably are very
vulnerable today to that kind of attack from a sophisticated
attacker. I'm not talking about teenagers who are hacking to show
off. I'm talking about a systematic, coordinated, multi-pronged
attack from an intelligence service, foreign military or foreign
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your job, then, would be to make them aware of the threat?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our job is to make them aware of the threat, help them assess
their vulnerabilities, get them to coalesce as a sector, organize
themselves to deal with us about the issue, and then to work with
them to find ways of creating a monitoring network so we know when
attacks are occurring, to create a system for confining the attacks
so that they can't trip entire networks down, and, in the event
that they do, design a reconstitution system so that when a network
does drop we can get minimal essential service back up.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As U.S. military forces moved by air, land and sea
to prepare for a possible attack on Iraq last February, President
Clinton received a top-secret briefing at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the month, he learned, military computer systems
around the country had been penetrated. The Pentagon didn't know
who the intruders were, where they were based or how deeply they
had probed into the 3,000 or so separate networks considered
critical to U.S. military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that the hackers might be Iraqi operatives, Defense
Department officials worried for nearly three tense weeks whether
the planned mission might have been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they learned that instead of enemy agents, the
computer commandos were a couple of California teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Pentagon, relief was fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   If high school-educated techno-buffs could breach national
security with an ordinary desktop computer, some asked, what sort
of damage might be inflicted by a savvy band of well-funded
terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Clinton announced in a nationally televised
commencement address to the U.S. Naval Academy that the United
States would step up its efforts to combat a new generation of
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our security is challenged increasingly by non-traditional
threats,'' Clinton said. ''Rather than invading our beaches or
launching bombers, these adversaries may attempt cyber-attacks
against our critical military systems and our economic base, or
they may deploy compact and relatively cheap weapons of mass
destruction _ not just nuclear, but also chemical or biological, to
use disease as a weapon of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has sharply increased his funding request for
anti-terror preparations in next year's budget to more than $1
billion, and Congress seems inclined to go along _ although some
members question whether the administration is prepared to
effectively manage an effort involving a broad array of federal and
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The effort comes as terrorists are reaching for advances in
modern technology
</P>
<P>
   to strengthen their hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terrorism obviously is nothing new _ it has always been the
weapon of the weak,'' said Frank Cilluffo, director of the
terrorism task force at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS), a Washington research center. ''What is new,
though, is the changing face of terrorism coupled with the
development of new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a scientific genius, experts say, to harness
modern techniques in the service of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see the terrorists being on the cutting edge,''
explained Gregory Jones, an analyst with the Rand Corp., an
international consulting firm based in Santa Monica, Calif. ''The
problem is, what used to be cutting edge is now getting to the
point where the terrorists might be able to do something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world's last remaining superpower, the United States, its
businesses and its citizens make high-profile targets.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department tracks more than three dozen active
terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they commited 304 separate bombings, shootings,
kidnappings and other terrorist acts in 1997 alone, killing 221
people, seven of them Americans, and wounding another 693. That was
a slight increase over 1996 incident levels, but was still one of
the lowest incident rates since the State Department began
cataloguing terrorist activity in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Even as terrorist activities decline slightly, however, experts
worry that such attacks could become increasingly disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials concede that the nation is ill equipped to
confront the death, destruction and panic that computer hackers or
someone with a nuclear, chemical or biological weapon could
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Clinton set up the President's Commission on
Critical Infrastructure Protection to assess the terrorist threat
to the systems that provide the country with telecommunications,
energy, water, banking services, transportation and public health
and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's findings have been sobering.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two scenarios for which we are not well prepared,''
said Richard A. Clarke, named by Clinton in May to the new position
of national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and
counter-terrorism at the National Security Council. ''One is a
chemical and biological attack in an American city, and another is
a multi-pronged computer attack that knocks down communications and
electricity in several major regions simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some capability in both of those cases, but it's not
anywhere near enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cilluffo at CSIS, ''the biggest nightmare is a
bio-terrorist attack. It's the so-called silent killer, because the
first indicator you usually hit is falling bodies. ...We really
don't have much defense for those sorts of threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Germ warfare raises the specter of mass death by a lethal
disease. One considered a prime candidate for use by terrorists is
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   The spores that carry anthrax can be stored for years, are
easily dispersed through the air, and are all but impossible to
detect until victims begin showing symptoms _by which time it's
often too late to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I could aerosol just a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of spores, I
could cover a large area of Washington, D.C. with a potentially
lethal dose,'' said Jones. ''You could be talking about thousands,
or tens of thousands of people affected.''
</P>
<P>
   The world got an unwelcome look at another modern terror threat,
chemical weapons, three years ago when the Japanese religious cult
Aum Shinrikyo placed open containers of deadly sarin nerve gas in
Tokyo's packed subway system, killing 12 and injuring more than
5,000 commuters.
</P>
<P>
   A threat that keeps former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., awake at night
is the fear that nuclear weapons material from the former Soviet
Union could make its way into the hands of terrorists or
international criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a big problem,'' said Nunn, now an attorney with the
Atlanta's King &AMP; Spalding law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., Nunn helped put in
place a program in 1991 that has helped former Soviet states
destroy, dismantle or deactivate more than 4,500 nuclear warheads,
as well as scores of intercontinental ballistic missiles, silos and
even bombers, at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of roughly $1.5 billion
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Still, however, Russia transfers an estimated 60 tons a year of
nuclear weapons material from its military into an even less secure
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the new terrorist threat, Cilluffo said, will require
enhanced intelligence resources to help root out terrorist groups
and monitor their activities, as well as plans for protecting
against acts that take the country by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Better to avoid a crisis than heroically react to one,'' said
Cilluffo. ''No matter how robust our intelligence capability, it'll
never be 100 percent, so you need to be able to prepare for
terrorism, manage the consequences, mitigate the damage, minimize
the loss of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the very sophistication of the nation's security
structure adds to its vulnerability. The powerful information,
communications and imaging systems that have brought new power and
efficiency to the post-Cold War military can become weaknesses to
be exploited by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crux of the matter is that, as our force structure is
downsizing, we become ever more reliant and dependent on superior
technologies and, in particular, information technologies,''
explained the Defense Department's Christopher Mellon, deputy
assistant secretary for security and information operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our strategy is a strategy that entails information dominance
and superiority,'' Mellon said in an interview. ''So, if the plug
gets pulled on these things, and a system is brought down ...it
creates a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of modern systems failure, moreover, is only one
dimension of a multi-faceted threat.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government's critical operations, including those of
the military, rely on services provided by the private sector. That
why Clinton's initiative, besides beefing up intelligence-gathering
and reaction capabilities, seeks to build a new culture of
cooperation on security matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be a public-private partnership of almost an
unprecedented nature,'' said Nunn, who serves on Clinton's critical
infrastructure commission. ''I don't believe any company's capable
of handling an attack by a well-organized, highly disciplined,
multi-layered terrorist group.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industries _ nuclear power and telecommunications, for
instance _ have long worked closely with government agencies _ the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Commerce Department, among
others _ to guard against terrorist or criminal activity. Others,
however, appear to have much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ''To some extent we're trying to raise awareness because we've
had ... the mentality that we're immune here in the United States''
because of the country's geographic separation from most of the
world's trouble spots, said the Defense Department's Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, ``that insulation disappears, and all of a sudden
people from anywhere in the world can end up on these systems right
here in your office, potentially,'' Mellon said. ''You know, as the
world gets smaller, and gets closer, it kind of forces us to think
a little differently about the way we do counterintelligence and
security.''
</P>
<P>
   As more attention is paid to the new threats, some in Congress
are pressing for a fresh look at who's in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the anti-terror program includes the Departments of
Defense, Justice, State and Health and Human Services, plus state
agencies, they question whether it should be run by an unelected
White House official with limited powers who is largely
unaccountable to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., has called for Attorney General Janet
Reno to create a five-year inter-agency anti-terror plan by Nov.
31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we have is getting everybody working
together and having a top-down, total commitment to cooperation,''
Gregg told CQ Weekly magazine. ``We cannot tolerate turf war on
this.''

 &HT;    CYBER-TERRORISTS POSE THREAT TO A NETWORKED AMERICA
 &HT;    With THREATS .
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 2.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It starts with an unexplained power blackout in a
major southeastern city. As utility workers struggle to restore
service, telephone systems across the country become paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, misrouted freight and passenger trains collide,
killing and injuring many passengers. Civilian air traffic control
systems go haywire, causing still more accidents and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Before the nation can recover from those blows, malfunctioning
pipeline flow-control mechanisms trigger oil refinery blasts.
</P>
<P>
   As alarm and fear begin to spread, electronic ``sniffers''
sabotage global financial systems, disrupting fund transfers and
causing stocks to plunge on world exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   At neighborhood banks, automatic teller machines randomly credit
or debit customers' accounts. As reports of the berserk ATM units
spread, depositors panic and rush to make withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Television networks and local stations, seeking to keep tabs on
the mounting chaos, lose control of their programming. An
orchestrated disinformation campaign mysteriously airs on their
channels, sowing further confusion.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon mobilizes to restore order, dial-in attacks
paralyze phone systems at military staging bases. More ominous yet,
sensitive computer-controlled weapons' systems begin to show signs
of electronic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario, outlined in a recent report by the Rand Corp. for
the Defense Department, provides a chilling picture of how the
Information Age has left the United States vulnerable to a
``digital Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Information war has no front line,'' the study notes.
``Potential battlefields are anywhere networked systems allow
access'' through their satellite and fiber-optic links to the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, the U.S. homeland may no longer provide a sanctuary
from outside attack,'' it concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely vulnerable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Government Affairs Committee, which
shares legislative jurisdiction over terrorism issues. If an enemy
state or terrorist groups wanted to strike at America, he said,
``the first thing they would do is screw up our computers.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen nations are known to have active
information-warfare programs, including Russia and China and such
potentially hostile states as Libya, Iraq and Iran. Foreign teams
have broken into both U.S. government and corporate computer
systems to find vulnerable points and, perhaps, to deposit unseen
digital ``trap doors'' and ``logic bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that among the flood of tech workers hurriedly
imported to deal with the Year 2000 computer problem, foreign
agents may be planting more software surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the nation's essential services stand
exposed chills top government officials. It has led directly to a
high-priority program aimed at ``hardening'' U.S. digital defenses.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last May issued ``Presidential Decision
Directive 63,'' mobilizing ``a national effort to assure the
security of the United States' increasingly exposed and
interconnected infrastructures, such as telecommunications, banking
and finance, energy, transportation, and essential government
services'' by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has sought $64 million in the next fiscal
year to fund the coordination of government and private efforts to
ward off threats to critical computer operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government has to lead,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., chairman of
the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on terrorism, told CQ Weekly
magazine this spring. ``Until the government is seen to recognize
the threat in a significant way, it's a little hard to get industry
to focus on the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Most attention to the dangers of information warfare has focused
on the vulnerability of the Pentagon's own systems, the subject of
a series of hearings in recent years by the Senate permanent
investigations subcommittee under former Sam Nunn of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the General Accounting Office, Pentagon computers
were infiltrated as many as 250,000 times in 1995. The exact number
was difficult to calculate, the GAO said, because the hackers
rarely were even detected.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of decades, intruders have stolen, changed or
destroyed sensitive data or software in Pentagon computers. In some
cases, they installed files to cover up their break-ins or to make
future infiltration easier.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the National Security Agency staged a ``red team''
exercise, code-named ``Eligible Receiver,'' in which agents
pretending to be North Koreans infiltrated the command-and-control
facilities of the U.S. Pacific Command in Honolulu _ demonstrating
their ability to neutralize most U.S. armed forces from Okinawa to
San Diego for many hours without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   With such methods, cyberspies track the precepts of Sun Tzu, who
lived in China four centuries before the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attaining 100 victories in 100 battles is not the pinnacle of
excellence,'' he wrote in ``The Art of War,'' the earliest known
treatise on military science. ``Subjugating the enemy's army
without fighting is the true pinnacle of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials are also concerned about attacks on civilian
information networks, which the military has no legal or political
authority to protect in peacetime.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a thief with a laptop computer in an apartment in
St. Petersburg, Russia, broke into Citibank Corp. accounts in
Chicago and transferred millions of dollars before being caught by
old-fashioned police work.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing last June before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
technology, terrorism and government information, Ellie Padgett,
deputy chief of the NSA's office of defensive information warfare,
told of one aspect of the ``red team's'' worrisome success in
``Eligible Receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   In a phase of the exercise that simulated attacks, she said,
``we scripted (an) Internet message (that) would be sent out to
everybody saying there was a problem with the 911 system,
understanding that human nature would result in people calling the
911 system to see if there was a problem'' _ thus causing the
overloaded phone system to crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of all of this is that it doesn't take a lot
of people to do this,'' Padgett said. ``It can probably be done,
this sort of an attack, by a handful of folks working together. ...
They can get the tools off of the Internet.''

 &HT;    TOP SMALLPOX EXPERT SAYS U.S. SHOULD STOCKPILE VACCINE
 &HT;    With THREATS, THREATS-GERM and THREATS-GERM-LIST. For release
Sunday, Aug. 2.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The man who directed the global campaign that
eradicated smallpox from the Earth now believes the United States
should spend between $25 and $50 million as soon as possible to
stockpile vaccine against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Donald A. Henderson, a former epidemiologist at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, said security
problems in biological warfare laboratories created by the former
Soviet Union, along with documented interest in bioterrorism in
Iraq and among Japanese cult members, convince him that ``the level
of danger has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a population that has effectively received no vaccine
for 30 years'' and has lost its immunity, Henderson said in an
interview, ``and it looks to me like we have a much more volatile
situation that we had thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, now dean emeritus of the Johns Hopkins University
School of Public Health, in the 1960s was the first director of a
CDC program to eradicate smallpox from 18 West African countries.
</P>
<P>
   When this program led to a decision by the World Health
Organization to launch a global eradication campaign, he left CDC
to direct the WHO effort. Smallpox was officially declared
eradicated from the Earth in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Now, following the fall of the Soviet government, defectors and
others have revealed that Soviet scientists were working with
smallpox as a biological weapon and had stockpiled a still-unknown
quantity of the deadly virus.
</P>
<P>
   Because of economic problems in the Soviet Union, many of the
``cutting edge'' virologists who worked in these facilities have
left, Henderson said, and guards have complained that they have not
been paid for months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult in Japan is
believed by some investigators to have up to $1 billion and as many
as 16,000 adherents in Russia, even though its leader has been
jailed, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The cult burst into headlines in 1995, when it released deadly
sarin nerve gas in a Tokyo subway, killing a dozen people. Since
then, evidence has come to light that members have tried several
times to obtain biological weapons and use them, once at a U.S.
military base in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's now-documented
interest in biological warfare, the developments in Japan and
Russia mean ``we have every reason to be concerned'' that an
epidemic of smallpox could be deliberately started in the United
States, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us with ample possibility to provide
protection if that happens,'' he said. ``At this time, there is no
vaccine manufacturing capability in this country and to my
knowledge, anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson did not advocate the preventive inoculation of
Americans before an attack. In a mass campaign to give millions of
people the vaccine, a few would be expected to die from side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that the cost of establishing a manufacturing
facility and producing 150 million doses of smallpox vaccine would
be between $25 and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson also said he thinks the United States should spend
about $1 billion to upgrade the public health system in preparation
for a possible epidemic caused by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one looks at bioterrorism, you're looking at a situation in
which you're going to see an epidemic emerge,'' Henderson said.
``You'd like to detect that epidemic as soon as possible so you
could start vaccinating people. Who's going to do that? The medical
community, state and local health departments and CDC. Yet no money
has been made available to anybody in these areas yet.''

 &HT;    PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR POORLY PREPARED FOR GERM ATTACK
 &HT;    1050&AMP;add. With THREATS, THREATS-GERM-POX and THREATS-GERM-LIST.
For release Sunday, Aug. 2.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the spreading chaos that could develop if
terrorists deliberately started an epidemic of smallpox, ebola or
another deadly disease in America, the country's first line of
defense would be the doctors, nurses, hospital personnel and public
health workers who would care for victims and try to figure out
what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Clinton administration, which plans to spend about $1.3
billion next year to defend the country against chemical or
biological warfare attacks, would invest only about 3 percent of
that amount _ $42 million _ to reinforce an underfunded and poorly
equipped network of state and local health departments.
</P>
<P>
   And even that money is in jeopardy, thanks to the
administration's failure to provide a routine report to the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spends about $1 billion a year to defend against
chemical or biological attacks. The money goes for research,
equipment and a new $300 million program to establish 50 or more
``rapid response'' units in the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   But the quick action _ or lack of it _ that could mean life or
death for hundreds of thousands of Americans in a terror-spawned
epidemic would rest with state and local public health departments,
currently so poorly equipped that many still use rotary phones.
</P>
<P>
   Many do not have Internet connections or the ability to share
information electronically. They plod through outbreaks of E. coli
and salmonella, playing telephone tag with other departments as
they try to report unusual ``clusters'' of illness and waiting for
unreliable fax machines to deliver badly needed expertise from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The $42 million President Clinton has proposed that the CDC
spend to begin upgrading this system ``is a very small amount of
money,'' said Dr. Donald A. Henderson, dean emeritus of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Public Health and former director of
the World Health Organization campaign that eradicated smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best approach is to strengthen the infrastructure that is
so important to detecting and responding to a disease,'' Dr.
Henderson said, ``and that is the public health and medical
infrastructure. We need better surveillance, better laboratories,
better protection.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be this system _ not ``rapid response'' teams from the
National Guard or other teams being trained by the Marines or by
the Army at Aberdeen Proving Grounds _ that would first learn of
and respond to a biological attack against America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Selden, who specializes in chemical and germ warfare
matters for Business Executives for National Security, said
preliminary exercises indicate that efforts by various federal,
state and local civilian and military agencies to cope with an
actual bioterrorism attack likely could end up ``with a lot of
people yelling at each other and nobody in command. It's going to
be very confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to be in overall control, and that just hasn't
happened,'' Selden said. He said that only a nationally known
figure such as former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., retired Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Colin Powell or former White House national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft could command the attention and
respect of the different groups.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's model for responding to terrorism is
weighted in favor of a chemical attack, such as the nerve gas that
killed a dozen people when released in a Tokyo subway in 1995,
Selden said. Paramedics, firemen, police and other ``first
responders'' at the site of that kind of terrorist attack must know
how to protect themselves and others from lethal chemicals or
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Such training could be irrelevant in a biological attack.
</P>
<P>
   A ``suicide cougher'' who had allowed himself to be infected
with smallpox could expose thousands of people in a few days _ and
they would in turn expose many thousands more. By the time his
actions became known, victims could be all over the country, and
would need doctors, nurses and quarantined hospital beds, not
military units.
</P>
<P>
   If ebola virus, which causes one of the most gruesome deaths
imaginable _ the victim starts hemorrhaging and bleeding from every
body orifice, including the eyes _ were scattered among Americans,
it would be from two to 21 days before the first exposed victims
began to fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   And while anthrax does not spread in epidemic fashion from one
person to another, the sooner it is recognized, the quicker victims
can be treated with penicillin or other antibiotics that could save
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred million dollars for the National Guard doesn't
really make a lot of sense,'' said Michael Osterholm, state
epidemiologist of Minnesota. ``It's kind of like investing all of
your money in an expensive fire truck when what you need first is
the ability to find the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Training and equipping the National Guard's first-response
groups would not be affected by the additional $300 million which
President Clinton last month asked Congress to appropriate in germ
and chemical warfare preparedness funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new money would be divided among several agencies, including
the FBI, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS). A total of $51 million would be
used to start a civilian stockpile of antidotes, antibiotics and
vaccines necessary to respond to acts of bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, the House Appropriations Committee approved the $51
million Clinton had requested for the medicines stockpile, but
dropped the $42 million in public health infrastructure funds.
</P>
<P>
   A committee report stated that HHS, which includes CDC, had
``declined to provide'' a routine report detailing how the money
would be spent. An HHS spokesman said the department's failure to
deliver the report on time was the result of a ``misunderstanding''
that was subsequently cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   A committee spokesman said that if the committee received the
report, it would try to get the $42 million included later this
summer, when House and Senate budget writers meet to hammer out a
final fiscal 1999 federal budget. But in the high-stakes atmosphere
of a conference committee meeting on the federal budget, nothing is
certain to happen or not happen.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as they wait to see whether the funding will be
provided, leaders of associations of state and local public health
associations say they have not been included in any planning for a
terrorist attack. Some say they wonder whether anyone in the
federal government realizes what burdens would fall on their
shoulders if one took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be some kind of assumption that the response to
a bioterrorism event will be mounted by the federal government and
the military,'' said Dr. Edward Thompson, a physician who serves as
Mississippi's public health commissioner. ``If the country is
attacked, it seems reasonable that the military would respond. The
problem with that is that it will inevitably be state and local
public health systems that will detect an act of bioterrorism in
the first place and bear the brunt of mounting a response.''
</P>
<P>
   If smallpox virus leaked from former Soviet Union germ warfare
stockpiles were obtained by terrorists, then released in a subway
or airport in a large city, public health experts say the disease
would spread wildly among Americans, virtually none of whom have
valid immunizations. The disease typically has a 30 percent
mortality rate among healthy adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the release event goes unrecognized, the more
widespread the infection,'' said Dr. Thompson. ``The number of
eventual victims could quickly become millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern that this very thing could happen has led Dr. Henderson
to call for a new campaign to manufacture and stockpile enough
smallpox vaccine to immunize 150 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Defectors from the former Soviet Union say biological
laboratories in Russia worked with both smallpox and ebola as
potential germ warfare weapons _ and even tried to engineer both of
them into a new organism.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials such as Osterholm and Thompson say they
shudder at the thought of their understaffed and poorly equipped
departments having to deal with a deliberately introduced epidemic
of smallpox or ebola hemorrhagic fever or with millions of dying
anthrax victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, electronic communications are the best way to send
and receive data quickly, and the Internet is the best way to share
data and get access to current information about a disease,'' Dr.
Ralph Morris, executive director of the Galveston County, Texas,
Health Department and president of the National Association of
County and City Health Officials, told a Senate subcommittee in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while such communications are ``taken for
granted'' in the military and law enforcement, ``most health
departments still rely on the phone, the fax machine, and paper and
pencil to track down the information they need.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of all local health departments do have have
electronic mail, he said, and at least 1,000 do not have access to
the Internet. Among those that do, one-third are not linked to
their state health departments and fewer than one-fourth can share
data with other departments electronically, Dr. Morris testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't afford to get any further behind,'' he said.
``Whether the cause of a health emergency is an innocent cook at a
church supper or an international terrorist, our need to respond
quickly remains the same. Saving time means saving lives.''

 &HT;    RISK IS GREAT, SAYS NATION'S FIRST ANTI-TERRORISM COORDINATOR
 &HT;    With THREATS. For release Sunday, Aug. 2.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In May, President Clinton named career diplomat and
National Security Council official Richard Clarke as the first
national coordinator for security, infrastructure protection and
counter-terrorism. Clarke spoke recently with Cox Newspapers White
House Correspondent Bob Deans about the new generation of terrorist
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you say that terrorism poses a greater risk today than
five years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A. If terrorist groups acquire weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological and nuclear _ then it would pose an
inordinately greater risk than it has before. If terrorist groups
or countries acquire the ability to damage our telephone exchanges,
our power grid, our banking system, by computer warfare attacks,
then it would pose a much greater threat than it's ever posed
before.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we don't know specifically that terrorist groups have
weapons of mass destruction, we don't know specifically that they
have prepared computer warfare attacks. But, given the fact that
most of the nations that sponsor terrorism also have chemical
weapons or biological weapons, we have to be concerned that one day
a terrorist group will get that kind of support, or that they will
buy a chemical weapon or a biological weapon or steal one.
</P>
<P>
   We know there are countries that have offensive computer warfare
capabilities, so we know that threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which ones?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't tell you which ones, and moreover we probably don't
know all of them, but we know of some specific ones.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there some surprises in there, or are they the
technologically advanced countries you would suspect?
</P>
<P>
   A. They're technologically advanced, but it's also the case that
offensive computer warfare doesn't take a lot of people , and it
doesn't take enormous computers. What it takes is an understanding
of computer networking and certain popular software. So, a small
number of smart people with equipment that you can buy in K-Mart
could engage in offensive computer warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the technological sophistication of the United States
make it more vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. We are more reliant on computer-controlled networks and
systems than any other country in the world. Your electrical power
is coming to you over a network that is computer-controlled. Your
telephones are all computer-controlled. Most American banking moves
on computer-controlled networks, whether it is the ATM machine or
large-scale inter-bank transactions. The stock market, airline
reservation systems, virtually everything we do all day long
depends upon computer controlled networks.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that the U.S. military relies upon
civilian-owned and civilian-operated computer-controlled networks.
Most military bases get their telephones and their electric power
from privately owned and operated infrastructure providers. So it's
not just our economy which is at risk to offensive computer attack,
it's also our defense capability.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How aware is private industry of the need for security, and
how vigilant is private industry being?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think industries are aware of the threat of vandalism, of
extortion by disgruntled employees. I think they're probably aware
of the threat of industrial espionage. They don't tend to think
about computer attack for the purpose of large-scale destruction or
large-scale disablement.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, most American industries probably are very
vulnerable today to that kind of attack from a sophisticated
attacker. I'm not talking about teenagers who are hacking to show
off. I'm talking about a systematic, coordinated, multi-pronged
attack from an intelligence service, foreign military or foreign
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your job, then, would be to make them aware of the threat?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our job is to make them aware of the threat, help them assess
their vulnerabilities, get them to coalesce as a sector, organize
themselves to deal with us about the issue, and then to work with
them to find ways of creating a monitoring network so we know when
attacks are occurring, to create a system for confining the attacks
so that they can't trip entire networks down, and, in the event
that they do, design a reconstitution system so that when a network
does drop we can get minimal essential service back up.

 Technology famous for breaking promises  
By Gregory Kallenberg  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Technology is famous for breaking its promises.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago ``the next big thing'' was network computers: They
would would cost less than $500 and have no hard drive. Instead,
the network computer would keep all of its information on the
Internet. To retrieve a document or game, you had to be online.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four months later, the idea lies in the technology
graveyard, along with virtual reality glasses and long distance
over the Internet. With computer prices so low (you can buy a great
refurbished computer for about $600) there is no need for the
network computer. This is unfortunate because network computing was
such a good idea. If we kept our data online, maybe we would be
more concerned about the information that was on the Internet. With
network computing, maybe we wouldn't put up with spamming and
kiddie porn sites. With network computing, the Internet would be a
better place.
</P>
<P>
   Nextec (www.nextec.net) is a company that still believes in the
idea of network computing and in what the concept can do for the
Web. On June 11, the company _ which is responsible for the 100
million-hit-a-month RotoNews (www.rotonews.com) fantasy sport site
_ posted FreeDrive (www.FreeDrive.com), a site where you can store
any information you might otherwise keep on your computer for free.
Just by signing on, you receive a password-protected 7.5 megabytes
of storage (the equivalent of about five floppy disks) to hold
pictures, files or to back up your hard drive. To date, the site
has accumulated 5,000 users (with no advertising).
</P>
<P>
   ``FreeDrive is your own personal Web hard drive, a virtual drive
that resides on the Internet,'' said Michael Rhodes, president and
CEO of Nextec.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of the FreeDrive goes far beyond being a virtual
hard drive. It is the beginning of network computing, the beginning
of keeping our information online.
</P>
<P>
   FreeDrive makes it possible for multiple people to view your
files, thus encouraging the formation of separate virtual
communities. You can give your password to friends and colleagues,
then they can then log on to your virtual hard drive and view what
you are working on. On the FreeDrive site, this is called
``carpooling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've only been up for a month, people are still in the
self-education phase and not really using their storage for very
much,'' Rhodes said. ``We have, however, seen the `carpooling'
function use quadruple in the past week (from 5,000 to 20,000
users).''
</P>
<P>
   The interest of the ``carpoolers,'' along with the initial
sign-on of 5,000 users, shows that people are truly interested in
storing their information online and in the original concept of
network computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to build a community of `drivers' that will learn
and grow together,'' Rhodes said. ``A community that will help
change the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this site hasn't been set up for charity. Nextec sees
a definite marketability to its site. ``Multiple Drivers,'' where
other users can alter and add to material on your FreeDrive, costs
an extra $4.95 a month. Extra megabytes of storage also cost money
and the site will have banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its capitalistic leanings, FreeDrive has hit on a great
idea. If we start storing our data, pictures and documents on the
Net, then the Internet becomes more of a home for us. Once it's a
home, we will start treating the Internet as what it was meant to
be: a communication tool for the exchange of ideas and content.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to look at the Internet as more of a tool
than they did before, as an expansion of their own PC,'' Rhodes
said. ``FreeDrive is a practical application that these people will
use and will definitely expand people's belief and confidence in
what the Internet is.'' Send questions, comments, ideas, products,

   It's summertime, and you have the kids at home. By now you've
probably done it all: Schlitterbahn, Sea World, the Austin Museum
of Art and the Capitol. Now, you're all at home, making peanut
butter, banana and ham sandwiches and looking for something to do.
You don't want to turn on the television because you don't want
your child dressing like Ginger Spice or talking like Judge Judy.
Why not buy your kid a couple of Broderbund games and let them
expand their minds while having fun? ``Kid Pix'' and the new,
improved ``Where in the World is Carmen San diego?'' will fulfill
both of those desires. ``Kid Pix'' is a drawing program which will
keep your 3- to 12-year-old occupied for hours. And ``Carmen San
Diego,'' a mystery entertainment game for 9-year-olds and up, has
been improved to include Internet links and teach your child
foreign languages. Available for the Mac and PC for $39.95.

 New version of Intel's Celeron will arrive next month  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Edsel flopped, Ford Motor Co. dumped the name.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., however, is sticking with Celeron, even though
reviewers panned the computer chip after it debuted in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara-based chip-maker will deliver a new version of
Celeron next month in another stab at the sub-$1,000 personal
computer market. The August arrival will put the new chips out
several months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like an impressive product,'' said Nathan
Brookwood, principal microprocessor analyst with Dataquest, a San
Jose market research firm. ``Will the initial images of Celeron as
a somewhat weak product linger and affect this one? That is a key
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Celeron marked Intel's entry into the market for PCs costing
less than $1,000, but critics said that it was a stripped-down
product that didn't deliver the speed PC users need.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Celeron lacked Level-2 cache, a small but
vital memory feature that lets the PC easily access frequently used
information. Without the cache, the computer lagged.
</P>
<P>
   In the new versions, Intel has added the cache. The new Celerons
will also have faster clock speeds, of 300 megahertz and 330 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Intel never actually admitted any error with the original
Celeron. Last week, when the company announced its quarterly
earnings, officials claimed that Celeron accounted for 5 percent of
Intel's shipments, and that it was one of the quickest selling
products in the company's 30-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is the world's largest chipmaker, producing the brains for
more than 80 percent of PCs sold today. But rivals AMD and National
Semiconductor dealt a blow to Intel by pioneering chips for
sub-$1,000 PCs, which consumers have been snapping up over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Intel announced a $24 million investment in Evans
&AMP; Sutherland, a Utah-based maker of graphics hardware. The deal
gives Intel an 8 percent nonvoting stake in the company, with
options to go to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The investment is Intel's latest push into the graphics market.
``The goal is to make high-end graphics as widely available to
workstation users as possible,'' said Intel spokesman Robert
Manetta.

 A Company of Her Own  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Winblad is the best-known female venture capitalist in
Silicon Valley _ and not just because she's Bill Gates
ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   She's renowned as a successful and witty software advocate who
has become something of an unofficial _ and unusual _ spokeswoman
for her industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although soundbite-savvy Winblad can be found on the speakers'
roster at nearly every high-tech forum in the country, she holds
herself aloof from the rest of the chummy venture capital world.
</P>
<P>
   Her firm Hummer Winblad has offices in San Francisco's South
Park _ 30 miles away from VC row at Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad said she keeps her distance partly out of fear of
alerting competitors to the nature of her deals and partly because
she eschews the herd mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagles don't flock,'' Winblad explained. ``As Buffy the
Vampire Slayer says, `Does the word `duh' mean anything to you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Winblad is unique among high-tech financiers because her firm
invests only in software startups _ excluding other lucrative
segments of the industry, such as computer hardware, chips and
networking.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet exploded, software was a hard sell in a
Silicon Valley that worshipped hardware makers such as Apple
Computer and Silicon Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software was the Rodney Dangerfield of the computer industry _
it got no respect,'' Winblad said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, software is a hot field and Winblad is enjoying
her time in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   She travels so much that some office-mates say they rarely see
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann who?'' asked Neil Weintraut, a venture capitalist who
shares office space with Hummer Winblad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann is so active in industry activities that she is rarely in
the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Winblad says her job as a professional speaker is secondary to
her prime mission of ``finding, funding and building'' startups
into bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad founded her first $35 million fund with former NBA star
John Hummer in 1991 _ and it earned a 50 percent return on the
money it initially invested.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Hummer Winblad has collected about $200 million from
pension funds and institutional investors and distributed the money
to nearly 50 startups.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad's top picks have included Berkeley Systems, the
makers of After Dark screensavers that was sold to CUC
International for $13.8 million last year, and Arbor Software, a
Sunnyvale database software firm that has doubled in market value
since it went public in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer Winblad also nurtured the growth of Wind River Systems,
an Alameda firm whose stock has soared eight-fold to $36.38
yesterday from a opening of price in 1993 of $4.22, adjusted for
stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   Even if success and attitude didn't set Winblad apart, she would
stand out as a women and Midwesterner among the mostly male,
East-coast-bred venture capitalist crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad, 47, was raised in Farmington, Minn., _ a small town
with one stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of six children, she had an entrepreneurial flair at
an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad's sister Patty Jorgensen recalls that while she and her
siblings would draw pictures, Ann would sell their drawings to the
neighborhood parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember she'd be making Barbie doll clothes and selling
them and I'd beg for one,'' Jorgensen said. ``She said, `No, I'm
selling them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Winblad went to a Minnesota women's college but took all her
classes at the all-male campus nearby. She majored in business and
mathematics _ but also fell in love with computers.
</P>
<P>
   During school, she wrote computer programs for male classmates
in exchange for their girlfriends typing her papers.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation she looked for a job where she could work with
computers and landed at the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis as
a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank was too slow-paced for Winblad.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1975 she convinced three programmer colleagues from the
bank to quit and start their own company building accounting
software.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, Open Systems, was successful enough that Winblad and
her partners sold it for $15 million in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Winblad took her share of the money and high-tailed it to
Silicon Valley, where she worked as a consultant and started dating
Microsoft founder and CEO Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Although she and Gates were an item for three years, Winblad's
friends say she never tried to profit from the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann's success has nothing to do with Bill,'' said Seattle
consultant Jonathan Lazarus, a longtime friend of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't supply capital for her. He doesn't make contacts for
her. She doesn't depend on him for introductions, references or
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gates-Winblad duo was apparently a merger of workaholics.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has described one of his favorite trips with Winblad when
they spent a week holed up in Santa Barbara watching videos about
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched movies for hours even when it was sunny outside,''
Gates told Wired magazine in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our fun discoveries was a series of brilliant lectures
Richard Feynman gave on physics which Ann subsequently made
available to high school students.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Winblad doesn't like to talk about her
relationship with the nation's richest man, although the two are
still good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to a lot of big dogs in this industry,'' Winblad says,
changing the subject when the topic arises.
</P>
<P>
   Gates is now married and has a daughter. Winblad has no
children, but spoils her two dogs _ both Samoyeds, or Siberian sled
dogs _ and the children of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's great with my kids, they call her Auntie Ann,'' said
longtime friend Heidi Roizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really gets far more down and dirty with my kids than you
would expect and she's a little bit Auntie Mame-ish with giving
presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Roizen, a Silicon Valley consultant, said Winblad treats her
entrepreneurs the same way: She likes to rumble with them and
shower them with money.
</P>
<P>
   When Roizen was CEO of T/ Maker, she said Winblad helped her
make a pivotal decision that turned the company around _ to get out
of the word processing software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't walk in one day and say, `You're going to divest
this product line,''' Roizen said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Winblad, who was a director and major investor in the
company, waited for Roizen to suggest the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once the cat was out of the bag, she really pushed me on
it,'' Roizen recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very tough but I grew a lot under her mentoring.''

   ELEMENTARY SCIENCE
</P>
<P>
   Ever get busted in chemistry class for reading a comic book
instead of your textbook? It's too late now, but had the Web been
around, you might have gotten off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   You could have informed the teacher that you were involved with
the Periodic Table of Comic Books project
(www.uky.edu/\Pholler/periodic/periodic.html).
</P>
<P>
   The project was created in 1994 by Jack Selegue and F. James
Holler, University of Kentucky chemistry professors with an
affinity for comic books.
</P>
<P>
   Their site's main page features the all-too-familiar elements
table, but instead of a mind-numbing lesson, you get a comic-book
image or story that features the element.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the symbol for iron (Fe) and up pops the cover of
Marvel's Iron Man. Click on Krypton (Kr) and _ yep _ you get the
element that makes Superman want to hurl.
</P>
<P>
   Selegue points out that many comic-book writers used science as
a basis for character ideas and plot developments drawn from
physics. Examples: X-Men are chemically altered mutants, and the
Fantastic Four were overexposed to cosmic rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``On close inspection, the attitudes of comic-book writers and
artists toward their readers, traditionally children, become
apparent,'' Selegue said.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, where was Selegue when we needed him?
</P>
<P>
   MAKING AN IMPACT
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of fun with science, NASA's Earth and
space-science site (observe.ivv.nasa.gov) is featuring impact
craters and tsunamis to coincide with this summer's disaster
movies, ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep Impact.'' In a recent news
release, NASA is promoting two online articles about the possible
aftereffects of a celestial collision.
</P>
<P>
   FIND A COUPLE THAT CLICKS
</P>
<P>
   Help Bruce Willis and Demi Moore find new spouses at Hollywood
Online's Bruce &AMP; Demi Matchmaker poll (www.hollywood.com). For
Willis, the choices are Elizabeth Berkley, Cher and Phyllis Diller
(Phyllis Willis, get it?). For Moore, it's Rob Lowe, Brad Pitt or
Jonathan Demme (Demi Demme, get it?).

L.A. POLICE CITE NET THREAT TO KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   BY PATRICK McGREEVY AND DOUGLAS HABERMAN   
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saying that arrests for Internet-related crimes
against children in Los Angeles are up 150 percent over last year,
Police Chief Bernard Parks warned parents to watch their
youngsters' computer use more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Because if they don't, pedophiles certainly will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have been enticed to meet pedophiles, or they are
sent a bus ticket,'' Parks said during a news conference Wednesday.
``These are things we think come about from unsupervised
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said an ``explosion'' in the number of home computers has
given pedophiles infinitely more opportunity to troll the Internet
for new victims and trade photos.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the LAPD unit that handles sex crimes against
children says it has arrested 15 people for computer-related crimes
involving minors _ compared to six arrests last year _ and is
investigating 14 other reports.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the anonymity of the Internet, police are unsure
exactly how many pedophiles lurk in cyberspace, but they said
detectives constantly are busy trying to outfox computer-savvy
molesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get cases every day,'' said Detective Raul Galindo of the
Los Angeles Police Department's Child Sexual Exploitation Unit.
``This is new, and this is more underground than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit has five detectives that handle sex crimes against
minors, the same as last year despite the growing problem. But none
of them can devote time exclusively to Internet porn, said
Detective Bill Dworin, head of the child sex crime unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a computer nerd in here,'' Dworin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that many parents are caught unaware by the
dangers of the Internet, the city also is grappling with how _ and
whether _ to control online access in public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Library policy now places the responsibility for restricting
children's Internet access on their parents and guardians. A June 9
memorandum from the City Attorney's Office recommends that if any
revision is planned, it should be an interim policy to protect
children from obscene materials without infringing the rights of
adult library patrons. The City Council's Arts, Health and
Humanities Committee is scheduled to revisit the issue Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related crime against children falls generally into
several categories: the downloading, distribution and production of
photographs and pornographic material, and the solicitation of
minors through ``chat rooms'' and bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   New technology has allowed pedophiles to scan pictures into
computers at home and even take videotape and send it anywhere on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's material that we have never seen before. These are
children who are being molested now,'' Dworin said. ``These are
children we are trying to identify.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 13-year-old Los Angeles girl was lured into
meeting a man from San Diego to have sex, and she was molested
while a video camera captured it, Dworin said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the LAPD arrested veteran rock guitarist Robert
``Waddy'' Wachtel and his wife, Annie, on suspicion of possessing
child pornography. Police said they found illegal images on his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims were are dealing with often lack attention and
affection at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our children don't talk to strangers,'' Dworin said.
``We then give the child a computer and put it in their bedroom to
be used as a baby-sitting tool and frequently parents have no idea
who their children are contacting in the various chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet spans the world, Dworin said detectives
have found that many pedophiles and networks of them operate out of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One investigation may easily lead to many others based upon
what is found on computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to laws against physical molestation of children,
Dworin said it is illegal to use sexual language in computer
conversations with children. Upon a second conviction of that
misdemeanor law, the person must register as a sex offender, Dworin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other crimes that have led to arrests by his unit include
distribution of child pornography for commercial purposes and
production of child pornography. The latter crime, if for private
viewing, is a misdemeanor and could lead to one year in jail; if
for commercial purposes, a conviction would draw a maximum sentence
of eight years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology, however, also can be used to block children
from viewing unacceptable material. But child advocates said that
parents themselves are the best guardians.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can be a powerful learning tool but ``in order to
keep it like it is, parents have got to keep kids away from the
dangers,'' said Jayne Murphy Shapiro, founder and president of
Granada Hills-based Kids Safe, an advocacy group on child safety
education.
</P>
<P>
   Educate your children to the dangers, set rules and impose
discipline if they break them _ just like for any other activity,
said Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents do not have to know how to use a computer _ but they
do have to teach their kids when they're on it to be very
careful,'' she said.

 RealNetworks, Apple Take Aim At Microsoft  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new front has opened in the government's war against
Microsoft: multimedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, antitrust allegations against the software giant have
focused mostly on its Web browsing software and on agreements with
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, Rob Glaser, CEO of RealNetworks in Seattle, told
a congressional panel that Microsoft's latest multimedia software
causes his firm's competing software to ``break.''
</P>
<P>
   And Apple Computer disclosed that the Justice Department is
investigating whether Microsoft tried to bully Apple out of the
multimedia software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one more segment of the industry stepping forward
and saying, `It's happening to us, too,''' said Ed Black, president
of the Computer and Communications Industry Association in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The new claims illustrate how broadly Microsoft's influence is
felt in the high-tech industry. And they also could spur the
Department of Justice to expand its antitrust case against the
Redmond, Wash., company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies both allegations, saying the problem with
RealNetworks was due to a technical glitch and that it never tried
to bully Apple. However, Microsoft refused to send a representative
to defend the company during the congressional hearing chaired by
Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel it was a sincere effort to provide a balanced
forum, and we chose not to participate,'' said Microsoft spokesman
Greg Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the panel of speakers at the Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing yesterday read like a list of Microsoft rivals: Larry
Ellison, the outspoken Microsoft critic who is CEO of Oracle Corp.;
Mitchell Kertzman of Sybase (which makes competing database
software); Jeff Papows of Lotus (a division of IBM that makes
competing office software); and Rob Glaser of RealNetworks (which
makes competing multimedia software).
</P>
<P>
   Many of the CEOs rehashed to the committee complaints that they
already had taken public _ such as Kertzman's allegation that
Microsoft tried to force him out of the market by giving away its
software for free.
</P>
<P>
   But RealNetworks CEO Glaser, a former Microsoft senior vice
president who had been silent in the Microsoft debate, stunned the
industry by joining the ranks of Microsoft critics.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's change of heart was especially surprising because
Microsoft owns a 10 percent stake in his firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because Microsoft is taking actions that simply stop
our company's products from working,'' Glaser told the committee.
``This is not fair play.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaser demonstrated how RealNetworks' video playing software
stopped working after he loaded Microsoft's competing product onto
a personal computer. He said Microsoft had refused to fix the
problem despite repeated requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft asks consumers in its advertisements, `Where do you
want to go today?''' Glaser said. ``But if Microsoft continues on
its present course, consumers will increasingly be asking, `Is
there anywhere I can go except where Microsoft wants me to?'''
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft said it has traced the problem to a glitch in
RealNetworks' software _ not its own. Microsoft said it soon will
post a description of the bug on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, allegations emerged that Microsoft asked Apple
to curtail its development of multimedia software called QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Microsoft asked
Apple three times to stop making QuickTime for Windows in exchange
for Microsoft endorsing other Apple software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied the charges. Apple executives would not comment
but confirmed that they had been subpoenaed by the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multimedia is one area where Microsoft and Apple have some
disagreements, but we're trying to resolve them professionally,''
added Apple spokeswoman Katie Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations could add fodder to the pending antitrust case
against Microsoft, which was filed in May by the Justice Department
and 20 states. The suit accuses Microsoft of using its Windows
monopoly to promote its Web browser software.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts say it's unlikely that government prosecutors
could include new charges before the trial date of September 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have time to investigate these charges while they
are getting ready for trial,'' said Rich Gray, an antitrust
attorney in San Jose. ``But once they get to the other end of this
trial, then they'll come back to it.''

 Senate Backs Internet Gambling Ban  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All bets are off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly yesterday to shut down the
online gambling industry, condemning it as a corrupting influence
on young Americans and a major contributor to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 90 to 10 to ban an estimated 140 offshore Web
sites _ with names like World Sports Exchange, InterCasinos and
NetCasino _ from letting U.S. high rollers play interactive
blackjack, video poker, roulette and other casino-style games over
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The ban is expected to sweep through the House and be signed
into law by President Clinton this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is unregulated, accessible by minors,
addictive, subject to abuse for fraudulent purposes like money
laundering, evasive of state gambling laws _ and already illegal at
the federal level in many cases,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
the bill's chief author.
</P>
<P>
   Online wagers _ available 24 hours a day from the privacy of
homes and offices _ add up to an estimated $1 billion worldwide,
$600 million of it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If it becomes law, the gambling ban would be the most
far-reaching Internet legislation since the Communications Decency
Act of 1996. That bill, which barred indecent and ``patently
offensive'' materials on the Net, was ruled unconstitutional by the
U.S. Supreme Court last year.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling legislation _ included as an amendment to a $33.2
billion spending bill _ would force Internet service providers in
the United States to use filtering software to block customer
access to cybergambling, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gambling already is considered illegal under a 1961
federal law that bars interstate gambling over telephone wires.
While that has deterred U.S. operators from establishing online
betting, it has not stopped offshore companies from setting up
global online casinos in exotic locales such as the Caribbean and
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kyl's provision, gamblers face fines up to $500 and jail
terms of up to three months; individuals running gambling sites
could be imprisoned for four years and fined $20,000 or three times
the amount of bets accepted.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ban would not apply to:
</P>
<P>
   _State lotteries and off-track betting that employ
``closed-loop, subscriber-based'' computer systems unavailable to
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   _Sites for popular sports ``rotisserie'' leagues, in which
consumers pick professional athletes and bet on their statistics,
as long as fees are not used to pay off bets.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, meanwhile, rejected Native American groups' appeal
that they be exempted from the Internet rule because their casinos
and gambling operations are sanctioned under a separate federal
law. Kyl said that would create a mammoth loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl's provision has been hotly disputed for more than a year,
stuck in a political tug-of-war between opposing interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill range from consumer advocate Ralph Nader and
the four major sports leagues to law-enforcement officials, the
Christian Coalition and regulated gambling operations. All of them
contend that unfettered access to gambling contributes to
bankruptcy, crime, family breakups and, in some cases, suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online gambling is a predatory attack on main street America.
With a click of a mouse, you could lose your house,'' said Tom
Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Gambling
Expansion in Hanover, Ill. ``People are wagering, and losing _
$2,000 an evening in front of their PCs, instead of watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Licensed U.S. casinos, such as the Las Vegas Mirage, say they
oppose cyberwagers because they are not subject to strict controls
over ownership or fairness of the games. For example, no one makes
sure that virtual slot machines occasionally pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters of the ban agree. ``Legalized online gambling
is legalized stealing,'' Christian Coalition spokesman Arne Owens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, argue that the bill is toothless and will do
little to dissuade online gambling ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's being proposed here is outright prohibition without any
attempt at regulation,'' said Sue Schneider, chairwoman of the
Interactive Gaming Council, a group promoting online gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Internet providers, who would bear the brunt of implementing
blocks against gambling sites, also protested the legislation. ``We
adamantly oppose the idea of turning ISPs into online traffic
cops,'' said Justin Newton, public policy director of the ISP
Consortium, a Minneapolis-based organization that represents 300
Internet service providers worldwide. ``It is technologically
impossible to track all the content that travels over our online
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said enforcement of the legislation could be
equally troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the California attorney general's office in
Sacramento acknowledged it would be difficult to pinpoint
individuals gambling online.
</P>
<P>
   And Sebastian Sinclair, an analyst with Christiansen Cummings
Associates, a New York gambling consulting firm, said the
governments of Antigua, the Dominican Republic and other offshore
gambling hotbeds have shown no willingness to extradite individuals
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many in the online gambling industry said the
legislation will do little to damper the proliferation of virtual
casinos. The industry has mushroomed from a dozen companies a year
ago to about 140 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to gamble, they gamble. You can't wiretap and
monitor everyone's personal computer,'' said David Herschman, CEO

SENATE CONDEMNS INTERNET GAMBLING IN 90-10 VOTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By STEVE LASH 
 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to outlaw
most gambling in cyberspace, casting into legal limbo a burgeoning
$600 million-per-year industry.
</P>
<P>
   By a 90-10 vote, senators approved a measure to extend a federal
ban on interstate betting by telephone or wire to include the
Internet. Before passing the legislation, the Senate rejected,
82-18, an effort to exempt Indian tribes from the prohibition on
Internet wagering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet gambling is unregulated, accessible by minors,
addictive, subject to abuse for fraudulent purposes like money
laundering, evasive of state gambling laws _ and already illegal at
the federal level in many cases,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.,
chief sponsor of the measure. Permitting an exception for tribes
would render the prohibition meaningless as anybody with a computer
would have access to the Indian casinos, he added.
</P>
<P>
   About $600 million was wagered over the Internet last year,
according to Kyl's office.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-gambling bill, an amendment to pending funding
legislation, contains exceptions that would allow states to conduct
lotteries over the Internet. In addition, off-track-betting on
horse and dog races would be permitted so long as wagers are placed
on subscriber-based computer systems inaccessible to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Also permitted under the measure are the popular sports
``fantasy'' or ``rotisserie'' leagues, in which fans create their
own roster of professional athletes and bet on how well their teams
will do. However, the fees Internet sites charge for using these
sites could not be used to pay off bets.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals convicted of running gambling sites on the Internet
could be imprisoned for four years and fined $20,000 or three times
the amount wagered. People found guilty of gambling on the World
Wide Web could be imprisoned for three months and fined $500.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill argue the ban is necessary because of the
difficulty in trying to regulate virtual casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The easy access and anonymity for bettors makes it possible for
youngsters who get their hands on a parent's credit cards to run up
debt, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from states that have refused to legalize games
of chance expressed concern that residents cannot be prevented from
signing in and placing wagers on sporting events or the turn of a
card in virtual casinos operated from locations thousands of miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   A recent State Department report also criticized foreign
Internet gambling operations in places like Antigua for providing a
haven for money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Internet gambling industry,
assailed the Senate for placing ``a blockade around the U.S.''
while other countries, such as Australia, permit cyberspace
gambling. She also noted with disdain that senators chose to carve
out exceptions for lotteries and parimutuel betting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not prohibition; it has exceptions,'' said
Schneider, who chairs the Interactive Gaming Council. ``It's a
little inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was part of a bill that provided $33.2 million
for the Justice, State and Commerce departments in fiscal year
1999, which begins Oct. 1. The overall spending bill passed 99-0. A
similar measure to outlaw gambling on the Internet is awaiting
action in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who voted against the Kyl bill were Joseph Biden,
D-Del.; Larry Craig, R-Idaho; Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.; Pete
Domenici, R-N.M.; Russell Feingold, D-Minn.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa;
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska; and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. &QL;

MICROSOFT DESCRIBES A SUCCESSFUL YEAR AND TALKS OF MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Confident Microsoft executives Thursday outlined for
industry analysts a string of successes suggesting momentum
throughout the computer industry in markets as diverse as home
computers, business desktop machines, engineering work stations and
the giant computers that connect entire corporations and serve up
World Wide Web sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain this momentum, the company said it planned to
increase research and development spending to $3 billion a year
from $2.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, and to
pump almost $200 million a year more into technical and customer
support.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft officials here were laying out some of the most
impressive results recorded by a major American corporation this
year, in Washington the Senate Judiciary Committee was hearing
complaints from executives of several competing software companies
that Microsoft uses predatory marketing practices to squelch
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Among those testifying was Robert Glaser, a former Microsoft
employee who is now chairman of Real Networks, a Seattle-based
maker of software that enables users to receive live audio and
video on their Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser told senators that Microsoft had developed a new version
of its media player for the Windows 98 operating system that
undermines his software.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft lawyer, Brad Smith, said any problem Glaser had
encountered was unintended, adding that ``we'll keep working with
them'' to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   However, at a time when the company's business practices are
under attack by the Justice Department, several congressional
committees and 20 states and the District of Columbia, and under
investigation by European governments, Microsoft executives gave no
indication of abandoning the aggressive strategies that have made
it one of the world's most successful and feared corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while citing increasing market share against its
strongest rivals, including Sun Microsystems, Novell and Oracle in
applications as diverse as operating systems, data bases and
Internet commerce software, the company sought to play down any
possibility that the Justice Department's antitrust suit would have
a negative effect on its profit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jeff Raikes, its sales chief, suggested that Justice
Department investigators had misinterpreted a corporate sense of
humor as a strategic intention to eradicate competition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To demonstrate this corporate humor, Raikes played a music video
that the company had produced to motivate its sales force. In the
video, a spoof on the movie ``Men In Black,'' Raikes plays the role
of a rap singer wearing wrap-around dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   His lyrics include, ``We're the first, last and best line of
defense against the worst scum in the industry,'' and, referring to
Lawrence Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, ``Ellison is a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Microsoft officials expressed satisfaction with
advances in their share of several markets and with sales of
Windows 98, which they said was on track to match the first three
months' sales of Windows 95, the best-selling software ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has surprised a lot of people, including myself to some
extent,'' Raikes said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other areas where the company acknowledged it had
made less progress than it expected. Novell had proved to be a
tougher competitor than was expected in the network service market.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft executives asserted that they had taken five to
eight percentage points of market share away from Novell in the
last year, and Raikes said he would be disappointed if Microsoft's
market share did not grow an equal amount next year.
</P>
<P>
   As he does every year, Microsoft's chief financial officer
predicted that the company's growth would decline substantially in
the coming year because many of its products are mature and are
reaching the saturation point in the market. He also expressed fear
about the Asian troubles, adding, ``In fact, there is evidence it's
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year Microsoft appears to zero in on one company for
attack, and analysts who attended Thursday's meeting said the next
focus would be on the corporate data base business that Oracle now
dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison was in Washington on Thursday, testifying against
Microsoft's business practices.

ALLY OR FOE? A COMPLAINT ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of a young, fast-growing software
company testified at a Senate hearing Thursday that Microsoft Corp.
had introduced a competing product that crippled his company's most
recent technology.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors commonly complain that Microsoft business practices
are unfair. But this complaint appears particularly intriguing
because it comes from a company with close ties to Microsoft _ and
one that is engaged in a promising niche of the Internet software
market in which the government is investigating Microsoft tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was made by Robert Glaser, a former Microsoft
executive. Microsoft holds a 10 percent stake in his Seattle
company, Real Networks Inc., and licenses Real Networks technology.
After his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Glaser
said, ``I loved my 10 years at Microsoft and, even after today, I
think I have friends there.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's company is the leader in the emerging field of
so-called streaming software, which is used for sending recorded
voice and television-style video over the Internet and receiving
such multimedia programming on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's appearance before the committee included a computer
demonstration of how the latest version of Microsoft's software for
receiving streaming media, Windows Media Player, cannot play
Internet multimedia programming that is based on the latest Real
Networks technology.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser also read excerpts from an e-mail exchange with Bill
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, starting on July 6. Glaser said he
first became concerned about the problem caused by Microsoft's new
program, and the potential effect on his company, in May.
</P>
<P>
   By July, Glaser said, he was growing increasingly alarmed. Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had
been in touch with him about testifying in Washington, and Glaser
sent Gates an e-mail saying that he might go. In his testimony,
Glaser suggested that the communication with his old boss was a
final effort to settle his dispute instead of voicing it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   According to Glaser's account, Gates seemed in no mood to reach
an accommodation. Glaser said that Gates had said he was ``not very
familiar with our business relationship'' and later added that he
found it ``interesting'' that Glaser felt he had no choice but to
go to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gates closed his last e-mail to Glaser with what seemed to its
recipient a chilly dismissal. ``While you're in Washington, I
suggest you visit the National Gallery and the Smithsonian,'' Gates
wrote, according to Glaser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft vigorously denies Glaser's version of the recent
conflict between the two companies. Microsoft officials say the
software breakdown that seemed to be so convincingly shown by
Glaser's computer demonstration in the Senate hearing room applies
only to a test, or beta, version of Real Networks' software that
was posted on its Web site for downloading only a week or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This smoking gun turns out to be a water pistol,'' said Mark
Murray, a Microsoft spokesman. ``That demonstration was something
of a misleading stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, Glaser was mainly using his Senate
appearance as a negotiating ploy. And Microsoft was able to present
that view forcefully before the committee, thanks to its allies in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., introduced an
affidavit of Paul Maritz, a group vice president at Microsoft. The
affidavit said Glaser called Maritz on Wednesday afternoon and said
that he was prepared to ``negotiate all night if that's what it
takes'' to come to terms with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Maritz affidavit added, ``Mr. Glaser said that if the
negotiations he proposed for the night of July 22 resulted in an
agreement between the two companies, he would not testify the next
day before the Senate Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, Glaser said his call to
Maritz was merely a courtesy call. At the time, Glaser said, he was
in Washington and on his way to speak to Hatch before appearing
Thursday. The Maritz affidavit, Glaser said, ``is simply not
true.'' ``I was locked, loaded and ready to testify,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The committee hearing comes prior to a trial of the Justice
Department's antitrust case against Microsoft, which is scheduled
to begin on Sept. 8 in U.S. District Court in Washington. The
government contends that the company is unfairly using its
near-monopoly of the market for desktop personal computer software
to dominate the new market for Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives characterized Glaser's allegation as an
inexplicably overwrought reaction. ``We are still willing to have
our engineers sit down with the engineers of Real Networks and work
these problems out,'' said Murray, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, agreement among the engineers might be difficult as well.
Wednesday night, after six hours of software testing by its
programmers, Microsoft had concluded that the problem was with Real
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bug in their program, not ours,'' said Yusuf Mehdi, an
executive.

COMPUTER MUSCLE GETTING EASIER TO BUY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although computers priced below $1,000 get most of the attention
these days, the guts and glory in PCs are still in the high end. If
you want serious power, you'll have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't have to pay much. For about the past 18 months,
the average price for a state-of-the-art Windows-based personal
computer has ranged between $2,000 and $2,600, down from $2,500 to
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   If your needs are basic _ word processing, home finance,
Internet access, children's software _ you probably don't need a
muscle-bound machine. Spend your cash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're into serious gaming, computer graphics and
multimedia, here are two systems to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 5630, $2,600, Compaq Computer Corp.: Although
Compaq's Presario line is the most popular in home computing, it's
always suffered a bad rap from PC enthusiasts. They argue that the
Presario is so loaded down with bells and whistles that its
performance suffers.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Presarios once were loaded with proprietary
components _ sound and graphics systems built into the main system
board, modems mated with sound cards, and so on. As a result, those
who wanted speed and control over the configuration of their own
systems looked elsewhere, often at direct marketers such as Dell
and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's answer is a new line of high-end Presarios that don't
suffer from performance anxiety. The 5630, Compaq's top-of-the-line
Presario, is fast, easy to upgrade and still has enough bells and
whistles to satisfy the greediest gadget freak.
</P>
<P>
   The 5630 comes with a 400-megahertz Pentium II chip; a generous
128 megabytes of memory; a 10-gigabyte hard drive; a DVD-ROM drive;
a built-in Zip drive; a 56K fax modem that uses the new v.90
standard; a four-megabyte ATI 3D Rage LT Pro AGP-based graphics
card; and a sound card that uses the impressive new Aureal 3D audio
standard.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with a built-in Ethernet port, so you can plug it
directly into a home network. There are also two Universal Serial
Bus and one IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire or iLink) connections
on the front of the machine, making it easy to plug in camcorders,
digital cameras and scanners that use these kinds of connections.
</P>
<P>
   Both the modem and the video card on this computer are on
removable cards, so if something better comes along, you can
replace them. There are also plenty of open slots for further
expandability.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq ships this system with a fancy keyboard that includes a
handy volume control, easy-access buttons for sound and playing
music CDs, and a set of four buttons aimed at making it easier to
get to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those last four buttons are programmable, but figuring out how
to use them is tricky. Most of them point you to Web sites that pay
Compaq a little cash whenever you visit. This strikes me as just a
bit sleazy, particularly since changing the settings is not as easy
as it should be. Compaq has released a software patch that is
supposed to make it easier to change the buttons, but I have not
yet tried it.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is selling this machine on its Web site, as well as
through kiosks it is installing in computer and electronic stores
around the country. You can order it with extra features, such as a
Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D II graphics card or a Syquest
1.5-gigabyte removable disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   I tried this system with a new, 14-inch, flat-panel monitor, the
FP500, that was a serious disappointment. Though it's an
active-matrix display, it's almost as dark and hard to see as a
passive-matrix system. At $999, it's too expensive for most home
users to consider. Stick with one of Compaq's traditional monitors
until the price on this comes down and the quality of the display
goes up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pavilion 8290, $2,600, Hewlett-Packard: Although this model is
relatively old _ it was replaced earlier this month by the 8380 _
it's still on store shelves and probably can be found for less than
the list price shown here. The 8380 has a list price of just more
than $2,000, so it's possible this older model might be found for
less than that.
</P>
<P>
   The 8290 comes with a 400-megahertz Pentium II chip; 64
megabytes of memory; a roomy 12-gigabyte hard drive; a
four-megabyte ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP-based video card; a DVD-ROM
drive; a 56K fax modem; and 3-D stereo sound.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's keyboard also comes with buttons and controls
for volume, playing music CDs and launching some programs. In fact,
Hewlett-Packard pioneered these keyboards, and they do it better
than anyone else. It's much easier to reconfigure these buttons
than those of the Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Although the HP is not quite as zippy as the Compaq, which could
be chalked up to having only half the amount of memory, it still
will not disappoint. And like the Compaq, it is highly expandable.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find this machine and opt for the 8380 instead,
note that it will have 96 megabytes of memory, but a smaller hard
drive at eight gigabytes. It also has USB ports on the front of the
machine. Otherwise, they're almost twins.

RULE OF THUMB ON DUPLICATE FILES: WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T DELETE THEM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm trying to clean my hard drive of duplicate files, but I'm
not sure which files to delete. Can you give me some insight as to
which files are needed? My problem is I don't know which directory
needs the files in question. How can I distinguish them and delete
the right file?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a simple rule you can follow: If you don't know
whether to delete a file, then don't.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features found in lots of uninstall and
clean-up-your-hard-drive programs is a duplicate file finder.
Often, the files it finds in the vast reaches of a user's hard
drive duplicate those found in the Windowssystem folder.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on a second.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, those files aren't really duplicates. If you look
closely, they'll have different file sizes and dates on them. That
means they are different versions of the same files.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where users get into trouble. They believe they need only
one version, so they delete the older one. Or, they've heard that
all of these system files _ usually with extensions of DLL _ should
only be in the Windowssystem folder, and they remove the duplicate
found in an ordinary program folder.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, they'll find their system starts crashing a
lot. Or a program doesn't run. Or they suffer mysterious lockups.
</P>
<P>
   What happens is that programs written at different times rely on
different versions of key system files. Let's say you've got a copy
of FindElvis 1.0, written back in the early days of Windows 95. You
install it on your new, Windows 98-based PC. You look in your
system folder and see a DLL file called BIGFILE.DLL, dated 5/6/98.
But in your FindElvis folder, there's another file called
BIGFILE-.DLL, and it's got a date of 8/24/95.
</P>
<P>
   When FindElvis 1.0 was written, the programmer who created it
may have relied on certain aspects of the older version of BIGFILE.
If you delete that older version from the FindElvis directory, you
may not be able to find Elvis at all _ the program may not have
what it needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you delete the version in Windowssystem, then other programs
that might also use it can't get to it, because they don't know
about the FindElvis folder. They expect to find BIGFILE in the
system folder.
</P>
<P>
   When you can delete duplicate files is when they are exactly the
same size, have exactly the same name and exactly the same date.
Even then, don't delete the duplicate at first. Change the file's
name instead. If your system runs fine for a few days, then delete
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent question, a reader asked if it is better to
install a new motherboard first or Windows 98. You answered with
the motherboard. This is true, but before the user turns off the
computer to install it, he or she should go into the DeviceManager
and remove the old board's resources. This helps in that when the
PC is turned on with the new board, Windows isn't looking for the
old one and should not cause a lot of conflicts. This is helpful
when installing most new hardware and prevents a lot of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   A: You raise a good point. If the board you're installing is
fully Plug and Play compliant, there should be no problems. But
removing the drivers in Device Manager under System
Devices/Motherboard resources could prevent some lockups _ thanks
for the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the most important components for decent Web-surfing
speed? Modem? Memory? Chip speed?
</P>
<P>
   A: First, of course, is your connection speed. Above a certain
processor speed _ say, 166 megahertz _ most browser software
performs about the same. So, what you really want is more memory so
the browser software runs smoothly and your operating system
doesn't write to the hard disk as often, which slows everything
down.

Company developes child care internet computer system 
By Sanjay Bhatt  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ A Palm Beach Internet company's plans could help
the Murphy Browns of the world spend more time with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe inspire a few budding Murphy Browns, too.
</P>
<P>
   While some Internet companies use videocameras to give parents
the ability to watch their child in day care, Safe Technologies
International plans to take the concept a step further and give
parents the ability to have a conversation ``face-to-face'' on a
computer screen with their child or child's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is using a novel business strategy to bring its
child care computer system to market: Rather than selling its
services to day-care centers, Safe Technologies is focused on
buying these centers and weaving its services into their programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Safe Technologies announced it had signed a letter
of intent to buy its first child-care center operator, Toddler's
Learning Center, which runs two day-care centers in Stuart. Twelve
teachers and 13 other employees run a pre-school for children from
infants to the age of 5 and an after-school program for children
from ages 5 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to buy more child-care centers over the next
few years in Florida and the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We envision mothers who travel a lot will use this,'' said
Barbara Tolley, the 61-year-old chairwoman and CEO of Safe
Technologies International. ``She could carry a laptop and an
Internet phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies is a penny-stock company that emerged five
months ago from Tolley's take-over of Safe Aid Products, a holder
of patents on medical products. It employ 15 people, five in Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While its shares (SFAD) were selling for only about 10 cents
Thursday on the Over The Counter market, Safe Technologies has some
influential partners. In May, it announced that it signed a deal
with AT&AMP;T to put the phone company's Internet access software on
all Safe Technologies' new Internet software products.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley said Thursday that VocalTec Communications Ltd., an
Israeli company that had $7.7 million in losses on $15.7 million in
sales in 1997, will provide the technology for
video-teleconferencing. VocalTec's Internet Phone provides
real-time, two-way voice transmission over computer (much like a CB
radio), thus avoiding long-distance line charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hed goes here In general, Internet companies who sell the
monitoring service use a camera to capture a child's image in a
room every few seconds and transmit it to a secured computer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and other authorized users, such as grandparents, must
have an Internet address and password to access the image from
their computer via phone lines. Many such Internet sites also give
parents news of upcoming events, report cards and immediate
emergency notices.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies plans to use a similar set-up and will add
teleconferencing equipment to simulate a face-to-face conversation.
The company also is considering giving parents CD-ROMs with
age-appropriate educational content developed by child-care centers
to reinforce lessons taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many ramifications of how this (Internet)
could be used,'' Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right mix _ a profitable one _ is where Safe
Technologies hopes to buck the general trend of costly,
money-losing Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of this company is making acquisitions'' in
a variety of industries and integrating the Internet into the
company's operation to make it more efficient and profitable,
Tolley said. The company is looking to buy businesses in real
estate, technology, marketing, health care and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies has bought two companies since February _
Tampa-based Total Micro Computers, a computer systems seller, and
Miami-based Precision Imaging, a graphics printer which helps
produce Boca Raton Magazine, she said. She declined to say how much
the purchases cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tolley knows how much start-up capital Internet companies need
and how much money they can lose. As a marketing consultant, she
worked with AT&AMP;T in the early 1990s to develop a real estate search
engine for its private information services division.
</P>
<P>
   The product, PII.Net, moved to the Internet in 1995 before
another well-known search engine, Yahoo!, did, Tolley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet's free-lunch culture sapped the product's
profitability, and Tolley said she moved on to develop an Internet
mall for ``the rich and famous,'' and a CD-ROM for real estate
brokers called Real Estate 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM _ which allows brokers to access information and hold
video teleconferences _ paved the way for Safe Technologies' child
care CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Technologies' plans to use videoconferencing and buy child
care centers is unique, say heads of similar Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of anyone doing this with their own chain of
centers,'' said Seth Steinberg, president of Atlanta-based
ParentNet Inc., one of about 12 companies around the country that
sell Internet systems to day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 2-year-old company provides 4,000 parents and other
authorized users with glimpses of their children at day care over
the Internet and expects to double that number by September.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Steinberg's wife, who is the company co-owner,
ParentNet will soon service day-care centers in Jacksonville and
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Hed goes here Boca Raton-based Center-View.com Inc. also markets
an Internet system to child-care systems.
</P>
<P>
   ParentNet's monitoring service adds about $2 to the $120 a week
that parents pay for day care, Steinberg said. ``We expect true
growth to come in the future as it's accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg isn't so sure Safe Technologies' videoconferencing
will be a hit with education-oriented centers. ``It's disruptive to
the classroom. What's nice about (our) system is parents don't poke
their head in.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing his own 9-month-old boy and 3-year-old girl has
convinced Steinberg this technology's time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows you to see the games they like best, the kids they
interact with, how they nap. . . . It gets you in sync with them so
when you spend time with them you're reinforcing routines. That's
what a child needs _ structure and routine.''

SENATORS: COMPUTER BUG POSES HEALTH CARE CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's health care industry has fallen victim
to the millennium bug syndrome _ with no quick cure in sight.
</P>
<P>
   That was the diagnosis reached on Thursday by Sen. Bob Bennett,
R-Utah, who chairs a special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer
glitch. As Bennett sees it: ``If tonight when the clock strikes
midnight the calendar flipped to Dec. 31, 1999, large portions of
the health care system would fail.''
</P>
<P>
   His views were echoed by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who
said what people really want to know is whether ``people are going
to die as a result of Year 2000 complications in the medical
industry?''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd's answer: ``I don't think so. There's no need to put people
into a sense of panic. But it's entirely possible that millennium
conversion could put the health care industry into intensive
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential industry problems include the need to replace
thousands of kidney dialysis units, costing $14,000 apiece, that
will improperly shut down for maintenance when they are unable to
read the correct date. Similarly, there is concern about
malfunctioning computer-based scanners and patients' medical
records that become locked up or lost as systems fail.
</P>
<P>
   Rural and inner city hospitals and clinics are expected to be
especially hard-hit in light of their limited resources to finance
fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key issues raised at the hearing:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Health Care Financing Administration, which pays Medicare
claims, admitted that it recently had to revise its estimate of its
bug-infested programs from 20 million to 49 million lines of
computer code after an outside contractor performed an audit. But
Nancy-Ann DeParle, the agency's administrator, said ``we are making
substantial progress in addressing the Year 2000 problem'' after
she had made it her ``top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Food and Drug Administration has achieved only a 10
percent response rate to its repeated inquiries to the makers of
medical devices seeking Year 2000 compliance data. But Michael
Friedman, the FDA acting chief, said that the data gathered so far
shows ``no indications that there will be significant problems
which will place patients at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not reassuring,'' Dodd told Friedman, citing the low
response rate. ``I find that frightening. We've got to have the FDA
become a lot more aggressive about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the senators' concern, Jennifer Jackson, speaking for
the 5,000-member American Hospitals Association, called on Congress
to enact legislation that would force medical equipment makers to
impart information on whether their devices are Year 2000
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have the legislative or regulatory authority to
compel disclosure,'' Jackson noted.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association also voiced its concern over
the threat the Year 2000 problem poses to patient care. A
spokesman, Donald Palmisano, called on Congress to work with the
health care industry to forge a uniform definition of Year 2000
``compliant'' with regard to medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a bevy of administration and industry witnesses in the
health field, Bennett and Dodd cast doubt on optimistic government
forecasts that a fix would be in place before their
mission-critical systems were put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also berated makers of biomedical devices for
having failed to set up a central clearing house where the data
needed to repair the problem could be processed.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramin Mojdeh, speaking for the Health Industry Manufacturers
Association, stressed the complexity of the problem, which came
about when programmers wrote software and designed chips that can't
decode dates in 2000 or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that the challenge posed by the Year 2000 bug
doesn't represent a single problem that will yield to a single
solution,'' Mojdeh said, because the sensitivity to the bug varies
dramatically among medical devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Device Manufacturers Association, excluded from
testifying at the hearing, contended that the risk posed the Year
2000 problem has been ``overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology is not a component of most medical devices
and the vast majority of medical equipment that does rely upon
computer hardware and software is not date-sensitive,'' the trade
group argued.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has set up a web site,
www.fda.gov/cdrh/yr2000/year2000.html, that contains information on
products identified by their manufacturers as not being Year 2000
compliant as well as a list of those products said by their makers
to be unaffected by the problem.

NETSCAPE HOPING SURFERS WILL COME TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. has taken quite a beating from
Microsoft Corp. But so far, there's no sign of brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape once held over 80 percent of the market for Internet
browsers, with people paying up to $79 a copy. Today the company
isforced to give them away, and still Netscape's market share
dwindles _ it'sdown to about 52 percent now, with Microsoft at 45
percent and gaining fast.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no longer much hope of relief from that federal
antitrust case against Microsoft's browser-marketing practices.
Last month, a federal appeals court said that Microsoft has every
right to build its own browser directly into the Windows operating
system, even if it hurts Netscape's business. And whatever the
final outcome of the case, it'll likely come far too late to
provide Netscape with any relief.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation time? I'll say. But you can be desperate and shrewd
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing with a beta-test version of the newest
Netscape browser software, Communicator 4.5. For the most part it's
just another browser, with some fresh new bugs added. But Netscape
has added some clever new features that will appeal to serious Web
surfers, while setting the stage for Netscape's plan for long-term
survival.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen on hard times in the software business, Netscape
is now trying to become an Internet media company. Already its
Netcenter Web site is one of the 10 most visited Web sites, largely
because users of Communicator get taken automatically to the
Netcenter home page.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Communicator features reinforce this idea. Indeed,
every time you use the browser, it'll seek out ways to bring you
back to the Netcenter portal. Netscape is trying to drive traffic
to its portal, so it can attract paying advertisers and sponsors,
and so it can persuade you to shop at Netscape's on-line retail
mall.
</P>
<P>
   The company is doing this the right way _ with a system called
Smart Browsing that links Netcenter and the browser in ways that
make life easier for the common Web surfer.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're looking for Delta Airlines. These days, you'd
probably head to Yahoo or AltaVista to look up the Web address. Or
you could just type Delta Airlines in the address space of the new
Netscape browser.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, the browser contacts Netcenter, where Netscape has
compiled an index of thousands of businesses and organizations. The
index finds a listing for Delta, and the company's Web address. The
information is relayed to your browser, and up pops the site.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape didn't invent this idea. Visit http://www.realnames.com
for a similar service. But Netscape is the first to build it right
into the browser. It's the best effort so far to liberate us from
the tyranny of typing dot-com. But there's more. Click a button
marked ``What's Related.'' Netcenter whips up a list of 10 other
Web sites with similar content, and flashes it on your screen. If
you change your mind about flying Delta, a couple of clicks takes
you to the Southwest Airlines site instead.
</P>
<P>
   You never even know you've paid a visit to Netcenter_it all
happens behind the scenes. But say you want generic information on
a particular topic, like cars. When you type in the word
``automobiles,'' up pops Netcenter, with a listing of popular
automotive Web sites, and some strategically placed advertisements.
It's the ads that bring in the money, and by routing your eyes past
them, the browser will fatten up Netscape's cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody likes this idea. Type a generic word in today's
browsers, and the browser simply adds a ``www'' in front and a
``.com'' in back. If you type ``automobiles'', you wind up at a
car-buff site called Automobiles.com. Knowing this, lots of
companies own generic-sounding Web addresses. But with the new
Netscape browser, type ``automobile'' and you go to a Netcenter
page with information on cars instead. This could hurt traffic at
many other Web sites. Several businesses are already complaining
about this, and Netscape is working on ways to mollify the
companies, perhaps by giving their sites a prominent space on
Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   There's definitely a hint of desperation in Netscape's new
strategy. Here's a company that once thought to dominate the
Internet software business, reduced to scrabbling after the fickle
eyeballs of Web surfers. Oh, well. You do what you have to do, and
on the whole, Netscape is doing it rather well.

A BETTER MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the Anir Mouse from Animax International of
Oslo, doesn't look like a computer mouse at all _ more like a
mutant joystick. Then there's the name: What's an Anir? Some
ill-tempered Norse god?
</P>
<P>
   But then I wrapped my hand around it for a few weeks and
realized that the Anir Mouse is the most comfortable device of its
kind I've ever touched.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand why the $50 Anir Mouse is so comfortable
simply by resting your forearm on a table. Just plop it down on the
surface. Now notice how it's lying. Chances are that most of the
weight is resting on the outer edge of your arm and hand, with your
thumb facing upward.
</P>
<P>
   The designers of the Anir Mouse have created a device that takes
advantage of this natural resting position of the arm. With a
standard mouse, you twist the wrist to put your hand in the right
position, and to slide the mouse around. It's a slight effort, but
hours of mousing around can take a toll on your arm.
</P>
<P>
   With the Anir Mouse, I simply drop the edge of my hand on the
base and curl my fingers around the grip. My thumb rests easily on
a rocker switch at the top of the grip. I can make left or right
mouse clicks simply by tilting my thumb from side to side. A third
mouse switch is embedded in the grip, where I can click it with the
slightest pressure.
</P>
<P>
   To move the mouse, I just pivot my elbow from side to side or
pull it back and forth from the shoulder. I never have to twist my
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a day or two to get used to the way the Anir Mouse
works. For example, to use it properly, you must rest your forearm
on the desk. That means the Anir Mouse will take up more room on
your desk than a traditional mouse. But what you lose in desk space
you gain in comfort.

MICROSOFT'S HOMEADVISOR SITE PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has created a new Web site called HomeAdvisor,
which it claims will provide you all the help you need to buy a
house and find a mortgage loan.
</P>
<P>
   But the site, at www.homeadvisor.com, is bogged down by
technical glitches and information gaps during what Microsoft calls
a ``preview'' stage, which began about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the promised features are missing, and the site is
plagued with technical problems that make it tough to use _
sometimes impossible, depending on your browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it started with a preview version to iron out the
kinks and get consumer reaction. It says the site will be
``substantially modified'' over the coming weeks _ which would be a
good thing. Right now, it is about as useful as a house without a
roof.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ian Morris, lead product manager for HomeAdvisor, why
Microsoft would jeopardize its world-class reputation by posting a
primitive, faulty Web site, even temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   He replied that ``you really can't predict every issue'' before
activating a site. He contends that despite the glitches, the site
has gotten ``tons of positive responses'' from users.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers point out that Microsoft has done this sort
of thing before _ putting out bug-ridden products to establish a
position in a market before gradually improving the quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner they get into a market and make everyone nervous _
so no one else will come in _ the better,'' says one veteran
Microsoft-watcher. ``It's like a dog marking its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, once HomeAdvisor progresses from
``preview'' to ``officially live,'' you will be able to use it to
tap into all 500-plus Multiple Listing Services nationwide and call
up data and photos for all the houses offered for sale in any
neighborhood you choose.
</P>
<P>
   You will be able to screen them by community, neighborhood,
price, size and amenities _ such as air conditioning, family rooms
and formal dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a house that seems appealing, you can enter data
about your finances to find a mortgage loan that suits you. And you
can contact a lender online, to see whether you qualify.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft makes good on all those promises, it should have
the most useful home-buying site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, that distinction belongs to San Francisco-based
HomeShark, which operates a Web site at www.homeshark.com.
HomeShark has the edge now because it has a much more complete
database than HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor is woefully short of listings. Even where houses are
listed, the photos haven't materialized yet. And the choice of
mortgage lenders is slim _ just three institutions in the entire
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, the Web site is a technological nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   When I tried navigating with Netscape, I frequently got stymied
by blank white screens or error messages _ especially the dreaded,
fatal ``JavaScript'' error, from which there is no appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it,'' says Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the sly technicians at Microsoft built
incompatibility into the site to discredit arch-rival Netscape?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Morris says HomeAdvisor also doesn't work well
with Microsoft's own Internet Explorer, version 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor does work with Internet Explorer 4.0 but just
barely. After you bring up the site _ which can take several
minutes _ you encounter interminable delays as you move from page
to page. The experience is as frustrating as coaxing a lame mule up
Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says that's partly because the site has been handling
traffic ``many times higher than expected'' since it opened on
Bastille Day. ``We've added some servers, and the performance has
gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Microsoft, HomeAdvisor currently offers listings
for only about a fourth of the 1.2 million or so homes nationwide
that real estate agents list for sale at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   There are big gaps in the Bay Area: few or no listings for San
Francisco, Mill Valley and Pleasanton, for example. On the other
hand, there are plenty of listings for San Mateo, Burlingame and
Montara.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know anything about Montara before using HomeAdvisor,
so I seized the opportunity to test the site's demographics
section, which offers background information on every community.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor says that Montara, located on the coast in San Mateo
County, has 2,832 residents and a median household income of
$83,555. It describes Montara as a place where people ``play
racquetball ... rent foreign videos ... own an Acura ... read
Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Its students rack up good test scores, perhaps because the ratio
of students to teachers is less than 19. But if you want a more
complete report on the schools, you have to pay $34. There also is
an extra charge _ $20 _ for detailed crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   That seems exorbitant. School information is available free from
the board of education in virtually every California community.
Crime statistics are available free from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, among other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says Microsoft is still negotiating to get home data from
most of the Multiple Listing Services. It has signed up less than
half of them, and many of those still haven't been included online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things that makes this project
challenging,'' Morris remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Each home listing is supposed to be accompanied by a color
photograph _ but I couldn't find any, despite numerous attempts.
Whenever I called up the data on a particular house, I found a
rectangular frame surrounding the legend ``No Photo Available.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos will be added soon, Morris promises.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft eventually plans to give HomeAdvisor users a broad
selection of mortgage lenders to choose from, but at the moment it
has lined up only American Finance and Investment, Principal
Residential Mortgage and Homeside Lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a number of discussions,'' Morris says. ``But those
three give the average consumer a good starting point. They offer
broad coverage, good pricing and great service.''
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing HomeAdvisor, I compared it head to head with
HomeShark.
</P>
<P>
   I pretended to be a prospective buyer interested in houses in
San Mateo with at least three bedrooms and priced between $350,000
and $400,000. San Mateo is one of the more prominent Bay Area
communities already included in HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor came up with 16 houses that fit the parameters,
while HomeShark produced 13.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to tell how much the listings overlapped,
because HomeShark didn't disclose seven of the addresses.
HomeAdvisor disclosed them all.
</P>
<P>
   I focused on a house on 30th Avenue, with an asking price of
$399,000, that appeared on both lists. HomeShark showed a color
photo of the house, while HomeAdvisor didn't, but otherwise
HomeAdvisor's display was more useful.
</P>
<P>
   I learned from HomeAdvisor that the house has interior space of
1,247 square feet, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fireplace and a
two-car garage.
</P>
<P>
   HomeShark mentions the number of rooms and bathrooms, but
nothing else. It refers homebuyers who want more information to the
listing broker.
</P>
<P>
   The pages that display information on individual houses follow a
uniform format on HomeAdvisor. On HomeShark they differ greatly,
because the listing agents design them. Some agents don't include
photos.
</P>
<P>
   If you are ready to look for a mortgage loan, HomeShark directs
you to eight lenders, all with a large assortment of mortgages.
That gives it an edge over HomeAdvisor, with its three lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike HomeAdvisor, HomeShark doesn't provide demographic
information.
</P>
<P>
   There are several other Web sites designed for people who want
to find or finance homes. None of them offers the breadth of
information you get from HomeShark, or will get _ the gods of
technology willing _ from HomeAdvisor. Some of them provide only
loan information, with no home listings.
</P>
<P>
   The following sites deserve at least a look from prospective
homebuyers:
</P>
<P>
   _www.quicken.com, from Intuit, provides as much detailed
information on individual houses as HomeAdvisor intends to provide.
But it covers only about 40 percent of the United States. In the
Bay Area it is limited to Alameda and Contra Costa counties. You
can use the site to get prequalified for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   _www.realtor.com, sponsored by the National Association of
Realtors, purports to contain every real estate listing nationwide.
Yet I found only six in my control group _ San Mateo houses priced
in the $350,000 to $400,000 range. That's less than half the number
offered by HomeAdvisor and HomeShark. The listings don't include
square footage, addresses or photos.
</P>
<P>
   _www.bankrate.com, from Bank Rate Monitor, is the most
comprehensive of the mortgage-only sites, listing some 50 different
lenders and a huge variety of loans. You can apply for a loan
online.
</P>
<P>
   _www.eloan.com, from E-Loan Inc., provides a long list of
lenders and mortgages and lets you get the loan of your choice
preapproved online. However, you must pay a $9.95 preapproval fee.
</P>
<P>
   _www.homebynet.com, a joint venture of Banc One Mortgage and
NeoLogics Software, helps you find a loan and lender with minimal
fuss. You can get a prequalification verdict for free, without
disclosing your identity. The other Web sites won't let you stay
anonymous if you want to prequalify.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once you actually apply for a loan, you have to tell
the lender who you are, and provide a lot of intimate details about
your finances.
</P>

 &HT;    Austin hostel provides unique view of city
 &HT;    By James Hibberd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Taos has teepees. Yosemite a mountain cabin. Portland a
lighthouse and Hartford a Victorian mansion. Death Valley has a
squat mobile home on hardpan desert and, in its publicity photo,
you can almost see heat waves baking young travelers inside.
</P>
<P>
   Austin has . . .well, what does Austin have? If hostels are, as
one veteran traveler said, the windows through which a city is
viewed, then the Austin hostel is a one-way mirror. The modest
building on Lakeshore Drive is tucked away on the southeast side of
Town Lake, unseen by most of the city's bustling downtown and
university populations. Our hostel is so nondescript even neighbors
stop to ask what it is (''It's what?'' they reply. ``A hotel? A
hospital?'').
</P>
<P>
   Looks can be deceiving. Inside this small hostel, more than
9,000 visitors from every corner of the globe each year make a
temporary home in 40 beds. They come to Austin, almost all for the
first time and most staying no longer than a week, and peer at our
city through the prism of this lakeside window. They see Austin
unfettered by traffic, environmental threats, crime, racism or
political bickering _ a snapshot of a place these travelers say is
one of the friendliest cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hostel territory
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pollard returns the hostel's rental canoe to the storage
shed, towels off and comes inside to escape the 95-degree noontime
heat. He's in the hostel's common area, where European flags hang
from the high ceiling and several hungover guests watch TV or bury
their tired faces between couch cushions. Sunlight beams through
the large picture windows and prevents any serious napping.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard's girlfriend stops writing an e-mail on the hostel
computer and looks at him quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been canoeing,'' he explains in his strong English accent.
``Not quite Belize revisited, but refreshing nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, 30, is wearing Tevas, shorts and a T-shirt. It's the
unofficial hosteling uniform and, if you get a group of guests
together, they look like a staff of summer camp counselors.
</P>
<P>
   They're at an Austin summer camp for adventurers who can't
afford fancier travel accommodations. This camp is one link in the
5,000-plus Hostelling International chain, a non-profit network of
beds, baths and communal kitchen for globetrotters on the cheap.
Formerly called ``Youth Hostels,'' the network now accepts visitors
of all ages, but 18-to-30 year olds still dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the U.K., most hostels are in old houses, but this is
really clean and folks here go out of their way to help you _ it's
the best we've stayed in,'' Pollard says. ``We came here because we
heard that Austin's the best place for live music. It's all rather
brilliant. I think Austin's kind of . . . radical? Liberal?''
</P>
<P>
   On his way back to the men's sleeping quarters, Pollard chats
with Keith Burns, a 20-year-old from Atlanta, who is sweeping the
floor. Last night, Burns learned how to acquire drinks on Sixth
Street without a legal ID and plans to perfect his technique
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible here,'' he says of Austin's nightlife. ``In
Atlanta, a girl won't even talk to you unless you have a hot car.
Here, all you have to do is smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns performs three hours of daily cleaning in exchange for a
free stay (the price is normally $13 for Hostelling International
members, $16 for non-members). This is his first hosteling
experience, a warm-up before taking on the European hostel circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected a bunch of cots in a big gym, where you'd have to
keep an eye on your stuff,'' Burns says. ``Even the name `hostel'
sounds like a trashy, rugged place. This is like a small resort. We
got TV, AC, Internet _ anything goes here.''
</P>
<P>
   Except littering. Bobby Peele and his wife Sam, who run the
hostel, require few of the chores demanded of guests at many
hostels, but they do insist visitors put trash in the appropriate
bins. It's tougher than you think, since there's a half-dozen
separate recycling containers for every sort of waste, from paper
to colored glass to compost.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the environmental emphasis that's been
characteristic of the Austin hostel since it opened in 1989 (the
only other Texas hostels are in San Antonio, Houston and El Paso).
The Lakeshore Drive facility has the distinction being the first
U.S. hostel to operate entirely on solar power and sponsors a Town
Lake clean-up four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental philosophy is not just the Peeles' ideology,
but the pioneering spirit of hosteling. A German school teacher,
Richard Schirrmann, founded the movement in the early 1900s, saying
the industrial revolution was depriving students of the opportunity
to travel and experience nature.
</P>
<P>
   So this is Austin
</P>
<P>
   A young man from New York climbed out of a taxi. Setting down
his backpack, he paused to survey the hostel. The lawn was green
and glorious Town Lake peeked around the sides. Sitting on the
grass was pretty, nose-ringed hostel staffer Teresa Barber.
</P>
<P>
   The young man spread his arms and said, ``So this is Texas!''
</P>
<P>
   Barber relates the story with a laugh. She sits behind the
check-in counter next to local entertainment listings and collage
of postcards sent from around the world. Under the counter are
supplies such as razors, shampoo and patches that say ``I Sleep
With Strangers at the Austin Hostel.'' One of her job
responsibilities is feeding Town Lake ducks that waddle up from the
shore.
</P>
<P>
   She's waiting for the nightly wave of incoming travelers. About
60 percent are from U.S. cities and the rest from abroad. If, as
happens about 15 weekends per year, she fills the hostel's 40 bunk
beds (in four rooms separated by sex), she'll call the
Goodall-Wooten or Taos Cooperative, University of Texas-area
private dormitories that accept hostelers during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people in here and they're so excited,'' Barber says.
``They're like, `Where's Sixth Street? How can we see the bats?
Where's Stevie Ray Vaughan?''
</P>
<P>
   Some guests are so excited, they don't go home.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Boyle, 23, is one of many hostel visitors using the
facilities while establishing residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, I was staying at this $200 weekly-rate
motel on South Congress,'' says the San Diego transplant.
``Prostitutes were going in and out and somebody robbed the food
mart next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boyle looked up ``Hostel'' in the Yellow Pages and moved
into the Lakeshore Drive facilities. Although guests are only
typically allowed to stay for one week, Boyle has been allotted a
little more time while he searches for a job and an apartment. He
says his South Congress experience hasn't spoiled the otherwise
pleasant culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the coast, everybody's gotta have this front, an
attitude,'' he says. ``I expected everybody to be really laid back
and friendly in Austin, and I heard right.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the hosteler's point of origin, observations like
Boyle's are the common denominator: Austin's so friendly, the live
music is so wonderful, the residents are so laid back . . .
</P>
<P>
   The flattering phrases are a cliched litany we hear less
frequently nowadays around Austin and they lend a sense of
nostalgia to the 9-year-old hostel. It's as if the environmental,
youthful and idyllic Austin has been bottled up in this little
building. Travelers seek the Austin they've heard so much about and
still find it among the soaring rents and congested traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, to visit the hostel, to stay among visitors who've
never been to Austin before, is to be reminded of why people choose
to live here. Travelers look through this window and see what we've
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you learn most working here,'' Barber says, ``is how much
we take Austin for granted.''

 &HT;    Salamander-conservation plan for Barton Springs pool debated
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox New Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Swimmer after swimmer at an Austin, Texas public
hearing recently criticized a proposed salamander-conservation plan
that calls for a new dam, reduced cleanings and other changes
intended to accommodate the endangered amphibians while allowing
public use of Barton Springs Pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow people to be forced out of that
pool,'' said Mark Gentle, a local lawyer and regular swimmer,
drawing a burst of applause from about 50 like-minded people at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Leoda Anderson, a retired University of Texas administrative
assistant who has swum at the pool for more than 20 years, said:
``The salamanders have not suffered through 70 years of cleanings.
And nobody has produced a stepped-on salamander yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jack Lawrence, a computer programmer and 25-year pool user,
said swimmers are ``the truly endangered species. This is kind of a
ham-fisted approach. This is not an aquarium and there's no way it
can be absolutely safe for the salamander.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was drafted by the City of Austin and is under review
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The wildlife service listed
the 2.5-inch-long Barton Springs salamander as an endangered
species last year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a key part of the city's application to the wildlife
service for a permit that would allow continued cleaning, swimming
and wading even if salamanders occasionally were killed or injured
in the process. The city, in turn, would pursue conservation
measures estimated to cost about $2 million over the 15-year life
of the permit.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for a 3-foot-high dam separating the shallow and
deep ends. This would allow more frequent cleaning of the shallow
end without affecting the deep end, where the salamanders
congregate. The deep end would be lowered only four times a year
for cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a gravel-bottomed area known as the beach would be
deepened so that people would be less likely to step on
salamanders. And an area of limestone ledges and underground
openings known as the fissures would be roped off permanently.
Sunken Gardens, a nearby spring outlet that until recently was open
to unfettered public swimming, would be restricted to educational
uses.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Duncan, the city's environmental officer, said the plan,
including the number of deep-end cleanings, is subject to change.
Wildlife service officials agreed. ``This is a crown jewel for
Austin and always has been -- but also for the salamander,'' David
Frederick, the wildlife service's supervisor for interior Texas,
said in an interview. ``This proposal shows the rest of the nation
that Austin wants all things to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grant Godfrey, a lawyer for the Save Our Springs Alliance,
an environmental group, criticized the federal agency and the city
for not doing more to guard against larger threats to the
salamander. Government and independent scientists agree that urban
development and a toxic spill are the main hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Runoff of stormwater washes soil, fertilizer, oil and other
pollutants into streams that feed an underground limestone
formation known as the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards
Aquifer. The formation supplies well water to 45,000 people and
flow at the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Roads, pipelines and railroad tracks across the watershed pose a
continuing threat of a gasoline or chemical spill that could wipe
out the species in a single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the salamander is endangered is that it cannot
escape upstream pollution, which all gets funneled through Barton
Springs,'' Godfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brandes, a local landowner, said the chafing by swimmers
and environmentalists at proposed pool-use restrictions was
reminiscent of how landowners reacted when the wildlife service
sought to limit property development to protect endangered
songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners have had to give up large percentages of land to
comply with the Endangered Species Act,'' Brandes said. ``What is
being asked of the swimming public is insignificant by
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife service is expected to make a final decision on the
city's conservation proposal in late August or early September,
Frederick said.

UNCONVENTIONAL WAY TO SELL SOFTWARE  
 FREE STOCK SHARES FROM THE INTERNET  
 BAND OF ANGELS INVESTS IN SENDMAIL

<P>
   Unconventional Way to Sell Software
</P>
<P>
   Is Katrina Garnett a real-life Lara Kroft?
</P>
<P>
   Kroft is, of course, the computer-generated character whose
popularity in the game Tomb Raider has made her the first fictional
cyberbabe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garnett is president and chief executive of the start-up
company Crossworlds Software in Burlingame, Calif., which creates
software that links disparate programs for tasks like inventory
management and payroll systems. Ms. Garnett, 36, has been
attracting Kroft-type attention for a print advertisement that
promotes Crossworlds in an unusual manner.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the ad has been appearing in mainstream magazines
like Business Week, Fortune, Vanity Fair and W rather than in
computer publications. For another, the ad, created in-house, shows
Ms. Garnett wearing a low-cut black cocktail dress and a Mona Lisa
smile; the photograph was shot by Richard Avedon of fashion-world
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Another unconventional aspect of the ad is the text, which
resembles a Playboy Playmate's biography crossed with an old
``Dewar's Profile'' ad for Dewar's Scotch whisky. Ms. Garnett is
described as a ``trail blazer'' whose credo is presented as ``Aim
high _ then deliver''; under her ``recent thrill,'' the ad lists
``flying 360-degree inverted loops in a SF260 Marchetti.''
</P>
<P>
   There is increasing interest in Silicon Valley along Madison
Avenue; for instance, Kim Polese, president and chief executive of
the software company Marimba Inc., and Esther Dyson, the technology
newsletter editor, appear with women like Reba McEntire and Bebe
Neuwirth in a 32-page ad supplement for Anne Klein sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Crossworlds ad is different enough to have turned Ms.
Garnett into a media darling, the subject of coverage from CNBC to
The New York Post to The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   As for complaints about using her femininity to sell software,
Ms. Garnett replied: ``I'm a woman. What should I do, dress like a
nerd? If I'd felt compromised, I'd have never done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garnett looks good in a little black dress, but can she
write and ship code? The answer seems to be yes; though prices for
software sold by the fledgling company start at a hefty $250,000,
the Crossworlds client list already includes accounts like Bay
Networks Inc. and Siemens Corp. The company, whose investors
include Intel and Compaq, is expected to go public next year.
</P>
<P>
   _STUART ELLIOTT
</P>
<P>
   Free Stock Shares From the Internet
</P>
<P>
   As one of Gypsy Rose Lee's colleagues told her, ``You gotta get
a gimmick.'' And the fledgling Internet entrepreneur Ralph Bartel
knows it, too.
</P>
<P>
   When this 32-year-old from Hamburg, Germany, started the travel
Web site Travelzoo.com in April, he had no money and no original
content. What he did have was a dream of his own media company, and
the knowledge that traffic equals power on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So he concocted a strategy: give away three free shares of stock
to Web surfers who signed up on the site, allowing him to amass a
database that he claims now has more than 450,000 names. (He
promises not to sell the list.) Upon signing up on the site, the
person receives an e-mail with serial numbers for the stock and the
message ``Your shares will be kept in the electronic share register
at our offices in the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   As with many other things Internet, practicality appears to have
taken a back seat to frenzy. News of the offer has spread via
e-mail, in a sort of digital-age pyramid scheme: If you get a
friend to sign up, you get another share.
</P>
<P>
   Bartel said he is not behind an e-mail now circulating that
claims _ inaccurately _ that the Web-search company Yahoo made a
similar offer in its early days. But he is thankful for the number
of visitors the buzz has generated, which he just a week ago
translated into a deal with the eyeball-hungry ad-sales company
Doubleclick, which will place its clients' advertisements on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Anderson, editor in chief of Hoovers Online, a financial
news and database service, likened the scheme to the ``Publisher's
Clearing House school of corporate finance.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned Travelzoo's promise to pay shareholders dividends.
``There is not an Internet company on the planet with the
wherewithal to pay dividends,'' he said. ``Microsoft, with $12
billion in cash, doesn't cut dividend checks. The chance of
Travelzoo ever paying dividends is _ optimistically _ nil.''
</P>
<P>
   _LISA NAPOLI
</P>
<P>
   Band of Angels Invests in Sendmail
</P>
<P>
   It is a 20-year-old software program that has never generated
revenue, but it has now grabbed the attention of 40 of Silicon
Valley's most powerful investors. Last week the software, Sendmail,
drew $6 million in financing for its owner, Sendmail Inc. of
Emeryville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the money came from the prestigious Band of
Angels, a loosely organized group of investors that includes Mark
Porat, the founder of Avanti Capital, and Dean Morton, the retired
chief operating officer of Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail is the software responsible for routing and delivering
more than three-quarters of the Internet's e-mail _ hundreds of
millions of messages a day. But until late last year, one of its
developers, Eric Allman, had maintained Sendmail mainly as a hobby,
giving it away.

 &HT;    Agency's software scans for lowest airline prices
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett

<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ The Travel Company of Delray Beach is
installing computer software that quickly searches all airfares
available to find the lowest rate, the company announced at its
first annual meeting recently.
</P>
<P>
   The system, called Flight Attendant, ``does what a perfect
travel agent would do: searches, searches, searches'' until it
finds plane tickets that fit the customer's needs, Chairman Joseph
Vittoria said.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of the system, which will occur at its
subsidiary Travel 800, is central to The Travel Company's intention
of offering one-stop shopping for travel.
</P>
<P>
   The Travel Company (Nasdaq: TRVL, $31.13) provides leisure
travel services, including booking flights, cruises, auto rentals
and lodging. Travel 800 in San Diego, which is one of 18 companies
under The Travel Company banner, sells discounted airline tickets
over the phone at 1-800-FLY-CHEAP. The company gets 500,000 calls a
month, Vittoria said. It charges a $10 shipping fee for each
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Flight Attendant system automatically searches several
airline reservation systems as well as a database of discounted air
fares The Travel Company has negotiated, Vittoria said after the
meeting, held at the Boca Raton Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which The Travel Company developed, does
automatically what Vittoria says is too costly for a travel agent
to do because of the time involved.
</P>
<P>
   It also is designed to be more user friendly than current
systems. Maryann Bastnagel, senior vice president and chief
information officer, said employee training on the new system takes
about 2 1/2 days, compared with two or three weeks for current
systems.
</P>
<P>
   By October, consumers will be able to use the same Flight
Attendant system on the Internet to search for their own plane
tickets, Bastnagel said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also expects to start using the system in its
cruise-booking companies by the end of the year, she said.

 &HT;    tate School sanctioned for use of steaming bus
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Throughout this fireball summer, nearly 40 people with
mental retardation were forced to endure bus rides on the Austin
State School campus in an unair-conditioned bus where temperatures
soared to 110 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   State inspectors deemed the situation life-threatening,
particularly because some of the disabled residents have seizure
disorders and take anticonvulsant drugs that put them at high risk
for heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too hot, too hot,'' screamed some of the residents, according
to Department of Human Services inspectors who boarded the bus at 4
p.m. July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents, their faces bathed in sweat, became jumpy and
nervous while riding the bus, inspectors said in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials say heat stroke can be imminent for
people exposed to temperatures of 105 degrees or hotter.
</P>
<P>
   A bus driver told inspectors that at least two mentally retarded
passengers had seizures while riding the bus this summer, though it
was not clear whether the heat contributed to the seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Austin State School officials immediately stopped using the bus.
Although the air conditioning had been broken for nearly two years,
it was not repaired because the $7,000 cost was viewed as
prohibitive, said Doug Ferris, director of safety and
transportation at the institution at 35th Street and MoPac
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized how long they stayed on that bus, I was
flabbergasted,'' said Ruth Snyder, whose daughter lives at Austin
State School but does not ride the bus. ``I just couldn't believe
nobody cared enough to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin State School's decision to use the faulty bus is the
latest problem at the institution for 450 residents. Earlier this
month, DHS inspectors froze the institution's $57,000-a-day
Medicaid money because workers failed to report sexual activity
among residents. Inspectors cited improperly trained staff as part
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the institution has a shortage of 35 workers. Some
recreational and vocational workers have been reassigned to direct
care, such as bathing and grooming. The school has also been forced
to start paying $100-a-month bonuses to direct-care workers willing
to work the evening shift.
</P>
<P>
   After human-services agency inspectors discovered the broken bus
air conditioner, the institution began using air-conditioned vans
to shuttle residents between their cottages and on-campus
workshops. Officials spent $4,400 to put seats in a bus that had
been used to carry wheelchair users. That bus was put into use on
Monday, Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the bus was intended as an on-campus shuttle to prevent
individuals from having to walk from building to building in the
heat, there was clearly a better way to do that,'' said Karen Hale,
interim commissioner of the Texas Department of Mental Health and
Mental Retardation, which oversees Austin State School.
</P>
<P>
   Human-services inspectors reported the temperature inside the
bus was 110 degrees at 4 p.m. on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these clients remained on the bus for 30 minutes even
though the temperature never dropped below 105.4 Fahrenheit,''
their inspection report said. ``When the bus was in motion, the
temperature inside the bus dropped down to 105.4 Fahrenheit, and
when it stopped to pick up or drop off the clients, the temperature
would go up to 108.3 degrees Fahrenheit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the school's Medicaid money already was halted, DHS
officials imposed a second hold on the money because of the problem
with the bus. Under the previous sanction, the school was given
until Oct. 1 to correct problems.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident prompted regulators to put the school on a
fast-track correction plan. Now, all problems must be fixed by
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid money, which pays about 85 percent of the institution's
operating costs, will be paid retroactively if Austin State School
corrects problems.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Murphree, a disability advocate at Advocacy Inc., a
federally funded agency that provides legal help to Texans with
disabilities, said her agency ``is shocked that the residents of
Austin State School would have their health and safety put at risk
day after day for two summers for the cost of air conditioning in a
bus.'' Jim Armstrong, superintendent of Austin State School, said
he had been unaware that the bus air conditioning was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a mystery to me, to tell you the truth,'' he
said. ``I believe we had some people who probably, looking back on
it, wish they had called that in. But they didn't, so consequently
we went on transporting people in a bus that was not air
conditioned for, I guess, two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel sad,'' he said. ``I felt bad about that.''

PANEL WILL URGE MAJOR SPENDING FOR COMPUTER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A presidential advisory commission made up of
some of the nation's leading computer scientists plans to deliver a
report Monday to the White House, calling for a significant
increase in federal spending on advanced computer research in order
to create ``expeditions to the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, a draft of which was given to The New York Times by
someone close to the committee, calls current federal support for
research in information technology ``dangerously inadequate,'' and
too narrowly focused on ``near-term problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel, known as the Presidential Advisory Committee on High
Performance Computing and Communications, Information Technology
and the Next Generation Internet, has as its co-chairmen William
Joy, a founder of Sun Microsystems, and Ken Kennedy, a computer
scientist at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   The draft report calls on the federal government to finance
research centers that will pursue broad-ranging computer research
in the spirit of the early explorers of North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much like Lewis and Clark opened the West,'' it says,
``virtual centers focused on future technologies and applications
can, by making bold assumptions about the future, give us key
research insights into the manifold possibilities of the 21st
century technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Such new research centers might build upon, but move beyond work
done at today's federally financed supercomputer research centers
and their attempts to advance scientific computing.
</P>
<P>
   Computer research with such government backing has resulted in
some of the most significant new industries created since World War
II, including personal computing and the Internet. Almost all of
those advances came from basic exploratory research, rather than
research and development efforts aimed at solving specific
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although total federal spending for R &AMP; D has remained steady,
there has been a marked shift toward support for applied R &AMP; D,''
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   It also stresses the need for new emphasis on software research,
saying that the nation has become too dependent on outmoded
software, like systems long used by the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA and IRS systems have proved to be amazingly difficult
to upgrade,'' the authors write, maintaining that while there have
been dramatic improvements in computer hardware in the last 40
years, the ability to develop software has not kept pace.
</P>
<P>
   The report also warns that federal funds for supercomputing have
largely collapsed since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The
authors argue that failing to support high-performance computing is
a national security risk that the nation cannot afford to take.
</P>
<P>
   In order to keep the United States leading in building the
world's fastest computers, the nation should set a goal of creating
machines capable of reaching the speed of a petaflop _ one thousand
trillion mathematical operations a second _ by the year 2010, the
report says.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 CASTELLETO, Italy: avoid damage. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shift toward MEMS at ST Microelectronics has been made with
the blessing of Pasquale Pistorio, the company's president and
chief executive, for whom Murari has worked for much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the freedom from Pasquale to do what I want to do,''
Murari said during a recent interview as construction workers
nearby completed a new MEMS research wing of the Castelleto center.
</P>
<P>
   ST Microelectronics does maintain a satellite laboratory in San
Jose, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. And Murari, who
visits that lab about four times a year, acknowledges that in many
ways chip design is easier in the Valley, with its network of
support services and ready availability of specialized talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it made it more difficult by staying here,'' he
said. ``We would have been able to achieve the same results in half
the time in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, part of the recipe for the success of this Italian
laboratory may be Murari's own homegrown independent style as a
researcher and a leader, a combination of ardor and insight. It is
what one of his customers, Thomas Froeschle, an engineer at Bose,
the U.S. audio company, refers to as ``management by enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruno is a remarkably creative person,'' Froeschle said. Bose
designed several of its most popular circuits with the help of
Murari's team, and Froeschle remembers that while other engineering
firms are frequently proprietary about their work, he was struck by
the willingness of the ST Microelectronics engineers to discuss
design ideas freely, without concern for ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Castelleto, Murari makes certain that each of his 300 or
so designers has time for what he calls ``play'' _ the 10 percent
to 15 percent of their time that is set aside for them to use
thinking about and working on their own ideas.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of play frequently spills into his own design work.
</P>
<P>
   Murari is a former world champion designer of model glider
planes built with carbon fiber and Kevlar. Chesson, the Canadian
engineer, remembers a discussion of mechanical design with a large
American customer in which engineers from the two companies were
becoming frustrated. Each side was having trouble understanding the
other's notion of how the product's mechanical and electronics
systems would interact.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, to illustrate his point, Murari took in a
carbon-fiber glider wing he had designed.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Chesson remembers, ``the Americans were looking at
each other with expressions that said, `This guy's off the wall.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``a light went off in their eyes. Bruno had
come out of left field, but his idea bridged the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Murari doesn't reserve his left-field flourishes for outsiders.
Several years ago, when he was pushing his team to come up with a
new design for packaging its circuitry onto chip surfaces, no one
seemed to be grasping the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Then one morning Murari burst in to the laboratory and threw a
compact and elegant chip package onto the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said. ``This is what the competition is doing, and
it's a shame we're not doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after he had left the room did one of the engineers venture
over to examine the ``competitor's'' system.
</P>
<P>
   The device was not really a rival's _ and not even a real chip.
Instead, it was a tiny block of painted wood onto which Murari,
equal parts engineer and artisan, had painstakingly carved his
circuitry design.

 &HT;    Opera, from the mouths of babes
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The kids are sitting at a big, round table, doing their
Rob-Buddy-Sally routine a la The Dick Van Dyke Show. They're
writing. An opera. About a gang.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characters is in a wheelchair, shot in the back by
some nasty street kid. Gang warfare, it appears. Another character
is about to steal some liquor from Dad's stash, which, as we all
know, is not a very bright move. But it adds to the on-stage drama.
And they love the drama.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, though, the kid writers have a little problem.
It's called writers' block. In fact, their plot is at a downright
standstill. They're barely into Scene 2, and they're already
thinking they just might crash and burn at this, their first
writing gig. Angst abounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' says the obvious Rob Petrie of the group. ``Get
serious. We need to write, man. What happens next?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' says someone else. ``The mom is watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's dumb. That's not going to work. Come on, you guys. Get
busy,'' spouts Rob Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah, it will. She's deaf to the outside world. She's
watching Days of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Short pause.
</P>
<P>
   Big pause.
</P>
<P>
   Huge, long pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' says some kid named Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And instructor Karen Long-hofer stands there and smiles. Her
little scheme is working. These kids are actually thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Ava Coleman, director of development for Palm Beach Opera, says
she's wanted to do this camp for a while. She saw her first opera
when she was 7 years old, growing up in France. She went with her
grandmother, her godmother and two cousins. She wore a pretty
dress.
</P>
<P>
   The opera was Madama Butterfly, and it was glorious. The
7-year-old girl cried. And she never forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my children were growing up, we went to the opera,'' said
Coleman. ``But we could afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Coleman says, she's thought it would be nice if the
opera could pay for kids who wouldn't otherwise be going anytime
soon. Last year, she worked out a deal with the folks who run the
summer camp at the Kravis Center. But it didn't suit Coleman, who
appears to be quite fussy about her art forms.
</P>
<P>
   There was too much regular old theater work at the Kravis camp.
It wasn't opera, opera and more opera. Coleman waged on.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Coleman struck a deal with Mac Schwebel, who owns
Sherbrooke Golf and Country Club in Lake Worth. Mr. Mac Schwebel
also happens to support opera, you see. He might even be the
president of the Palm Beach Opera board.
</P>
<P>
   Can we have the camp out at Sherbrooke? Coleman asked. Sure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman says she went out and collected $10,000 from opera
supporters for the four weeks of camp. They got the kids, about 40
in all, on the recommendations of local social service workers and
school music teachers.
</P>
<P>
   When all that was arranged, Schwebel threw in some golf lessons
in the morning and a decent lunch right after that. Coleman added
some brush-ups on good manners _ ``It cannot hurt,'' she says _ and
she called the whole thing Swing and Sing Summer Camp, which she
thought was pretty darn clever. In fact, it still makes her
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of it all were Karen Longhofer and her husband,
Gordan. He's a free-lance performing artist who often works with
the Palm Beach Opera. She teaches at Crystal Lakes Elementary in
Boynton Beach, this year, fifth grade. She's been to the New York
Metropolitan Opera to take classes on _ guess what? _ how to teach
kids how to write an opera. What a coincidence! Together, the
couple teaches these kids how to write and produce an opera in two
quick weeks. There are set designers, composers, costume designers,
performers.
</P>
<P>
   They do it all. But I'm ahead of myself.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing the Longhofers do is ask the kids, about 20 of
them in each two-week session, about their perception of opera. And
it never fails.
</P>
<P>
   Opera singers, they are told, are fat. All of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they look at me, and they'd hear me sing, and they say,
`How does all that sound come out of that body?''' Gordan said.
Gordan, you see, is a beanpole with a big voice.
</P>
<P>
   What else do kids think about opera?
</P>
<P>
   Singing. Headaches. History. Italian. Sad movies. Scenes.
Cartoons. Acting.
</P>
<P>
   And my personal favorite: Men in tights.
</P>
<P>
   The first camp session _ there will be just two this summer _
performed an opera called A Gazillion Miles Away. It was the story
of siblings who moved from Dallas, where they had lived in a
``spacious home'' all their lives, to a small apartment in New York
City. ``It was wonderful,'' says Karen Longhofer. ``And this one
is, too. But they're as different as night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That first week, they really started coming out with some
things,'' said Karen, about the kids' pre-writing conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they talked about crime and punishment and how our society
doesn't punish people for their crimes. And one of the kids said,
`We should have these conversations more often because I didn't
know other people felt the same way I did.'''
</P>
<P>
   Karen loved that exchange, mainly because it's the little things
like that in life that keep us all going.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way. That little number they called A Gazillion
Miles Away? It was really an operetta. The difference? An operetta
is shorter, and there is some spoken dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Geez. Don't you guys know anything?

 &HT;    Upscale decor upstages actors in flat `Trap'
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you didn't know that this new Parent Trap comes courtesy of
the same team behind the 1991 remake of Father of the Bride (and
its sequel), here's a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Director/writer Nancy Meyers and writer/producer Charles Shyer
can't resist letting a camera linger over the details of a
well-made home, be it a sprawling California ranch or a posh London
townhouse. Heck, they even make a cabin in a summer camp look like
the Grand Palais.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the big deal, you may ask, especially when there's a
good story to be told? Details don't intrude. They just add, well,
detail.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Meyers/Shyer formula, details become the means to an
end. They overwhelm the story, the acting, the pacing. For the sake
of indulging in some fantasy of upscale decor, the filmmakers turn
an otherwise delightful tale into a bore. This Parent Trap is more
than a trap: It's a hostage takeover _ with the audience as victim.
Adults might tolerate it, as they tolerated the slightly amusing
Father of the Bride I and II, which had their own umpteen-bedroom
``simple'' family homes. But kids are the target audience here _
and they couldn't care less whether you live in a palace or a
poorhouse.
</P>
<P>
   What's really the tragedy is that Meyers/Shyer have assembled
such a fine cast. And they've kept the charming essence of the
story known to millions from the 1961 Disney original, which
starred Brian Keith, Maureen O'Hara and Hayley Mills.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, there's a pair of divorced parents: Nick Parker
(Dennis Quaid), a California winemaker who's equal parts hunk and
heart; and Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson), a London designer
of wedding dresses who's proper, prim and sexy all at the same
time. Long before the couple began fighting, they managed to
conceive a set of twin daughters. The split resulted in Hallie
(newcomer Lindsay Lohan) heading home with Dad, and Annie (also
Lohan) with Mom. Neither twin knows of the other's existence.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't you know, both girls end up at the same summer camp
in Maine _ and their blood connection becomes clear. To bring their
parents back together, they hatch an ingenious plan to pose as each
other and then force a meeting of their torn-apart families. Just
to add some comedic potential, Dad's gold-digging girlfriend gets
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   The film should ride on finding the right Hallie/Annie: Lohan,
discovered after an exhaustive search in eight cities, does no
wrong. She's mastered the difficult task of playing two characters
and short-shrifting neither. Her Annie is dignified and devious;
her Hallie tomboyish and.... devious. Each has her own quirks, but
both play a mean game of poker.
</P>
<P>
   Quaid and Richardson don't disappoint, either. The former is a
one-note actor, a kind of man's man for all seasons, but since the
part doesn't ask for more, he's not in trouble. The latter is a
subtler cinematic presence _ and she manages to flesh out what
could have turned into a two-dimensional role.
</P>
<P>
   But all that presence can't compensate for the film's
insufferable slowness. As the setting moves from Maine to London to
California to London, one wonders how long it's going to take, how
many more glittering interiors Meyers/Shyer are waiting to capture
on celluloid. The movie could easily be trimmed by 30 minutes. Or
those 30 minutes could be put to better use with a few more
slapstick sequences. There's only about three from start to finish.
Count 'em yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here is that kids care more for looking at pratfalls
than pricey furniture. For that matter, so do some adults.

 &HT;    `Negotiator' patronizes its audience
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Negotiator features a duel of great minds. Too bad they
don't belong to the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a Hollywood movie allows its premise to go poof,
wasting two good actors who register average performances. Samuel
L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey play hostage negotiators facing each
other in a psychological tango that could turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is Danny Roman, a Chicago cop whose credentials as a
skilled rescuer are established in the first scene. He's a hero to
his buddies. But despite the smiling faces, things aren't kosher in
cop land.
</P>
<P>
   Roman is framed for the murder of his partner, who had told him
that Internal Affairs snoops were looking into the disappearance of
police money. But this policeman is no patsy. The hostage rescuer
takes hostages in the Internal Affairs office. He holds his fellow
cops at bay with threats to kill his captives.
</P>
<P>
   They are a sullen secretary (Siobhan Fallon); a con man with
computer skills (the chameleon Paul Giamatti, who provides comic
relief); Roman's chummy commander (weaselly Ron Rifkin of L.A.
Confidential); and the Internal Affairs chief (the late J.T. Walsh,
whose blandness always hinted at disturbing depths).
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a give-and-take between Roman and colleagues
whose tactics he knows better than they do. He wants to flush out
the real villains. He demands to deal only with another crack
negotiator, Chris Sabian (Spacey). If great minds think alike,
Sabian will get the drift of what's going on. At the very least, he
won't let trigger-happy cops snuff out the truth.
</P>
<P>
   What follows could have been a nimble dance, full of
psychological depth and personal revelation. The strengths and
weaknesses of the pair, their tics and crotchets, might have come
into play in complex and suspenseful ways that would redeem the
thriller sequences.
</P>
<P>
   And the film, opening today, starts in that direction. We buy
into the premise, despite its stretch. But the plot degenerates
into a familiar melange of gunfire and overheated action. The
confusing threads of the mystery are finally woven together in a
confrontation that is both silly and stilted.
</P>
<P>
   The young action director G. Gary Gray (Set It Off) settles for
middle-of-the-road melodrama. Adding to the wimp-out is dialogue
that often doesn't sound right in the context of cops caught in a
corner. Simple words, such as fraud and absurd, and ``people who
set me up.''
</P>
<P>
   People? Why not (expletive deleted)? A naughty word would do
nicely here. Roman has a right to be huffy. In addition, the
repartee too often turns into speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson gives his rogue cop some emotional complexity, fire and
ice. But he relies on meaningful glares to the point that we start
glaring back. As for Spacey, he's an oasis of calm command in a
crazy situation. But he never comes alive as an interesting foil.
Besides, there's always the hint of a twinkle in his eyes. In this
case, alas, it seems to say he doesn't like where this plot is
heading.
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator could have talked its way to salvation. But the
premise is held hostage to dumbing down _ the Hollywood fear that
people just don't want to think at summer movies.
</P>
<P>
   2 stars; Rated R: Running Time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.

   Health experts seeking Brushy Creek outbreak's precise cause
</P>
<P>
   By Christian Davenport
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- As an outbreak of a parasitic infection worsened _
five more people tested positive _Austin Mayor Kirk Watson promised
help to those affected by the sewage spill in the Brushy Creek area
and began demanding answers about how well the city responded.
</P>
<P>
   The additional positive tests means that nine of 12 people who
submitted samples to health officials were found to be infected
with Cryptosporidium, a relatively rare and highly infectious
parasite that apparently has spread to drinking water in the Brushy
Creek area west of Round Rock. State and local health officials
said the number of positive tests qualified as an ``outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the July 14 spill at a City of Austin pumping station that
sent 170,000 gallons of raw sewage into Brushy Creek, 13 wells have
been contaminated and more than 150 people have called the
Williamson County and Cities Health District to report stomach
ailments. Late Monday, the Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District
ordered children out of the water and closed its two public
swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of activity this week is in stark contrast to the first
week after the spill, when officials gave repeated assurances that
the effects of the spill were minor and the water in Brushy Creek
was safe. The first seven days after the spill, during which
numerous local, state, health and private agencies tried to update
each other, was marked by miscommunication, misinformation and
delayed action.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five public wells at Brushy Creek MUD were closed
July 21, and the neighborhood of 10,000 people began buying extra
water from Round Rock. But because it can take 10 days for symptoms
of the disease to appear, officials said the number of infections
could continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has severe symptoms is urged to see a doctor, but the
outbreak of Cryptosporidium appears to be confined to residents of
Brushy Creek MUD and to users of nearby private wells, said David
Bergmire-Sweat, a Texas Department of Health epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of a widespread outbreak throughout
Central Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the sewage spill appears to be the culprit in the
outbreak, work continues on pinpointing the exact cause so health
officials can assess whether a health risk remains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said Tuesday he wanted to determine whether the city
responded adequately to the spill, and said he was particularly
interested in how city officials identified and warned private well
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want someone to tell me what happened and why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Russell, a Brushy Creek MUD resident, said, ``I'm not
sure that they let on how serious the problem could be.'' The
incident began July 13, when a thunderstorm knocked out power to a
City of Austin pump station at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the 103 pump stations the City of Austin owns, the
station just west of the Round Rock city limits does not have a
backup generator. The storm also knocked out the phone line the
emergency alarm system was hooked up to, meaning city officials did
not know of the spill for almost 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds of this happening are very rare,'' said Randy Goss,
director of Austin's Water and Wastewater Utility. By 4 a.m.,
officials estimated, the sewage had backed up to a manhole next to
Brushy Creek, erupted out of the ground and into the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, A. J. Olson, the operations manager for the
Brushy Creek MUD, drove by on his way to work and smelled the
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shooting about six inches off the ground,'' he said.
``It was flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson was the one to notify the company that operates the
pumping station for the City of Austin. Forty-five minutes later,
crews were at the scene, and by 9 a.m. the spill was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But not before 170,000 gallons of raw sewage had spewed into the
creek.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, crews pumped as much sewage as they could
out of the creek. Then they flushed the creek with water from a
nearby fire hydrant. And when the rain came that afternoon, they
said that would help move the contaminants downstream.
</P>
<P>
   But it apparently didn't move the sewage fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   While state officials told people that the spill would have no
lasting effects, scores of dead fish floated in the creek, and the
contaminants began to seep down to where wells suck up water.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, four homeowners who live on Sam Bass Road about a
mile downstream from the spill began to worry about the quality of
the water coming from their private wells. So as the news of the
spill spread, they called the City of Austin and asked the city to
test their wells.
</P>
<P>
   The results came back two days later: Their wells were
contaminated, and they were told to drink bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   When Tony Bennett, of the water utilities division of the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission, heard that their wells
were contaminated, he called Brushy Creek officials to make sure
they were thoroughly testing theirs.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't.
</P>
<P>
   The district was testing the disinfected water coming out of its
wells and going into homes. But it didn't begin testing the water
before treatment until three days after the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the lab processed the water samples that MUD
officials had collected. By July 20, Olson got the test results
back, showing the water was contaminated, and he called Bennett's
office at the conservation commission. But Olson didn't tell him
how severe the contamination was until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, July 21, one week after the spill, Bennett
ordered the wells shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said the MUD should have been testing the water going
into its wells sooner after the spill.
</P>
<P>
   During the delay, contaminants like Cryptosporidium apparently
slipped past the wells' disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have begun testing the raw water immediately,'' MUD
director Jimmy Griffith said at an emergency meeting last week. ``I
think we learned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many households near the spill have their own private wells,
which are not regulated, required to have a permit, or, as far as
any state or city official can tell, even located on any map.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go out in your back yard and dig a well if you want
to,'' Goss , of the Austin water department, said. ``There is
nobody stopping you from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of any complete list pinpointing the location of wells
owned privately made it particularly hard for officials to find
them. So the Austin utility depended on citizens contacting the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Some did. And last week, City of Austin crews tested 10 more
private wells. Five came back contaminated, and more people
switched to bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Edmiston a Brushy Creek resident, said he thinks MUD
officials should have tested the water more extensively sooner
after the spill happened, but he's not interested in assigning
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're doing the right thing now by shutting down the
pool, by testing it or treating it,'' he said. ``They're starting
to take the steps necessary that should be taken, and I guess
that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston, 34, said he, his wife and two sons have all felt
symptoms of the parasite in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   As residents near the sewage spill continue to worry about their
health, officials are trying to assure residents they are doing
everything possible. Will Hampton, a City of Round Rock spokesman,
said Tuesday that the city has been testing the water going into
and out of its wells every day since July 6, and that no
contamination has been detected. Owners of private wells should
continue to drink bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have recommended that those in the Brushy Creek
area wash their hands frequently, and throw out any ice or drinks
made before July 22, the day after the wells were shut down. And
the Williamson County and Cities Health District is compiling a
database that will pinpoint specific clusters of people infected
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting reports of illness,'' said Karen Wilson, the
director of the health district. ``So we know what the magnitude of
the illness is and where the people getting sick live.''
</P>
<P>
   Reassurances have not eased all of the concerns of those
affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 people went to a special meeting of the Brushy Creek
MUD board of directors Monday night, and many had questions during
the 90-minute meeting. One of those was John McLemore, who along
with Edmiston signed up to speak at the meeting. McLemore said
Tuesday that officials should have done more testing earlier to
detect parasites.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``There's been a real failure to respond out here.''

<P>
   CASTELLETO, Italy _ If there is a Lost Tribe of Silicon Valley,
it resides here on a broad industrial plain on the outskirts of
suburban Milan.
</P>
<P>
   And the tribe's leader is 62-year-old Bruno Murari, head of a
semiconductor research laboratory for one of the world's leading
chip makers, ST Microelectronics.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the company was known as SGS-Thomson
Microelectronics. And, like many of Silicon Valley's most legendary
chip makers, it is one of the ``Fairchildren,'' a descendant of
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the California company that helped
ignite the global semiconductor revolution more than 30 years ago _
by, among other things, owning an early stake in Murari's company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the culture here isn't like the restless one in the American
chip companies that can trace their lineage to Fairchild, the
Intels, Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductors. There
engineers frequently change jobs to work on the latest chip. Here
at the ST Microelectronics lab the folkways are more akin to those
in a Renaissance craftsmen's guild.
</P>
<P>
   Murari has passed up many offers to leave Italy and go to the
United States. He explained, ``We had a team, and I found I was
committed to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet traditional does not mean old-fashioned. Indeed, Murari is
considered the grandmaster of analog circuit design, a subordinate
field of electronics in which ST Microelectronics is the world
leader _ and which is about to enter a new and potentially more
important era.
</P>
<P>
   Analog chips translate real-world phenomena _ like motion,
sound, temperature, pressure and light _ into analogous electronic
or mechanical patterns.
</P>
<P>
   And compared with digital chips, which define the world in black
or white absolutes, understanding only a binary code of ones and
zeros, analog chips function as the eyes, ears and muscle that
connect the clinically precise world of digital computing to the
subtler, more textured world that is perceived by human beings.
</P>
<P>
   It is analog circuitry, for example, that converts the human
voice entering a microphone into an electronic signal that a
digital chip can reduce to the binary code stored on an audio CD.
And it is analog circuitry in the CD player that turns the digital
code back into an electronic speaker signal that a human ear can
hear.
</P>
<P>
   It is also analog chips that tell an automobile's transmission
when to shift, signal a car's air bags to inflate during a crash,
and handle numerous other automotive tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between designing analog and digital electronic
devices has long been viewed by many engineers as the difference
between an art and a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital design is like building with Lego blocks,'' said
Richard Chesson, a Canadian engineer who works under Murari in the
Castelleto laboratory. ``Analog design is more like wood carving.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly Murari, as the soft-spoken leader of this effort,
has carved out his niche. In his 37-year career, he has designed 10
major analog integrated circuits and has supervised the design of
1,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   And he has helped create a series of unique semiconductor
processes that have made ST Microelectronics, which last year had
revenue of more than $4 billion and was the world's 12th-largest
semiconductor company, the No. 1 analog chip maker in the world,
surpassing such U.S. competitors as National Semiconductor and
Analog Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Now Murari is preparing his laboratory for what he considers the
final challenge of his long career. Later this year ST Microsystems
will announce that the company plans to become a major player in
the emerging market for micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS
chips.
</P>
<P>
   These are perhaps the ultimate analog circuits, consisting of
microscopic mechanical structures that are etched into the surface
of silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Already the MEMS market is a multibillion dollar business, based
largely on use of the chips in silicon accelerometers that are now
standard equipment used as sensors for air-bag collision systems in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the MEMS market, in which ST Microsystems is already
moderately active, is expected to become an even larger business in
the next century with the birth of a remarkable new class of chips
_ those covered with millions of microscopic mirrors that are the
heart of projection display systems, or those that have the ability
to detect gases and liquids that serve as chemical or biomedical
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ST Microelectronics is already the leading supplier to
Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's dominant manufacturer of ink-jet
printers. At the heart of an ink-jet printer are MEMS chips with
arrays of microscopic nozzles that shoot tiny drops of ink onto
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Now the MEMS market is expanding rapidly as intelligent sensors
are being added to more and more consumer electronics products. For
example, as disk drives are being added to mobile products like
laptop computers, designers have begun adding accelerometers _ tiny
MEMS chips that sense motion and can automatically lift the head
from the surface of a disk drive to avoid damage.

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ Some people draw celebrities like magnets. I
spent a week in Thomasville, Georgia once and the most famous
person I met was a well-regarded gentleman who sold peanuts on the
main street. Now I hear from my friend Pat Gainey that
Thomasville's celebrated ancient oak tree is a natural attracter of
the eminent and celebrated. ``Your article about the old oak tree
in Mobile(Ala.) reminded me of one of Thomasville's landmarks, our
vintage live oak tree, corner of Monroe and Crawford streets,''
wrote Miss Gainey. ``Visitors to our town are always shown the oak.
Each time I drive by, I wonder how much longer its wide, low, heavy
branches will stay intact.'' (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MINOR-OPERA _ The kids are sitting at a big, round table, doing
their Rob-Buddy-Sally routine a la The Dick Van Dyke Show. They're
writing. An opera. About a gang. One of the characters is in a
wheelchair, shot in the back by some nasty street kid. Gang
warfare, it appears. Huge, long pause. ``Man,'' says some kid named
Pedro. ``This is hard.'' And instructor Karen Long-hofer stands
there and smiles. Her little scheme is working. These kids are
actually thinking. Ava Coleman, director of development for Palm
Beach Opera, says she's wanted to do this camp for a while. She saw
her first opera when she was 7 years old, growing up in France. She
went with her grandmother, her godmother and two cousins. She wore
a pretty dress. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ Veterans of the Second World War II and
high school students just learning about it are venturing onto
America Online's Saving Private Ryan area (Keyword: Saving Private
Ryan) to remember, exchange stories and just talk. AOL spokeswoman
Janine Dunne says that since the area opened Friday, more

   MUSTACHE _ There's something about Matt Dillon's mustache. It's
smarmy. Seedy. Oily. Just the crayon-type scrawl for a not-so-stiff

   STATESCHOOL-BUS _ AUSTIN _ Throughout this fireball summer,
nearly 40 people with mental retardation were forced to endure bus
rides on the Austin State School campus in an unair-conditioned bus
where temperatures soared to 110 degrees. State inspectors deemed
the situation life-threatening, particularly because some of the
disabled residents have seizure disorders and take anticonvulsant
drugs that put them at high risk for heat stroke. (Gamino, Austin

   AUSTIN-HOSTEL _ AUSTIN _ If hostels are, as one veteran traveler
said, the windows through which a city is viewed, then the Austin
hostel is a one-way mirror. The modest building on Lakeshore Drive
is tucked away on the southeast side of Town Lake, unseen by most
of the city's bustling downtown and university populations. Our
hostel is so nondescript even neighbors stop to ask what it is
(''It's what?'' they reply. ``A hotel? A hospital?''). Looks can be
deceiving. Inside this small hostel, more than 9,000 visitors from
every corner of the globe each year make a temporary home in 40

TECHNOLOGY COLUMN: FROM WEB-SEARCH ENGINES TO PORTAL SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet business models, like the technologies that drive them,
mutate faster than a flu virus. A case in point: the ``portal,'' a
scheme whereby a handful of mostly money-losing enterprises band
together to form a mega-Web site that combines searching, content,
e-mail, chat and other services.
</P>
<P>
   The portal, its defenders insist, is a whole greater than the
sum of its parts, because people who come for one service will
discover another and stick around. Advertisers and investors have
demonstrated that they love this sort of reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the logic of the portal concept is lost on some.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there are amusing contradictions to the portal
fad. Not the least of these is the spectacle of hundreds of
new-media geeks who spent years painting America Online as the
trailer park of cyberspace now scrambling desperately to be ...
well, America Online _ the original, and some would say, only
authentic _ portal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond simply creating a hip version of America Online, the idea
is to make the portal site so enticing that World Wide Web users
will make it their first stop, and so seductive that they will not
want to stray elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to be seduced were Wall Street and a few big
media companies. All told, many billions of dollars have been
invested in enterprises that with two notable exceptions have yet
to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because advertisers have been drawn to portals at a level
that defies all reason.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Great Portal Shakeout,'' a recent report by
Forrester Research, the top nine portals _ those of Alta Vista,
America Online, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, Microsoft, Netscape, Snap
and Yahoo _ account for a mere 15 percent of all Internet traffic.
Yet they attract 59 percent of all advertising revenue on the
Internet, an extraordinary 293 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   Network television, in contrast, attracts 67 percent of all
viewers and 84 percent of advertising, for a 25 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite this enormous bonus, only the two largest portals,
America Online and Yahoo, have so far managed to eke out a net
income. This reality, said Chris Charron, the analyst who was the
lead author of the Forrester report, makes the infant portal
industry ripe for a shakeout that will leave only three or four
winners dividing at most 20 percent of Internet traffic by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to give,'' Charron said. ``The pie is
advertising, and the pie that's available, we think, will be $8
billion in five years, with 30 percent of that going to portals _
about $2.4 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   And of that $2.4 billion, he added, ``AOL and Yahoo will grab
half.''
</P>
<P>
   The business concept is simple on its face: If you can stuff
enough services and content into a single Web address, you will, in
the ugly parlance of the industry, ``aggregate eyeballs'' _ that
is, bring a lot of people with disparate interests and needs to the
same place so that the owners of the portal site can sell
advertising priced on a certain dollar amount for every 1,000 pages
viewed.
</P>
<P>
   If this algorithm seems vaguely familiar, it may be because it
is the basic programming plan of network television.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely the problem, said Michael Wolff, whose
book ``Burn Rate'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998) chronicles the origins
and quixotic meanderings of many of the companies that are now
either portals or the anchor tenants of portals.
</P>
<P>
   While a television audience is attracted to a network by the
program playing at any given moment, when it comes to a portal,
Wolff argues, ``there really is no natural reason why the audience
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, to get somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience isn't there for unique content or for a
partiality to the experience or really for any self-selected
reason,'' he said. ``You are there for the same reason you might
find yourself on a highway interchange or in an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   How would the same people who have enthusiastically invested in
a portal react if the Department of Transportation were to design a
huge federal highway interchange with the sole objective of having
drivers continuously circle a row of billboards? Yet such a
comparison is not all that far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace is its own reality. Even so, following the
why-am-I-here question to its logical answer suggests that the true
essence of a portal is a sort of parlor-trick illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The anchor tenant of each of the portals is what used to be
known as a search engine or Internet directory service. These
services _ Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, etc. _ were designed to do one
thing: help people find what they are looking for on the Web. To
various degrees and in different ways, they all do this well.
</P>
<P>
   But the metamorphosis from search engine to portal is something
of a paradox, since one is the antithesis of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines are intended to point you to your desired
destination in the increasingly complex terrain of cyberspace. Now
they are becoming tools in a scheme to keep you in one place. If
you actually go where they point you, some other site may get your
attention _ and the few micro-cents your attention is worth.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of another Forrester analyst, Kate Delhayn, ``Most
portals have transitioned from intersections on the Internet to
sticking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, most consumers will not appreciate the discovery that
someone has lined the hallway with flypaper. So the portal has to
keep up at least the illusion of movement. It continues to send
users to a destination just as before. Only now the deck is stacked
in favor of destinations that are owned by the portal itself or by
its partners or advertisers _ at least, there is very real danger
that consumers will perceive things that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a portal becomes captive to any one source of content, or
is perceived to be captive _ Snap, for example, being seen simply
as an outlet for NBC to the exclusion of other content _ it runs
the risk of turning away consumers who are looking for an open
gateway to the Internet,'' Charron warned.
</P>
<P>
   Which, he is quick to point out, is just about everyone.

 &HT;    `I wish I had a pencil-thin mustache' . . . why?
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something about Matt Dillon's mustache.
</P>
<P>
   It's smarmy. Seedy. Oily. Just the crayon-type scrawl for a
not-so-stiff upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dillon's character, Healy, says a word in There's
Something About Mary, the summer's hottest comedy, you can tell
he's a sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been told to beware of people with a mustache,''
says Richard Vachon, owner of Richard's Barber Shop in Palm Beach.
``The shady character always wears a mustache.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? It comes from the old silent elodramas, guesses Stephen
Charla, assistant curator at the International Museum of Cartoon
Art in Boca Raton. The mustache, the black cape, the sinister
smile, the woman tied to the railroad tracks ... all ``incredibly
cheesy'' stuff, Charla says.
</P>
<P>
   The mustache was picked up by the cartoon world, which
introduced us to Snidely Whiplash of Dudley Do-Right and Dishonest
John of Beany and Cecil, among others. Now, Charla says, the
pencil-thin mustache is just a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny worm of fur across the upper lip means you're not
courageous enough to make a full statement, says Ruth Rubinstein, a
sociologist at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not really committed,'' she says. ``You're trying to
get away with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds about right. John Dillinger had one. Wayne Newton had
one, for Pete's sake.
</P>
<P>
   What about old movie stars? What about Clark Gable?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a rogue,'' Rubinstein said. ``But a beautiful rogue.''

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ Some people draw celebrities like magnets. I
spent a week in Thomasville, Georgia once and the most famous
person I met was a well-regarded gentleman who sold peanuts on the
main street. Now I hear from my friend Pat Gainey that
Thomasville's celebrated ancient oak tree is a natural attracter of
the eminent and celebrated. ``Your article about the old oak tree
in Mobile(Ala.) reminded me of one of Thomasville's landmarks, our
vintage live oak tree, corner of Monroe and Crawford streets,''
wrote Miss Gainey. ``Visitors to our town are always shown the oak.
Each time I drive by, I wonder how much longer its wide, low, heavy
branches will stay intact.'' (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MINOR-OPERA _ The kids are sitting at a big, round table, doing
their Rob-Buddy-Sally routine a la The Dick Van Dyke Show. They're
writing. An opera. About a gang. One of the characters is in a
wheelchair, shot in the back by some nasty street kid. Gang
warfare, it appears. Huge, long pause. ``Man,'' says some kid named
Pedro. ``This is hard.'' And instructor Karen Long-hofer stands
there and smiles. Her little scheme is working. These kids are
actually thinking. Ava Coleman, director of development for Palm
Beach Opera, says she's wanted to do this camp for a while. She saw
her first opera when she was 7 years old, growing up in France. She
went with her grandmother, her godmother and two cousins. She wore
a pretty dress. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

SENATE'S INTERNET LEGISLATION UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the beginning of July, a number of Internet
bills had been languishing in Congress for months, their sponsors
unable to muster the necessary support for floor debates on what
could become precedent-setting laws covering free speech and
content in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Then one-by-one, in a three-day period last week, the proposals
were quietly attached to Senate appropriations bills, in most cases
without debate. Although the bills must still pass the House and
make it through a conference committee to become law, civil
liberties groups are crying foul, questioning whether senators
understand or gave responsible consideration to complicated issues
that could have long-term impacts on the global network.
</P>
<P>
   It started on Tuesday when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is
chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee,
offered as an amendment to the $33 billion spending plan for the
Commerce, State and Justice departments a bill requiring filtering
software on computers in schools and libraries that get federal
funds for Internet hookups.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to that was a measure that has been dubbed the
Communications Decency Act II, a bill by Sen. Daniel Coats, R-Ind.,
that would make it a crime for commercial Web sites to distribute
or display to minors any material that could be ``harmful'' to
children. The original Communications Decency Act, which outlawed
the general distribution of material harmful to minors, was struck
down last year as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday came an amendment by Sen. Lauch Faircloth,
R-N.C., to give the FBI access to the customer records of Internet
service providers in investigations of pedophilia without an order
from a court or grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Thursday, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., added a bill that
would ban gambling on the Internet, in part, Kyl argued, because
Internet gambling is ``accessible by minors.''
</P>
<P>
   While all the bills are presented as measures for protecting
children, opponents argue that they raise complicated free speech,
privacy, censorship and regulatory questions that could have
long-term impacts on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is racing ahead of policy makers, and the
policy makers are stumbling to catch up,'' said Ron Weich,
legislative consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The
Congress has not begun to consider the important constitutional and
practical considerations of these bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl's gambling bill was the only Internet bill debated on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Weich criticized the process as sloppy legislating,
Mark Buse, policy director for the Commerce Committee, defended the
procedure. McCain, he said, had been working for weeks to get his
bill scheduled for floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were certain Democrats fronting for the ACLU who would
not allow us to bring the bill up for debate,'' Buse said. ``We had
no choice but to offer it as an amendment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lisa Dean, director of the Center for Technology Policy at the
Free Congress Foundation, said Republican lawmakers were ``dealing
with a medium here that defies control, and they are trying to
control it.'' She said of the gambling bill, for example: ``It sets
a precedent to restrict other habits later on. Whether or not you
are in favor of gambling is immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties advocates have vowed a court fight, if
necessary, over the constitutionality of both the Coats and the
McCain bills. The Coats bill, they say, would unconstitutionally
restrict free speech on the Internet. They oppose filtering

   Dave Farber, a professor of computer science at the University
of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, said that Congress was in a panic, passing bills on
issues they did not understand or that they know will eventually be
struck down as unconstitutional.

   ``It is an election year coming up, and let's be kind and say
they like to put on a good face to their community, even if they do
things that damage their community in the long run, which these
do,'' he said. ``But there are nicer ways to protect our children
than doing things that take away their rights when they grow up.''

   BLACK-HAIRSHOW _ ATLANTA _ An advance on the Atlanta-based
Bronner Brothers annual mid-summer black hair show at the Georgia
World Congress Center featuring interviews with stylists and a look
at trends. Expected attendance: 100,000. A show highlight will be
the ``Hair Battle Royale '98'' on Aug. 2, a contest for
hairstylists who do fantasy styles. The winner takes home a 1998
Jeep or $10,000. (Johnson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m.

   NETWATCH _ ATLANTA _ Veterans of the Second World War II and
high school students just learning about it are venturing onto
America Online's Saving Private Ryan area (Keyword: Saving Private
Ryan) to remember, exchange stories and just talk. AOL spokeswoman
Janine Dunne says that since the area opened Friday, more
than10,000 messages have been posted. Dunne says the only time
there was such a large response to a topic was after the death of
Princess Diana. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED 7/28.

<P>
   MUSTACHE _ There's something about Matt Dillon's mustache. It's
smarmy. Seedy. Oily. Just the crayon-type scrawl for a not-so-stiff
upper lip. Before Dillon's character, Healy, says a word in There's
Something About Mary, the summer's hottest comedy, you can tell hs
a sleaze. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   STATESCHOOL-BUS _ AUSTIN _ Throughout this fireball summer,
nearly 40 people with mental retardation were forced to endure bus
rides on the Austin State School campus in an unair-conditioned bus
where temperatures soared to 110 degrees. State inspectors deemed
the situation life-threatening, particularly because some of the
disabled residents have seizure disorders and take anticonvulsant
drugs that put them at high risk for heat stroke. (Gamino, Austin

<P>
   It's as good an excuse as any this summer to check out Boca, the
booming Palm Beach County resort that is steadily gaining a

   AUSTIN-HOSTEL _ AUSTIN _ If hostels are, as one veteran traveler
said, the windows through which a city is viewed, then the Austin
hostel is a one-way mirror. The modest building on Lakeshore Drive
is tucked away on the southeast side of Town Lake, unseen by most
of the city's bustling downtown and university populations. Our
hostel is so nondescript even neighbors stop to ask what it is
(''It's what?'' they reply. ``A hotel? A hospital?''). Looks can be
deceiving. Inside this small hostel, more than 9,000 visitors from
every corner of the globe each year make a temporary home in 40
beds. (Hibberd, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   LOW-AIRFARE _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ The Travel Company of Delray
Beach is installing computer software that quickly searches all
airfares available to find the lowest rate, the company announced
at its first annual meeting recently. The system, called Flight
Attendant, ``does what a perfect travel agent would do: searches,
searches, searches'' until it finds plane tickets that fit the
customer's needs, Chairman Joseph Vittoria said. The installation
of the system, which will occur at its subsidiary Travel 800, is
central to The Travel Company's intention of offering one-stop
shopping for travel. (Plunkett, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FOOD-CYBERSPICE _ Not so long ago, only a handful of food
magazines were being published. Now it's hard to keep up with the
proliferation of gourmet and cooking publications that hit the
newsstands every month. Add to those print publications their
Internet versions and ``webzines,'' which are found only on the
World Wide Web, and there are more food publications out there than
you can possibly ever read. So, with a warning to be selective,
here are some Internet addresses that, with a press of a button,
will give you instant access to hundreds and hundreds of food and
gourmet magazines. (Pahram, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   MOVIE-REVIEW-PARENT _ If you didn't know that this new Parent
Trap comes courtesy of the same team behind the 1991 remake of
Father of the Bride (and its sequel), here's a clue. Just look at
the houses. So, what's the big deal, you may ask, especially when
there's a good story to be told? Details don't intrude. They just
add, well, detail. But in the Meyers/Shyer formula, details become

Kevin Spacey play hostage negotiators facing each other in a

Kirk Watson promised help to those affected by the sewage spill in
the Brushy Creek area and began demanding answers about how well

of 12 people who submitted samples to health officials were found
to be infected with Cryptosporidium, a relatively rare and highly

Lawrence, a computer programmer and 25-year pool user, said
swimmers are ``the truly endangered species.'' (Haurwitz, Austin

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: kids' toys.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is just this sort of shopper that the big conventional
retailers are going after. Toys ``R'' Us, the nation's largest toy
retailer, started a Web site last month that it intends to heavily
advertise on the Internet as well as on television and through home
delivery circulars later this year. So far, the site has about
2,000 items, compared with about 15,000 stocked in Toys ``R'' Us
stores. Tens of thousands of Internet users have already visited
the site, though the company declined to say how many had bought
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to www.toysrus.com are assured that shopping is ``fun
and fast.'' Say, for instance, someone is clueless as to what to
buy an 8-year-old girl. The shopper need only choose a category,
like dolls, click on the child's age and the target price. Seconds
later a suggested list of merchandise appears, including Baby Pick
Me Up, which sells for $14.97 plus shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   Just like a theater operator who tries to drum up concession
sales by piping in the smell of freshly popped corn, Toys ``R'' Us
is using its personalized suggestion feature also to get shoppers
to consider buying items they may not have intended to. Those
looking for dolls, for instance, are also shown a Barbie Disc Girl
CD Player for $16.99. Call it an electronic hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are typically the same for toys bought online or in
stores. But the convenience of Internet shopping does mean having
to pay shipping rates, which are about $5 for a $25 order and
around $9 for a $100 purchase. The companies insist, though, that
the cost is more than worth the convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more strapped for time, and they are looking for
new ways of shopping,'' said Joel Anderson, vice president of Toys
``R'' Us Direct. ``There is a new medium out there that is
emerging, and it is an area we need to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Toy maker Hasbro Inc. is feeling the same need. The company,
which has been dabbling in online product marketing for more than a
year, recently hired a specialist in Internet commerce to develop a
plan to advertise further and sell selected items like collectibles
directly to the consumer (www.hasbro.com). The executive, Wendy
Riches, had managed the interactive advertising unit of WPP Group's
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather agency, as part of her role as chairman and chief
executive of the Ogilvy One North America division.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem is that Hasbro sells mainly to retailers,
some of whom may frown on any form of added competition. This sort
of conflict has also been a problem for computer makers, like
Compaq, which has a well-established network of distributors who
have been wary of the company's plan to expand into online direct
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some toy retailers are raising concern about Hasbro's
intentions. ``This is the manufacturer cutting out the middle
man,'' said Shane Igoe, new media manager at F.A.O. Schwarz, which
was one of the first toy sellers to go online when it started a Web
site (www.faoschwarz.com) nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us is less concerned, saying Hasbro's Internet appeal
will be limited because it will offer only its own brands and not
Barbie, Beanie Babies and other popular toys made by its
competitors. For its part, Hasbro says its online selling efforts
are not meant to put it in competition with Toys ``R'' Us or any
other retailer. Rather, the company says, it is seeking to augment
what retailers are already doing, even listing store locations
where shoppers can find certain items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at this as a partnership with the retail trade,'' said
Adam Klein, Hasbro's head of global marketing. ``Each one of our
key retailers is going at this thing a different way. We have to
have our own in-house expertise to both work with them and, where
there are gaps, to be able to recognize them and go after these
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro also says that, at least initially, it will limit its toy
selling to items not available in retail stores. The company, which
has not determined when it will begin selling online beyond the
interactive products like the Yahtzee CD-ROM it already offers, was
fuzzy on whether consumers would have to pay retail prices for toys
bought directly from the manufacturer. Klein said only that ``the
idea is not to compete with the retail trade, and this is part of
everything we are going to be looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hasbro and other industry giants edging in on its domain,
Etoys, a year-old company based in Santa Monica, Calif., that has
about 3,000 items listed for sale on its site, www.toys.com, may
need a Star Wars laser to fend them off. But the company says its
strength is in the range of playthings it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is have the popular products and also have a lot of
cool products like kits to make your own chewing gum, products you
never see in Toys `R' Us,'' said Toby Lenk, chief executive of
Etoys. ``A big retail buyer can't buy six of something. It's too
inefficient for them so they buy in bulk and can't test on a
smaller scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Etoys also knows it will have to rev up its marketing machine to
avoid getting overshadowed by the competition. Without discussing
precise amounts, the company said it planned to triple its
multimillion-dollar marketing budget for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   If people like Mrs. Wilson, the mother in West Virginia, are any
indication, the online toy market is up for grabs to anyone who can
make toy shopping effortless without significantly adding cost. But
won't she miss an intrinsic part of the toy-buying experience by
buying a lovable baby doll without first giving it a squeeze or
without reading product information on a box of building blocks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavens, no,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ``I could care less. I
already know what a box of Legos looks like. I wish I'd found this
before last Christmas.''

 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First virtual toys, now virtual toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   With toy makers and sellers catching up with the computer age
and making a big push into Internet retailing, shoppers can now buy
everything online _ from Tamagotchi virtual pets to Teletubbies
plush dolls. The hope is that these stores-without-walls will
attract parents with modems and motivation, people either too busy
or too impatient to deal with the big chain stores' huge,
warehouse-like retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   So, well ahead of the 1998 critical year-end selling season, toy
companies are racing to become the Amazon.com of their industry.
Some of the online players include Noodle Kidoodle Inc., Toys ``R''
Us and the leading upstart company, Etoys, a unit of Idealab. Some
manufacturers, including Mattel Inc., which has a Barbie Web site,
www.barbie.com, are also experimenting with online marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Having had one of its best years in a decade last year, thanks
to a healthy economy, and hoping for a repeat performance this
year, the toy industry is in an expansive, experimental mood.
Though online retailing still accounts for only $13 million of the
$22 billion annual U.S. toy market, the virtual toy shop is the
industry's attempt to find new or additional sales among the
households that are most likely to value time-saving efficiency and
to have the discretionary income to pay a premium for such
convenience. Nearly 20 million Americans now shop online, according
to the Web measurement company Media Metrix Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's move online is not without risk. The big
retailers face the same sort of internal conflicts that bookseller
Barnes &AMP; Noble does in trying to counter Amazon.com _ how to
respond to the online upstarts without cannibalizing the
brick-and-mortar franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Toy makers must venture carefully into cyberspace, lest their
direct-sales activities rankle the retailers they rely upon to move
their merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the online upstarts, despite the cost advantages
of not having to invest in stores, warehouses and big inventories,
may find themselves struggling to match the marketing muscle of big
established retail brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether the touch and the texture
of toy shopping can translate as readily to the digital realm as
some other consumer activities that have taken hold online, like
booking airline seats or trading shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big strengths of toy retailing is the in-store
excitement, merchandising and the personal touch,'' said Frank
Reysen Jr., editor of Playthings, a toy industry publication.
``There is a danger of that getting lost in the web of technology.
The initiatives, attitude and approach have to be a virtual
representation of the store itself, and that's not an easy thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy merchants are undaunted, though.
</P>
<P>
   The large retailers say they will win the Internet game because
their well-regarded names and vast resources give them an in with
consumers that should spill over into online selling. For
customers, the companies say, those strengths will translate into
low prices, quick response to orders and a better chance of finding
limited-edition items _ like Mattel's popular Share a Smile Becky
doll, a wheelchair-bound friend of Barbie _ that smaller toy
sellers may have trouble obtaining in large volume.
</P>
<P>
   But the small, niche operators say they have the upper hand
because they offer many of the must-have items and also specialty
products _ like Schylling's make-your-own chewing gum kit _ that
tend to sell in such small numbers that the big guys find them not
worth stocking.
</P>
<P>
   And whether large or small, the companies say they can offer
online consumers the advantage of not having to traipse around in
search of the last Beanie Baby in town.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, toy merchants envision that this type of retailing
will become the modern equivalent of that more traditional form of
direct-to-consumer marketing _ catalog shopping. Like catalog
sales, which rely on mailing lists assembled from consumers' past
buy-by-mail habits, the databases created by electronic commerce
would enable toy makers to observe the shopping habits of
computerized households and use discounts and other enticements to
keep them coming back for more. It is a way for merchants to get to
know their customers' preferences to an extent not possible when a
person goes into a store and pays cash for a Sing and Snore Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   All of the industry's behind-the-scenes strategizing for her
money and loyalty is just fine by Chana Wilson, a housewife and
mother of two boys, ages 3 and 12, who was in the market recently
for an ant farm for her out-of-state nephew. ``I knew I had to buy
a toy, wrap it up and ship it to Houston,'' said Mrs. Wilson, who
lives in Beckley, W.Va., and ranks shopping at toy stores right up
there with visiting the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to avoid ``all that rigamarole,'' Mrs. Wilson, whose
husband, Derric, is a supervisor at a prison, went online and found
Etoys, where she bought an Uncle Milton ant farm for $19.95 plus $4
for shipping and $3 for gift wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That saved me time and money and a major headache with my
3-year-old,'' Mrs. Wilson said. ``You just don't want to take a
3-year-old shopping for other kids' toys.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When news of the gunfire in the Capitol building swept the
country on Friday afternoon, a familiar ritual began. The Internet
news rush was on.
</P>
<P>
   At Cable News Network's Web site, cnn.com, servers running at 25
percent of capacity saw a surge to nearly 100 percent five minutes
after the shooting. A similar flood engulfed msnbc.com.
</P>
<P>
   All afternoon, as the reports grew more detailed _ the deaths of
two members of the Capitol police force, the emergency medical
treatment given to the gunman by Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a heart
surgeon _ people kept checking in.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, while they were there, they checked on how well their
stock portfolios had come out at the end of a rocky week, or looked
at the reviews of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' or monitored the weather
report to see how things were in the mountains where they were
going on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Like a photograph developing in the darkroom, the identity and
habits of Internet news audiences is not changing so much as it is
becoming clearer with every new crisis and every new computer user.
By and large, it is made up of younger men with college degrees and
professional jobs. They check in on the news from work, not home,
and even if they are drawn into a site by a crisis, they stay
around to pursue very particular individual interests.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, ``it's the big, big story that brings
them in,'' said Merrill Brown, editor in chief of msnbc.com. Second
in popularity is ``stuff with utility'' _ individualized stock
portfolios, reviews, listings, health and science news. The
sure-fire draw, he said, is a story about something that touches
both _ like a sharp shift in stock market prices. ``That's where
you're more likely to get people the other media don't get.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference between the Internet and other news
outlets, from newspapers and magazines to cable and network
television to radio, is that Internet news is read less often over
morning coffee and more often over eat-at-your-desk takeout food.
News _ the stuff of the morning newspaper, the evening newscast and
drive-time all-news radio _ is now the stuff of the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge difference,'' said Scott Woelfel, editor in chief
of cnn.com. ``Until recently, the only news that penetrated into
the workplace was radio. Now they go in and spend what could be
hours during the day'' checking into the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise they don't watch the nightly news when they
go back,'' he added. ``They heard or read all those stories hours
before.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey last month from the Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press, one American in five goes online to
get the news at least once a week _ 15 percent of all women and 25
percent of all men. Two years ago, the overall figure was 6
percent. Some 35 percent of college graduates get their news from
the Internet at least once a week; 47 percent of college graduates
under the age of 30 do.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a big breaking story, what these people are
looking for, the Pew study indicates, is information about hobbies,
movies or restaurants (82 percent), science and health (64
percent), technology (60 percent) and finance (52 percent). Low in
the rankings was local news (28 percent).
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense, based on a recent study by the Newspaper
Association of America. It shows that 63 percent of those surveyed
regularly watch local television stations, more than use any other
medium. Internet news audiences don't try to find out about crimes
and fires and political squabbles while they are at their
computers. Why bother, when you can get it that night on
television?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, just 7 percent of the news audience regularly gets its
news from the Internet, according to the association's survey,
which shows 51 percent regularly reading newspapers, 49 percent
listening to radio and 42 percent regularly watching national
television news. But different people are clearly gravitating to
different media. The Pew survey found that just 22 percent of men
under the age of 30 regularly watch network news, compared with 55
percent of women over the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Internet news sites draw but a small fraction of
news consumers, it is a fraction advertisers might find desirable.
More than 200,000 subscribers are paying up to $49 to read The Wall
Street Journal Interactive Edition (wsj.com), according to the
publication's managing editor, Rich Jaroslovsky. About two-thirds
of that group, he said, ``don't read The Wall Street Journal in
print.'' The interactive subscribers tend to be younger than the
readers of the broadsheet, he said (``40ish rather than 50ish''),
and four of five are male.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times on the Web (www.nytimes.com), which never
charged domestic subscribers and this month dropped the fee for
overseas subscriptions, now has about 4 million registered users,
77 percent of them men, according to Richard Meislin, the editorial
director. About 73 percent are college-educated and 55 percent have
household incomes greater than $50,000. The educational and income
profiles of msnbc.com's audience are similar _ 74 percent
college-educated, 62 percent with household incomes of more than
$55,000.
</P>
<P>
   Home consumption of online news is also rising, according to the
Web rating services Media Metrix and Relevant Knowledge. But even
at home, the audience is most often male; the favorite subject,
computers. The top news-related sites feature technology news:
Media Metrix ranks cnet.com, a computer-related site, highest,
above zdnet.com, the site of the Ziff-Davis Inc. technology news
magazines. Relevant Knowledge has zdnet ranked on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the peaks are when there is sexy technology news,''
said Jai Singh, the editor of C-Net's news.com site. The Capitol
shooting didn't cause a big spike in the audience numbers;
Thursday's Senate hearings on Microsoft's business practices did.
``If Bill Gates is in the news, it makes it big time,'' Singh said,
with a nod to the chief executive of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the online news audience, with its idiosyncratic
tastes, may arguably be helping cable news cut into the network
news audience. But it is not cutting into the time spent with
traditional media. Internet news junkies, apparently, are also just
plain news junkies. The Pew study reported, ``Those who go online
for news tend to spend more time than those who do not reading a
newspaper or watching television news.''

A CHEAP PC MAY FIT YOU PERFECTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the attention paid to sizzling microprocessors speeds,
dazzling multimedia technologies and snazzy styling, the z's that
are most common in personal computers today are the ones that occur
while the computer is waiting for something to do.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true if the computer is used primarily for
word processing, electronic mail, keeping a calendar and to-do
list, and browsing the Internet _ applications that generally do
not demand the latest and most powerful processors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to save money when buying a computer is to
be realistic about how it is going to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of computer applications demand high performance,
including three-dimensional games, software development, graphic
arts and publishing, multimedia explorations and complex financial
analysis. For people who do such things, or who anticipate getting
involved with such applications soon, no computer is fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   And some people are willing to pour money into powerful new
computers just to have the fastest machine on the block, or in the
belief that the more they spend up front, the longer they can
retard the computer's inevitable decline into the technological
junk heap. There is some validity in this thinking, but only if one
puts it in the context of what the computer's main tasks will be.
</P>
<P>
   If one accepts the fact that advances in PC technology are
accelerating even as prices are falling, an argument can be made
for buying a cheap PC today and simply replacing it with a cheaper
and more powerful computer when it can no longer keep up with the
demands made on it. We're not quite at the point of having
disposable PCs, but we're heading in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for the growing number of people who use
the PC primarily as a communications device, more than as a
computational device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the largest driving influence in consumer PC
sales today,'' said Strategic News Service president Mark Anderson,
who was among the first technology analysts to forecast the growing
significance of inexpensive personal computers, or Cheap PCs, as he
calls them. ``Consumers are buying CPC's to get onto the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   For Net-based applications like e-mail, the PC itself may not be
the most critical component of a system. The slowest chip available
today is still idle more than 99 percent of the time while waiting
for someone to type the next character on the keyboard. This is
true even among the newest crop of CPC's selling for less than
$1,000. (When people talk about sub-$1,000 computers, they almost
always leave out the fact that one must spend a few hundred dollars
more on a monitor and a printer.)
</P>
<P>
   Are these cheap PCs a good deal? Or are they last year's
technologies, at the brink of obsolescence even as they come out of
the box?
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every low-cost PC on the market is capable of running
standard applications, except high-end games, for the next 18
months, said Stephen Baker, senior hardware analyst for PC Data of
Reston, Va. ``The big difference now, as opposed to a year ago,''
Baker said, ``is that PCs under $1,000 are designed to be
competitive. They're all based on current technology, so you don't
have to worry as much about obsolescence. It's the low end of the
current stuff, but it's still pretty current.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cheapest machines, those that are now flirting with a
$500 sticker price, are generally built around end-of-the-line
chips and bare minimum configurations. Some manufacturers try to
eke out a profit at these levels by cutting corners, so, if
possible, try the system before you buy it. Some of these come with
rickety keyboards, frail mice, scarce expansion slots, small or
fuzzy monitors, cheap speakers and just enough system and graphics
memory to do basic chores.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the $1,000 models today are surprisingly robust,
certainly for the common applications of word processing and
Internet cruising.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, draw the bottom line at 32 megabytes of RAM
(random access memory), a 4-gigabyte hard drive, a 24-speed CD-ROM,
at least 2 megabytes of video memory, a 15-inch monitor, and a
so-called 56K V.90 modem, the current top standard for dial-up
connections to the Internet or an online service. Any of today's
processors in the 233-megahertz or higher range can handle most
basic tasks, but for added oomph make sure the processor comes with
at least 256 KB of something called Level 2 or L2 cache, which
stores frequently used data in high-speed memory.
</P>
<P>
   At these prices, it becomes more important than ever to buy from
reputable companies. Almost all the major PC makers now offer
models under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the average price of a PC bought today (not including
monitor) is still about $1,125, according to market researchers, it
is likely to drift below $1,000 by the end of the year, pushed
downward by price cuts for microprocessors, memory chips and other
standard components.
</P>
<P>
   (According to the research of ZD Market Intelligence, the
popularity of Windows 98, which requires more processing power,
memory and hard disk space than earlier versions of Windows, has
kept the average price higher despite the introduction of cheaper
PCs by Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and others.)
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. cut prices again last week on Pentium and Celeron
processors, and accelerated the introduction of new 300-megahertz
and 333-megahertz Celeron chips that offer higher performance than
the ones now on the market. (They integrate a performance booster
called an L2 cache, which earlier Celeron chips lacked.) Those
chips will be available to computer makers next month.
</P>
<P>
   This will translate into higher momentum for low-cost personal
computers in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Intel's price cuts typically prompt its rivals to cut
prices, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder, then, that low-cost PCs are popular. They may
be just the right tool for people who have basic computing needs.
Why buy a Ferrari if you just need to drive to the grocery store?

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   Trashing Hard Drive's Cyberjunk  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I was told that to quickly rid my hard drive of the mass of
cyberjunk it has accumulated, the way to go is to reformat. If
feasible, how do I reformat and then put Windows 95 back onto my
computer? I have a Pentium 120, a 2.1 gigabyte hard drive and 32
megs of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Reformatting indeed will quickly remove your cyberjunk.
Unfortunately, it also will erase everything else on the drive. So
if you decide to do it, make sure to first save every document,
graphic and other piece of information that you want to keep on a
floppy disk or a Zip disk. Also, write down the account numbers,
phone numbers and settings for your online accounts, including
Internet and home banking. You'll also need copies of programs that
you'll want to reload, such as Microsoft Office, Norton Utilities
or America Online.
</P>
<P>
   If your PC came with an emergency recovery CD, you probably can
use it to reformat and reinstall Windows. If not, you'll need two
things: a Windows Startup Disk and a copy of Windows 95 (full
version, not upgrade). To make a Startup Disk, go to
Start/Settings/Control Panel, then double-click Add/Remove
Programs. Tab over to Startup Disk, and follow the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   To reformat your hard drive, start the PC with the Startup Disk
in the floppy drive. Then type c: /s at the prompt and hit Enter.
</P>
<P>
   Before you reformat, make sure to save the driver files and
configuration information for your CD-ROM drive on the Startup Disk
or on a separate floppy. You may need them to get the CD-ROM drive
working again after reformatting. (If the CD-ROM drive doesn't
work, you won't be able to reinstall Windows 95 from its CD).
</P>
<P>
   Consult the documentation that came with the CD-ROM drive, or
contact the manufacturer for information about installing the
CD-ROM drive software. Some companies let you download automatic
installation programs from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I would like to know how to receive and send e-mail while
traveling in Europe. I want to use my laptop and modem, but I don't
want to have to make a long-distance call to my Internet service
provider in the United States. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; What you need is an ISP that offers ``roaming.'' This
feature lets you connect to your Internet account through foreign
ISPs. Many larger ISPs now offer roaming. To find one, check with
www.ipass.com or www.gric.com, which are run by companies that
provide roaming services to ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
Q:  &LR; My Windows 95 desktop is getting cluttered, and I'd like to
remove some of the icons, especially the ones for programs I no
longer use. What's the best way to do this, and are there any
dangers to be aware of?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The easiest way to remove an unwanted icon is to
right-click it and choose Delete. However, as we saw in a column a
few months ago, some Microsoft icons can't be deleted this way. For
them, you need a program called Tweak UI, which you can download
for free from Microsoft at www.microsoft.com/windows
/windows95/info/powertoys.htm. Tweak UI lets you customize your
desktop, including dumping icons like MSN.
</P>
<P>
   As for possible dangers in removing desktop icons, yes, there is
one. Most icons are ``shortcuts,'' so removing them doesn't affect
the actual program. But the desktop also can contain bona fide
program icons. And if you delete one of those, the program is
trashed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you can tell when an icon is a shortcut because it
features a tiny arrow. Also, Windows will display a warning box if
you're about to get rid of a program.
</P>
<P>
   Header Update: Last week, I described how users of Netscape
Communicator can eliminate unsightly headers in e-mail messages.
That sparked a barrage of requests from America Online users who
also would like to do away with headers.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, guys, it can't be done. Says an AOL technician: ``We
are sorry, but unfortunately we do not support that ability at this
time. However, we do rely on our members' feedback, and all
comments submitted to us are forwarded to the appropriate
department for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to register your opinion directly, go the Member
Services in AOL's Members menu. Choose E-mail, then click on Ask
the Staff.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; Don't like your keyboard? Get a new one. There's
no hassle involved. Just plug it in and go. A wide variety of
keyboards with different levels of sensitivity are available
starting at under $25. And ergonomic and wireless keyboards also
can be had for under $60.

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Marvin Minsky, 71, a rumpled-looking man who wears shirts
mended together with masking tape, is Toshiba professor of media
arts and sciences, and professor of electrical engineering and
computer sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
one of the world's leading theorists of artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Minsky and John McCarthy, a professor of
computer science at Stanford University, founded a research program
that would evolve into the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
In addition to inventing and building thinking-machines, Minsky
wrote the classic ``The Society of Mind,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1986)
in which he tries to show how intelligence works ``by the
particular way the agents in the brain have evolved to interact.''
``The Turing Option,'' (Warner Books, 1992) a novel by Minsky and
Harry Harrison, is about superintelligence in not-too-far-off 2023.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the 1960s, science students, particularly those at MIT,
talked of artificial intelligence, or AI, as if it would create
world revolution. Were they too optimistic?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it got stuck. AI was able to produce all kinds of
wonderful things ... programs that did better than the average
stockbroker or portfolio manager, programs that could fix some
piece of equipment. Around 1980, progress stopped in some ways and
people went off in a number of other directions to try to find some
way to get back. It stopped because we'd done the easy things. In
the eye of eternity, it got stuck for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is, in 1964 or 1965, one of our students, Daniel
Bobrow (now a vice president at the Xerox Corp.) wrote a program
that could read a question from a high school algebra book, and
sometimes, solve the problem. So it could figure out a little bit
of language and algebra. It didn't get most of the problems because
it couldn't understand the words.
</P>
<P>
   What people tried to do then is get a program that would read a
story from a first- or second-grade children's book. But what
happened was this: For any particular story, we could build into
the program the knowledge necessary to read that story. We didn't
have much trouble with the grammar. As soon as something was
mentioned that the program didn't know about ... (the system broke
down).
</P>
<P>
   One MIT student had a story where some person's daughter was
kidnapped by the Mafia and they demanded a ransom. So he asked the
program ``What should we do?'' The program couldn't understand.
Finally, it asked, ``Why would he pay MONEY to get his daughter
back?''
</P>
<P>
   It could figure out a little bit of language, a little bit of
algebra. It didn't get most of the problems because it couldn't
understand the words. As far as I know, nobody has been able to get
a machine to solve real problems that are informally expressed, the
way somebody would normally express them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you define common sense?
</P>
<P>
   A. Common sense is knowing maybe 30 or 50 million things about
the world and having them represented so that when something
happens, you can make analogies with others. If you have common
sense, you don't classify the things literally; you store them by
what they are useful for or what they remind us of.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I can see that suitcase (over there in a corner)
as something to stand on to change a light bulb as opposed to
something to carry things in.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you get machines to the point where they can deal with
the intangibles of humanness?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's very tangible, what I'm talking about. For example, you
can push something with a stick, but you can't pull it. You can
pull something with a string, but you can't push it. That's common
sense. And no computer knows it. Right now, I'm writing a book, a
sequel to ``The Society of Mind,'' and I am looking at some of
this. What is pain? What is common sense? What is falling in love?
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is love?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, what are emotions? Emotions are big switches, and there
are hundreds of these. ... If you look at a book about the brain,
the brain just looks like switches. ... You can think of the brain
as a big supermarket of goodies that you can use for different
purposes. Falling in love is turning on some 20 or 30 or these and
turning a lot of the others off. It's some particular arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   To understand it, one has to get some theory of what are the
resources in the brain, what kind of arrangements are compatible
and what happens when you turn several on and they get into
conflict. Being angry is another collection of switches. In this
book, I'm trying to give examples of how these things work.

</P>
<P>
   Q. In the 1968 Stanley Kubrick film ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a
computer named Hal developed a lethal jealousy of his space
companion, a human astronaut. How far are we away from a jealous
machine?
</P>
<P>
   A. We could be five minutes from it, but it would be so stupid
that we couldn't tell. Though Hal is fiction, why shouldn't he be
jealous? There's an argument between my friend John McCarthy and me
because he thinks you could make smart machines that don't have any
humanlike emotions.
</P>
<P>
   But I think you're going to have to go to great lengths to
prevent them from having some acquisitiveness and the need to
control things. Because to solve a problem, you have to have the
resources and if there are limited resources ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where were Stanley Kubrick and his co-author, Arthur C.
Clarke, right with their ``2001: Space Odyssey'' predictions?
</P>
<P>
   A. On just about everything except for the date. It's quite a
remarkable piece.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you believe the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration wastes money by insisting on humans for space
exploration?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not that they waste money. It's that they waste ALL the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you were heading NASA, how would you run it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would have a space station, but it would be unmanned. And
we would throw some robots up there that are not intelligent, but
just controlled through teleoperators and you could sort of feel
what's doing. Then, we could build telescopes and all sorts of
things and perhaps explore the moon and Mars by remote control.
Nobody's thought of much use for space. The clearest use is
building enormous telescopes to see the rest of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are manned shots a NASA priority?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because NASA's people are basically oriented toward keeping
themselves alive. They are a big organization. And the biggest part
of it is Houston and that has to be fed, and what Houston is good
at is putting men in space. The Jet Propulsion Lab is much smaller
and has a smaller staff and is good at doing everything else.
</P>
<P>
   So, I think, in order to support that, they get into this
vicious circle where you have to convince yourself that's what the
public wants. Now, I think, the public is more excited by Sojourner
than by astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you go to the movies, what do you see?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Terminator,'' ``Total Recall,'' which had ideas about
implanted memory. Pretty clumsy, but I loved the engineering. I
don't like movies exactly. One of my rules is not to think of the
whole thing as having any unity. The idea of liking a whole movie
is ... People have this idea that they have to like something or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you read?
</P>
<P>
   A. Science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you read science fiction in the same way spies read spy
novels _ for ideas?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. There are a dozen very, very rich sources of ideas out
there. Gregory Benford of UC. Irvine, David Brin, Larry Niven are
the best writers of our period. When they write a book, there's
some big new idea about something. I've also gotten a lot of good
ideas from old-timers like Robert Heimlein and the late Isaac
Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where was Mary Shelley right and where was she wrong with her
``Frankenstein'' last century?
</P>
<P>
   A. She certainly was right in predicting how people would not
understand the poor thing. That's SUCH a sad story! By the way,
I've gone through that book very carefully to see if she left any
hints explaining how the robot worked. But alas, no clues and the
funny part is when you read it, you don't mind.

TechnoBuddy: Some people always fret about the wrong things 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes I take after my namesake, my Great Uncle
Bill, a man who had only a nodding acquaintance with reality and
who delighted in worrying about improbable things.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he worried himself sick about meteorites and
avoided going outside during the peak of meteor showers. On the
other hand, he spent most of his working life in the logging fields
of the Pacific Northwest, during a place and a time when the term
``widow maker'' was coined for cutting a tree down in a careless
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're like me and my Uncle Bill when it comes to
computers and the Internet, spending more time worrying about the
meteorites of computing and not enough time about the widow makers.
Let's talk today about what's worth worrying about and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with some things that lots of people worry about but
probably shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Topping my list are viruses. I don't mean that viruses are a
myth. They're real. But unless you spend a great deal of time
exchanging software with friends and downloading programs from the
Internet, viruses don't present a great threat. And, even for folks
in these high-risk categories, an up-to-date anti-virus program
will usually catch the infected programs that come your way.
</P>
<P>
   Next on my list are folks who avoid buying something over the
Internet because they fear a hacker will steal their credit card
information. Many of these are the same folks who feel perfectly
comfortable handing their credit card to the perfect _ and
sometimes not-so-perfect _ strangers who wait on them at the store
and in restaurants. It's the same with e-mail. Sure, it's possible
to break into an e-mail account (we'll talk about ways to protect
yourself in a bit), but most of us have outdoor unlocked mailboxes
for the checks and personal letters that arrive every day.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Internet grows and as computers become more popular,
there are things that you should worry about. Let's talk some about
what those legitimate worries are and how to protect yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At the very top of my list of things to worry about is the pure
certainty that _ sooner or later _ your hard disk will die. It's a
mechanical device and, if it had a tattoo, the tattoo would say:
``Born to die.'' Since the hard disk probably contains important
e-mail and e-mail addresses, and data about family finances and
business projects, you should learn how to back up your data.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when hard disks were smaller, floppy disks
could be used to make copies of your critical information. But as
hard disks have grown, most of us need a tape backup system (you'll
find plenty of them for $200 or less) or a Zip drive (even
cheaper). You needn't worry about backing up Windows or most of
your programs. You can simply reinstall them using the original
disks (CDs in most cases). But you should regularly back up the
data you create.
</P>
<P>
   Next on my list of potential problems is the way most people
treat passwords. Many of us have to juggle three or four passwords
nowadays _ we're logging on to an Internet service at home, to the
computer system at work, and perhaps to three or four
password-protected Web sites. Being human, we like to keep things
simple. So many people make passwords easy by using the name of a
child, or a spouse, or their own telephone number. I strongly
encourage you to use a password that contains both letters and
numbers. Then avoid telling anyone _ in person or online _ what
that password is.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and this is the best advice you'll ever get about
computers and computing: Avoid following the advice of untried
experts. Nowadays, there are dozens of computer experts at work, at
your church and among your closest friends. Mostly these are nice
people who mean well but who feel compelled to either tell you how
to adjust your computer for maximum performance or fix it when it
is broken. Many of the saddest stories I hear are from people who
decided to tune up their computer based on help from this kind of
expert.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, they ended up with a computer that was fixed so
completely that it didn't work at all.

Tech Tools: Checking quality of your phone line a matter of a call 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As expected, I got a number of e-mails after the
column in which I tried to help a correspondent with his concerns
over whether his telephone line would be acceptable for 56k bps
modems.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, most of them corrected me on several points, the
simplest thing being that I got an acronym wrong. It should be
ADSL. Not ASDL.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpful info came in messages informing me there is
indeed a way Bob Wildaus can check the quality of his telephone
line. I'm going to give primary credit to Jerry A. Smith of Smyrna,
because his message had the most details.
</P>
<P>
   3Com, now the parent company of U.S. Robotics, has a telephone
number you can call to check your phone line's acceptability for
56K operations. You can find out a lot about X2 technology and v.90
at 3Com's Web site at http://www.3com.com. However, I had to do a
lot of poking around to find details on the line checker, so to
save other folks the necessity of all that, I'm going to repeat the
routine here.
</P>
<P>
   First off, you don't get to this function through the Internet.
You'll need to use an ordinary communications program (remember
them?) to accomplish the task. HyperTerminal, the program built
into Windows 95's accessory package, will work fine.
</P>
<P>
   The number to call is 847-262-6000. This is not toll-free.
</P>
<P>
   This will connect you to a bulletin-board type of system. It
will ask you if your system supports graphics. I made the mistake
of answering yes, and the result was not pretty. Just hit enter,
which conveys a ``no'' to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will ask you for your first name. Type: line and press
enter.
</P>
<P>
   Logically enough, it will then ask for your last name, which
should be: test and press enter. Got it? If you want a line test,
your name is line test. I have no idea what will happen if you give
it your right name.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, that's all you need to do. Some invisible
diagnostics will be run, and a report will come back. If your line
is adequate, it will say so, and if you want to see a lot of
statistics about your line, press enter. When you're done, press g
for goodbye and hit enter.
</P>
<P>
   If you get ``Your line does not support 56k technology,'' hit g
and enter. 3Com recommends making several calls over a period of
time to be sure of an accurate report.
</P>
<P>
   If the report is ``Cannot determine 56k capability, test must
run in v.34 mode,'' this indicates noise or static on the line, a
good reason to complain to the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible responses, but these are the ones that
would appear to pertain to home telephone lines. For more
information on using the test, point your Web browser to http://
</P>
<P>
   www.3com.com/56k/need4_56k
</P>
<P>
   /linetest.html.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for another persistent query, this from folks trying to
make calls within the Atlanta area's overburdened phone system. I
think I've answered this before, but here goes again:
</P>
<P>
   To set up your fax calling, or whatever kind of calling, to dial
within an area code such as 404 or 770 without the software
insisting on sticking a ``1'' in front of it, simply enter all the
digits in the space for the number, like this: 4045551212.
Disregard the space for the area code; leave it blank.
</P>
<P>
   This works on every system I've tried.

Instructional software can help budding virtuosos hone their
musical skills 
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music, Plato said, gives flight to the imagination and soul to
the universe. It also can be a balm for the spirit in the midst of
high-speed American life.
</P>
<P>
   But Plato lived in a simpler era, when demands on time were
fewer, and budding lyre virtuosos could spend all day learning the
intricacies and techniques of playing the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you or your child is ready to give piano or guitar
lessons a whirl, but you're worried there aren't enough hours in
the day, don't panic. Help is on the way, courtesy of the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Music instruction has vaulted into the future with software that
teaches basic music theory and technique in a form with which both
children and adult beginners are comfortable. Hundreds of sites on
the World Wide Web also offer help, whether you're interested in
learning about autoharps or zithers.
</P>
<P>
   No software or computerized guidance can replace the subtlety,
experience and ear of a flesh-and-blood teacher, but for many
parents or novices such programs can be a good first step in
finding out whether aptitude or interest justify investing in
formal lessons, which average $15 a half-hour, or instruments,
which can cost several hundred dollars, even for models made for
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instructional software costs between $45 and $99,
but requires a MIDI-capable, 16-bit or better sound card and a MIDI
keyboard. Many titles will run on Windows 3.1, and most have
Macintosh versions. MIDI _ musical instrument digital interface _
is what lets a sound device ``talk'' to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Piano is still the instrument most parents want their children
to learn, says Kenon Renfrow, a music professor at the University
of Miami at Coral Gables. Renfrow, a keyboard specialist, also
serves as a software consultant for the Cincinnati-based Music
Teachers National Association. It's guitar titles, though, that
grab the lion's share of shelf space at many music and computer
stores. The same is true on the Web, where a mind-boggling number
of sites are devoted to the ``ax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest advantages of using technology in music is
that students can get instant feedback'' on how they're doing,
Renfrow said, and perform at their own pace. Several instructors
said beginner-level software is an excellent reinforcement for
theoretical concepts, and that young students seem to retain them
better.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teachers find this computer assist to be a useful
tool, though all emphasize the need for individualized instruction
to take students to their highest potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a box or computer program you can plug into a
wall and replace a teacher,'' Renfrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Some software packages that retail for less than $200 come with
a 49-key keyboard and all the necessary MIDI cables or connectors.
Two of the most popular are Piano Discovery System from Jump! Music
and the Family Music Center Play Piano from Midisoft.
</P>
<P>
   Piano Discovery System ($169) uses multimedia and games to
present music theory and basic note-reading. Once you've learned a
song, the software takes you to a ``performance hall,'' where you
play the piece with synthesized orchestral accompaniment. The
software then generates a review of your playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Midisoft title ($199) relies less on multimedia and offers
less step-by-step guidance, according to reviewers. After you
finish a section, the software scores you and highlights where you
hit the wrong notes.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice for teaching children the fundamentals is
Harmonic Vision's Music Ace ($49.95), which has garnered an
``outstanding'' rating from Children's Software Revue. There are
Windows and Mac versions available, and you can download a free
demo from the company's Web site (http://www.harmonicvision
</P>
<P>
   .com/). A MIDI keyboard is optional, not required, which makes
the software a good value.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are intent on being the next Andres Segovia or Jimi
Hendrix have a slew of choices, but reviewers have been most
impressed by Seattle-based eMedia's Guitar Method 1, for Windows 95
or Windows 3.1, which offers 60 lessons on the basics. You can use
either acoustic or electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a second level available as students progress
that covers barre chords, music notation and scales, and licks like
hammer-ons, pull-offs and bends. Both titles include visual tuners
and digital metronomes, and retail for $59.95 _ about the price of
three lessons with an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Guitropolis ($49.95) from Alfred Publishing takes the form of an
adventure game, but includes method-only versions of Alfred's
well-regarded Basic Guitar Method and Teach Yourself To Play
Guitar. Both provide solid instruction, reviewers say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another readily available option is G-Vox Guitar ($99.99,
for Windows 95) by G-Vox Entertainment. It includes all the
necessary hardware, as well as a music notation component. The
title comes with a pickup to attach either an electric or acoustic
guitar. A caution here, though: The instrument must have steel
strings, which can be devastating to uncallused fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The technology may have changed, but there is at least one
element of learning music that hasn't changed since Plato's day: If
you want to get to the top, it's practice, practice, practice.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a string thing
</P>
<P>
   Here are some sites on the World Wide Web that offer music
instruction or guidance on how to obtain information on learning to
play a range of instruments.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Even in hand-held models, Windows has a foothold 
By Brit Hume &AMP; T.R. Reid  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows CE is Microsoft's Windows 95 look-alike operating system
for hand-held and palmtop PCs. Rolled out with much ceremony at a
big computer trade show in 1996, Windows CE is a sign Microsoft is
determined to compete in every market where a rival operating
system might gain some traction, as has occurred with the
proprietary systems built into such hand-held devices as 3Com's
highly popular PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Before you drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what ``CE''
stands for, here is what Microsoft itself says about that: ``CE
doesn't represent a single concept, but rather implies a number of
Windows CE design precepts, including `Compact, Connectable,
Compatible and Companion.''' In other words, nothing in particular.
</P>
<P>
   While Windows CE, now in version 2.0, is designed to work with
tiny palmtop devices with green monochrome displays, it seems more
in its element in hand-held PCs with color screens and keyboards,
such as the Sharp Mobilon 4600, which is where we tested it. You
turn on the computer, and, presto, there is the Windows CE opening
screen, which looks almost exactly like the Windows 95 desktop,
complete with taskbar, Start button and icons representing the
Recycle Bin, My Handheld PC (like My Computer), Inbox and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you will find icons representing a set of
``pocket'' versions of major Microsoft Office applications,
including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Internet Explorer. All are
bare-bones versions of their larger cousins, but have surprising
power considering their size. Pocket Word, for example, now
includes a spell checker.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Justice Department's attitude toward the inclusion of
Internet Explorer with Windows 95 and Windows 98, one can only
imagine what it would say about the bundling of all these
``pocket'' versions of Windows applications with Windows CE. So
far, though, no sign of any intention to sue. Perhaps that's
because Netscape has not yet developed a version of its Navigator
Web browser for Windows CE, and the Justice Department seems to
regard protecting Netscape's market share as one of its primary
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else you do with your Windows CE device, you will
surely want to do two things: connect to your desktop computer to
share information and connect with the Internet to check your
e-mail and browse the Web. Connection to your desktop is relatively
simple via a serial cable. You must load Windows CE
``synchronization'' software from an included CD to your desktop
system. Once that's done, you will be able to exchange files
between the My Documents folders on both computers.
</P>
<P>
   You will also be able to transfer such things as e-mail messages
from the Inbox or Outlook windows of your desktop to and from the
Inbox program on your hand-held. You can also exchange data between
Microsoft's SchedulePlus on your desktop and the Calendar program
on your hand-held. The same for information in your hand-held's
Contacts application and your desktop's Outlook program.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the Web by a dial-up connection is a more complex
matter. You must use the Remote Networking utility in the
Communications folder found in the programs menu. It is similar to
the dial-up networking procedure in Windows 95, but different
enough that it may take you a while to get it right, especially
since there are some arcane commands you may need to enter under a
tab called Dialing Patterns found under the Communications icon in
the Windows CE Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get this right and get your modem to dial and log on to
your network or Internet service provider, you may be sorely
disappointed in the speed of Pocket Internet Explorer. Even with a
33.6k bps modem, pages load at a glacial pace, and you may be
wondering if you are even achieving a 28.8k bps connection, let
alone anything higher. Unfortunately, Windows CE, unlike Windows
95, does not tell you how fast your connection is, so you are left
to wonder. The good news is when you are first dialing in, Windows
CE seems to get you through the log-on process much faster than
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   You are likely to be much happier with your e-mail performance.
Most messages come through quickly, and while Windows CE's Inbox is
not the most full-featured of programs, it is easy to use and does
the job well enough. Given the size of most hand-held keyboards,
you are not likely to be sending many long outgoing messages
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Printing can be a nuisance, since you can only print directly
from Pocket Word or Excel. You must use a serial cable or infrared
connection to your printer. Most printers do not have such a
connection, so you must fall back on transferring your file to your
desktop and printing from there. Ouch.

OneClick a fine shortcut for many repetitive tasks 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OneClick is software that lives up to the Mac ideal. It not only
makes computing easy, it's fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad, considering OneClick is not a game but something
called a utility. It expands what your Mac can do.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind OneClick is simple. It reduces nearly any
repetitive task on your computer to a button click.
</P>
<P>
   That includes changing fonts, copying text and more complicated
chores such as inserting boilerplate text into e-mail. OneClick can
do all this and more.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick works through a motif of buttons and palettes. Every
palette displays a collection of buttons, and each button performs
a task.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick comes with lots of pre-configured palettes and buttons
that are ready to use. You'll find global palettes that include
buttons automating things such as closing windows and emptying the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   And there are application palettes for programs such as
PhotoShop and ClarisWorks. These palettes only appear when you're
using an application.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning. You can make your own palettes
from scratch, selecting everything from the shape of the button to
the background color of the palette.
</P>
<P>
   Creating buttons from scratch is easy, too. OneClick will record
a series of actions, such as copying text, and save them on a
button.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can write your own scripts with OneClick's own
programming language called EasyScript. Matt Neuburg, a reviewer
with Mac newsletter TidBits, said EasyScript ``is spectacularly
well thought out and easy to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to learn EasyScript or OneClick's record
functions to add new buttons and palettes. Others are creating new
ones all the time and posting them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick has collected and organized them on its Web site at
http://www.westcodesoft
</P>
<P>
   .com. Check the list often, because it's always being updated.
Downloading and adding other palettes to your computer is easy.
</P>
<P>
   While it generally works great, OneClick is not without bugs. I
found it does slow the general speed of your system. In addition,
it messed around with the performance of some programs such as
Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick can also make your screen a cluttered mess, with all
its different palettes. But the company has licked that problem by
letting you easily hide any or all of them.
</P>
<P>
   You can control OneClick through a pull-down button the program
puts in the upper right hand corner of your menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick is a powerful program with many, many features. I've
just scratched the surface here. To learn more about the program
and what others have to say about it, check out reviews in MacWorld
and MacAddict magazines. You'll also find user comments at the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Westcode Software, OneClick sells for about $70.
The best place to buy it is from the company's Web site.

MindSpring is investors' darling 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always nice to watch David beat Goliath. Watching the
soaring stock prices of Atlanta-based Internet service provider
MindSpring elicits a similar feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides dial-up Internet access to some
393,000 subscribers, just posted its third profitable quarter
operating in the volatile Internet industry. The stock closed
Friday down 50 cents at $148.50 after hitting a record $157.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring founder and Chairman Charles Brewer cut his vacation
short to appear on CNBC. When asked what was the secret to the
Internet service provider's success, Brewer replied with what is
becoming the MindSpring mantra: Keeping costs down and customers
happy is the key to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   And Brewer seemed to hint in a Wall Street Journal Heard on the
Street column that he wasn't averse to selling the company.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's national media attention has captured the
imaginations of small investors like Atlanta resident Edie
Friedman. Friedman is impressed by the stock's performance and what
friends say about the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love it. They say it's very easy to use. It's going to be
another Microsoft. I have a gut feeling,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, several investment firms warn MindSpring's wild ride is
a short-term phenomenon. But they still believe MindSpring is an
excellent long-term investment for those with the money and the
patience to ride out the company's ups and inevitable downs.
Robinson-Humphrey research associate Jeff John believes MindSpring
has long-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, these dial-up providers were all supposed to go
broke because the big boys like AT&AMP;T were supposed to come along
and steal all their customers, and that hasn't been the case,''
John says. But MindSpring, along with America Online and the
aggressive Internet service provider Earthlink are still alive and
kicking. ``MindSpring is one of the highest-quality ISPs out
there,'' John says. ``They've proven that an ISP can be
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink, the one national provider most similar to MindSpring
in size and scope, hasn't seen its stock prices climb to
MindSpring's dizzying heights. Part of the reason could be the 28
percent share telecommunications company Sprint has in the company,
which could be off-putting to potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a difference in company strategies. MindSpring has
opted for steady growth and profitability. Marketing is almost
exclusively word of mouth and customer retention rates are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthlink is not a profitable company, and they won't be for
about four years, which is why it's trading at a discount,'' John
points out. Earthlink's plan is to spend as much money as it takes
to acquire subscribers and become the No. 2 provider behind AOL,
which has 12 million subscribers worldwide. Earthlink has 710,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors like service providers because, unlike some other
Internet companies, they use a recurring revenue model. They charge
a monthly fee that allows analysts to make more accurate
projections. ``It takes away some of the uncertainty you have with
some Internet companies right now,'' John says.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like Amazon.com are hard to put a value on
because it's hard, if not impossible, to predict how many books the
company will sell from quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say MindSpring is a solid company, whose fortunes have
been greatly increased by Wall Street's overall enthusiasm for all
things Internet. ``There are very few (Internet) companies to
invest in, and even fewer that have the profitability to back up
some of those valuations,'' John says.

SANYO BUYS ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FROM IBM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sanyo Electric Co., struggling to emerge from the
shadows cast by bigger competitors like Sony and Matsushita, has
bought access to some of the most advanced semiconductor technology
to use in its consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal announced Monday with the International Business
Machines Corp., Sanyo gets access to advanced semiconductor
manufacturing processes and is permitted to design chips that
incorporate IBM's copper circuit technology, a breakthrough in
semiconductor manufacturing that greatly reduces energy consumption
and improves performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us access to cutting-edge technology that's needed
for the next generation of consumer devices like digital cameras
and digital decoders for television, things that need more power
than conventional home appliances,'' said Daniel Cox, a spokesman
for Sanyo.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is also another step in Sanyo's efforts to build a
name for itself in the computer chips business, potentially a much
more lucrative area than consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   New consumer electronics, like cellular phones and digital
cameras, derive their capabilities from sophisticated computer
chips inside the devices. ``Many companies know they can't make
huge operating margin from assembled consumer electronics,'' said
Masashi Kubota, an electronics analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo.
``They're facing increased competition from Korean manufacturers
and price-cutting in Japan and know that the place to make money is
in electronic components and semiconductors.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give IBM greater presence as a chip supplier in
Japan. ``It's further acceptance of technology that we've developed
and evidence that it's valued by others,'' said Mac Jeffery, a
spokesman for IBM Asia Pacific in Tokyo. ``Plus, a fair amount of
our income is derived from licensing our technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sanyo's alliance with IBM, like an earlier one between Sony and
Fujitsu, highlights the high cost of developing the new, more
sophisticated chips used in modern consumer electronics. These
chips are home to a combination of transistors and circuits that in
the past would have each resided on separate chips.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of creating a neighborhood of tiny transistors
atop a postage-stamp-sized silicon wafer is immense, as is the
price. But as the world moves toward increasingly digitalized
consumer electronics, such ``systems on a chip'' become more
important as DVD storage disks replace CD-ROMs and cellular phones
replace desktop phones.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its deal with IBM, Sanyo will have access to IBM's
core library of chip design technology, including methods that
provide superior performance using less energy. It will also be
able to tap IBM's manufacturing technology to produce transistors
with a width of eighteen-hundredths micron and thinner, or less
than five one-hundredths of the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us access to technology that we otherwise wouldn't
have,'' Cox said.

WEB ADDRESS SELLS FOR $3.35 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. has agreed to pay a San Jose man $3.35
million for the Web address www.altavista.com, which is believed to
be a record amount paid for a domain name, according to a source
close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction settles a well-known two-year dispute between
Compaq, which owns the popular Alta Vista search engine, and Jack
Marshall, who owns the Alta Vista Web site name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the largest known figure for a domain name
transaction,'' said Edwin Hayward, who runs www.igoldrush.com, a
Web site that tracks such purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The buying and selling of Web site addresses _ or domain names _
has become fairly common on the Web, but most fetch price tags in
the tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators buy popular names such as www.mcdonalds.com or
www.television.com for $100 and then sell those addresses to
corporations for much higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has been somewhat curbed by a 1996 court ruling
that prevents cyber-squatters from buying trademarked names, but
generic names are still fair game.
</P>
<P>
   The Alta Vista name, however, was not trademarked when
electrical engineer Jack Marshall bought cyber-rights to it in
January 1994 for his Campbell startup, AltaVista Technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Marshall sold $49.95 software that let users build
multimedia postcards that could be displayed on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Digital Equipment Corp. _ which now is owned
by Compaq _ launched a search engine called Alta Vista. Because it
didn't own the Alta Vista address, Web surfers had to find it at
www.altavista.digital.com.
</P>
<P>
   But that address confused Web surfers, and many looking for the
Alta Vista search engine ended up on Marshall's site, overloading
his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We noticed it immediately,'' Marshall said. ``So we put a link
on our page to the search engine and frantically did a bunch of
things with our servers to keep the thing running.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had to upgrade his computers to handle the
half-million visitors per day, the increased traffic allowed
Marshall to lure big advertisers to his site as well.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Equipment Corp. offered to buy the Alta Vista trademark
from Marshall. He agreed to sell the trademark, but kept the right
to use it on software packages and his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But by Halloween 1996, Digital Equipment Corp. decided it wanted
more _ and it sued Marshall for the rights to www.altavista.com on
grounds that Marshall had violated the previous agreement by
failing to disclose that his site was not the Alta Vista search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, a federal judge in Boston required Marshall to
change his logo, which was similar to Digital's Alta Vista logo,
and to add a disclaimer to his site. But he didn't rule on the
domain name itself.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said settlement negotiations were stalled until Compaq
bought Digital Equipment Corp. for $9 billion in January.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions came to a head Friday during a six-hour
deal-making session in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations said Marshall won $3.35
million plus a permanent link from the Alta Vista search engine to
his new Web site _ www.photoloft.com.
</P>
<P>
   On August 31, Marshall will shut down his old site and turn the
name over to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said his agreement with Compaq prevents him from
commenting on the details of the settlement. Compaq officials were
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In all the frenzy of wrapping up the project, Marshall, 37,
barely made it home in time to witness the birth of his second son
at 5:21 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to appear in bad faith by not coming out to
Boston,'' he said. ``But I'm just so happy I came back before the
baby arrived. It would have been terrible if I'd missed it.''

NO GUARANTEE THAT FOREIGN WORKERS BILL WILL BECOME LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM ABATE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House hasn't signaled whether it will endorse last
week's House-Senate ``compromise'' on a controversial bill to
increase the number of foreigners who can work in the United States
under temporary H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the high-tech lobby cheered the deal, there's no
guarantee it will overcome an administration threat to veto the
H-1B bill unless it contained ``protections'' to ensure that
Americans weren't displaced by workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Lamar Smith, R-Texas, wrote such protections into
his original H-1B bill in the House, requiring that companies
``attest'' that no American was laid off to employ a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   But when the high-tech lobby balked, Republican leaders
pressured Smith to water down the ``attestation'' provision. As a
result, in the compromise bill, only firms whose staffs were more
than 15 percent H-1B workers would have to swear they weren't
dumping any Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of higher H-1B limits _ notably organized labor and
some professional engineering associations _ say Smith caved,
because only a handful of employment agencies that specialize in
hiring out H-1B workers will have to attest to anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a compromise, it's a victory for high-tech,'' said
Norman Matloff, a University of California at Davis professor and
H-1B opponent.
</P>
<P>
   He contends the compromise bill is really the industry-backed
Senate version authored by Senator Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., with a
15 percent attestation tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the 15 percent is enough of a fig
leaf to hide the fact that the compromise bill is essentially the
same legislation that President Clinton threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say White House economic advisor Gene Sperling, who'll
make the recommendation to Clinton, hasn't seen the actual
compromise language _ because Abraham's staff is still drafting it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can be sure tech leaders will be pressuring the
White House to approve the Smith-Abraham agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage it would be hard for the president to disappoint
high tech,'' one Republican Senate staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Hollowed ground? &LR;  After Lockheed Missiles &AMP; Space Co. said
last month it would cut some 2,000 heads from its 9,500-person Bay
Area workforce, a Lockheed veteran drew me aside to com plain that
the gray-haired were the first to be shown the door _ robbing the
firm of its institutional memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ageism but economics,'' the source said, requesting
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being retired based on their cost,'' he added.
``They happen to be the oldest and most experienced people. Many
projects are showing gaps in engineering knowledge as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed spokesman Dave Waller confirmed that employees 55 and
older have received letters offering voluntary early retirement.
But no group _ neither older workers nor new hires _ have been
singled out for layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Waller disputed any notion that the company was shedding its top
brains, saying Lockheed reserves the right to deny early retirement
to older workers with essential skills.
</P>
<P>
   But my source said Lockheed has been thinning its senior ranks
for years. The latest letters are just more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the results of this ``brain drain'' are evident in
troubled programs like the Theater High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD), which is supposed to protect troops in the field by
shooting down enemy missiles. But the system has been highly
criticized by the press.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; God on our side? &LR;  The trade publication Government Computer
News recently reported that a software screwup in May made the
Navy's ``smart ship'' go dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   According to GCN, the missile cruiser USS Yorktown _ called
smart because it uses software to replace 10 percent of its crew _
lost propulsion for 45 minutes because of an error caused by its
Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch led one civilian engineer to grumble that using the
relatively-new NT instead of the battle-tested Unix to run a
warship ``is similar to hoping that luck will be in our favor''
when the shooting starts.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; So what's new? &LR;  Pacific Bell's voice mail was down _ again _
for much of Saturday and for about 45 minutes yesterday. Spokesman
John Britton said the cause of yesterday's outage was unknown.
Saturday's down time occurred while the company was installing a
software update.

PINT-SIZE PCS OFFER WINDOWS PERFORMANCE  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've been looking for a portable computer that you can
carry around without getting a hernia and buy without refinancing
your house, you're in luck.
</P>
<P>
   A new category of personal computer called the mininotebook
offers Windows 98 performance in a package that's smaller and
lighter than a conventional notebook PC but bigger and more
user-friendly than handheld PCs with their tiny keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders in this bantam-weight class include the Sony
505 ($2,000), the Toshiba Libretto ($1,700), the Hitachi VisionBook
Traveler ($1,650), the Mitsubishi Amity ($1,500) and the Panasonic
CF-M31 ($2,300). All are Windows-based machines, which means that
they will run most applications you can put on a full-sized
notebook or desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Panasonic machines measure
about 9 inches by 7 inches _ only three-fifths the size of a
regular notebook. The Sony is bigger, but it's the thinnest of the
bunch. All the units weigh less than 3 pounds _ half the weight of
a regular notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Because you can't alter physics, some trade-offs are necessary
to reduce size. The most important sacrifices are:
</P>
<P>
   _The screen, which measures 7 or 8 inches diagonally in the
mininotebooks (10.4 inches for the Sony), compared with 12 inches
for a typical regular notebook.
</P>
<P>
   _The keyboard, which is about 90 percent the size of a regular
notebook's.
</P>
<P>
   _Mininotebooks have smaller batteries, typically offering less
than two hours between charges.
</P>
<P>
   _There is no CD-ROM drive. An external drive is an option
available for about $300.
</P>
<P>
   There are other minor drawbacks as well. Most mininotebooks have
slower chips than you will find on full-sized models. And they
don't come with modems, though you easily can add a
credit-card-sized modem for exchanging e-mail or surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Inconveniences notwithstanding, mininotebooks are ideal for
business travelers who use their PCs on the road for
correspondence, spreadsheets, e-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they are under three pounds and are full Windows
systems makes them very attractive to real road warriors,'' said
Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley research analyst who closely follows
the notebook market.
</P>
<P>
   Whether mininotebooks will catch on in the mainstream market is
debatable. ``They've got a lot of people going `ooh and ah,' but
whether that translates into `Ooh, here's my credit card' remains
to be seen,'' said Dataquest analyst Mike McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, mininotebooks soon could be eclipsed by a new
generation of devices that are bigger than handheld computers but
smaller than mininotebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``PC companions,'' these under-2-pound contenders use
Windows CE, the streamlined version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Early entries in this new class include the NEC MobilePro 750C
and the Phenom Ultra from LG (formerly Goldstar), both going for
$899.
</P>
<P>
   PC companions look like full-size notebooks that have been cut
in half length-wise. The color screen is about half the height of a
full-size notebook display. The keyboard also is small. But it's
still large enough for touch-typing without getting instant
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Most PC companions come with built-in modems. Another big
advantage to these little guys is longer battery life _ up to eight
hours for the NEC.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect PC companions to give you everything you get even
with a mininotebook. You can't add applications, so you have to be
content with Windows CE 2.0, which includes ``pocket'' versions of
Word, Excel, Internet Explorer and Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's enough to let you do the basic stuff like word
processing, spreadsheets, scheduling and e-mail. Given their
portable size, PC companions could be perfect for students who want
a computer for taking notes in class.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire thinks PC companions have the look of a winner.
``Frankly, we think these are going to out-ship the
ultraportables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that your interest has been piqued, you might want to hold
on for a while longer before snapping up a mininotebook or PC
companion. That's because the next version of Windows CE, version
3.0, is due out soon. It will spawn a generation of more-powerful
mininotebooks and PC companions, and prices on current models will
drop.

MICROSOFT CALLS ANTITRUST CASE `COMPLETELY GROUNDLESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first court papers it has filed in its defense, Microsoft
Corp. called the government's sweeping antitrust case against it
``completely groundless'' and offered a glimpse of the legal
strategy it will pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's formal answer to the suit filed in May by the
Justice Department and 20 states is an early step preceding a trial
in U.S. District Court in Washington, scheduled to begin on Sept.
8. Other, more detailed, court filings will be made later. Both
sides are scrambling to take depositions from potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The government has informed Microsoft that it wants to take a
videotaped deposition from Bill Gates, the company's chairman and
most prominent founder, according to a lawyer involved in trial
preparation. ``We want to see what kind of witness he makes,'' the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Microsoft would only say that Gates has not yet
been deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a deposition from Gates, antitrust experts say, would not
be a surprising tactic. ``It would be just a common-sense strategy
on the government's part, given that Bill Gates apparently has
firsthand knowledge of everything important that goes on at
Microsoft,'' said Kevin Arquit, a partner at Rogers &AMP; Wells, a New
York law firm, and a former senior antitrust official at the
Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The taking of a pretrial deposition from Gates would not
necessarily be followed by his being called as a witness _ a
hostile one _ for the government side. But that option is open to
the government, and the Justice Department did put the chairman of
AT&AMP;T, John de Butts, on the stand in the government's landmark
antitrust case against AT&AMP;T. That case culminated in the breakup of
the company in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said Tuesday that its own trial preparation was being
hindered by a reluctant competitor, Novell Inc. ``We are dismayed
that Novell is resisting a court order to provide information,''
said Mark Murray, a spokesman for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Such delays, Murray said, could present ``significant problems''
for Microsoft as it tried to prepare for a Sept. 8 trial date. But
he added that the company was working with Novell to try to resolve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Tuesday, Microsoft denied all of the government's
major allegations. For example, the company said that it had
decided to include Internet browsing software in its operating
system as early as late 1994 and early 1995, before Netscape
Communications Corp. had even been founded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not until 1995 that Microsoft licensed from another
company, Spyglass Inc., the technology that became the core of its
Internet Explorer browser. In its defense, Microsoft said it will
argue, with supporting evidence, that the decision to include
browsing capabilities in its Windows 95 operating system was made
much earlier, even though it had not yet acquired the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also denied that it had ever tried to ``illegally
divide the browser market'' in meetings with Netscape, as the
Justice Department contends. Representatives from both companies,
the court papers say, met ``in Redmond, Wash., on June 2, 1995, and
again in Mountain View, Calif., on June 21, 1995, to explore ways
in which the two companies could work together to improve their
respective products.''
</P>
<P>
   Another government allegation is that Microsoft's contracts with
personal computer makers are restrictive, giving Microsoft
tight-fisted control over the main Windows screen that users see
when they start up their machines. These restrictions are important
to the government's antitrust case because, the Justice Department
says, they are intended to allow Microsoft to use its Windows
operating-system monopoly to give the company an unfair advantage
in the newer markets for Internet software and services.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that the Windows main screen serves as a
crucial gateway to these new markets and that Microsoft is trying
to maintain a chokehold on that gateway.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Tuesday, Microsoft replied that its Windows
licensing deal with personal-computer makers gives them ``broad
flexibility to differentiate their products in response to
perceived consumer preferences.'' The only restrictions it places
on personal-computer makers are those that ensure the ease-of-use
and reliability of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a brief statement late Tuesday
afternoon, saying that the Microsoft filing contained ``numerous
misstatements and mischaracterizations.'' The Justice Department
added, ``We remain confident in our case and expect to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also filed a countersuit against the states Tuesday,
asking the Federal court to toss out claims made under state
antitrust laws instead of the Federal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said the move was mainly intended to streamline the
case, but it also asked that the states pay the company's legal
fees for researching and responding to specific state laws.
Microsoft could not estimate what those fees might be, but they
would presumably be a small share of the company's total legal
costs to prepare for the trial.

SECURITY FLAW DISCOVERED IN E-MAIL PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A serious security flaw has been discovered in
popular e-mail programs published by Microsoft Corp. and Netscape
Communications Corp. that would permit a malicious person to send a
message containing a virus that could crash a computer, destroy or
even steal data.
</P>
<P>
   So far, security tests have shown that the flaw exists in three
of the four most popular e-mail programs, used by perhaps tens of
millions of people around the world: Microsoft's Outlook Express
and Outlook 98 and Netscape's Web browser, Navigator, which is part
of its Communicator suite of Internet programs.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft is already providing fixes, the flaw is
particularly worrisome in the Microsoft Outlook 98 program, which
combines e-mail with a schedular, contact list, notes and other
tasks, because this software allows an illicit program attached to
a piece of e-mail to execute without any activity on the part of
the person using the target computer. Most computer viruses can
only infect a machine when the user opens an infected file or
attempts to run an infected program.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Microsoft admitted on Tuesday that the first fix
that was offered on the company's Web site, on Monday, does not
repair the problem. Anyone who downloaded and installed that fix
will have to return to the Web site and download and install the
new version.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported on Tuesday that users of its Outlook Express
program, the e-mail software supplied with Windows 95 and Windows
98, would have to open an infected attachment before a malicious
program could be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape officials said on Tuesday that a user of their
Communicator program would also have to open a file before a virus
could activate. The extra danger of the Outlook 98 program is that
it allows a malicious e-mail attachment to execute at the moment
the e-mail message arrives at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said that the flaw was present in versions
of the Outlook Express shipped with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
or 4.01 on Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
for DEC Alpha, as well as in versions for Macintosh and UNIX
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 3.1 and Windows NT 3.51 versions of Internet Explorer
are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Microsoft said on Tuesday that it had distributed about
2 million copies of the more seriously flawed Outlook 98 program
and at least a million copies of Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape could only report that 70 million copies of its
Navigator/Communicator software had been downloaded, but the
company could not determine how many people used the browser's
built-in e-mail software. Many people use separate, more
sophisticated programs than those that are shipped with browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of these is Eudora, a mail program published by
the Qualcomm Corp. Security researchers said that Eudora was not
vulnerable to the problem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although there is no evidence yet that any computer virus has
been distributed that exploits this newly discovered vulnerability,
security experts say that since word of the flaw leaked on the
Internet over the weekend, virus makers are undoubtedly already
aware of it and will work quickly to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Microsoft was already providing ``patches,''
small programs that repair the flaw in e-mail programs in question
for its Windows and NT operating system. The company said that
fixes for Macintosh and Unix computers would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said that the company's software development
group was attempting to determine how the flawed code made it into
their software.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape officials posted a notice about the problem on their
Web site on Tuesday, noting that the flaw only affects the Windows
and Windows NT versions of Navigator, not those distributed for
Macintosh or UNIX machines. The company said it would post a patch
for its Windows and NT versions within two weeks. Neither company
currently has any plans to notify users of the danger and the
availability of patches other than the notices on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft patches are available at
www.microsoft.com/ie/security. As of Tuesday, none of the virus
detection programs were yet offering protection from _ or even
detection of _ malicious e-mail attachments designed to exploit the
flaw. Officials at Symantec Corp.said that they were now exploring
how they might add new functions to their software to detect this
type of virus, but they said they would not be able to offer any
protection in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate users of electronic mail typically have their e-mail
programs configured to check for mail every 10 minutes or so while
on line and then automatically download any new messages to the
computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said they were astounded that both companies
had distributed software containing a well-known type of
program-design error. The code that resulted in the flaw has been a
widely documented problem for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled that a flaw like this would be in recently
written software, given what we know,'' said Eugene Spafford,
director of the Center for Education and Research in Information
Assurance and Security at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Several security specialists attributed the flaw to heated
competition between Microsoft and Netscape for domination of the
Internet market. Both companies have been rushing programs to
market in record times, giving them away for free and largely
turning millions of Internet users into a massive audience of
software testers.
</P>
<P>
   A number of computer security researchers also said that because
the program had been so widely disseminated on commercial CD-ROMs,
as part of the Windows operating system and over the Internet,
closing the hole might prove to be a particularly vexing task.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, security experts who have been aware of the problem
for several weeks began talking openly about the possibility of
forcing the software publishers to issue a general recall of their
software because of the potential danger. The Federal Trade
Commission, the government agency responsible for such recalls, has
never recalled software and does not have a policy for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is to begin to treat computer security issues
with as much fervor as we treat a medical issue or a financial
issue, said Russ Cooper, a software security expert and the
moderator of a mailing list that deals with Microsoft software
bugs. ``To do this we need a mechanism for software recalls.
Microsoft needs to recall all Windows 98 CDs and all CDs produced
with the affected versions of Outlook Express and Outlook 98, and
Netscape needs to recall all the affected version of their
Communicator suite.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said that the company had begun putting
into place user protection mechanisms that would make software
recalls unnecessary. For example, beginning with its Windows 98
program, Microsoft added a Windows Update feature that notifies
users if their software is not up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   To use the feature, however, the users have to press the Start
button, followed by Settings, followed by Windows Update. What is
more, as of tonight, the automatic update feature offered a patch
for the Outlook Express problem but did not even mention the far
more serious Outlook 98 flaw.

``Saving Private Ryan'' creates ``dialogue'' for America Online 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veterans of the Second World War II and high school students
just learning about it are venturing onto America Online's Saving
Private Ryan area (Keyword: Saving Private Ryan) to remember,
exchange stories and just talk.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokeswoman Janine Dunne says that since the area opened
Friday, more than10,000 messages have been posted. Dunne says the
only time there was such a large response to a topic was after the
death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Kornbluth, AOL's editorial content director, says the
outpouring of messages can be directly related to the movie's power
and the need to talk about the war and its aftermath in a different
way. He also says that AOL's infrastructure and technology make
this kind of dialog easier than it would be on the Web or other
online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime on AOL we get real and deal with the struggle of
everyday life, there is just an outpouring of emotion on the
boards,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the messages are personal reactions to the movie
and heated debates about Matt Damon's acting ability, the most
interesting and moving posts are a spontaneous dialogue between
those old enough to recall the war in vivid detail and those who
are young enough to regard it as ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Comments range from those of vets recalling their wartime
memories to amazed teens who now see ``grandpa's war'' in a new
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you loved the movie, hated the movie, found it
overdone, inaccurate, too gory, etc., ``Saving Private Ryan'' did
exactly what a good movie should do ...i t created a dialogue,''
wrote one AOL member marvelling at the number of messages.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Saving Private Ryan'' message boards aren't the only place
where AOL members have gone en masse to express their opinions and
feelings. AOL has set up areas to talk about the Florida forrest
fires and Jonesboro, Ark., high school shootings and met with an
outpouring of emotional and heartfelt response. The combination of
AOL's screen names which protect the identity of the user (members
are warned not to post their names, addresses or any other specific
personal information) and the online service's technology that
makes chats and message boards easier to manipulate than those on
the Web are part of what makes AOL something akin to a national
watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed that it takes a movie to make us realize what
it took to get this country where it is,'' wrote one AOL member.
``Sure we learned about the wars in history class, but I don't
think it ever soaked in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought back memories one tried to supress for 50 years,''
wrote another veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Vietnam vet and the son of a WWII vet who was in the
invasion of Normandy, I can say I finally understand how and why my
father became the man he is,'' one AOL member writes. ``When I
asked him about the invasion, he said he left his soul on the
beach. After seeing 'Saving Private Ryan,' I know now what he
meant. I served in Vietnam and did see some action, but nothing
compared to the carnage and destruction of Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornbluth believes the ``Saving Private Ryan'' area is what
America Online is all about. ``To me we are an online 'service,'''
he said. ``The service aspect is hugely important to me and crucial
to what we do. After you check the stocks and look at your e-mail,
there is one other thing to do _ to share and feel. ``
</P>
<P>
   The boards are monitored, not censored. A teenager who doubted
the film's authenticity and touted Adolph Hitler as a great man,
received many responses _ some gentle and some passionate _
disagreeing with him. One member replied. ``Millions fought and
died 50 years ago so that you can voice that kind of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best example of how high emotions are running on
this topic come from a Vietnam vet who responded to a message from
a teenage girl: ``You said, 'I have so much respect for veterans
from the past wars, I only wish I could tell them all and hug them
and thank them.' Young lady, you just did. As a Vietnam vet I thank
you for your thoughts and believe me, your hugs felt good.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Plenty of food sites to savor on the Net 
By Betty Parham  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have all become familiar with the warnings that have come
along with the burgeoning of the Internet _ take heed before giving
out personal information, don't become a Net addict, beware of
strangers, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes yet another, although far more benign, Internet worry.
Affected are those millions of folks who jealously guard a precious
hour or two a month when they can steal away to a favorite chair,
facing no distractions, with a favorite food magazine. Leafing
through the slick pages showing tantalizing food being prepared in
impossibly fabulous kitchens, by impossibly fabulous people in
exotic settings, can be a seductive escape from busy lives _ to say
nothing of the inspiration you can get for your own kitchen. The
problem may arise because the Internet presents too much of a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, only a handful of food magazines were being
published. Now it's hard to keep up with the proliferation of
gourmet and cooking publications that hit the newsstands every
month. Add to those print publications their Internet versions and

<P>
   COZUMEL, Mexico _ When huge cruise ships belly up to a new
concrete pier off this Caribbean island, it's a bitter reminder to
Dora Uribe of an opportunity lost.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity, she says, to use the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) to mount an 11th-hour campaign to stop the pier
and save Paradise Reef. Environmentalists had long argued that the
reef would be broken to pieces and eventually destroyed by visiting
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Uribe and other Mexican environmentalists were
the first to file a complaint with a special commission established
by NAFTA's environmental side agreement. By arguing that Mexican
laws had been ignored or violated in the pier's planning, the
petitioners had hoped the commission would fine or at least
chastise Mexico enough to embarrass officials into stopping the
pier's construction.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting nearly two years, they received ``a beautiful''
report from the commission last October, peppered with facts to
back up the environmentalists' position, Uribe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there wasn't one recommendation,'' said Uribe, a lawyer on
this small Mexican island 40 miles south of Cancun. ``The only
conclusion you can make . . . is that this is another bureaucracy
with no power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cozumel experience is one of the hard lessons learned by
environmentalists who have tried to use the NAFTA side agreement to
ensure that laws in each country are followed, not flouted or
downgraded, as free trade spreads in Mexico, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal-based Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC)
is charged with reviewing citizen complaints in each country, but
the process doesn't allow the commission to penalize a nation for
failing to enforce its own laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another institution set up to accompany NAFTA, which went into
effect in 1994, is the San Antonio, Texas-based North American
Development Bank (NADBank), established to make or secure loans for
water and sewage treatment projects in Mexico and the United States
that would clean up the troubled border region.
</P>
<P>
   Although NADBank counts 21 projects for which it is actively
helping find financing, not a single water or sewage-treatment
plant has been built using a bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank also has a sister institution, the Border
Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC), a binational agency
based in Juarez, Mexico, that reviews applications for NADBank
assistance and decides if the proposals are well-designed and
financially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The BECC, critics say, has limited power because it doesn't have
purview over toxic waste, pollution that threatens the operation of
sewage treatment plants built along the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the CEC in Montreal, director Greg Block said, ``I'm very
aware there are mixed and divisive views among the public'' on the
environmental side agreement's efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, he said, was not granted the power through NAFTA
to take a side when reviewing citizens' complaints, although some
people may have mistakenly believed this.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reviews ``let the facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Block defended the CEC, arguing that it is successfully
pursuing a North American-wide program to phase out dangerous
pesticides and funding small environmental research projects and
businesses in each country. And, he added, the CEC has had some
success responding to environmental crises.
</P>
<P>
   When 40,000 migratory birds in Mexico perished in 1995 at a
poisoned reservoir, Block said, the CEC investigated -- ``with a
good deal of cooperation from Mexico'' -- and recommended methods
to curtail pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, the NADBank has found its work stymied, in part,
because private financing for infrastructure projects proved
difficult to secure and Mexican municipalities were virtually
blocked from accepting loans by federal constraints. What's more,
few Mexican cities have experience at instituting user fees to
guarantee that loans for projects would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
   The $400 million that Mexico and the United States have
contributed to the bank so far is insufficient to directly finance
costly infrastructure projects, according to NADBank director
Victor Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is still trying to obtain loans, but it has retooled
its mission.
</P>
<P>
   It is now focusing heavily on administering a program offering
$170 million in grants supplied by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to help get critical projects built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without grants, this system doesn't work,'' said Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're barely beginning,'' he added. ``If we haven't built
anything in five years, I'll be on the critics' side.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage are still
flowing into rivers and oceans off Texas and California, along with
toxic chemicals from the growing number of ``maquiladoras,'' or
Mexican export factories.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people living along the border lack basic
water delivery and sewage disposal systems. Environmentalists worry
that without careful planning, projects to address these festering
problems won't keep up with border population growth that's
expected to double by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   All of the NAFTA environmental agencies enjoy defenders --
including environmentalists -- who say that the institutions are
vital to free and fair trade, and must be given a chance to mature.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank is working on relaxing Mexican bureaucratic
obstacles that have prevented municipalities from getting direct
loans, said Mark Spalding, a University of California at San Diego
lecturer who wrote a report on the bank called ``Promising
Potential'' for the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The CEC, Spalding acknowledged, has no power to stop
environmentally-damaging projects, something that is ``one of the
big criticisms.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, media coverage over the CEC probe into the
Cozumel pier ``embarrassed Mexico,'' and has paved the way for more
transparent reviews for other controversial proposals in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Alanis, director of the Mexican Center for Environmental
Law, was among those who filed the citizen complaint over the
Cozumel pier.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned to the CEC to register other complaints, he said,
because the commission's international spotlight provides objective
information that encourages wider debate in Mexico. The CEC's
attention to the pier, he added, forced Mexico to improve its laws
to protect endangered reefs and prompted an environmental plan for
the island of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, was disappointed that after many months of waiting
-- while construction went ahead on the pier -- ``you end with
this: a report, only facts, and no conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Seligman of the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C. is more
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was sold a bill of goods (with the NAFTA side
agreement),'' he said. ``As a general matter, there was more
promise than could possibly be delivered by these institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank was a flawed concept, Seligman said, because it was
expected to lure private capital to finance, in Mexico, the type of
infrastructure projects that Americans had to build with government
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another underlying problem, he said, was that border factories
in Mexico -- many of them American _ are not being sufficiently
taxed by Mexico to contribute to water and sewage projects in the
communities where they dump waste and use resources.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Seligman said, United States EPA money, ``American
taxpayers' money,'' is now being used to help finance projects
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrisome, Seligman and other environmentalists agree, is
the specter that NAFTA-backed infrastructure projects along the
Texas-California-Arizona border with Mexico will suffer because of
toxic chemicals, explosive population and industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego-Tijuana border region, where millions of
gallons of raw sewage from Tijuana are dumped into the ocean each
day, a highly touted binational sewage treatment plant that opened
earlier this year to dispose of Tijuana's waste is failing acute
toxicity tests.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: sludge from Tijuana contains a toxic stew of various
industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and other agencies managing the plant, which was started
before NAFTA, are conducting tests to figure out what the poisons
are, and will need cooperation from Tijuana to identify sources and
prevent businesses from dumping chemicals into sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   The toxic substances ``could be coming from U.S. companies in
Tijuana,'' said Elizabeth Borowic, EPA's project manager for the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects supported by the BECC and the NADBank is an
upgraded sewage-treatment center in Tijuana that currently treats
only about half the sewage it receives.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA-backed Tijuana project is slated to be connected to
the San Diego binational plant, but the plan will end up a disaster
if authorities in Mexico don't come up with an adequate program to
prevent toxic dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are upset because they predicted the San Diego
binational plant would be overwhelmed by toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really expecting to use this as a model for
binational cooperation,'' said Cesar Luna of San Diego's
Environmental Health Coalition. ``It would like a jewel of NAFTA.
Instead, it's like a cubic zirconium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has no right-to-know laws that require public disclosure
of toxic substances, and in the past it has been reluctant to
reveal that information publicly on the American side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years after NAFTA,'' Luna said, ``this sort of thing
should have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Texas-Mexico border, raw sewage is still flowing into the
Rio Grande river despite a sewage-treatment plant inaugurated in
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in 1996 with much fanfare from both
countries' governments.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators discovered that the plant, which President Clinton
cited as a NAFTA success story, will require millions of dollars
more in construction costs so that it can capture sludge from
growing communities that were not properly connected to the system
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities are trying to determine how to pay
for the costs, given that Nuevo Laredo is financially-strapped.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects planned for the border cities of Juarez, Acuna,
Reynosa and Matamoros could face similar problems if such obstacles
are not anticipated, said Cyrus Reed of the Texas Center for Policy
Studies in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building things now to take care of problems that have
accumulated for years,'' Reed said. ``But the growth on the border
continues.''

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Norberto Cordoba says he was fired from Han
Young, a Korean-owned auto parts factory here, for a simple reason:
``They told me I was a 'political man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old welder didn't take his unjust dismissal lightly.
</P>
<P>
   He, and Mexican and American labor activists have taken his
grievance and a range of others alleging unfair treatment at the
Han Young export, or ``maquiladora'' factory in Tijuana, all the
way to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a high-profile battle that is dampening free-trade
support in the U.S. capital, straining U.S.-Mexican relations and
testing a promise that the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) would benefit -- rather than exploit -- laborers in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   When NAFTA was enacted in 1994, a special side agreement set up
offices in the labor departments of the United States, Mexico and
Canada where people could submit complaints charging that member
countries were failing to enforce their own labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Trade Representative in the Clinton
administration, promised then that the side agreement would have
``real teeth.'' But NAFTA opponents were skeptical because the pact
-- the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation -- included
only limited provisions for penalizing a country for refusing to
change bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mexican and U.S. labor activists have been teaming up
to submit complaints and use the agreement as a forum for
spotlighting abuses, especially in Mexico's maquiladora industry.
Maquiladoras employ about 1 million people in nearly 3,000
factories that assemble export goods for U.S. consumers. Han Young,
for example, welds truck chassis for Hyundai Precision America, the
automobile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work, if labor rights are not respected, then
this was all a deception and the labor agreement was simply a way
to protect cheap labor,'' said Tijuana labor organizer Enrique
Hernandez, a leader in the Han Young dispute who has been
threatened with arrest for his activities and whose office has been
vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department has received nine petitions alleging
unchecked abuses in Mexico, ranging from discrimination against
pregnant women in maquiladoras to reprisal against independent
labor unions attempting to organize in these factories.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Labor Ministry, for its part, is investigating
complaints filed against the United States, including one alleging
that U.S. officials have failed to protect Mexican apple workers in
Washington state from anti-union intimidation and health and safety
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young complaint is twofold: It charges that Mexico
failed to enforce laws protecting health and safety, as well as the
workers' constitutional right to organize an independent union.
</P>
<P>
   Independent unions are a sensitive subject in Mexico's
maquiladoras, a sector dominated only by unions that are affiliated
with Mexico's ruling political party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). Han Young's maquiladora workers are
among the first in Mexico to successfully obtain recognition for
their independent union.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy, according to an ongoing U.S. probe into
Han Young. Today, despite requests from U.S. officials to address
harassment of the Han Young workers, the independent union is still
battling to represent the employees at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement depends on cooperation, and the Mexican
government is not cooperating,'' said Mary Tong, director of the
San Diego-based Support Committee for Maquiladora Workers, one of
the groups that filed the Han Young complaint.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Hernandez and a group of Han Young workers
upset with working conditions and wages as low as $8 a day tried to
organize their independent union. They were foiled, they say, by
the company, which dismissed sympathetic workers and hired and
intimidated new ones. In addition, the Tijuana labor authorities
conducted poorly-run union elections and then refused to recognize
an independent union victory.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote that upheld the independent union's victory was
held after federal government intervention -- and after President
Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo discussed the Han
Young dispute at the urging of U.S. House Democratic Whip David E.
Bonior of Michigan, a NAFTA opponent who has seized on Han Young as
an example of worker abuse in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the independent union, assisted by American labor
activists, filed its complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor.
And in late April, the department issued a diplomatic but
devastating report that criticized Mexico and backed up the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The report challenged Mexican officials' impartiality and
commitment to enforcement of its laws, and found that
government-affiliated unions enjoyed more legal protection than
independent unions. It also recommended that Mexico's labor
secretary meet with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's initial response was hostile, according to published
reports, with the Mexican Labor Ministry accusing the United States
of taking sides and a Tijuana labor official calling the report ``a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are silent on the matter now, saying they are
waiting for a second report on health and safety at Han Young to be
issued by the United States before commenting. No meeting between
the labor secretaries has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the request for consultations, the relationship between
the independent union and Tijuana labor officials has deteriorated
further. Police have clashed with pro-union workers, attempting to
break up a strike that a judge declared was legal under Mexican
law. After a government-affiliated union said it wanted to regain
its hold on the factory, officials held two more questionable
elections whose results were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Labor organizer Hernandez had to obtain a court order to prevent
Tijuana authorities from arresting him. Anti-American banners were
hung up at the plant, urging ``gringos'' to stay out of Han Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior issued a blunt statement from Washington, accusing Han
Young management, Tijuana labor officials and the Mexican
government of ``a systematic effort to deny Han Young workers their
right to an independent union through harassment, intimidation and
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the outcome of the dispute ``a test for the Mexican
government,'' and warned that it ``could have long-term
implications for U.S. trade policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior also used the Han Young case to defeat President
Clinton's bid for continued ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate
new free-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young case is so sensitive that Irasema Garza, the
secretary of the office that produced the U.S. report, won't
comment on it other than to say that she is concerned and
monitoring developments.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. Labor official familiar with the case said despite
the chilly reception from Mexico, the dispute shows how the NAFTA
side agreement is working to pressure Mexico to enforce its own
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That union that is currently struggling (in Tijuana) right now
would not exist were it not for the process,'' said the official,
who asked not to be identified. ``I can't say it any clearer than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Garza said, ``The Mexican government, to be quite
honest with you, has been cautious (about the side agreement). I
think this is not an experience they have enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The second report on Han Young, focusing on alleged health and
safety violations and due to be released before summer's end, could
be even more explosive than the first.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations, if left unaddressed by Mexican officials,
could lead to U.S. trade sanctions against Mexico, including up to
tens of millions of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA countries can only face sanctions if they are found to
have flagrantly violated their own child-labor, health and safety
or minimum-wage laws. There are no provisions for sanctions for
violating the right to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Garza acknowledged that getting to sanctions could take years of
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is designed in such a way to try to convince a
government to do the right thing . . . ,'' she said. ``Ultimately,
that's what this is about. It's not about penalizing governments.
It really is about governments being convinced to enforce their own
labor laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though sanctions are unlikely, Garza defended the NAFTA
side agreement for opening up ``public debate'' in Mexico through
public hearings that have been held to gather testimony on various
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on union organizing in Mexico City, she said, ``the
workers would come up to me and say, 'Miss Garza, this is historic
. . . We don't have access to our government officials like you do
in the United States. This is an opportunity we've never had.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said Mexico, through a new five-year plan, is addressing
problems that have been raised some complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Gualde, who studies maquiladoras at the College of the
Northern Border in Tijuana, said the NAFTA side agreement has
``symbolic import'' and puts companies under pressure to comply
with existing laws or face public criticism, especially bad reviews
in Washington, D.C. and in the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of the substantial change,'' he said, ``has to come
from within Mexico itself.''

   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Savoring the week of her 18th birthday
and the end of first-year exams, Lyudmila Yolshina resembles any
college freshman on her way to a dance club. Nails are polished, a
hint of make-up adorns her face and the mini-skirt is suitably
stylish.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman ever admitted to Russia's vaunted Frunze Naval
Academy, founded by Peter the Great in 1715, has just finished her
hellish inaugural year. August offers a chance to be a civilian
again, just another one of the girls before returning to her
arduous role as a minority of one in a school of more than 1,000
men.
</P>
<P>
   Cadets at the academy, one of Russia's most prestigious military
institutions, refer to her as ``Soldat Zhane'' -- G.I. Jane. Some
intend it as a compliment; others deliver it with a sneer.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to her American counterparts at military academies such
as Annapolis and West Point (who first gained entry in the 1970s),
she has tales of difficult days in an overwhelmingly male domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women should have the opportunity, but it is very
hard. Sometimes I feel I want to give it up because it is just too
hard. There are such moments,'' she confessed in a recent interview
with the Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, I've managed to show them my place and their place,'' she
added with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Yolshina has been acclaimed as a symbol for the new Russia,
representing the transitional role of women in an Old-World society
notorious for male chauvinism. Russian television and newspapers
have featured her in stories, as have news media around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the blonde-haired, soft-spoken Yolshina is a reluctant icon.
Dealing with demanding classes and hostile classmates is difficult
enough. Her mere presence is bucking tradition daily at the stately
18th-Century academy on the Neva River, which cuts through this
historic city.
</P>
<P>
   Yolshina does not want her success or failure interpreted as
something larger than what it may mean for her naval career. She is
uncomfortable as the litmus test on behalf of Russia's womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to be the exception. I am doing well. I am
studying hard for myself. There is no such feeling that since I am
the only woman and the first, that I must be the top student,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And she is not sure she would recommend the experience to other
women.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are against every high-schooler -- male or female --
anxious to enter the demanding, tradition-bound academy; five of
every six applications are refused.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Yolshina and her father, a retired naval captain,
were bristling at her rejection. Despite her athletic abilities as
a competitive swimmer and her excellent academic record, the
academy was not prepared to allow her even to take the entrance
exam.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few women officers sent for specialized training,
no woman had ever been admitted to Russia's elite military
academies for the grueling five-year training as a career officer.
</P>
<P>
   Yolshina wrote letters to the navy's high command, the defense
ministry and the Kremlin in her struggle to be accepted. Her
ability to take the exams, and ultimately her acceptance last
August, were finally approved after she wrote letters directly to
President Boris Yeltsin asking him to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively few women in Russia's military -- they comprise
less than 1 percent of the total, compared to about 15 percent in
the U.S. military -- do not serve in combat roles, though tens of
thousands did in the Soviet army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Yolshina, who has chosen meteorology as her specialty field,
acknowledges that she will likely never rise through the ranks to
command a ship. There are important jobs to be done on land, she
said, and she is prepared to carry out hers when she receives her
commission in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In her first week at the academy, she had no uniform because it
had to be specially designed. She wore civilian clothes and was
treated as a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told classmates that I was a student and no one believed
me,'' she said. ``In the first weeks I didn't know how to behave
myself. I didn't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazing, notorious in the Russian military, also takes place at
Frunze. But the word quickly spread among male students that
Yolshina was off-limits. Navy officials, aware of the public
interest in Yolshina and the academy's image, have instructed her
to report even the slightest problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pressure from professors and fellow cadets is
intense, and entrenched attitudes are difficult to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Boris Popov, head of the academy, told reporters last
year: ``Women are no worse than men, and some are better suited for
certain navy professions,'' adding with a chuckle: ``They are
particularly good at meteorology -- look at the weather girls on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's restrooms existed at the academy for female members of
the administrative staff, but no dormitories. Yolshina commutes to
classes by subway from her parent's home and is exempted from
nightwatch duty, which tends to further alienate her from the
academy's male society.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is content with the arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Yolshina speculates that the experience could be
even tougher if there were more females in her class, offering a
bigger target for those opposed to admitting women. More female
cadets might force the reluctant administration to make concessions
on boarding and might stir up more resentment among male students
and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be an issue soon. No women applied for the incoming
freshman class this year. Yolshina remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they try to find fault with everything I do. But I
think this is natural because I was the first in the school,'' she
said. ``I have to be ready for this now and in the future.''

<P>
   COZUMEL, Mexico _ When huge cruise ships belly up to a new
concrete pier off this Caribbean island, it's a bitter reminder to
Dora Uribe of an opportunity lost.
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity, she says, to use the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) to mount an 11th-hour campaign to stop the pier
and save Paradise Reef. Environmentalists had long argued that the
reef would be broken to pieces and eventually destroyed by visiting
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Uribe and other Mexican environmentalists were
the first to file a complaint with a special commission established
by NAFTA's environmental side agreement. By arguing that Mexican
laws had been ignored or violated in the pier's planning, the
petitioners had hoped the commission would fine or at least
chastise Mexico enough to embarrass officials into stopping the
pier's construction.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting nearly two years, they received ``a beautiful''
report from the commission last October, peppered with facts to
back up the environmentalists' position, Uribe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there wasn't one recommendation,'' said Uribe, a lawyer on
this small Mexican island 40 miles south of Cancun. ``The only
conclusion you can make . . . is that this is another bureaucracy
with no power.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cozumel experience is one of the hard lessons learned by
environmentalists who have tried to use the NAFTA side agreement to
ensure that laws in each country are followed, not flouted or
downgraded, as free trade spreads in Mexico, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal-based Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC)
is charged with reviewing citizen complaints in each country, but
the process doesn't allow the commission to penalize a nation for
failing to enforce its own laws.
</P>
<P>
   Another institution set up to accompany NAFTA, which went into
effect in 1994, is the San Antonio, Texas-based North American
Development Bank (NADBank), established to make or secure loans for
water and sewage treatment projects in Mexico and the United States
that would clean up the troubled border region.
</P>
<P>
   Although NADBank counts 21 projects for which it is actively
helping find financing, not a single water or sewage-treatment
plant has been built using a bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank also has a sister institution, the Border
Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC), a binational agency
based in Juarez, Mexico, that reviews applications for NADBank
assistance and decides if the proposals are well-designed and
financially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The BECC, critics say, has limited power because it doesn't have
purview over toxic waste, pollution that threatens the operation of
sewage treatment plants built along the border.
</P>
<P>
   At the CEC in Montreal, director Greg Block said, ``I'm very
aware there are mixed and divisive views among the public'' on the
environmental side agreement's efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, he said, was not granted the power through NAFTA
to take a side when reviewing citizens' complaints, although some
people may have mistakenly believed this.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reviews ``let the facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Block defended the CEC, arguing that it is successfully
pursuing a North American-wide program to phase out dangerous
pesticides and funding small environmental research projects and
businesses in each country. And, he added, the CEC has had some
success responding to environmental crises.
</P>
<P>
   When 40,000 migratory birds in Mexico perished in 1995 at a
poisoned reservoir, Block said, the CEC investigated -- ``with a
good deal of cooperation from Mexico'' -- and recommended methods
to curtail pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, the NADBank has found its work stymied, in part,
because private financing for infrastructure projects proved
difficult to secure and Mexican municipalities were virtually
blocked from accepting loans by federal constraints. What's more,
few Mexican cities have experience at instituting user fees to
guarantee that loans for projects would be paid back.
</P>
<P>
   The $400 million that Mexico and the United States have
contributed to the bank so far is insufficient to directly finance
costly infrastructure projects, according to NADBank director
Victor Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is still trying to obtain loans, but it has retooled
its mission.
</P>
<P>
   It is now focusing heavily on administering a program offering
$170 million in grants supplied by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to help get critical projects built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without grants, this system doesn't work,'' said Miramontes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're barely beginning,'' he added. ``If we haven't built
anything in five years, I'll be on the critics' side.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage are still
flowing into rivers and oceans off Texas and California, along with
toxic chemicals from the growing number of ``maquiladoras,'' or
Mexican export factories.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people living along the border lack basic
water delivery and sewage disposal systems. Environmentalists worry
that without careful planning, projects to address these festering
problems won't keep up with border population growth that's
expected to double by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   All of the NAFTA environmental agencies enjoy defenders --
including environmentalists -- who say that the institutions are
vital to free and fair trade, and must be given a chance to mature.
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank is working on relaxing Mexican bureaucratic
obstacles that have prevented municipalities from getting direct
loans, said Mark Spalding, a University of California at San Diego
lecturer who wrote a report on the bank called ``Promising
Potential'' for the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The CEC, Spalding acknowledged, has no power to stop
environmentally-damaging projects, something that is ``one of the
big criticisms.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, media coverage over the CEC probe into the
Cozumel pier ``embarrassed Mexico,'' and has paved the way for more
transparent reviews for other controversial proposals in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo Alanis, director of the Mexican Center for Environmental
Law, was among those who filed the citizen complaint over the
Cozumel pier.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned to the CEC to register other complaints, he said,
because the commission's international spotlight provides objective
information that encourages wider debate in Mexico. The CEC's
attention to the pier, he added, forced Mexico to improve its laws
to protect endangered reefs and prompted an environmental plan for
the island of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, was disappointed that after many months of waiting
-- while construction went ahead on the pier -- ``you end with
this: a report, only facts, and no conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Seligman of the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C. is more
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was sold a bill of goods (with the NAFTA side
agreement),'' he said. ``As a general matter, there was more
promise than could possibly be delivered by these institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The NADBank was a flawed concept, Seligman said, because it was
expected to lure private capital to finance, in Mexico, the type of
infrastructure projects that Americans had to build with government
money.
</P>
<P>
   Another underlying problem, he said, was that border factories
in Mexico -- many of them American _ are not being sufficiently
taxed by Mexico to contribute to water and sewage projects in the
communities where they dump waste and use resources.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Seligman said, United States EPA money, ``American
taxpayers' money,'' is now being used to help finance projects
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrisome, Seligman and other environmentalists agree, is
the specter that NAFTA-backed infrastructure projects along the
Texas-California-Arizona border with Mexico will suffer because of
toxic chemicals, explosive population and industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego-Tijuana border region, where millions of
gallons of raw sewage from Tijuana are dumped into the ocean each
day, a highly touted binational sewage treatment plant that opened
earlier this year to dispose of Tijuana's waste is failing acute
toxicity tests.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: sludge from Tijuana contains a toxic stew of various
industrial chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and other agencies managing the plant, which was started
before NAFTA, are conducting tests to figure out what the poisons
are, and will need cooperation from Tijuana to identify sources and
prevent businesses from dumping chemicals into sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   The toxic substances ``could be coming from U.S. companies in
Tijuana,'' said Elizabeth Borowic, EPA's project manager for the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects supported by the BECC and the NADBank is an
upgraded sewage-treatment center in Tijuana that currently treats
only about half the sewage it receives.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA-backed Tijuana project is slated to be connected to
the San Diego binational plant, but the plan will end up a disaster
if authorities in Mexico don't come up with an adequate program to
prevent toxic dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are upset because they predicted the San Diego
binational plant would be overwhelmed by toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were really expecting to use this as a model for
binational cooperation,'' said Cesar Luna of San Diego's
Environmental Health Coalition. ``It would like a jewel of NAFTA.
Instead, it's like a cubic zirconium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has no right-to-know laws that require public disclosure
of toxic substances, and in the past it has been reluctant to
reveal that information publicly on the American side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years after NAFTA,'' Luna said, ``this sort of thing
should have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Texas-Mexico border, raw sewage is still flowing into the
Rio Grande river despite a sewage-treatment plant inaugurated in
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, in 1996 with much fanfare from both
countries' governments.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators discovered that the plant, which President Clinton
cited as a NAFTA success story, will require millions of dollars
more in construction costs so that it can capture sludge from
growing communities that were not properly connected to the system
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities are trying to determine how to pay
for the costs, given that Nuevo Laredo is financially-strapped.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects planned for the border cities of Juarez, Acuna,
Reynosa and Matamoros could face similar problems if such obstacles
are not anticipated, said Cyrus Reed of the Texas Center for Policy
Studies in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building things now to take care of problems that have
accumulated for years,'' Reed said. ``But the growth on the border
continues.''

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ Norberto Cordoba says he was fired from Han
Young, a Korean-owned auto parts factory here, for a simple reason:
``They told me I was a 'political man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old welder didn't take his unjust dismissal lightly.
</P>
<P>
   He, and Mexican and American labor activists have taken his
grievance and a range of others alleging unfair treatment at the
Han Young export, or ``maquiladora'' factory in Tijuana, all the
way to Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a high-profile battle that is dampening free-trade
support in the U.S. capital, straining U.S.-Mexican relations and
testing a promise that the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) would benefit -- rather than exploit -- laborers in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   When NAFTA was enacted in 1994, a special side agreement set up
offices in the labor departments of the United States, Mexico and
Canada where people could submit complaints charging that member
countries were failing to enforce their own labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Trade Representative in the Clinton
administration, promised then that the side agreement would have
``real teeth.'' But NAFTA opponents were skeptical because the pact
-- the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation -- included
only limited provisions for penalizing a country for refusing to
change bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mexican and U.S. labor activists have been teaming up
to submit complaints and use the agreement as a forum for
spotlighting abuses, especially in Mexico's maquiladora industry.
Maquiladoras employ about 1 million people in nearly 3,000
factories that assemble export goods for U.S. consumers. Han Young,
for example, welds truck chassis for Hyundai Precision America, the
automobile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't work, if labor rights are not respected, then
this was all a deception and the labor agreement was simply a way
to protect cheap labor,'' said Tijuana labor organizer Enrique
Hernandez, a leader in the Han Young dispute who has been
threatened with arrest for his activities and whose office has been
vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Labor Department has received nine petitions alleging
unchecked abuses in Mexico, ranging from discrimination against
pregnant women in maquiladoras to reprisal against independent
labor unions attempting to organize in these factories.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Labor Ministry, for its part, is investigating
complaints filed against the United States, including one alleging
that U.S. officials have failed to protect Mexican apple workers in
Washington state from anti-union intimidation and health and safety
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young complaint is twofold: It charges that Mexico
failed to enforce laws protecting health and safety, as well as the
workers' constitutional right to organize an independent union.
</P>
<P>
   Independent unions are a sensitive subject in Mexico's
maquiladoras, a sector dominated only by unions that are affiliated
with Mexico's ruling political party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). Han Young's maquiladora workers are
among the first in Mexico to successfully obtain recognition for
their independent union.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy, according to an ongoing U.S. probe into
Han Young. Today, despite requests from U.S. officials to address
harassment of the Han Young workers, the independent union is still
battling to represent the employees at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement depends on cooperation, and the Mexican
government is not cooperating,'' said Mary Tong, director of the
San Diego-based Support Committee for Maquiladora Workers, one of
the groups that filed the Han Young complaint.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Hernandez and a group of Han Young workers
upset with working conditions and wages as low as $8 a day tried to
organize their independent union. They were foiled, they say, by
the company, which dismissed sympathetic workers and hired and
intimidated new ones. In addition, the Tijuana labor authorities
conducted poorly-run union elections and then refused to recognize
an independent union victory.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote that upheld the independent union's victory was
held after federal government intervention -- and after President
Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo discussed the Han
Young dispute at the urging of U.S. House Democratic Whip David E.
Bonior of Michigan, a NAFTA opponent who has seized on Han Young as
an example of worker abuse in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the independent union, assisted by American labor
activists, filed its complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor.
And in late April, the department issued a diplomatic but
devastating report that criticized Mexico and backed up the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The report challenged Mexican officials' impartiality and
commitment to enforcement of its laws, and found that
government-affiliated unions enjoyed more legal protection than
independent unions. It also recommended that Mexico's labor
secretary meet with U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's initial response was hostile, according to published
reports, with the Mexican Labor Ministry accusing the United States
of taking sides and a Tijuana labor official calling the report ``a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials are silent on the matter now, saying they are
waiting for a second report on health and safety at Han Young to be
issued by the United States before commenting. No meeting between
the labor secretaries has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the request for consultations, the relationship between
the independent union and Tijuana labor officials has deteriorated
further. Police have clashed with pro-union workers, attempting to
break up a strike that a judge declared was legal under Mexican
law. After a government-affiliated union said it wanted to regain
its hold on the factory, officials held two more questionable
elections whose results were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Labor organizer Hernandez had to obtain a court order to prevent
Tijuana authorities from arresting him. Anti-American banners were
hung up at the plant, urging ``gringos'' to stay out of Han Young.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior issued a blunt statement from Washington, accusing Han
Young management, Tijuana labor officials and the Mexican
government of ``a systematic effort to deny Han Young workers their
right to an independent union through harassment, intimidation and
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the outcome of the dispute ``a test for the Mexican
government,'' and warned that it ``could have long-term
implications for U.S. trade policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior also used the Han Young case to defeat President
Clinton's bid for continued ``fast-track'' authority to negotiate
new free-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Young case is so sensitive that Irasema Garza, the
secretary of the office that produced the U.S. report, won't
comment on it other than to say that she is concerned and
monitoring developments.
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. Labor official familiar with the case said despite
the chilly reception from Mexico, the dispute shows how the NAFTA
side agreement is working to pressure Mexico to enforce its own
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That union that is currently struggling (in Tijuana) right now
would not exist were it not for the process,'' said the official,
who asked not to be identified. ``I can't say it any clearer than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Garza said, ``The Mexican government, to be quite
honest with you, has been cautious (about the side agreement). I
think this is not an experience they have enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The second report on Han Young, focusing on alleged health and
safety violations and due to be released before summer's end, could
be even more explosive than the first.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations, if left unaddressed by Mexican officials,
could lead to U.S. trade sanctions against Mexico, including up to
tens of millions of dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The NAFTA countries can only face sanctions if they are found to
have flagrantly violated their own child-labor, health and safety
or minimum-wage laws. There are no provisions for sanctions for
violating the right to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Garza acknowledged that getting to sanctions could take years of
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is designed in such a way to try to convince a
government to do the right thing . . . ,'' she said. ``Ultimately,
that's what this is about. It's not about penalizing governments.
It really is about governments being convinced to enforce their own
labor laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though sanctions are unlikely, Garza defended the NAFTA
side agreement for opening up ``public debate'' in Mexico through
public hearings that have been held to gather testimony on various
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on union organizing in Mexico City, she said, ``the
workers would come up to me and say, 'Miss Garza, this is historic
. . . We don't have access to our government officials like you do
in the United States. This is an opportunity we've never had.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said Mexico, through a new five-year plan, is addressing
problems that have been raised some complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Gualde, who studies maquiladoras at the College of the
Northern Border in Tijuana, said the NAFTA side agreement has
``symbolic import'' and puts companies under pressure to comply
with existing laws or face public criticism, especially bad reviews
in Washington, D.C. and in the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of the substantial change,'' he said, ``has to come
from within Mexico itself.''

   ENVIRONMENTAL INSTITUTIONS CREATED BY NAFTA SIDE AGREEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC)
</P>
<P>
   Based in Montreal, the commission is supposed to review
citizens' complaints that NAFTA countries (Canada, Mexico and the
United States) are not enforcing their environmental laws. The CEC,
however, has no power to sanction a country in response to these
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   North American Development Bank (NADBank)
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Antonio, Texas, the bank is supposed to loan money
to border communities in Mexico and the United States that are
overwhelmed by untreated sewage and insufficient potable water. No
projects have been built yet using bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Border Environmental Cooperation Commission (BECC)
</P>
<P>
   Based in Juarez, Mexico, the commission is supposed to recommend
which water and sewage treatment proposals the NADBank should help
finance. The commission has no purview over toxic waste, which
threatens to hinder sewage treatment plants being built along the
border.

NEWS AT THE CAPITOL VS. GOSSIP IN THE STARR CHAMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans know the important news that comes out
of Washington, and they can distinguish it from the usual
politically motivated junk. The two have been side by side on the
front pages for the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The important news, the powerful news, was the slaying of two
Capitol policemen, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, who died
defending the Capitol against an armed madman.
</P>
<P>
   Next to that was the dumb, yet constitutionally important, news
that President Clinton has been subpoenaed by special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr to testify before a federal grand jury about his sex
life.
</P>
<P>
   We are divided as a nation on Starr and Clinton. We are united
in our love of our democracy and its architectural symbol. We stand
together in respect and grief for the men who died defending us.
</P>
<P>
   Defending us _ there's no other way to put it. That's exactly
what these average family men did for America. Suddenly, we
remember we're a family.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever we think of the politics or personalities of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich or Rep. Tom DeLay, we felt the hurt they felt
over the death of men they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the story of Clinton being subpoenaed to testify about
an alleged extramarital affair seems just plain petty _ except for
the effects it has on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A madman and two heroes have put things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   One week, the president's Secret Service detail had to testify
before Starr's grand jury. The next week two men guarding Congress
were gunned down in the line of duty. One was Republican whip Tom
DeLay's personal bodyguard, who stopped the madman right outside
DeLay's office.
</P>
<P>
   Will presidents wishing a little privacy push the Secret Service
detail back out of earshot where they're useless as a line of
defense? Starr may have the right to call Secret Service agents
before a grand jury, but do we really need to jeopardize public
officials? And just to learn about alleged hanky-panky in the White
House?
</P>
<P>
   I know the question is whether President Clinton asked the young
intern, Monica Lewinsky, to lie about whatever it is they were
supposed to have done.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no, it's not the extramarital affair itself, people say.
It's the president asking someone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that a politician should ask anybody to lie.
They're so good at doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And just roll those words ``extramarital affair'' and ``lie''
around, and see if they don't go together like fries and ketchup _
to put it in terms of another Clintonian appetite.
</P>
<P>
   If this is obstruction of justice, it's not quite in the same
league as Nixon sending a private gang to harass and play dirty
tricks on his political enemies and break into their offices to
steal documents. And then Nixon fired the special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Are we going to drive Clinton from office for messing around
with a young woman? Or will he be tarred as a stonewaller for
resisting a subpoena? That seems to be Starr's aim. I'm not a
Clinton fan at all, but I just don't see it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot more important things in the world, and
sometimes we forget, especially we in the media. We get pretty
carried away with the chase sometimes, especially when the chase is
led by the hounds of gossip. And it seems like everyone is a gossip
hound.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to be driven from office because of what he did
with a female intern, a hundred years from now people will look
back on it with the kind of incomprehension we reserve for
witch-burning or Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now that I think of it, witchcraft and Prohibition may be
making comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   One of America's witchcraft incantations is the word
``security.'' It's right up there with ``closure,'' something it
looks like we'll never get with Starr and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a nation of no safety but plenty of security _
meaning guards, gates and metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Airport security has increased to the point where you have to
arrive at the airport two hours early. You get more high-tech
examinations than your HMO would ever authorize.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anybody can get anything onto a plane if they try. And
planes crash mostly on their own anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most members of Congress, and even members of the
media, have resisted the call for more security at the Capitol. As
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the House delegate from the District of
Columbia, said, ``We can't build security around a maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the security worked. Sadly, it was at great cost, but
the cost could have been higher. Two highly professional policemen
died protecting us and our elected officials. They stopped the
maniac.
</P>
<P>
   We all feel bad for his family, who had to live with his madness
for two decades, and now have to live with the deaths he caused.
They're honest people, and they're so sorry it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are pretty sensible. This is the important thing.
We can only let Ken Starr continue in dubious battle against our
president of doubtful personal morals.
</P>
<P>
   We pay tribute to Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson. They were our
best.

HONORING THE HEROES OF A COLORBLIND SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I went Monday afternoon to see Henry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades ago, he was a railroad porter in this town. Now,
he's a bronze monument in Washington Park.
</P>
<P>
   That monument is all anybody can find of Henry Lincoln Johnson
these days. He committed an act of conspicuous gallantry in France
during World War I. The French honored him with a Croix de Guerre.
But he was a black man, so America ignored him. He died 20 years
later, his heroism only a memory. He was buried in an unmarked
pauper's grave near what's now Albany International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, he lay forgotten. Then the 369th Veterans
Organization, a group of black vets, began pushing to get Henry
Johnson in death the honors denied him in life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there's the monument. There's a street named after him.
There's a posthumous Purple Heart. No Medal of Honor yet, but the
369th is working hard to get that done, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Mr. Johnson,'' I said to the monument, ``what do you
think?''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't answer, of course. But gazing at the bust of the man,
in his doughboy uniform, I wished profoundly that he could. What
would Henry Johnson think about the letter that John Hope Franklin
wrote to President Clinton last week?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we should aspire to a colorblind society is an
impediment to reducing racial stereotyping,'' Franklin wrote.
``Given that research has demonstrated that the best way to reduce
racial stereotyping is to be conscious about racial differences, it
is important to present a thoughtful alternative to the colorblind
society concept.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hope Franklin of Duke University is a distinguished
historian and author. He chairs a presidential panel to advise the
president on racial matters. His letter represented an open
repudiation of one of the best ideas this country ever had _
integration.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. summed up the integrationist credo in
a speech shortly before he was murdered. He said he dreamed of a
time when his children could be judged by the content of their
character rather than the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Medals of Honor were belatedly awarded to
African-American soldiers from World War II. One recipient was Lt.
Johnny Fox, who died in Italy in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   His widow clutched the medal to her chest and said, ``I think
this sends a message ... when a man does his duty, his color isn't
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Fox understood that her husband and others, like Henry
Johnson, had been denied the honors due them precisely because
their race was deemed their most important characteristic _ more
important than their deeds, more important even than their
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans have fought and died in all this country's wars
_ the good wars and the bad ones alike _ because they've been half
of the longest unrequited love affair in the planet's history. They
understood that however unrealized, the American ideal was loyalty
to a magnificent set of egalitarian political principles rather
than preoccupation with accidents of birth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at century's end, with racism at a lower ebb than at any
time in our national history, we have a presidential panel openly
rejecting the goal of a colorblind society.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I don't think that's what Henry Johnson fought for. I
don't think it's what Johnny Fox died for. They did what they did
because they believed that acceptance and inclusion were worth any
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we somehow get past this idea that blood is everything _
that race matters above all other considerations _ then how can we
ever fully accept one another as full-fledged fellow Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Dr. King would have put it, as brothers and sisters with
a common birthright of equality.

CHRISTIANS VS. CHRISTIAN VIRTUES

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The letter was handwritten on nice white
stationery printed with pretty yellow roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you know that being gay causes AIDS?'' it began.
``Didn't you know that being gay is unnatural?''
</P>
<P>
   The writer, from Kentucky, was responding to a column of mine
about televangelist Pat Robertson. He'd predicted that the folks
around Disney World ought to fear hurricanes from God because the
amusement park holds ``Gay Days.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter continued: ``I suppose you think perhaps we should
have a commit adultery day, a steal something today day, etc.
America does need to repent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Robertson is a man of God. I've heard him pray lovely
prayers for sick people to get healed. So quit condemning ministers
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the column did I condemn Robertson _ condemnation is
his specialty _ or criticize him for praying for the sick. Mostly I
pointed out how much money and political clout the man has.
</P>
<P>
   The letter closed: ``I challenge you to read Romans 1:26-32.
Remember God loves us and He knows what is best for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As letters from Bible-touting readers go, this one was pleasant.
While it was typical in its sweeping (and erroneous) quid pro quo _
``Don't you know that being gay causes AIDS?'' _ it was atypical in
its polite language, its brevity and in the absence of my eternal
soul being consigned to hell.
</P>
<P>
   The nastier mail and the more vile phone messages come from
people who identify themselves as ``Christians'' and tell me to
read the Bible. (Or who fill several pages quoting the Bible.) The
usual subject for such a screed is homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the quotes attributed to Jesus in the New Testament, not
one mentions homosexuality. But the issue of ``unnatural use,''
especially of ``males lying with males,'' sure occupies a big
portion of many contemporary Christians' minds.
</P>
<P>
   From the volume and tenor of mail and calls I receive, one would
have to conclude that the incidence of homosexuality in the world
far outranks that of poverty and injustice _ two subjects that
Jesus frequently weighed in on.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many Christians, the writer from Kentucky told me to
read a passage from Paul's letter to the Romans. Although different
translations make every Biblical passage subject to startling
variation, the most common translations of Romans 1:26-32 promise
damnation for women who ``did change their natural use into that
which is against nature'' and men who ``burned in their lust toward
one another; men with men working that which is unseemly.''
</P>
<P>
   As that passage goes on, a lot of people get a haircut _ from
fornicators (listed ahead of murderers) to ``whisperers'' and
``inventors of evil things.'' (How many Christians wrote to the
scientists on the Manhattan Project?)
</P>
<P>
   In his lifetime, Paul wrote several letters that covered many
subjects. Because it distinguished Jews from Gentiles, circumcision
was one of his regular topics.
</P>
<P>
   When he was at his most cosmic and big-picture, Paul was as good
as it gets in the Bible. His mystical-yet-practical treatise on
love (I Corinthians 13) could stand alone, forever, as the credo
for a people committed to peace, understanding, compassion and
service.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul was human and a man of his time. If we believe in the
equal weight of every word that is attributed to him, we must
``beware of dogs'' (Philippians 3:2), remember that ``jesting'' is
a sin (Ephesians 5:4), command slaves to obey their masters ``with
fear and trembling'' (Ephesians 6:5) and accept that it is better
and easier to be near God if one eschews marriage and remains a
virgin (I Corinthians, most of Chapter 7).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the woman-thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Ephesians 5:22 Paul says: ``Wives, submit yourselves unto
your own husbands, as unto the Lord.'' In I Corinthians 11:3-7, he
specifies proper head gear in church. Men: Hats off. Women: Heads
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference? Because ``the head of every man is Christ;
and the head of the woman is the man ... (the man) is the image and
glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are the angry letters from modern Christians about the
scourge of church-going women with uncovered heads?
</P>
<P>
   Jesus had zip to say about hats, veils, wifely submission, dogs,
jesters, virginity vs. marriage or lesbians and gays. What he did
say, over and over, is well put in Matthew 25, when he talks about
Judgment Day and who will be shut out of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It's those who encountered the ``least of my brethren,'' the
sick, naked, hungry, thirsty and imprisoned and _ failing to see in
them the person of Christ _ did nothing for these people.
</P>
<P>
   I challenge all ``Christians'' to read that one _ and live it.
Most of my homosexual friends do.

HELP WANTED: CBS NEEDS GUYS FOR ITS STODGY NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 2)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ CBS should consider changing its slogan from
``The Address is CBS: Welcome Home'' to ``Hey, Guys, We're Over
Here.''
</P>
<P>
   The network is an audience demographics nightmare: old _ 30
percent of its viewers are 65 and older _ with no males. As far as
advertisers are concerned, you couldn't do worse. CBS is
understandably desperate to get men, especially younger
city-dwelling males, to watch its shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly we are going after more males and a more urban
audience this season,'' said CBS network head Leslie Moonves. ``We
need to get younger. This effort is partially based on economics,
partly to provide a broad range of programming for our viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. As Moonves said, the folks at Polident don't go to
Fox with their ad dollars. The trick for a network that is as hip
as, well, Angela Lansbury is to start attracting young men without
alienating its female and older viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five and younger men weren't watching anything on CBS
over the last four years,'' Moonves said. ``We lost that group
almost entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened four years ago? CBS lost its National Football
League package to Fox. The hit the network took was so sharp the
execs were willing to pony up $4 billion over five years to bring
it back. It's no surprise the network's promo for bringing back
football featured the Who song ``Won't Get Fooled Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can underestimate how much the loss of
football had hurt us four years ago,'' Moonves said. ``I think the
values that will happen to the network across the board will be
unbelievable in terms of being a platform for promotion as well as
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Football's real value to the network is serving as a promotional
vehicle for other programs. CBS hopes they will catch ads for the
network's sitcoms and dramas and be inclined to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   The network is trying. ``Martial Law'' will feature Jackie
Chan-like mayhem from famed Hong Kong actor, director and martial
arts expert Sammo Hung. ``Buddy Faro'' will feature Dennis Farina
(``Out of Sight,'' ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the stylish but
brief show ``Crime Story'') as a detective out of circulation for
20 years returning, time encapsulated, to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, returning to the schedule are the Navy lawyer show
``Jag,'' and ``Walker: Texas Ranger,'' both the equivalent of
testosterone in a can. The Hong Kong legend Hung vs. Chuck Norris
could be a fun pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's entire slate of new CBS dramas and comedies did not
survive. And CBS took heat for canceling ``Dr. Quinn: Medicine
Woman'' (which could return next year in the form of a two-hour
movie).
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately it was a decision we had to make,'' Moonves said
of Dr. Quinn. ``This does not mean we are abandoning our loyal,
core audience. CBS continues to serve our female viewers and our
rural audience better than any other network.''
</P>
<P>
   So the network will have shows now for males and well as
females. The question is: Will any of the new or current fare be
able to attract both at the same time? Ray Romano, whose show
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' was worthy of an Emmy nomination it did
not receive, now finds himself in the same bind as the network
after his sitcom was moved from 8:30 to 9 p.m. on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll lose the women to `Ally McBeal' and the men to `Monday
Night Football,''' he said only slightly in jest. ``I don't know
where the audience is.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS does. The question is, will the guys come over.

 IN 1930s, SEATTLE SCRAP STEEL WAS A CASE FOR TRAD SANCTIONS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trade sanctions are not only an issue of the 1990s. Lorraine
McConaghy, historian of Seattle's Museum of History and Industry,
led me to a tale from a far different time: the sale of scrap steel
to Japan in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was reported in the Post-Intelligencer in December
1934, when Japan makes the symbolic move of buying shells from the
old arsenal at Fort Stevens on the Columbia River. The exporter
assures Americans that the shells are ``not being converted into
war material.''
</P>
<P>
   War is already on people's minds. That month, Japan renounces a
treaty restricting the size of its navy. But Japan is also a
longtime trading partner, and the steel shipments continue.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1937, Japan invades China. The same month, a Japanese
group offers to landscape Seattle's Foster Island with five acres
of cherry trees. The offer is not accepted; public sympathy is with
China. But U.S. exports are five times higher to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1937, Seattle's young congressman, Warren Magnuson,
says, ``We should permit Americans to trade with either belligerent
at their own risk.'' It is a common view.
</P>
<P>
   Left-wing groups like the Washington Commonwealth Federation
campaign for an embargo on fascist Japan. Few listen. Many an
American out of work gets pocket money by scrounging old metal.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1938 begins with the Rape of Nanjing. Hitler seizes
Austria. Steel shipments continue.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, 1939, 20 Chinese-American children, whose parents
are mainly cannery workers, begin picketing a Japanese ship at
Astoria. Japan's consul in Portland demands that the children be in
school. When the school board so orders, the children are replaced
by their mothers. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union
honors the pickets and refuses to load 21 railcars of scrap.
</P>
<P>
   The ship owners turn to a federal arbitrator, who rules that the
workers are in violation of their contract. The workers ignore him.
On March 3, Port of Astoria commissioners vote to ban shipments of
scrap to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, a picket is thrown around a Greek ship at Portland.
Again, the longshoremen ignore a federal arbitrator. The employers'
association threatens to close the port. On March 15, Oregon's
governor says the matter will be handled by the State Department,
and asks the pickets to stop.
</P>
<P>
   They do, and the ship is loaded. That day, German troops march
into Prague.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, about 75 picketers stake out a Japanese ship in
Seattle. Work stops. The employers' association calls this ``a pure
breach of contract.'' On March 28, after an appeal by Seattle Mayor
Arthur Langlie to load the ship, and an imminent ruling by a
federal arbitrator, the longshoremen load the ship.
</P>
<P>
   In Astoria, employers sue the port, saying it has no authority
to stop foreign trade. The Port of Seattle's attorney agrees with
them.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, 1939, deputy U.S. marshals serve more than 50
restraining orders on picketers at Pier 91. The orders are on the
petition of Bogle, Bogle &AMP; Gates, attorneys for the United British
Steamship Co. On July 2, longshoremen begin loading a British and a
Danish freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is now on the edge of war. Magnuson has long since
changed his mind about the sale of steel scrap and supports an
embargo bill. Japan threatens to stop buying U.S. cotton if the
bill passes. Roosevelt opposes the bill, and on July 20 it dies in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, 1939, Germany invades Poland, and World War II
officially begins. In April 1940, Germany invades Norway and
Denmark; in May, it invades Holland, Belgium and France. Between
January and August 1940, Washington ports ship 70,898 tons of scrap
steel to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 26, 1940, in response to Japanese actions in Indochina,
Roosevelt declares an embargo on scrap steel, effective Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, the Post-Intelligencer reports that rails from
Seattle's streetcar lines are being loaded on the Hie Maru. Mayor
Langlie, who is running for governor as a Republican, asks Customs
to stop the ship. Magnuson, a Democrat, jeers at Langlie's
negligence. The Seattle City Council asks for federal intervention.
The ship sails.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's embargo does not include melted scrap. Three days
before Christmas, a Japanese ship loads at least 10 cars of ingots
at Pier 91 _ a sale from Colorado Fuel &AMP; Iron Corp. to Mitsui &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   It is the end. A year later America is attacked at Pearl Harbor.
Schoolchildren are soon encouraged to collect scrap for the war
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a case for sanctions. Not many make the cut, but
that one does.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROUTS NECK, Maine _ Half of the people who summer in Prouts
Neck (and ``summer'' is most decidedly a verb in these parts) do so
because their mother and father summered in Prouts Neck, and in
many cases because their grandmother and grandfather summered in
Prouts Neck. The other half summer here because they are lucky
enough to have married into a Prouts Neck family.
</P>
<P>
   Take Cambridge (Mass.) District Court Judge George R. Sprague,
of Boston and Prouts Neck. Sprague concedes that it is his wife
Lee's family that is responsible for the beautiful old wood frame
``cottage'' overlooking the sea and Cape Elizabeth. In a typical
Prouts Neck geneological explanation of its provenance, Lee Sprague
says, ``This house was my grandmother's second husband's first
wife's family _ the May family _ which bought it in 1888. Rosamond
May married Boston lawyer Frank White and when she died in 1940,
she left it to him. He married my grandmother Florence Thorndike,
who lived here with her staff until 1968. In 1968 she had a stroke
and in 1969 we rented the house from her. We moved here permanently
(for the summer) in the summer of 1970.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which makes us relative newcomers,'' says George Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   The house, with its dark wood interior walls, antique furniture,
bright chintz upholstery, and old photos and maps and histories of
the area on the walls and in the bookshelves, is a treasure. The
few changes the Spragues have made have been to add decks for more
spectacular views of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Change is exactly what this enclave in the middle of Scarborough
does not want. It is set apart from the rest of the town by the
configuration of land, which juts out from the coastline and
encompasses about 150 acres. A walk around the neck, a very popular
evening activity, takes about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prouts Neck is also set apart because half its 400 residents
have summered here all their lives. There are a hundred cottages,
half of them owned by Bostonians, the rest owned by residents of
New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Texas, and, in one case,
San Francisco (the husband grew up here).
</P>
<P>
   Traditions rule in this community named after Timothy Prout, a
farmer, and the first tradition is that there is never, ever, an
apostrophe in the word Prouts. Don't ask why.
</P>
<P>
   The second tradition is that there shall be lobster cookouts at
the yacht club on Memorial Day and Columbus Day, and there shall be
fish chowder lunches at the yacht club on the Fourth of July, the
first weekend in August, and Labor Day. At the latter, participants
are served _ without variation _ chowder in the club's collection
of old pots, with a chowder cracker on the bottom and a sticky
doughnut on the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition also dictates that Sunday evenings are for picnicking
``on the rocks'' overlooking the ocean, followed by a community
sing-along at the yacht club that begins at 8:15 p.m. and finishes
at 9:30 precisely. Charles ``Chip'' Homer Willauer, an interior
designer in Boston in winter, has directed the sing-along every
Sunday for 42 years with the exception of July 12, when he had
bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   It was Willauer's grandfather who started the sing-along during
World War II, when the village fathers were trying to keep
everyone's blackout shades down for protection from enemy
submarines. ``The elders thought it might be pleasant to gather
everyone in one place which had shades _ back then it was the
country club _ and that they might as well sing while they remained
there,'' Willauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The sing has attracted participants from 2 to 80 and is such a
tradition that villagers published a Prouts Neck song book, and
everyone has a copy. It includes Stephen Foster songs and camp
songs and even an original written by a committee of neighbors,
``The Prouts Neck Song'': ``The atmosphere we love, it's Prouts
we're singing of. The friends we make we'll not forsake the fun
from Prouts Neck Shore''
</P>
<P>
   The Prouts Neck sing-along stopped, briefly, when Willauer's
grandfather suffered a heart attack in 1952, ``but in 1955, a
friend started them up again in his memory,'' notes Willauer.
</P>
<P>
   Willauer, who says ``I have spent every summer of my life in
Prouts Neck, and I'm 60 years old,'' also is president of the
Prouts Neck Association, which calls itself a ``village improvement
society'' and administers such matters as trash collection and
develops guidelines to keep the ``simple little community,'' as he
terms it, simple. He doesn't belong to the country club ``because I
don't play golf or tennis,'' but joined the yacht club because he
likes to sail. The clubs are private and exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you rent a cottage doesn't give you access to the
community,'' warns Willauer. However, the 100 guests staying at the
Black Point Inn, which sits at the entrance to the neck, are
invited to use the golf and tennis facilities of the country club.
</P>
<P>
   It's Willauer's middle name that connects him, and a score of
Prouts Neck residents, to the community's most famous son. Winslow
Homer, the landscape and marine painter, lived and worked in Prouts
Neck from 1884 until his death in 1910, and if you don't bump into
one of his descendants while walking around the point, you're sure
to bump into someone whose relative at least had him to dinner.
They'll tell you the painter wasn't always wealthy, and he used to
give gifts of a painting to his hostess. A generous gift,
considering the recent news that Microsoft owner Bill Gates
purchased Homer's painting ``Lost on the Grand Banks,'' for $30
million.

 &HT;        AMTRAK REPORTS RISE IN RIDERSHIP
 &HT;        By Jason Lakin
 &HT;       c. 1998 States News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON, July 29 -- Amtrak ridership is up 6.2 percent
over last year at this time, leaders of the federally subsidized
rail line announced Wednesday during the first meeting of its
infant Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your ridership up, your on-time performance up and a
newfound love of railroads in America,'' said Tommy Thompson,
Wisconsin's Republican governor and a board member. ``I think
you're on the dawn of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's revenues are also $12.7 million higher for the current
fiscal year than had been projected, while on-time performance has
improved to 79.6 percent for the year, up from 75.9 percent at this
point last year.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, one of four board
members, attributed Amtrak's success in part to legislation passed
last year by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the third quarter results, and look to
Amtrak as a vital element in our 21st-century transportation
system,'' Slater said. ``Last December, President Clinton signed
the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 that provided
Amtrak with the three things it needed to succeed: freedom to
operate like a business, financial resources necessary to rebuild a
railroad, and partnership with its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Thompson and Slater, the meeting's board members
include former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, the 1988
Democratic presidential nominee, and John Robert Smith, mayor of
Meridian, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis anticipated a successful kickoff of the Northeast
Corridor project, a high-speed rail line set to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Northeast Corridor, the kind of capital investment
Congress has been kind enough to provide is going to create
enormous new revenue,'' Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that the board will unveil more plans for
expansion soon, but he did not specify a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of plans going on right now,'' Thompson said.
``We're going to be revealing a Midwest plan. We have to go to
Congress and get that clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, created by Congress in 1971, has a payroll of 23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers threatened earlier this year to take Amtrak subsidies
away, but instead reshuffled the organization, with a goal of
making the company self-sufficient by 2002. Last April, Congress
passed a budget resolution affirming that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing ridership and improving financial performance show
that Amtrak is on the right track to improve service, modernize its
business and strengthen passenger rail service,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress reformed Amtrak's board of directors,
reducing its size from nine members to seven. Three of those seats
currently are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's transportation secretary holds a permanent seat on
the board.

AT THE END, `NEGOTIATOR' FUMBLES THE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE NEGOTIATOR 
Directed by: F. Gary Gray 
Screenplay by: James DeMonaco, Kevin Fox 
Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, David Morse, Ron Rifkin,
John Spencer, J.T. Walsh 
Running time: 138 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hostage negotiations, almost by definition, are ordeals. So are
movies about them. ``The Negotiatior'' is probably as good a
slicked-up Hollywood version as we're likely to get. Certainly, it
helps that Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey are on hand to play
Chicago's No.1 and No.2 police negotiators, respectively. The
gimmick is that Jackson is framed for the murder of a fellow cop
and the theft of millions from the police disability fund, forces
the situation, and finds himself on the receiving end of the
expertise he's so good at dishing out.
</P>
<P>
   Real negotiations are low key and deliberate, the idea being not
to detonate any fireworks. But movies about them are invariably
punched up with commando raids, countdowns with guns held to
hostages' heads and tense faceoffs. ``The Negotiator'' is good up
to the point where it begins to resort inordinately to these
cattle-prod devices. Jackson brings dignity and depth to what could
have been the completely stereotyped figure of the framed cop, and
does much to humanize the cop's anguish and anger, until, of
course, the producers cave in and pile on the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey's way of finding humor in unlikely places continues with
the way we're introduced to his cop, trying to negotiate his wife
out of their bedroom, into which she has locked herself because
their preteen daughter made her feel bad. But excursions into the
offbeat end quickly as Spacey's pro rushes to the the siege
downtown and begins playing cat and mouse with Jackson's reluctant
but desperate hostage-taker, who figures the only way he can
exonerate himself and avoid being assassinated by a police
sharpshooter on the side of the bad guys is to force the truth out
of Internal Affairs and the larcenous precinct house colleagues who
want him dead.
</P>
<P>
   As sniper and commando squads move into position, Jackson's
embattled suspect knows his only chance of succeeding is to
convince Spacey's honest cop to help him find the evidence that
will prove Jackson innocent and nail the real heavies. This
undercuts the mostly phoned-in duel of wits, which is the film's
most interesting aspect, partly because Jackson's expert knows all
the mind games that are being used against him, partly because
Spacey convinces us his character is nimble-minded and
unpredictable enough to know when not to play by the book.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting hot and cool styles of Jackson and Spacey,
respectively, keep ``The Negotiator'' watchable up to a point. But
then the bullets and explosions and deterministic plotting take
over and shove ``The Negotiator'' from intelligent thriller into
Hollywood formula dumbness, negating the fresh spin the two actors
had managed to put on their otherwise virtually nonexistent
characters. The louder and more frantic ``The Negotiator'' gets,
the more shallow it seems until, by the end, the movie nullifies
the visual interest of its well-used Chicago locales and snatches
preposterousness from the jaws of gritty credibility.

 PROUTS NECK, Maine: ... for $30 Million.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winslow Homer's nephew Charles Lowell Homer was Willauer's
grandfather, and he deeded the modest house and studio, the latter
called ``the factory,'' to Willauer. It is now a registered
landmark and museum, filled with reproductions only, and run
informally by Willauer and whomever happens to be renting the house
for the summer. Down a short path from the studio is Cannon Rock,
from which Homer painted many of his sea scenes.
</P>
<P>
   While Prouts Neck can't strictly be called a gated community
because there is no sentry on duty at the entrance, there is a gate
to the ``hard neck'' part of the colony; the ``soft neck'' is just
outside the gate, where all the roads run down to the beach. The
joke about the gate, according to Sprague, is that every handyman
in Scarborough knows its combination. What most people feel about
the gate, according to Willauer, is that ``it keeps the crowds from
Portland away from the private beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Prouts is contained because of the configuration of the land and
limited space. There are only a few lots left on which to build,
and it's extremely rare for a family house to go up for sale
because most are passed down. More families now rent their cottages
for part of the summer because assessments changed in the early
1990s, pushing waterfront property six or seven times higher in
value, and raising taxes on the average to about $7,500. Land alone
here is now worth about $600,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the overwhelming thing about this place is that it's
not like Southampton, it's not glitzy,'' says Sprague. ``Its just
low-key and family. Our kids feel more at home here than they do
wherever they lived in the winters.'' Sprague says when he's in
Prouts Neck he likes to spend his time ``sailing and
decompressing'' rather than socializing. Referring to the change of
renters and family members from one month to the next, he said ``I
see the July people at one party in July and the August people at
one in August. And we'll give a party or two as well. That's it.''
His wife is the village fire commissioner, which means she keeps a
hand-held siren in her red 1973 Cadillac convertible, and must give
a report to the town and post ``No Outside Burning'' warnings in
times of extreme dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   James Rose, a lawyer retired from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in Washington, grew up in Manhattan and summered
in Maine. ``Prouts Neck was a place to explore the outdoors, meet
kids from other communities, bike anywhere we needed to go, and be
far more on our own that we could have in Manhattan,'' he says.
``What is very significant about Prouts Neck is that many people
today don't live in the community where they grew up. A community
like Prouts Neck is the only place where your children know
everyone and everyone knows them.'' His grandfather built the
summer home in 1911 and Rose now shares it with his sister's
family; he's here in July and she's here in August. Rose was told
by his mother that Winslow Homer presented her with a gardenia when
her mother had the painter to dinner. His parents were married here
in 1925 and his daughter will be married here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Prouts Neck children are often baptized here rather than in
their winter towns. The lovely old shingled St. James Episcopal
Church is open only in summer, but Willauer says it is a vital part
of Prouts Neck childrens' lives. The beloved Rev. Charles Newbery,
he says, runs a lively ``semi-unruly'' service designed to keep
children interested. It is so popular that, with the congestion of
parked bicycles and cars around the church, ``you couldn't drive an
ambulance through that street on Sunday.'' It's also an important
part, many residents say, of their religious training. Like most of
the cottages here, though, it's not winterized, and early in the
season, if the church hasn't been warm for long, there's a chance
that the 100-plus-year-old organ may not work.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the tiny Charles E. Thomas Memorial Library, named
after the man whose home it once was. In the center of Prouts Neck
is 25 acres of open space, given to the village by Winslow Homer
and one of his brothers, named Charles Lowell Homer just as was his
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Socially, the children usually meet each other as
``periwinkles,'' the 3- and 4-year-olds who spend their summers at
the yacht club beach, and go on to become ``sea fleas'' as 4- and
5-year-olds learning to sail. As teens, they used to dance at the
country club, but more recently the dances were moved to the more
casual yacht club because, in one of the more wrenching changes in
the community in perhaps 100 years, it was decided that young
people today simply will not dress up enough in the summer for the
country club's dress rules.
</P>
<P>
   And if they live elsewhere 42 weeks of the year, this still is
where Prouts people bring fiances and fiancees to meet the
community, where they hold their weddings, and sadly, sometimes,
their funerals. When the Spragues' 30-year-old daughter Lucy, a law
student, was murdered in Chicago in December 1996, it was here, in
the memorial garden behind the church, where her ashes were buried
the following summer, while members of the village sang one of her
favorite songs from the song book, ``Waltzing Matilda.''
</P>
<P>
   The final tradition of each Prouts summer actually happens in
fall, when many villagers return for the Columbus Day weekend.
Then, Doris Homer, octogenarian widow of Winslow Homer's nephew
Charles (Winslow Homer remained a bachelor throughout his life) and
unofficial tour guide of the studio, gives her huge cocktail party
and serves ``Daddy Homer Punch.'' Made from the recipe of Arthur
Homer, the third of the three Homer brothers, it is a combination
of rum, tea, sugar and oranges. Sprague calls it ``lethal,'' and
says ``the judge doesn't drive on that day. Three cups of it and
you're history.''

US BASKETBALL HAS NO STARS _ OR A GUARANTEED WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ You think we can drop the Dream Team bit now?
</P>
<P>
   There was really only one Dream Team, anyhow, but now that we've
got Wendell Alexis, Brad Miller, and David Wood representing the
USA instead of Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, and Vin Baker, it's
reasonably safe to say that the only dreams being fulfilled here at
the 13th World Basketball Championships will be those of the
countries who can now once again fantasize about winning a gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was better competition for the other teams when the NBA
players were coming,'' observes Sarunas Marciulonis, the superb
Lithunanian guard who has advanced from the playing to the
executive ranks in his native land. ``But now it is possible to win
a gold.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is likewise possible to win a silver or a bronze. In the
last three high-level international basketball competitions _ the
1992 Olympics, the '94 worlds in Toronto, and the '96 Olympics _ it
was well understood that the gold was simply not available. Now the
likes of Argentina, Australia, and host Greece are feeling better
about the whole thing. They can start thinking seriously about
standing on a podium when the tournament draws to a close a week
from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatable,'' explains Donn Nelson, son of Don and once again an
assistant with the Lithuanian team. ``That's what people are saying
about the American team _ beatable.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, who are these guys, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bunch of hardworking guys who are really proud to be
representing their country,'' says coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who
spikes rumors that he had misgivings about remaining as coach once
the NBA players pulled out because of the lockout. ``There was
never a question in my mind. What I did was offer the USA
Basketball people (the choice) to get a college coach if the entire
team would be comprised of college players. They said it would not
be an all-college team, and so here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T talks about the playmaking of ex-Celtic Michael Hawkins,
the shooting and veteran leadership of Wendell Alexis, the inside
banging of 6-foot-6-inch Jason Sasser and 6-7 Ashraf Amaya, the
feistiness of Wood, and the surprising inside finesse of 6-11 Brad
Miller. ``I'll be playing all 12 men,'' he vows.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot at stake here for the Red, White, and Blue, who
will open play against Brazil this afternoon. Should the Yanks fail
to bring home the gold, the USA will be placed in the aggravating,
and possibly even dangerous, position of being forced to qualify
for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. It is assumed that said
qualification will be held at a time horribly inconvenient for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never talk about that,'' Rudy T insists.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long, long time since the USA has sent such a weird
team into a basketball tournament of this magnitude. We had gotten
used to sending out our best young players. Then came the Dream
Team business in 1992, at which point it was understood that
henceforth, the United States would submit only the creme de la
creme in these competitions. That would have been the case here,
too, but for the intervention of NBA politics.
</P>
<P>
   And so the movers and shakers at USA Basketball have turned the
goo-goo eyes to a fascinating collection of CBA players, assorted
European-oriented expatriates, and a pair of college types in
Miller and Trajan Langdon. They are asking Tomjanovich to make a
smooth basketball team out of The Best Of The Rest of American
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   No one is really happy about this, even if their medal
possibilities have improved. ``I don'think anyone really
understands why the NBA players aren't here,'' says veteran
Australian broadcaster Phil Lynch, who will be covering his third
world championships. ``It takes the gloss off the tournament. I
think they all want to compete against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help matters that another world power comes here
similarly stripped of its marquee players. Vlade Divac, who has
been playing year round for a decade, is using the excuse of the
NBA lockout to stay away from this event. The Yugoslavians are also
here without former NBA player Predrag Danilovic and veteran guard
Aleksandar Djordjevic. With these players, they would have been the
overwhelming favorites. ``It would have been Yugoslavia and draw a
line,'' says Nelson. Now they are only one of many medal
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at FIBA (the international basketball governing body,
of which USA Basketball is a member), not to mention the local
organizers, were horrified when the NBA players bailed out of this
tournament. FIBA secretary general Borislav Stankovic is the man
most responsible for the introduction of NBA players into this kind
of international competetion. He was rather looking forward to
seeing Gary Payton here, not that he has anything against Hawkins.
And then there are the Greek officials, who were counting on the
Americans to sell some tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our official position,'' says FIBA executive Marcos Beltra,
``is that we have 16 teams here and we cannot base the success of
the event on the presence of one team, or should I say the
composition of one team. And we hear that the American team is
actually pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love international diplomacy?
</P>
<P>
   As far as the box office is concerned, the ultimate financial
success of the tournament will depend on the fortunes of the Greek
team. Greece is the lone European country of note in which it can
truthfully be said that basketball is actually more popular than
football (i.e., soccer). The fanaticism of the Greek fans is the
stuff of international legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lucky to have this event in Athens,'' concedes Beltra.
``The Greek people love basketball and they are very
enthusiastically nationalistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that the Greek national team is in
transition. The Greeks have had better squads. They will more than
likely need all the vocalizing and flag-waving they can get.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans won't be getting any help. NBC and Turner have
bailed on them. The prospective American press corps has been
whittled by about 95 percent. You probably didn't even know they
were here.
</P>
<P>
   But they are. For better or worse, they are indeed here. ``You
know what they say,'' Nelson points out. ``Wounded dogs fight
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. ``There will be a lot of emotion and drama here,''
says Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   So light a candle. Place a bet. Help these guys out. You may not
know who these guys are, but if you like basketball, they're all
you've got.

 &HT;        AMTRAK REPORTS RISE IN RIDERSHIP
 &HT;        By Jason Lakin
 &HT;       c. 1998 States News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON, July 29 -- Amtrak ridership is up 6.2 percent
over last year at this time, leaders of the federally subsidized
rail line announced Wednesday during the first meeting of its
infant Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have your ridership up, your on-time performance up and a
newfound love of railroads in America,'' said Tommy Thompson,
Wisconsin's Republican governor and a board member. ``I think
you're on the dawn of a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's revenues are also $12.7 million higher for the current
fiscal year than had been projected, while on-time performance has
improved to 79.6 percent for the year, up from 75.9 percent at this
point last year.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, one of four board
members, attributed Amtrak's success in part to legislation passed
last year by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the third quarter results, and look to
Amtrak as a vital element in our 21st-century transportation
system,'' Slater said. ``Last December, President Clinton signed
the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 that provided
Amtrak with the three things it needed to succeed: freedom to
operate like a business, financial resources necessary to rebuild a
railroad, and partnership with its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Thompson and Slater, the meeting's board members
include former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, the 1988
Democratic presidential nominee, and John Robert Smith, mayor of
Meridian, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis anticipated a successful kickoff of the Northeast
Corridor project, a high-speed rail line set to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Northeast Corridor, the kind of capital investment
Congress has been kind enough to provide is going to create
enormous new revenue,'' Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that the board will unveil more plans for
expansion soon, but he did not specify a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of plans going on right now,'' Thompson said.
``We're going to be revealing a Midwest plan. We have to go to
Congress and get that clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, created by Congress in 1971, has a payroll of 23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers threatened earlier this year to take Amtrak subsidies
away, but instead reshuffled the organization, with a goal of
making the company self-sufficient by 2002. Last April, Congress
passed a budget resolution affirming that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing ridership and improving financial performance show
that Amtrak is on the right track to improve service, modernize its
business and strengthen passenger rail service,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress reformed Amtrak's board of directors,
reducing its size from nine members to seven. Three of those seats
currently are vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's transportation secretary holds a permanent seat on
the board.

ON A COMMUNITY FARM, NUNS HAPPILY REAP WHAT THEY SOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAINVILLE, Mass. _ The smell of potato bread just pulled from
the oven wafted through the old rambling farmhouse. Outside, along
the gently sloping hill, a farmer was pulling weeds from the ground
as the season's first melons pushed up through the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Barbara Harrington, dressed in blue jeans, a gray
T-shirt, and running shoes, stood smiling by the antique wood
stove. It was the beginning of another glorious day at Crystal
Springs, a 40-acre spread that three nuns have turned into a sacred
celebration of the earth and its bounties.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Springs was created out of the nuns' belief that earth
is the primary revelation of the divine. And food the land provides
is what binds people and the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the project is a community farm carved out of
one acre of the parcel once owned by a 19th century sea captain.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 families from surrounding communities paid $525 for a
``share'' in the farm tended by Jean Claude Bourrut, a native of
France with years of experience in organic farming. In return, each
family receives a weekly harvest of lettuce, potatos, peppers,
tomatoes, and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Harrington said, is to teach people to ``learn to live
in place, to learn to embrace the land they live on and what it
offers.'' The farm, she said, is an alternative means of providing
food in a society in which most people get their groceries from
antiseptic megasupermarkets where the produce may travels hundreds
or thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Community farms, Harrington said, are becoming increasingly
popular across the country among those interested in promoting
locally-grown products and in strengthening the connection between
humans and the food they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Several women's religious congregations have started community
farms, including the Kentucky Dominican Sisters, who have converted
Crystal Springs into a center for ecology, spirituality, and earth
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can learn to not just eat healthily but in a way
that reverences the land, the soil, then maybe we can better
appreciate that all this has been laid down as an endowment for the
nurturing of all life,'' said Harrington, pointing toward the field
overflowing with kale, Swiss chard, eggplant, and zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Springs has been in the hands of the Kentucky Dominican
Sisters for nearly 50 years, after it was donated to them by a
family out of gratitude to the nuns for taking care of a daughter
with Down syndrome. The farm has undergone several metamorphases.
It has been a training center for women preparing to become
Dominican sisters, a Catholic school, and a home for retired nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington lives at the farm with Sisters Carole Rossi and Chris
Loughlin. Trading in their religious habits for farmer's overalls,
the woman have embraced a much different way of living. ``We
decided a few years ago that our mission, our charisma was pushing
us toward the notion of earth literacy,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The three women still have other jobs. Harrington does
administrative work at the Kentucky Sisters local headquarters in
Watertown. Loughlin does individual and group spiritual counseling,
and Rossi is the Roman Catholic counselor at Harvard Divinity
School.
</P>
<P>
   Education has always been at the heart of the Kentucky Sisters,
which is celebrating its 175th ann

$800   PER   WEEK FOR A NANNY JOB? THANKS, BUT NO THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   News that wealthy New York City parents are hijacking nannies
from the slightly less-rich for weekly salaries of $800 plus
benefits landed in my household with sudden impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``About time,'' sniffed the adult parent who considers herself
the ``primary caregiver,'' as it's termed these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' murmured the other adult parent, who considers himself
lucky if he can weasel out of most of the many and varied chores
that go with caregiving, especially if the care-receiver does not
want that particular type of care delivered at that particular
time.
</P>
<P>
   I run into that a lot these days. It's still rude shock to a
well-intended duffer of a dad to discover that the wisdom I
accumulated over generations concerning high finance, low behavior,
driving to survive, the value of a good night's sleep, and a diet
that tosses in a few green vegetables along with the marshmallows
is so widely scorned.
</P>
<P>
   But ears perked up at the notion of 800 smackers-cum-benefits
for dealing with someone else's kid or kids. If this is a trend, I
want to know more. I am not making this up. Yes, there are those,
even under my roof, who snicker that I could not spot a trend
unless it backed into my pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take my word for the nanny price war: It's right there in
The New York Times, an outfit that lands on a trend like a load of
sheetrock coming off the top rack at Home Depot. A woman whose
other job was described as a human rights spokeswoman complained
that her nanny left her employ at a ``rather princely'' $550 a week
for the $800 down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, lady; it's called capitalism. Market forces at work. Going
for the gold is not only a human right, it's a human habit. Adam
Smith (the real one) would be proud. Come to think of it, was Adam
a primary caregiver on the domestic front? Did Mrs. Smith do the
grunt work with the little Smithies? Or was there a nanny in the
picture? Probably the latter. I'm guessing, but two shillings a
week and one hour off every other Sunday sounds right for the
times.
</P>
<P>
   Some irate feminists will probably burst into a capella harmony
about how child-rearing was always underpaid labor, that the oafish
males who supposedly run things planned it this way all along, and
that even things like starting times for elementary school are
designed to keep mothers pinned between the breakfast table and the
car pool line, while men rush from the sports section over coffee
to a tee time blessedly free of female golfers. How do they spell
that, anyway: Is it soccer moms, or sucker moms, that do all that
driving?
</P>
<P>
   I am familiar with arguments, if not the spelling. I merely
raise the point to suggest that if nanny work is made more
remunerative, then males will perforce begin to reassess. I know a
lot of guys who do hard work for less money that eight hundred per.
You know them, too, or at least you see them.
</P>
<P>
   They are up on the rooftops, carrying shingles or spreading tar.
They are lugging trash, breaking down tires off dirty rims in auto
shops, welding angle irons in places that are dark, dirty, and
extremely hard to get at.
</P>
<P>
   Would these gents make good nannies? Some would, some wouldn't.
Just like women. But being a nanny is good indoor work. Getting
cold, wet, or dirty is not part of the deal, as a rule. And it's
only a short hop from being, say, a house-husband to a role as paid
professional child-carer. I dimly recall some TV series have used
the role as a takeoff point for a sitcom. (Memo to the deep
thinkers at the Times: Keep an eye peeled for roofers, sanitation
men, or welders job-shifting into nannyhood _ I think it could be a
trend.)
</P>
<P>
   Not to mislead you; no way I'd be good at the nanny thing. It
requires feats of organization and patience that would defeat me. I
figure my DNA track was laid down eons ago, when the first caveman
decided to take his chances with the woolly mammoth over the next
hill rather than argue with his 15-year-old over who had to wash
the rock they used to beat the dinner roots.
</P>
<P>
   My kitchen work for kids is, beyond Spaghetti-Os, nonexistent.
Infants I can handle with no problem. Little kids I love. My
favorite people are 2 1/2-year-olds, on average. The only problem
with little kids is that they become big kids. I am all for kids,
of course; hard not to be. But I warm up to them a bit more again
when they hit their mid-20s. It's those middle years, starting
around 11, when all the important lessons I have learned about
things like bicycle helmets and seat belts, turn out to be the
starting point for disputation.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot list for you even three arguments I ever won with a kid
over 11 or under, say, 24. I'm always stymied by the killer
riposte, such as: ``Well, did you wear a seat belt/bike helmet when
you were a kid?''
</P>
<P>
   When I stammer that, uhh, no, I don't think we even had seat
belts or bike helmets when I was a kid, but statistics do show blah
blah blah, then I get the bitter smirk, the knowing smile, the old
trapped-you-again grin. So obviously a man who cannot win even
three arguments with three different kids over three decades of
being a nonprimary caregiver is a lousy candidate for $800-per-week
nannying. There are plenty of guys who'd do a bang-up job; just
count me out.

THE SKINNY ON SKIN-TRADE SCIONS; STEM TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news, everyone: Hugh Hefner, the ultimate hepcat, is on the
prowl again. He's been quoted endlessly that his marriage to
Kimberly Conrad nine years ago _ his first monogamous relationship
_ would be the final chapter in his singular life, but now, as we
learn in two magazines, comes Hef, ``the epilogue.''
</P>
<P>
   First he's in the August  &UR; Esquire &LR; , being given the Bill Zehme
reverential star treatment, and why not? He's the ``most famous
magazine editor in the history of the world,'' and that's just his
day job. He's the envy of generations, a regular guy who grew up to
be rich, famous, and the lover of hundreds of the world's most
beautiful women. (His estimate: about a thousand.) He has great
houses, he goes to work in his bathrobe, and everyone wants to be
his friend. Even at 72, back in the clubs since he and his
``Kimberella'' separated, Gen-Xers bow, and flock: ``You're the
man!'' ``You're the god!'' ``You rule!''
</P>
<P>
   Then in  &UR; Gear &LR; , an Esquire/GQ pretender that debuts on
newsstands Tuesday, we meet a slightly more contemplative Hefner,
interviewed in question-and-answer format by none other than its
editor and publisher, Bob Guccione Jr., scion of the Penthouse
empire, the most successful of the post-Playboy permutations.
</P>
<P>
   It is further proof that if you think you've seen everything,
just wait a minute. For better than three decades, they've been
foremost foes of the skin trade, and now, here is Hefner helping
his staunchest competitor sends its newest babe into the world. It
is an act that says that Hefner fears no rival.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a damn good article more enlightening than what Esquire
offers, that's not all he says:
</P>
<P>
   _On Viagra: It's ``a good deal more than simply giving an
erection. ... They'll never sell it that way, but it's a
recreational drug. It's everything that has been touted, and more.
I mean you can go all night.''
</P>
<P>
   _On monogamy: ``I don't think it's terribly necessary, and there
doesn't seem to be a whole lot of it around anymore. We live in a
kind of sequential polygamy, we go from relationship to
relationship, and some of them overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are his remembrances of Gloria Steinem, the
feminist icon who helped make her mark in publishing by entering
the Playboy bunny academy under cover, so to speak, and then
writing about it for Show magazine. He says that Harvey Kurtzman,
the founder of Mad magazine, tried to fix them up, though they
never got together, albeit not for lack of trying. He says Steinem
could ``in her personal life wind guys around her finger. That was
the kind of lady she was, a wheeler and dealer, who used her
physical attractiveness to a great effect. ... She could be
begrudging even when she was a party girl. She led a very active
sexual life, and, uh, more power to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's word this month from the elder Guccioni as
well, albeit in the far lower profile  &UR; Las Vegas magazine &LR; . He
talks to Carolyn Hamilton Proctor about his first love, painting.
He says he went to Europe in 1949 intent on being an artist, and he
was for a time; his first subjects were Roman prostitutes, because,
he says, ``they were always so flattered that somebody wanted to
paint them.'' But then came Playboy, and the rest is derivative
history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his success with Penthouse caused him to put aside
his paints for 30 years, he expresses no regrets. ``It has enabled
me to make significant changes in our culture,'' he says. He
believes, the article says, that ``Penthouse is responsible, more
than any other single publication in this country, for `the
progress that has been made toward freeing people from their senses
of guilt and fear with the association to their own sexuality.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such pomposity, even as he acknowledges that he got the idea for
Penthouse from Playboy, lays bare the fact that though Hefner is
secure in his legacy, Guccioni is still chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIT's  &UR; Technology Review  &LR; is out with its second issue since a
redesign and refocus, and it provides terrific reading, beginning
with the letters to the editor. Twenty-one letters address the
changes in the once-staid magazine, and reaction is split on
predictable lines: A typical naysayer accuses TR of abandoning the
``commitment to the advancement of technology for the betterment of
mankind as a whole.'' Supporters who got published seem to like
everything, especially the new look.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief reason to pick up this issue is associate editor
Antonio Regalado's interesting, illuminating, and important cover
story about the hunt for the human embryonic stem cell. They are in
each of us at the very beginning of creation, before developing
into tissue, or blood, or the other cells in our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: They could provide ``the ability to grow
replacement human tissue at will,'' to be a ``factory-in-a-dish''
to cure whatever ails.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: They could be the realization of a Frankenstein
monster, the route to a genetically engineered race.
</P>
<P>
   The worse news: The two sources for the raw material of this
research are embryos and aborted fetuses. Because of fierce
opposition from right-to-life groups and others, which is partly
why government funding for such activity is banned, all the
research is going on without the usual sharing of data, behind
closed corporate doors, without public oversight.
</P>
<P>
   This means that in this life-altering field, we depend entirely
on the ethics of corporate greed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the current  &UR; LinguaFranca  &LR; also offers an issue
devoted to technology. Particularly entertaining is Caleb Crain's
tale of Donald Foster, the ``forensic linguist'' who many consider
to be the first scholar to have added to the Shakespeare canon
since the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a learned man who loves the Bard, he accomplished
this feat not with a finely attuned aesthetic, but with computers.
He says that we all speak and write with predictable, recognizable
patterns, and that some of them are beneath our editing radar, such
as the uses of ``the'' and ``that.'' And he says they are as
reliable as fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   His record would seem to back him up. He's the guy who unmasked
Joe Klein as the author of ``Primary Colors,'' and he helped
convict Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber (the defense brought him in
hoping his research on Kaczynski's manifesto would aid their cause,
but after examining it, he joined the opposition).
</P>
<P>
   A number of American Shakespeare editions now include the
disputed work, ``A Funerall Elegye,'' but it's not in the Oxford
yet. The rationale for keeping it out is that the elegy is awful,
``tedious in a very unShakespeare way,'' one objector says.

AMERICA WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE LOCKED DOWN AND SHUT TIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we go again: another horrendous act of senseless violence,
another hysterical surge of ``security'' improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's shooting at the U.S. Capitol was caused by a lunatic
bent on mayhem, not by a lack of security. Russell E. Weston Jr.
was able to breach the Capitol's security because he cared nothing
for his own safety and because he was willing to gun down anyone
who got in his way.
</P>
<P>
   A security system might be devised to fend off such an
individual _ but it wouldn't be a system that citizens of a great
democracy would welcome in a cherished public building. As
concerned as they are about occasional outbreaks of random violence
in this country, the American people are surely not inclined to
sacrifice even more freedom in continued pursuit of the illusion
that they are safer.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what most of these increasingly cumbersome security
measures add up to _ the illusion of public safety. We can install
metal detectors, X-ray machines, bomb scanners and who knows what
else in hopes of shielding ourselves from trouble, but the sad fact
is that none of it can deter a maniac who is prepared to risk his
life to achieve his goals.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Capitol security is extensive and
sophisticated. But what good are sophisticated security devices
when the police officer monitoring those devices is gunned down
before he has a chance to react?
</P>
<P>
   Weston didn't sneak a pistol past the metal detector at the
Capitol door; he reportedly charged into the building, shot a cop
in the back of the head and started running down a hallway. Then he
shot another cop, who returned fire and ended the incident almost
as quickly as it had started.
</P>
<P>
   The two policemen died, and a tourist was injured. Weston was
seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, although the price was high, the security system
worked. Two cops died in the line of duty, but no member of
Congress was harmed, and the one bystander who got hurt was out of
the hospital the very next day.
</P>
<P>
   This tragedy might have been averted if the Capitol had been
locked up, inaccessible to the public. But that's not what America
is all about; the Capitol is where the people's elected
representatives conduct the people's business.
</P>
<P>
   If the day ever comes that we must wall off and lock down this
symbol of freedom and representative government, we might as well
send our legislators home, for the greatest nation on earth will
have surrendered to the tyranny of fear.
</P>
<P>
   No, all this talk of tighter security at the Capitol is
ill-advised and unnecessary. And it may be nothing more than an
understandable overreaction to a terrible tragedy _ just as
increased airport security was an overreaction to the explosion of
TWA Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   But in this era of cynicism, it is tempting to suspect a more
cynical explanation for some of these calls for enhanced security.
Some members of Congress, for example, seem to be capitalizing on
the shootings to revive a dormant plan to build an underground
``visitors center'' at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   One bipartisan proposal calls for building the $125 million
center with private funds. But in the wake of last week's violence,
there were rumblings that Congress might see fit to spend
taxpayers' money on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The project is a boondoggle, of course _ one that would do
little or nothing to prevent the Russell Westons of the world from
wreaking havoc if they are so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Glenn, the onetime astronaut who is currently training
for another trip into space, was asked on one of the morning TV
chat shows about the security situation. He wondered if it wouldn't
be smarter to spend some money improving mental health programs
rather than enhancing security at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's point was that Weston might never have been in
Washington on his mission of murder if he had received adequate
treatment for whatever mental disorder led him to commit such a
mindless act of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting idea. More interesting than a metal detector,
anyway.

WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN?

   &UR;  &LR; After a triumphant but exhausting victory at the Goodwill
Games in her final heptathlon last week,  &UR; Jackie Joyner-Kersee
 &LR; went home to Illinois for a farewell meet in her honor Saturday
where spectators cheered her every move even though she could
muster a jump no farther than 20 feet, 11 3/4 inches _ almost 4
feet shy of her all-time best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be,'' she said afterward in her last
competition before retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But her sixth-place finish seemed to faze neither Joyner-Jersee
nor the 9,200 admirers who came out to the US Open meet at
Edwardsville, Ill., to say goodbye. Ralph Korte Stadium is about 20
miles from East St. Louis, where the 36-year-old four-time Olympian
was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional tributes came from many quarters.  &UR; Gordon Bush &LR; , the
mayor of East St. Louis, proclaimed Saturday Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Day. USA Track &AMP; Field retired a uniform in her name, with its No.
7 representing the number of events in the heptathlon. The family
of retired track star Carl Lewis presented her with a check for
$5,000 for her foundation, which serves children in her rundown
hometown. The track team from her old high school ran a lap of
honor with her as she carried a lighted Olympic torch.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the woman many call the greatest female athlete of
her generation appeared to have no qualms about never competing
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad,'' she said. ``I have no regrets.''

Final Four-style tournament, with semifinal matches on Friday night
and the third-place game and final on Sunday.

   ``It is only natural that Boston play host,'' said  &UR; Francisco

competition,  &UR; Michelle Kwan  &LR; watched a tape of her silver medal
performance in the Olympics. ``I thought it was good,'' she said,
but ``I saw things I can improve on. There are some things I could
have done better. I needed a little more oomph to the long
program.'' Now, Kwan hopes the oomph is there and she can maintain
it right through the next four years to the 2002 Olympics in Salt

   By virtue of its 1-0, extra-inning victory Tuesday over host
Japan in the ISF Women's World Championship, the US national
softball team earned the right to defend its Olympic title in
Sydney. The US didn't get a hit against the tough Japanese squad
until the top of the sixth, and couldn't score until  &UR; Sheila
Douty &LR; , &UR;  &LR; of Diamond Bar, Calif., sent the first pitch of the ninth
towering over the left-field fence to give the US the lead and
eventually the win.  &UR; Lisa Fernandez  &LR; struck out 11 while allowing
just four hits and a walk in the shutout. The US faces Australia
tomorrow as the tournament continues ...  &UR; Valerie Still &LR; , &UR;  &LR; two-time
MVP of the ABL championship series, has signed a two-year contract
extension. The 37-year-old Still is the second-oldest player in the
league, but has led the Columbus Quest to two straight
championships, last season averaging 13.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and
2.3 steals per game. At the same time she revealed that reports of
her imminent retirement were greatly exaggerated, Still announced
that the ABL has contributed $5,000 to her SKIP _ Still Kids
Improvement Program _ Foundation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Zagol, a World War II paratrooper who survived D-Day, the
``Bridge too Far'' at Remagen on the Rhine River, and, as if that
wasn't enough, the siege of Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge,
has seen ``Saving Private Ryan.'' He's fine. Got bored after the
gory part, but stayed because ``my grandson wanted to see the end
of the movie.'' That may be a normal reaction for men who survived
the reality behind the myth of ``Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories and reviews on ``Private Ryan'' have raised concerns
about the opening 20 minutes of the film with scenes so violent and
so accurately evocative of the landings at Omaha Beach in Normandy
on June 6, 1944, and suggested that veterans will attend the film
at their peril. Some veterans will be disturbed: The post-traumatic
syndrome counselors at the Veterans Administration are gearing up
for an increase in the number of vets needing some help in the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of those who are truly disturbed by the film will be
veterans of D-Day. Those who have lived this long (the youngest are
over 70) are the men least troubled by memories of carnage. All the
talk about those poor veterans who may go to the movie and be
brought to tears is, well, talk. A few may crack but most will not.
It was that way in the war, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parks, a former Boston school official, spent D-Day on Red
Beach, one of the messier parts of Omaha Beach where the carnage
imagined and re-created in ``Private Ryan'' really happened. Parks
is looking forward to seeing the film later this week and doesn't
expect that the violence will bother him at all. He's been there:
``You have to understand, this was our first combat, we were
unprepared for the noise of the gunfire, the men screaming for
medical aid, all those dead bodies. But it won't bother me now. You
see, you fall into a groove in your psyche after a while, you
accept that it's war, that people are gonna die, you may die, so
you do your job, take your objectives, but with caution. You don't
lose that. You're still in that groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagol, a 101st division paratrooper, remembers the beach in
Normandy vividly. His outfit, after the jump, regrouped at the edge
of Omaha Beach. ``Did the violence in the movie bother me? Yeah, it
upset me,'' Zagol allowed. ``I remember the bodies on the beach,
but you know, I was wounded a few days later and sent back to the
beach to be evacuated, and the Germans got some planes over us and
strafed the hell out of the beach; I slept right through it. I
don't think the movie's going to bother anyone who was there.
You've seen so much, how can it really bother you any more?''
</P>
<P>
   Zagol went to the movie because his grandson wanted to see it.
``Actually,'' he recalled, ``after the first 20 minutes were over,
the real part, I wanted to go home. ... I mean, it just wasn't
realistic. They were running around throwing hand grenades into
buildings, they weren't staying behind the tanks when they moved
up. It wasn't the war I fought in.'' As for the movie's basic
premise, that a whole platoon of soldiers would be sent into
disputed territory to find a single soldier and bring him out,
Zagol couldn't think of a better comment than a very audible
snicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell,'' Zagol asked, ``how many vets are going to see it,
anyhow? I go to reunions now, and you don't see anyone you know. I
was young then, the officers, the sergeants, they were older,
they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Parks, who farms in Southeastern Massachusetts, wasn't
planning to see ``Private Ryan,'' but he got a call from a talk
show host who was planning a call-in about the film. ``I thought I
ought to go,'' Parks related, ``so I'd know what I was talking
about if he does have the show.'' As a film critic, Parks is
generous. ``It was one of the better ones,'' he said, ``at least
not that John Wayne stuff, that Rambo stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part to watch, the worst,'' Parks continued, ``was
the beginning of the movie. My wife was funny, she watched it
through her fingers, and she was really worried about me, she
wondered if it wouldn't bother me that night.'' His experience
parallels that of Paul Parks and Zagol, that everyone has to find
that groove to survive: ``The worst of the invasion was right at
the start. You knew everyone, we'd trained together for years, you
knew the dead. Later on in the war, they were just serial numbers.
You get used to it.'' Ed Parks's war ended at the Battle of the
Bulge. Captured, he spent the rest of the war in Stalag 4B, south
of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   And he had the same reaction, if milder, as Zagol to the movie
after the realistic violence of the invasion turned into the
psychological docudrama of sending a platoon of Army Rangers into
harm's way to save a single soldier. ``The uniforms,'' he began,
``were realistic. But the middle part was, well, pretty good. I
mean, you never saw anyone dig a foxhole. My God, the first thing
you did when you stopped was dig. Movement brought artillery fire,
guaranteed, so when you stop, you dig. `Dig or die,' that's we
said. Another thing, if you wanted to make it realistic: No one
ever sat down and ate anything. You stopped, you ate. People
bitched about the Army canned rations, but you ate. And you dug.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parks, although eager to see the movie, is already prepared
not to like, or believe, part of it. ``Everyone tells me it _ the
war footage _ is actual, realistic. The thing they're telling me
that really bothers me is that the movie makes us out to be so
disorganized on the beach. How do you think we got off the beach?
It was the platoon sergeants _ most of the lieutenants got it right
away, they were obvious targets _ and the sergeants are who gets
you up and moving. Now,'' he summed up, ``if there had been
disorganization at that level, the sergeants' level....''
</P>
<P>
   Terence Keane, a psychologist at the Boston Veterans Hospital,
where he directs the National Center for Post-Traumatic Syndrome,
is not surprised that the veterans of D-Day are taking the movie in
relatively well-tempered stride. ``For one thing,'' he explained,
``the veterans that you can still find, still get ahold of, are the
lucky ones. The people who were most severely affected by the war,
well, they die earlier, you can imagine the causes, alcoholism,
heart disease, accidents. The healthier ones, that's who's talking
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane also offered some insight into why veterans and
non-veterans might overlook, or only mildly object to, the film's
banal dialogue and unbelievable story line. ``Beginning the film
with that terrible and accurate footage of death and destruction is
what we call a `prime manipulation.' It's something we've studied,
used, and it affects the way people respond in all ways,
emotionally, behaviorally, cognitively. What Spielberg may have
done is primed them to deal with very serious issues, and then
given them a bad film.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Keane expects that this film, like others before it, will
trigger reactions in veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress
syndrome. ``We can expect something like a 20 percent increase in
our workload, numbers of clients seeking help, over the next few
weeks. This has happened with every very popular, very violent,
film since `The Deer Hunter,' back in 1978. That's the film that
made us aware of the problem. `Platoon' was another one, so was
`Born on the Fourth of July.'''
</P>
<P>
   While films might kick up visits to the VA, they don't hold a
candle to true life. ``The Gulf War,'' Keane recalled, ``we saw a
greater than doubling of patients. That's reality for you.''

H.O.R.D.E. LIVES UP TO ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   No other summer tour has such wide parameters. ``We're the least
exclusionary tour out there,'' says Chan Kinchla of the band Blues
Traveler, the host and headliner of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of festivals lean to an alternative-rock edge or a
skate-punk edge or a women's edge,'' adds Kinchla. ``But we're all
over the map.''
</P>
<P>
   The H.O.R.D.E., which stands for Horizons of Rock Developing
Everywhere, has lived up to its name. This season's show includes
main stage acts Blues Traveler, Barenaked Ladies, Paula Cole, Ben
Harper, and Alana Davis; second stage acts Government Mule, Marcy
Playground, Catatonia, the Jim Kelly Band, and Jiggle the Handle;
and even a third stage manned by New York's Mosaic and Chris Barron
of the Spin Doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The H.O.R.D.E. started out as a neo-hippie festival eight years
ago (Blues Traveler was joined by Phish, Widespread Panic, the Spin
Doctors, and the Aquarium Rescue Unit), but has expanded ever
since. Neil Young, Beck, and Primus played it last summer (the only
year that Blues Traveler was absent) and this season even featured
the Smashing Pumpkins on four Midwest dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pumpkins were looking to do something different. Their
manager didn't want to do it, but the band did,'' says Kinchla.
``We had first met them at the Bridge School benefit that Neil
Young does every year in California.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the H.O.R.D.E. also lucked out by booking Barenaked
Ladies, who are red-hot at the moment. ``We've been lucky that
way,'' says Kinchla. ``In the past, we've also had the Dave
Matthews Band, Sheryl Crow, and 311 just as they were getting
big.''
</P>
<P>
   What also distinguishes the H.O.R.D.E. is the amount of
inter-band jamming that takes place during the day. The main stage
is referred to as ``the Blues Traveler workshop stage,'' where
Traveler has jammed with everyone from Warren Haynes of Government
Mule to the Klezmer All-Stars from New Orleans. ``We called it
Klezmania,'' says Kinchla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things couldn't be better,'' he adds. ``We didn't know some of
the bands coming in _ like, Barenaked Ladies we'd only heard about.
But all the bands are getting along really well. The Barenaked
Ladies even did an impromptu rap session at the third stage, which
is in the concourse. And one day, Chris Stills and Warren Haynes
did `Ohio' together. A lot of cool things have been happening
there,'' he says. ``I've been up to play there and so has John
Popper,'' Traveler's singer and harmonica/guitar force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we went to Europe and did our own thing, playing at
some festivals over there,'' Kinchla says. ``But we're glad we're
back. We've been having fun this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blues Traveler is doing a bunch of new material from an album to
be released next year. Some of it lacks the harmonica focus of the
past, which has made some fans wonder what's going on. ``Harmonica,
being a diatonic instrument, points the music in a certain
direction. We're still finding places where the harp will work, but
we don't want to be obligated to using it,'' says Kinchla.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, what about the talk that some H.O.R.D.E. dates haven't
been as strong as others at the box office? ``Well, one of them has
been in Dallas and a lot of people don't want to go out in heat. I
can't blame them,'' Kinchla says. ``But, overall, our ticket sales
are pretty much where they've always been. We're making plenty of
money and everybody's having a good time.''

MINORITIES SEE `ETHNIC STEREOTYPING' IN POLICE SEARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts State Police thought they had sniffed out
a big-time drug trafficker when Manuel Espinola of Tewksbury put
his bag through an airport X-ray machine.
</P>
<P>
   There, buried in his luggage, was a bundle of cash totaling
$14,665.
</P>
<P>
   When police questioned him, Espinola became nervous, saying he
was flying to Las Vegas to buy a house. Yet he couldn't give police
his broker's name or employer's telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a specially-trained dog detected cocaine on the money.
</P>
<P>
   Espinola was not arrested at the airport during the incident in
November 1996 because police lacked enough evidence to build a case
against him as a trafficker. But State Trooper Stephen G. Lynch
seized the money under federal drug forfeiture laws, which allows
confiscation of property thought to be gained from or used in drug
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The government has had the money ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But on July 2, US District Court Judge Nancy Gertner ordered the
money returned to Espinola and delivered a blistering critique of
police, saying they may have relied on ``blatant ethnic
stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American and Latino civil rights groups say
``profiling,'' the process by which drug agents and police decide
who to stop and search in airports and along highways, has resulted
in unfair use of race and the disproportionate stopping of black
and Latino travelers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, the Supreme Court and lower federal
courts have granted police wide latitude to size up suspects as
part of the ``war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gertner, in one of the first major blows against profiling,
said police violated Espinola's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's showing of probable cause is completely
inadequate,'' Gertner wrote, ``based on a troubling mix of baseless
generalizations, leaps of logic or worse, blatant ethnic
stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   To Gregory Nojeim, general legislative counsel for the American
Civil Liberties Union, the case ``signals to law enforcement that
passengers are not to be treated as if they are criminals unless
there is probable cause of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the airport, passengers check their luggage, not their
rights to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   George Festa, &UR;  &LR; special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in New England, said law enforcement would continue
its aggressive patrol of airports. He said such efforts have cut
down on drug trafficking at Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with this decision because the officer did what
he is paid to do,'' he said. ``No one stood back and said, `That
man looks like a criminal! Let's stop him.' The trooper went step
by step to build probable cause. We weren't satisfied with
Espinola's responses.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinola, a salesman for Equinox International, an Amway-like
consumer products company, has declined comment, saying he feared
retaliation from the government. His lawyer, Blaine DeFreitas,
said, ``Just because a young Hispanic male carries a large amount
of money doesn't mean that money was ill-gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertner made her ruling in the midst of a national controversy
on profiling, or what some have dubbed ``DWBs _ Driving While
Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Strip searches at customs at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport have led to a federal lawsuit by 18 African-American women.
Last week, US Senators Dick Durbin and Carol Moseley-Braun, both
Democrats of Illinois, released data showing black women are the
most singled out group for strip searches.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the ACLU says it has received hundreds of
complaints regarding computerized airport screenings from travelers
to the Middle East, travelers who have Arab names, and
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profiling is lazy law enforcement,'' Nojeim said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating possible civil rights
violations in traffic stops and the House recently passed a bill to
monitor stops. The bill has stalled in the Senate under lobbying by
police associations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People announced it would begin studying traffic stops made
by police. In an interview with the Globe this week, NAACP Chairman
Julian Bond said he was approached a few months ago at a turnpike
rest stop between Washington and Philadelphia by a state trooper.
Bond said the trooper's hand was on his revolver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trooper said, `You resemble a suspect in a robbery,' said
Bond, who said he felt ``enormous fear'' at that moment. ``The
trooper looked back at the woman who was with him and asked her if
I looked like the robber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman said, `I told you it was a kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bond is 58 years old.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, authorities have stopped and interrogated
prominent African-Americans and Latinos such as Harvard Law School
professor Charles Ogletree, former Virginia governor Douglas
Wilder, Texas appeals court Justice Linda Reyna Yanez, and baseball
Hall of Famer Joe Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Air travelers who have been stopped report everything from
having underwear put on display to missed flights and assault.
Wilder was grabbed by the throat by a security guard at the
Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina in 1995. Morgan was
awarded $796,000 by the city of Los Angeles after being thrown to
the floor and handcuffed at the Los Angeles Airport in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree said he has been stopped about 12 times since 1980,
while dressed casually and when wearing a suit, at airports in
Boston, Miami, New York, Newark, and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from Jamaica, the only thing consistent was
that all of the people being stopped had dark skin,'' Ogletree
said. ``It is a situation of terror. You're so vulnerable. When
agents start searching and bring the dogs to sniff your bags you
have no recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the embarrassment of having fellow travelers all around
you who don't know you thinking you are guilty. You go away and the
first thing that happens when you come home is that you are
reminded of your status in this society.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reyna Yanez and her teenage daughter, Amparo, were walking
through an airport in Harlingen, Texas, in 1995 when a border
patrol agent grabbed her daughter, suspecting her of being in the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to intimidate me,'' said Reyna Yanez in a telephone
interview. ``I knew that my daughter and I were being singled out
for an immutable trait, our race, so it made me remember when I was
a little girl in school where they used to punish us for speaking
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Amparo Yanez, now 21, said she could hardly hold back her tears.
She said she has been stopped at least three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired and harassed and completely terrified,'' Amparo
said, also on the phone. ``I was embarrassed and scared and I felt
discriminated against because of my skin color.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Espinola case, Gertner originally granted police a
warrant to seize the money based on an affidavit Lynch submitted
after the incident. In her 30-page decision, she said she was wrong
to have done so, saying she was misled by the affidavit and did not
have a chance to hear Espinola's side.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the fact that Espinola's cash contained traces of
cocaine, citing several studies that show that 90 percent of all US
currency is tinged with the drug.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern disagreed and is appealing Gertner's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find any basis in the record that the trooper's
decision was based on racial stereotyping,'' Stern said.

AHAB'S WIFE TELLS HER TALE IN HENSON PUPPET THEATER FETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Moby Dick,'' author Herman Melville mentions Captain Ahab's
wife all of three times in the 700-odd pages. While the embittered
Ahab slices through waves in his hunt for the white whale that tore
off his leg, his wife remains the nameless woman who quietly sits
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind Melville. Four Boston-area artists have
collaborated to infuse Ahab's wife with a resonant voice, offering
a story Melville never told. Visual artist Ellen Driscoll, poet Tom
Sleigh, and choreographers/directors Amy Spencer and Richard Colton
teamed up to create the new performance work, ``Ahab's Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The visual production has been selected to be a part of the
prestigious Jim Henson Foundation's fourth biennial International
Festival of Puppet Theater Sept. 17-20 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Initiated by the Jim Henson Foundation, after the late
groundbreaking puppeteer's death, this year's festival _ the only
puppet festival in the United States _ has invited 28 troupes from
16 countries to perform. Despite Henson's brilliant work with ``The
Muppets'' and other children's entertainment, the gathering
presents mostly adult drama, showcasing marionettes, Kabuki, hand
puppets, rod puppets, and other elements of visual theater.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ahab's Wife,'' the title character steers through a journey
of flashbacks, imagination, loneliness, and longing to arrive at
her own realizations and destiny. The play combines visual objects,
poetic lyricism, shadowbox, modern dance, Jujitsu, slapstick, and
Fred-and-Ginger ballroom dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're expecting to see `Moby Dick' on stage _ it's not
that,'' said Colton, a Cambridge, Mass. poet who wrote the final
script. ``We're only using Melville's book as a springboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, Driscoll proposed the premise of the
play to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for sponsorship. The academy
turned it down, but one panel juror, Olivia Georgia, a curator of
the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island, enjoyed the
proposal so much she had the center commission the play. Snug
Harbor, formerly a sailors' retirement complex, was administered by
Melville's brother in the 1800s. The center will present ``Ahab's
Wife'' for the Henson festival.
</P>
<P>
   The original work for the production was created at workshops at
the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge and Concord (Mass.)
Academy's Summer Stages over the past two years. The final product
is a &UR;  &LR; blending of ideas pitched by workshop students, who each read
a chunk of the Melville novel to transfer some of its essence to
dance and acting. The play was also performed at the New Bedford
(Mass.) Whaling Museum last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long production consists of only 14 pages of script _
shorter than, say, the Cliff's Notes to Melville's book. But
interspersed with eclectic music, dance, and shadowplay, the piece
provides enough nonverbal elements to titillate the eyes and ears.
Scenes drift from one to another like seaweed, as do the fluid
modern dance moves. The fragmented mishmash is meant to complement
Melville's patchwork of writing styles, which tumble from technical
jargon of the whaling industry to philosophical ramblings to common
talk muttered by 19th century sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Melville does that,'' Driscoll said of the book's
myriad styles, ``is because the ship is like a world filled with
different kinds of men; it's a little floating universe. Our piece,
too, has multiple layers and fast turns. I think Melville would
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, Ahab's wife (Randy Danson) mourns the loss of her
husband but learns that all humans are alone, and that a person
cannot be completed by another. She eventually meets the majestic
whale (Robert Langdon Lloyd), who, as in the book, serves as a
collective repository of the character's experiences. Although
central to the novel, the whale also lacked a voice in the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of ``Ahab's Wife'' perused old bookstores and
thrift stores in search of nautical artifacts and documents. In
some scenes, the giant hoop skirt and diving bell are transformed
into the eye and head of the whale. Hoop skirts and corsets, both
which can represent the repression of women, were made of whale
bone in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll and Sleigh found an 19th century diary of a sailor's
wife who accompanied him aboard on his travels. Augusta Penniman's
journal entries are echoed in the monologues of Ahab's wife in the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women back then were much more adventurous than how we might
think of them today,'' actress Danson said. ``Some women were
traveling to far-flung places and meeting cannibals. (Ahab's wife)
is an adventurous explorer as well. The nautical journey is a
metaphor for her journey to sort out the loss of her husband.''

SHORTCOMINGS SNARE NEW `PARENT TRAP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE PARENT TRAP 
Directed by: Nancy Meyers 
Screenplay by: David Swift, Nancy Meyers &AMP; Charles Shyer 
Starring: Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine
Hendrix, Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz, Polly Holliday, Maggie
Wheeler, Ronnie Stevens, Joanna Barnes, Erin Mackey 
Running time: 124 minutes 
Rated: PG (some mild mischief) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing cheap or blatantly exploitative about Nancy
Meyer's remake of ``The Parent Trap.'' And newcomer Lindsay Lohan
is as likable as Hayley Mills was in the double role of twins who
meet for the first time at summer camp. Separated at birth when
their parents went their respective ways after an impulsive romance
and wedding, the girls, with the aid of trick photography and an
occasional body double, bond after initial antagonism, then scheme
to reunite their divorced parents. Meyer and her husband, Charles
Shyer have been down this road before, having retooled ``Father of
the Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   But _ and you will have sensed there's a ``but'' _ the film that
worked well enough in 1961 seems as bit hollow today. Ironically,
its shortcomings are exposed by the faithfulness with which Meyer
has replicated the original script as director and co-writer, right
down to timing out the film at a rather too leisurely
two-hours-plus. The new ``Parent Trap'' is slickly crafted _ with
foolproof fairytale settings in London and the Napa Valley _ but
its central premise, that kids can and therefore perhaps should
somehow get their selfish divorced parents back together, generates
more uneasiness than pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer never allows coyness and cuteness to invade the screen any
more than she succumbs to broadness and MTV editing. She even
manages a few sly visual send-ups _ one aimed at Beatle fans. But
the charm of the performers, sparked by Lohan's unaffected
freshness and the warmth and dazzle of Natasha Richardson's single
mom, enjoying a career as a successful wedding gown designer, and
Dennis Quaid's single dad, grown mellow and rich from his winery,
can only carry the film so far.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to watch Lohan play to slightly different versions of
her English-bred and California-nurtured selves and the siblings'
respective surrogate parents, Simon Kunz's London butler and Lisa
Ann Walker's Napa nanny. But you spend more time feeling prodded
into emotions than actually feeling emotions, which renders all the
technical care and craftsmanship moot. The actors are attractive to
watch as they gambol through what seem their awfully predetermined
moves through the dreamy scenery and through a perfunctory
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The latter revolves around the impending marriage of Quaid's
careless vintner to a blond she-devil played with unrelievedly
steely demeanor by Elaine Hendrix (Joanna Barnes, the vixen in the
original, returns as the vixen's mom here). ``The Parent Trap''
offers gloss and sheen, but it's all exteriors, a shortcoming that
Meyer might have concealed with a crisp-as-lettuce directorial
touch. But the film's pedestrian earnestness keeps reminding us
that while pretty, it's too calculated to be anything but bland.

PROSECUTORS, LAWYERS AWAIT EFFECTS OF COLORADO RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The delicate dance with the devil has played out in courtrooms
for more than a century, ever since horse thief and train robber
Dick Liddil cut a deal to testify against Jesse James' brother,
Frank, in a Missouri courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutor William H. Wallace reminded jurors in his
oft-quoted final argument in 1883, such alliances between lawmen
and outlaws are unsavory, but unavoidable:
</P>
<P>
   ``When the state would break up a band of criminals, it must
depend on the assistance of one of their peers in crime to do it.
Hence, it is the custom, as old as the law, to pick out from a
desperate band one of their own number, and use him as a guide to
hunt the others down.''
</P>
<P>
   So when a three-judge federal appeals court in Colorado this
month ruled that the practice amounted to bribery and was against
the law, prisoners convicted on the word of their cohorts called
their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And prosecutors cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning ruling was the first which targeted the linchpin in
most federal prosecutions: offering deals to witnesses to get them
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``No practice is more ingrained in our criminal justice system
...'' the court said. But, the court added, it's a practice that
flies in the face of a federal law that prohibits giving a witness
anything of value in exchange for testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the panel ordered a new trial for Sonya
Evette Singleton, a Kansas woman who was convicted of money
laundering and cocaine dealing largely on the testimony of Napoleon
Douglas, a member of the alleged ring.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Douglas' testimony, federal prosecutors had
agreed not to pursue other drug cases against him, allowed him to
plead guilty to reduced charges, and asked the sentencing judge for
a lenient term _ a fairly standard deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Singleton decision spawned a flurry of motions _ including
at least three in Massachusetts federal courts _ asking judges to
block the testimony of witnesses who have cut deals with the
government. That occurs in nearly all conspiracy cases involving
multiple defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would change everything,'' said Frank A. Libby Jr., a
former federal prosecutor who relied on a half-dozen cooperating
witnesses to crack the infamous ``Code of Silence'' case involving
murderous Charlestown, Mass. drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would shut down large-scale racketeering cases,'' Libby
said. ``You have to have an insider explain what things means, why
telephone calls went from A to B.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department, calling the decision simply
``wrong,'' immediately asked for a hearing before the full bench of
the Tenth Circuit, which includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Justice Department could act, the appeals court
withdrew the decision until the full 12-member court could hear the
matter in November _ mindful, no doubt, that it could affect the
pending appeal of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Both McVeigh and his cohort, Terry Nichols, were convicted in
part on the testimony of former accomplice Michael Fortier, who was
rewarded with a reduced sentence.
</P>
<P>
   With the ruling withdrawn, there is no impediment to business as
usual. And even if the decision had remained in place pending the
review, it would not have been binding in federal courts in the
First Circuit, which covers Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the federal judge in Boston who is presiding over the
current murder and drug trafficking trial of two members of the
Intervale Posse street gang _ a trial that features testimony by
three former gang members who've cut deals with the government _
rejected a motion to block them from the witness stand based on the
Singleton ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, law enforcement officials are plotting contingencies,
such as asking Congress to exempt plea bargains from the bribery
law, should the Singleton decision pass muster before the Tenth
Circuit and the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense lawyers hailed the first validation of their
longstanding view that deals-for-testimony are inherently suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get out-and-out rank perjury and manufactured stories,''
said Boston defense attorney Joseph Oteri, who won an acquittal
last year for a Legal Sea Foods executive whose chief accusers were
two career criminals-turned government witnesses. ``They call it
`getting on the bus,' down in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   And when stiffer, mandatory sentences and the abolition of
federal parole are factored in, Oteri said, ``Almost everybody is a
rat. It's the only way out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bargains that are cut have grown by leaps and bounds,''
said Framingham attorney John H. LaChance, president of the
Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a former
federal prosecutor. He's among a handful of local lawyers spurred
by the Singleton decision who filed motions to block witnesses who
had made deals in exchange for their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   LaChance represents Robert F. Carrozza of East Boston, a reputed
Mafia member and part of a faction charged with trying to topple
mob boss Francis Salemme during a bloody five-year power struggle
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The trial is set for September
in US District Court in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Martin G. Weinberg, who represents co-defendant Anthony Ciampi
seeking to block the testimony of three witnesses, including Sean
Cote, a career criminal who testified before the grand jury that
returned the indictments. Cote, a convicted bank robber, is
believed to have testified to more than a dozen murders and
assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Cote avoided a life sentence on charges he robbed
13 banks and two jewelry stores. Instead, he will serve 10 to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Carrozza's case offers a textbook example of how the system
works _ and how it can cut both ways. Back in 1992, Carrozza
himself received immunity for the attempted murder of Salemme under
a plea agreement that got him 19 years on a racketeering
conviction. He currently faces five charges, but the attempted
murder of Salemme is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Given the national outcry from law enforcement, it's unclear
whether the literal reading of the law in the Singleton ruling will
stand. Unlike any court before it, the three-judge panel in Denver
decided that the federal bribery statute which prohibits ``giving,
offering or promising anything of value'' for testimony applies to
arrangements prosecutors make with defendants who have ``flipped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to imagine anything more valuable than
personal physical freedom,'' the court found.
</P>
<P>
   While that interpretation ``is quite literally correct, it
clearly was not intended to apply in this setting,'' said
Christopher Mueller, a professor at the University of Colorado
School of Law. ``There's not a chance it will stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others point out that only three more votes are needed to
uphold the Singleton decision in Colorado and send it to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conservative issue, not a liberal issue,'' notes
Oteri. ``And when this thing gets to the Supreme Court you might
very well see the conservative majority go for it.''

MYSTERY MANAGER FOCUSES ON FEW HOLDINGS, GETS BIG RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a city that celebrates money managers, he is
arguably among the cream of the crop _ and a virtual unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dworsky works by himself in a sparse, two-room office
overlooking Post Office Square. The entire staff of his Mt. Auburn
Management consists of his wife, Suzanne Werber, who keeps track of
administrative duties from an office in their Cambridge home. He
stopped marketing the firm years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Auburn managed $648 million as of March 31, but the vast
bulk of the total represented huge investment gains over a period
of years. Dworsky's nine institutional clients have given him
considerably more modest sums to manage in an unsual,
high-concentration style that has produced extraordinary results.
</P>
<P>
   It is work done in low-tech solitude. Investment bankers touring
through town to raise money rarely knock on his door. The phone
never rang for more than an hour during a recent visit by a
reporter. Dworsky doesn't even have a computer in his office. The
only concession to information technology is a Quotrek machine, a
device the size of a hand-held calcualator that pulls up stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Dworksy, who describes himself as a bit of a
curmudgeon, has compiled unparalleled investment results for his
clients over the last 12 years. Mt. Auburn has averaged returns of
32.42 percent a year from March 31, 1986, when the firm acquired
its first real insitutional client, to June 30, excluding fees.
Cumulative total return: 3,019.22 percent, according to Dworsky.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the most successful mutual fund in the world
during the same period, Seligman Communications, averaged 21.62
percent a year for a cumulative 1,000.07 percent return including
fees. The best Boston-based fund, Fidelity Select Home Finance,
averaged 21.33 percent for a cumulative 968.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mt. Auburn's short-term performance isn't bad either. A
composite of its client accounts earned 51.04 percent before fees
in the first half of 1998. The latest Pension &AMP; Investments
Performance Evaluation Report, which tracks private money managers,
ranks Mt. Auburn's 120.1 percent total return for the 12 months
ended March 31 as tops in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky isn't shy about his numbers or the stock-picking behind
them. But he's cautious about how markets and investment
performance can turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have peaked out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky has generated big investment returns by putting his eggs
in just a few baskets. All Mt. Auburn's money is invested in nine
stocks at the moment, a rare level of asset concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Pick only a few winners, at least enough to outnumber the
losers, and concentration yields a big advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impact,'' said Dworsky. ``What's the point of having a
Dell Computer that quadruples'' if it only represents 2 percent of
assets? ``If you're running a portfolio with 100 names, you need
many more winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Most managers hold scores or even hundreds of stocks in
diversfied portfolios. Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, one of the
industry's most diversified mutual funds, owns 1,165 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme concentration is considered risky by most managers and
Dworsky agrees it may be an inappropriate strategy for people
investing large portions of a customer's money. Mt. Auburn usually
receives a small sliver of the total assets invested by an
institution and the rest is sprinkled among many other managers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dworsky has only suffered one year in which Mt. Auburn's
composite returns trailed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. Even that
year, 1996, generated a return of 14.85 percent. The portfolio has
been larger, but never numbered more than 12 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as risky as it seems,'' said Dworksy. The Mt. Auburn
portfolio is heavily focused on technology today. Among Dworsky's
selections are Dell, EMC Corp., America Online Inc., Tellabs Inc.,
WorldCom Inc., BMC Software Inc., and Cendant Corp. Dworsky keeps
his stock list close to the vest and discovering any portion
involves dragging it out of him one name at a time. He flatly
declined to name the other two stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine stocks, eight appreciated by at least 25 percent in
the first quarter of 1998, accounting for much of Mt. Auburn's
strong recent performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six years ago the portfolio was heavily in the health
care area,'' he said. ``I shifted toward information technology. I
didn't set out to build an information age portfolio, but my nose
and sensibilities have led me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky began his career in at Putnam Investments, joining the
Boston firm as an analyst straight out of Harvard Business School.
By 1972, he was offered the chance to run Putnam Investors, one of
the most successful funds of its day. ``The preeminent Nifty Fifty
50 portfolio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky sensed trouble soon after and privately advised friends
to get out of the stock market. He said he wanted his Putnam fund
to adapt a more defensive stance and ran into resistance from
Putnam executives. By 1975, he was removed as manager and returned
to the analyst ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many analysts note the parallels between the current
market and stocks in the Nifty Fifty days. Dworsky saw trouble then
but he's unconvinced about dire events ahead. ``It's not as clear
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky stayed with Putnam and later managed large pension fund
accounts, but decided to strike out on his own in 1983. ``When
you're at a place for 17 years, they tend to take you for
granted,'' he said. ``I began to think, you only live once.''
</P>
<P>
   He started Mt. Auburn Management with no clients and the
intention of remaining small, a position he still maintains today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided on Day One to limit ourselves to a business the two
of us and a computer could handle,'' said Dworsky. That made it
harder to build a business early and limits the money he could
manage today.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Mt. Auburn Management mutual fund and its unlikely
there will ever be one. Occasionally one of Dworksy's clients will
leave and another will approach him. And that's the pace he prefers
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an organizational man,'' he said.

ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS HITS CALIFORNIA PORT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Asia's economic crisis seems like an
abstraction to many Americans _ an alarm too distant and faint to
worry much about. But it is a hard reality here amid the screeching
machinery at America's busiest container port.
</P>
<P>
   As ships dock, giant cranes unload 20-foot-long containers
packed with clothing, toys, televisions, and car parts from Japan,
South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and China. When the ships are
ready to return to Asia, the cranes fill them with dozens of steel
containers loaded with ... nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Plummeting currencies have made Asian products a bargain as
American stores prepare for the busy back-to-school and Christmas
seasons. At the same time, Asian consumers are rejecting American
goods because the prices, in Korean wan, Thai baht and other
currencies, have doubled and tripled in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   That makes for the irony in booming California at the century's
end; one of the fastest-growing exports to Asia this summer is the
battered containers used to bring back imports.
</P>
<P>
   And what is happening in California, America's leading exporter
and importer, is telling for the rest of the country. This year,
the United States is running a merchandise trade deficit that
averages $20 billion a month _ compared to $16.5 billion a month
last year. Economists expect that the deficit will grow even wider
in coming months. A visit to the bustling Port of Long Beach, which
loads and unloads 5,000 ships a year, suggests that the economists
may be right.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released here last week underscore the broader story.
In June, the Port of Long Beach handled 10 percent more imports
than it did in June 1997, while exports dropped nearly 18 percent.
Asian shippers are so desperate for containers that last month the
port sent out 89,402 of the empty trailer-truck-sized containers.
It was the first time that empty containers exceeded loaded ones
since the port started keeping statistics in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are similar elsewhere on the West Coast. Thirty
miles to the north, the number of empty cargo containers leaving
the Port of Los Angeles last month was greater than the number of
containers with cargo for the first time in a decade. The backlog
of imports has grown so much that there is a two-day wait for space
on freight trains to the Midwest and the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Just 16 months ago, when Asia appeared to have an insatiable
appetite for Budweiser beer, Caterpillar tractors, and Imperial
Valley hay, the ports here were sending out the same number of
loaded containers as they were receiving.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, California's exports to
Japan, the state's largest export market, fell by 12.3 percent, to
$3.9 billion. The state's exports to South Korea suffered even
more, plunging 42 percent, to just over $1 billion. So far, though,
California has barely felt the pinch because sales of computers,
software, and television programs to Latin America, Canada, and the
rest of the country are soaring. The unanswered question _ for
California and for other states _ is what will happen when and if
those other markets soften.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian crisis is coming here fast and a lot of Americans
don't realize it,'' said Anthony F. Munoz, director of
international operations at American Racing Custom Wheels Inc.,
which employs 2,000 workers in the outskirts of Long Beach. Munoz
spent several years finding distributors for his company's fancy
wheels throughout Asia. He had especially high hopes for Thailand,
which is the world's second-largest market for pickup trucks after
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Thai baht crashed a year ago, sending waves of
instability to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea,
and, most recently, Japan, the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Munoz can barely find buyers in Asia, and he worries
that his Asian competitors will inundate other markets, such as
South America, with cheap wheels or that Asia will buy fewer
commodities from South American countries, and in turn those
countries will have less money for luxury products such as custom
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are not the only ones looking to the East with
alarm. At Sunkist Growers Inc., president Russell Hanlin has
fretted as the price of a pound of California oranges has doubled
in Japan, to $1.50, in less than four years. Sales of citrus to
Asia are down 15 percent this year, and that translates to a nearly
$50 million loss for Sunkist farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, movie producers have already cut profit
projections for fall releases because so many tickets will be sold
in weak overseas currencies. In San Francisco, United Airlines has
suspended daily flights to Seoul, its most important destination in
Asia. And in Anaheim, Disneyland and other attractions have been
hurt as tourists from Korea have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   All this might sound irrelevant to those living and working in
many other states. After all, the United States is enjoying the
lowest unemployment rate in nearly 28 years and the second-slowest
inflation rate in 35 years. Testifying before Congress last week,
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said Americans had
benefited from Asia's woes, as the flood of cheaper products kept
prices down and anxious investors moved capital to the US market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major concern that I have is that it obviously cannot
continue indefinitely,'' Greenspan added.
</P>
<P>
   At Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a forecasting and consulting company
in Lexington, senior economist Cynthia Latta said the US economy is
healthy in part because exports to Asia and other regions were so
strong in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is still dynamic enough to withstand turmoil in
several Asian countries, she said. ``But if the Japanese economy
doesn't start to come back ... that could have an impact and cause
a mild recession here.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of Asia takes on an added urgency in Long Beach,
where construction halted and housing prices tumbled in the early
1990s as military cutbacks jolted the largest employers, McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and Hughes Electronics. Politicians and business
executives formed a partnership and decided to promote what Mayor
Beverly O'Neill refers to as ``the three T's: tourism, technology,
and trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic paid off. The Sumimoto bank building towers over the
Long Beach Harbor. The Boeing Co., which acquired McDonnell
Douglas, employs more than 20,000 people in the city. Asian
visitors became so common that the Westin Hotel here has a copy of
``The Teachings of Buddha,'' in English and Japanese, in every
room.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese banks are expected to lay off some workers. Boeing
has reduced earnings projections, saying that Asia will order 150
fewer aircraft than expected from manufacturers. And the Asian
tourists are rarities.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, many in Long Beach are sanguine. ``It's been a big
hit,'' said Tom Teofilo, executive director of Long Beach's export
development office. ``But when the Asian countries do come back,
they're going to be stronger than ever because they learn from
their mistakes.''

LOOKING TO BE HOSTEST WITH MOSTEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time, once interstate highways were
built, before roadside diners gave way to fast-food chains and
mom-and-pop motels were replaced by Holiday Inns, Radissons, and
EconoLodges.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is today along the Internet information highway, where
a battle is being waged for market share in a roadside service
called hosting _ storage of Web page text and other content for
retrieval by computer users at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Along with storage, some hosting companies see the field
evolving to include rental of specialized business software &UR; ,  &LR; on a
per-use basis, to customers who need these sophisticated programs
but can't afford their upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   The players range from giants _ such as International Business
Machines Corp. and GTE Corp., which got into the game last year by
buying BBN Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. _ to Sage Networks Inc. a
Cambridge start-up intent on building a national hosting company by
buying smaller operators, and tiny Taylor Group of Bedford, N.H.,
which is starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is a position in an industry that now has 4,000 to
5,000 hosting companies, which maintain the computers, &UR;  &LR; called
servers, that store Internet data. &UR;  &LR; While no single hosting company
is believed to hold more than 2 percent of the market, these
companies had combined sales of $400 million in 1997, according to
Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge. That number is expected to
reach $1.9 billion in 1999 and $10.5 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying this rapid growth is the surging interest in on-line
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce &UR;  &LR; last year chalked up more than $20 billion
in sales, two-thirds of that in business-to-business transactions.
Forrester figures that by 2002, this number could reach $350
billion, as existing on-line companies _ ranging from home-based
enterprises to pioneering bookseller Amazon.com _ are joined by
retailers such as L.L. Bean, Macy's, and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the largest of these ``e-commerce'' companies manage
their own servers and networks. But some big players, and most of
the small ones, contract this work to hosting companies.
</P>
<P>
   These often are Internet service providers, many of them local
companies whose primary business is providing dial-up phone
connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But along with providing connections, they sell service packages
that _ for an average fee of $300 to $400 a year and frequently
much higher for large users _ store Web pages, execute orders, and
provide software to post purchases to buyers' credit cards while
transmitting deposits to sellers' bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting to be tapped, however, are thousands of firms that
have could sell their products or services over the Internet but
haven't tried, and others that have yet to exploit the World Wide
Web's full potential.
</P>
<P>
   Software products are coming out almost daily to ease the way,
says Joseph Barlett, an analyst with Yankee Group in Boston. ``Most
companies going with a hosting provider today are not very
sophisticated,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   But many that are very savvy are still hiring hosting companies
to help guarantee service quality for both external Internet pages
and intranet content meant only for employees' eyes. Boston Globe
Electronic Publishing Co., an affiliate of the newspaper, uses
servers at GTE in Cambridge for its boston.com on-line service. For
example, when a visitor to boston.com searches for a movie review,
he is tapping into GTE's servers for the stored information.
Texas-based J.C. Penney Co. uses another Cambridge Internet service
provider for much of its Web storage.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester says there were 12,000 such ``complex sites'' last
year, and predicts this number will grow to 20,000 by 2002. Many
will be managed in-house, but many more firms will be paying
thousands of dollars a year to hosting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Looking further ahead, the Internet is on the brink of opening
up new ways for companies to conduct their own internal financial
and production affairs, using software that until now only large
Fortune 500 companies could afford.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing this opportunity, major business software developers such
as Lotus Development Corp. (an IBM subsidiary), Microsoft Corp.,
and Great Plains Software Inc. are now market-testing versions of
their brand-name products for small companies _ firms with 500 or
fewer employees _ to use via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The concept calls for hosting companies to install master copies
of such specialized software, and then rent access to users.
International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass. says 25 percent of
900 companies in a recent survey said they liked the idea for
payroll processing; others saw a need for such services for
economic forecasting or supply-chain management capabilities that
they now lack.

<P>
   ``The capabilities in this field are just emerging,'' said
Steven Brand, Lotus's manager for small business applications.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Forming a backbone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hosting as a growth business is sharply defined in the
``rollup'' strategy being pursued by Sage Networks, which since
March has spent more than $20 million to buy eight hosting
companies from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   These acquisitions _ in Atlanta, New York, Washington, D.C.,
Dallas, San Jose, and Los Angeles _ form the backbone of what Sage
intends to be a national company that can establish brand identity
in a now-fragmented market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually think that through consolidation you can build a
large international company,'' said Bradley Feld, cochairman and
one of Sage's founders.
</P>
<P>
   By January, he said, Sage hopes to have between 15 and 25
acquisitions under its wing, with more planned for 1999. ``We are
now one of the top 10 hosting companies in the country and by the
end of this year should be one of the top two.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this represents a big market share.
</P>
<P>
   Sage says it currently has tens of thousands of clients at its
companies; some estimate that number is less than 40,000. The firm
believed to be the nation's largest hosting operator, Hiway
Technologies Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., claims 87,000 customers. And
the runner-up, Verio Inc., which has 125,000 customers buying
connections to the Internet, may be able to claim about 65,000 as
hosting customers, based on rules of thumb that industry veterans
say are commonly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hiway and Verio also are pursuing rollup strategies. Verio,
based in Englewood, Colo., is publicly traded. Hiway has an initial
public stock offering planned for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sage's buying spree has included a large, high-speed computer
center near Washington, D.C., purchased from IBM Corp., to be the
linchpin in the company's operations. A second center is being
built in Atlanta, where two of its operating units are also based,
at a projected cost of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sage's money comes mostly from a venture fund managed by a New
York investment bank, Charterhouse Group International Inc.
Patricia Riley, managing director, says Charterhouse has ``well
over $40 million in pure equity'' committed to Sage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at this, you have a market that is growing
exponentially and a business that creates profits quickly,'' she
said. An IPO is planned, but no timetable has been set.

Pioneering at BBN
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GTE, an international telecommunications giant with $23 billion
in revenues in 1997, paid $616 million last year to buy BBN, which
in 1969, as Bolt, Beranek &AMP; Newman, launched the forerunner of the
Internet for the US Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Today, BBN operates under the name GTE Internetworking, still
running key portions of the Internet and selling services to
support its parent company's drive to compete against AT&AMP;T Corp.
and MCI Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shooting to be a leader in the hosting market,'' says
John Vincenzo, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still under the BBN flag at the time, the company began
commercializing hosting operations at its 11 US locations in 1995,
according to senior product manager Christine Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Going first after large corporations that needed backup storage
capacity, the company last year expanded sales efforts to include
small and midsize firms _ companies with fewer than 500 employees
or sales less than $100 million. Analysts say this sector is where
electronic commerce is growing the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo said GTE now has more than 1,000 hosting customers. It
acquired one smaller hosting company, Genuity Inc., of San
Francisco, late last year primarily because it had a data center
that could be a GTE West Coast operations center. More acquisitions
are possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Thin client' technology
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a different direction, Dan Taylor, a Bedford, N.H.,
software consultant, sees new computer hardware technology paving
the way for hosting centers to provide small businesses with
payroll, engineering, manufacturing control, sales systems, and
other software that they previously couldn't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says the licensing fees for these high-end products,
which big companies take for granted, weren't the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It was the cost of hiring someone to install the software,
manage its use, and install upgrades , in as many as 200 desktop
computers in a medium-sized firm. These information systems
managers, who can earn $80,000 to $90,000 a year, also must be
available around the clock to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new hardware that is altering this picture is called ``thin
client'' technology, a name that refers to the fact that those
desktop terminals are stripped of their software storage
capabilities _ thinned down _ to become terminals that connect to
servers that function as a central computer.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound familiar to anyone who used a computer before the
PC revolution , when computer terminals were wired to IBM, Digital
Equipment, or similar mainframe computers that were tended behind
closed doors by technicians. ``The industry is calling it
recentralization,'' says Taylor of this return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   But by requiring that software be installed and maintained only
at the servers, operating costs plummet and fancy software becomes
more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor this fall will launch his first application of this
approach, installing accounting software in host servers at his
company's offices that nearby New Hampshire College will be able to
tap, via the Internet, for teaching its business courses.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, his company, The Taylor Group, is discussing the
hosting of specialized business applications with New Hampshire's
largest private manufacturing company, Cabletron Corp. of
Rochester, and with a Massachusetts health care firm, Physicians
Quality Care Inc. of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating success in these pilot installations, Taylor
recently bought a 9.5 acres of land in Bedford where he plans to
build new offices for his 75-employee company _ with 10,000 square
feet of space set aside for a hosting center.

<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ When her family gathers here Saturday to
celebrate the 90th birthday of Katherine Mearls Rogan, talk will
likely turn to the days when she could run faster, jump farther,
and swim quicker than any other woman in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When Boston newspapers routinely described her as ``America's
finest girl athlete'' and compared her popularity to that of Babe
Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   When she was this country's shining star leading up to the 1928
Olympics, only to fall inexplicably from the heavens when she
should have been glowing her steadiest and brightest.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, the honoree will likely have little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think very much of it,'' said Rogan of the nine
years, 1924-33, when she competed against the likes of Babe
Didrickson. ``We didn't make a big deal of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She still doesn't. Heck, why make a big deal out of five
straight national championships in the standing long jump from
1927-31? Or US titles in the 40-yard dash (5.4 seconds, 1928) and
50-yard dash (6.0 seconds, 1926)? Or a world record (11.20) in the
100? Or various national and New England championships in the high
jump, hurdles, shot put, and javelin?
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed, when you were also national champion in the
breaststroke and own gold medals in 12 events in two sports?
</P>
<P>
   Track, field, swimming, whatever. ``I just had a lot of fun,''
is how Rogan, her handshake still strong and calves still muscled,
sums it up. And you believe her.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she competed in anonymity. Far from it: The newspaper
clippings that daughter Kay Paltsios began to gather 20 years ago
from their attic hiding places (``I didn't know much about her; I
was amazed'') were glowing and plentiful, calling Rogan the
``Boston Miss who is the best all-around girl athlete in America''
and ``wonder girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan ``was right at the very start of Olympic track and field
for women, and competing in that time frame where they'd get 10,000
people for a track meet for women in New Jersey,'' explained Louise
Mead Tricard, author of ``American Women's Track and Field: A
History, 1895-1980.'' But trouble was brewing in the background,
and by the mid-1930s, a national organization of female physical
education instructors had persuaded the public that girls were too
frail to compete other than in ``play days'' _ a sentiment that
lingered for decades and dissuaded many girls of Paltsios's
generation from participating in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' she said when asked if she, too, had been an
athlete. ``My friends wouldn't have accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, on the other hand, recalls seldom feeling out of
place as a teenage athlete living on Fourth Street in South Boston.
``We never seemed to have any trouble, any one of us,'' she said.
Oh sure, the girls were cautioned not to wear their track pants too
short (``Now they almost wear nothing''), and once after a diving
competition at a local theater, Rogan was told not to come back to
school at St. Peter and Paul's unless her mother accompanied her to
explain how she dared appear on stage in a bathing suit. But for
the most part, she was left to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's athletic career _ although she would laugh at the word _
began casually enough, when she played around in Lake Boone, near
Hudson, where her family had a summer home. But soon she was
discovered by Ben Levias, described in a newspaper account as the
person ``in general charge of all New England girl athletes,'' and
progressed to the Boston Swimming Association, under whose banner
she both swam and ran.
</P>
<P>
   By 16, she was in her first track meet, on Boston Common.
``There were no lanes or anything,'' Rogan recalled. ``You just
ran.'' The one pair of track shoes you owned had to last for years.
The one track suit you owned showed up in photo after photo, year
after year. You spent days on trains traveling to distant meets, or
maybe you even took a boat. Your mother had to chaperone. You
didn't get much coaching. There weren't any hair dryers, so in the
winter after taking the bus to the T to the trolley, you got home
with icicles in your hair.
</P>
<P>
   And you didn't practice for hours every day the way they do now.
``Today they live at the pools,'' said Rogan. ``We went twice a
week, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years after her debut on the Common, she was being touted
as America's best hope for a medal at the 1928 Olympics, where
women would compete in track and field for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she can show such speed in the Olympics, victory should
crown her efforts,'' assessed one Boston newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But she never made it to Amsterdam, either as a swimmer or
sprinter. Advised by those in charge to enter the swimming trials
instead of track, young Mearls concentrated all her energy on the
pool, only to inexplicably fall apart at the Olympic trials and
fail to earn a spot on the team. ``I don't know what happened,''
she said at the time after making it to the finals before
imploding. ``I couldn't take a stroke. No, I wasn't nervous. Just
couldn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask her now what went wrong and she still shrugs. ``Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after she fell short in swimming, Rogan tried again
for a spot on the US Olympic team, this time in track. But she
hadn't been training and couldn't pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I didn't make the Olympic team in 1928, that's the only
time I was ever sad,'' Rogan said. ``But then I figured, `That's
the way it's supposed to be. I wasn't supposed to go.' There's a
reason for everything, you know. I probably would have got seasick
going across the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the men at the club advised her,'' added Paltsios, who
believes they saw swimming as a classier pursuit. ``I remember her
saying a long time ago she should never have done that. Track was
her first love.''
</P>
<P>
   Track, and Al Rogan. It was 71 years ago, when Katherine Mearls
was 18, that a carload of fellas came up to Lake Boone after a
meet. Rogan, himself a track star in Rhode Island, was one of them,
and four years later, they were wed in Watertown on Patriots Day,
1931.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the fans of running, ``We went from church to watch the
Marathon,'' said Rogan, who barely had time to change out of her
splendid wedding gown. ``Jimmy Henigan won.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who played tennis until he was 92, died three years
ago at 93.
</P>
<P>
   Although she says she ``must have'' competed for a few years
after marriage, the birth of Kay in 1933 put an end to that, except
for backyard track meets _ complete with pole vaulting and a high
jump pit _ later as Kay and son Al were growing up. ``In 1952, she
would have been 44 and she could easily have made the Olympic shot
put team,'' proclaimed her son, a track champion in the mid-1950s
out of Newton High School.
</P>
<P>
   It will be in that same backyard that Katherine Mearls Rogan
marks her 90th birthday, with memories but without pretense, with
family but without regrets. Some people live on their laurels and
dwell on their disappointments; Rogan has little interest in
either. Why does she need a medal from the Olympics when she has
plenty of others to go around the necks of her five grandchildren
and 11 great grandchildren?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with my life,'' she said. And you believe her.

CORPORATE MANAGERS OFFER ADVICE TO PUBLIC-SECTOR EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   E. B. Wilson never really retired. Nine years ago, the
67-year-old Chatham, Mass. resident ``stopped having to be
somewhere every day at 9 a.m.'' when he left Almay Inc., where he
was chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued working. Now he offers 35 years worth of
management expertise to area nonprofit groups _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and 140 other business executives and former top
corporate managers are volunteers for the Executive Service Corps a
Boston group which offers nonprofits hardnosed business advice from
the private sector on such organizational dilemmas as financial
planning, long-term strategy, and fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   As nonprofits face increasing pressure from donors for greater
financial accountability, managers and board members of social
service, cultural, and medical groups are gradually embracing some
elements of the traditional corporate outlook. Strategic plans
offer funding sources a glimpse at where their donation money will
go, and groups are learning to use benchmarks and data gathering to
measure how well their programs help their target population.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ESC, itself a nonprofit organization and the Boston
chapter of a loosely affiliated national network of similar groups.
For a small fee, which can range from about $200 to about $7,500,
depending on how much a nonprofit can afford, a ESC consulting team
will analyze a nonprofit's managerial and organizational problems
and help the group's board of directors come to a solution. The
nominal fee helps cover ESC's overhead costs; consultants work for
free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critical to the performance of the nonprofit agencies is their
capacity not only to serve their constituents,'' says Wilson, who
chaired ESC's board of directors for three years. ``They must be
business people as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And who better to aid nonprofit managers in their quest to
become business-savvy than former business executives. ESC's
volunteers come from the area's largest companies, including
BayBanks Inc., Polaroid Corp., and The Gillette Co. Others formerly
worked as lawyers or doctors, at smaller businesses, local
universities, or school systems. The group assists about 80 clients
a year.
</P>
<P>
   One such client is the Lowell Telecommunications Corp., &UR;  &LR; a
community group which offers public access television, satellite
downlinks, and a computer lab to Lowell residents. The line to use
the group's computer center in Lowell's historic district runs out
the door, says executive director George F. Preston. &UR;  &LR;  ``We're
suffering from too much success.''
</P>
<P>
   To solve the overcrowding problem, the group spent about $1,000
to hire ESC consultant Ann Dinsmoor Case the former assistant
superintendant of the Wellesley, Mass. school district. She is
helping the Lowell group write a strategic plan.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing nonprofits learn from ESC consultants is the
need to define a problem in specific terms. Each consulting
contract between a nonprofit and ESC includes the nonprofit's
assessment of its problem and a clear statement of what the ESC
consultants hope to accomplish. But it's up to the group's own
board to implement ESC's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are solving their own problems in their own way
with our help,'' says Edmund V. Marshall, 72, a retired group vice
president with Textron Corp. who lives in East Greenwich, R.I. In
his five years volunteering for ESC, Marshall says he's discovered
nonprofits and private corporations have more in common than most
people think. But other ESC consultants say there are many
differences between the two sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them don't think in terms of competitors, but they do
have competitors,'' says consultant Robert E. Ray, 62, a Boston
resident who retired as a vice president of Gillette in 1990. &UR;  &LR; 
Nonprofits also define their customers in a different way, says
John B. Roll, 63, a former manager with Xenergy Inc. Unlike
businesses, nonprofits must satisfy both the clients they help and
the donors whose funds keep their doors open. ``There's a
disconnect between the customer and who pays for (the service),''
says Roll, who joined ESC four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the differences in approach, consultants say the
nonprofit managers with whom they've worked have taken to
traditional business tactics like benchmarking and aggressive
marketing with aplomb. ESC's customer satisfaction surveys reveal
that ``not 100 percent, but 85 or 90 percent'' of nonprofit clients
are happy with the service, Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofits say they appreciate the cost-effective help as well.
</P>
<P>
   Action Inc., a Gloucester, Mass. community agency, has used ESC
for five consulting assignments over the past three years with Roll
as lead consultant, says executive director William C.
Rochford. &UR;  &LR; Roll's team revamped the group's fundraising efforts,
convincing the board of directors to send out three targeted
letters to donors instead of one blanket letter. The ESC
consultants also did a needs-assessment survey for the community
and helped Action launch a new program for homeless job training.
</P>
<P>
   ESC's strength, Rochford says, comes from the group's neutrality
and outsider perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hire a planner or community organizer in this
business, they come in already with an agenda, whether it's food or
housing or women's rights or welfare,'' Rochford says. ``ESC is
more open to what the real needs in the community are.''

SOX SHAKE HEADS AS SCHAEFER, KENNEY LOSE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ On the face of it, Mo Vaughn's recent venting
against the Red Sox and Bob Schaefer's ouster as the team's
director of player development would seem to have little in common.
</P>
<P>
   But at the center of both Vaughn's disaffection and Schaefer's
demotion is general manager Dan Duquette and what some perceive as
his insistence on complete control, even at the expense of his star
slugger and a longtime baseball man who was instrumental in
reversing the fortunes of the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do the best I could,'' Schaefer said Tuesday from
his home in Connecticut. ``I thought my job was to make the system
look good and the general manager look good. The general manager
got a three-year contract, so I must have done my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has not yet made it official, but Schaefer's duties are
being taken over by Kent Qualls and Buddy Bailey. Qualls, 31, began
in player development with Montreal in 1988, the year Duquette was
hired by the Expos, and was the Expos' director of minor league
operations until 1995, when Duquette hired him as trainer for
Boston's Triple A team in Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Qualls began this season as coordinator of baseball development
and administration; his duties included overseeing the team's
Dominican operation and involvement with its international
scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, meanwhile, managed at Pawtucket, was the major league
advance scout last season, and this season was working as the
team's roving instructor for catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who will report to Qualls under the restructuring of
duties, is highly regarded throughout the system for his baseball
knowledge. Qualls, who unlike Schaefer did not play professionally,
is viewed more dimly, according to club sources, as a paper-pusher
and Duquette yes man. In fairness to Qualls, however, there are
numerous player development people around the big leagues who did
not play pro ball. ``You can't knock his ability as a baseball
person,'' said Kevin Shea, director of Red Sox communications.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette and Schaefer, according to sources, clashed on numerous
occasions this summer over minor league personnel decisions and
also over what Duquette perceived as self-promotion by Schaefer for
the success of the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Duquette had broached the subject of Schaefer
taking too much credit, Schaefer hedged. ``I don't know,'' he said.
``Indirectly, I guess. But I'm proud of what we did. It's `we,' not
`me.' We helped upgrade the situation, and Ed Kenney and I worked
together, and we're not done yet. That's what bothers me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette also is known to be unhappy with the stalled progress
of prized center-field prospect Michael Coleman, who recently was
benched for several games because of his attitude. Schaefer, asked
if he were being held responsible for Coleman's problems, said,
``Maybe that's part of it. I've talked to Michael Coleman more than
anybody. Maybe my way didn't work, but Coleman is still a young kid
and he had tremendous talent. Patience is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Schaefer, Kenney's involvement with the minor leagues is
over, which ends his family's long association with Red Sox player
development. Kenney's father, Edward F. Kenney, spent more than 45
years with the Red Sox, and the team's player development award is
in his name.
</P>
<P>
   As in Schaefer's case, Kenney, the director of minor league
operations, was offered a lesser position with the team and
reportedly will leave rather than accept it. Kenney did not respond
to messages left on his voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Shea denied a report that Kenney had been fired but said
Duquette would not comment on the changes. ``Reassignments are
being made, and the process is still ongoing,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other changes as well. Roving infield instructor
Rafael Santana, the former Mets shortstop who was in his third
season with the Sox, has been fired, according to a source, and
several key minor league coaches and instructors are talking about
leaving if Schaefer doesn't stay. There also are indications,
sources say, that Pawtucket manager Ken Macha will not be asked
back next season in that position. And Pawtucket batting coach
Gerald Perry, who also came under some fire from Duquette over
Coleman, according to one source, also may look to leave, that
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said he was offered the title of director of Florida
operations but has not been told what the job entails. ``It's just
a title,'' he said. ``I'm a baseball guy. I don't care about the
other stuff. If the job does not include baseball, I wouldn't be
interested. I really don't want to leave the Red Sox, but before I
accept this job, I want to see what the job is.''
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval in the system came after organization meetings last
week at the Providence Hilton. At one point during the meetings,
according to sources, Duquette pulled Schaefer into the hall for a
10-minute discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the shakeup is unusual. This is the time of year
when minor league players are evaluated, when decisions are made
about which players will be asked to play winter ball, which
players will be assigned to the instructional league, and which
players will be promoted to the Red Sox in September, when rosters
can be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised it came out like this,'' said Schaefer, who
came to the Red Sox in 1993, when he was hired by then GM Lou
Gorman as a special assignment scout. ``I told Dan last year that I
didn't want to do this job forever, but that doesn't mean I didn't
want to be involved in the baseball part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could help Buddy, I could help Kent, I could do a little
scouting, I'm pretty close to the players. Jimy (Williams) and I
had a good rapport. No one knows the system better than I do. But
it's almost like they don't need you anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer was asked if he thought of going over Duquette's head
to CEO John Harrington, as one source said he was contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's my boss,'' said Schaefer. ``He's the one calling the
shots. I'm not going to be changing anybody's minds. He has the
authority to do what he has to do. So I accept it. I'm not happy
about it, but what can I say? Life goes on.''

VETERAN ROBERT GREEN ADDS EXPERIENCE TO YOUNG PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Drew Bledsoe dumps the ball off in the right
flat to the Patriot wearing No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The running back makes a quick little move, slipping a hit by
Chris Slade, and turns what might have been a loss into a gain.
</P>
<P>
   A Patriot training camp flashback at Bryant College: Bledsoe to
David Meggett? Nah. Just Bledsoe to the newest Patriot running
back, who happens to be a little Meggett-like.
</P>
<P>
   He wears the same number _ and did for his four years in
Chicago, by the way. He's built somewhat the same at 5 feet 8
inches, 202 pounds. He gets around the football field in somewhat
the same manner. Like Meggett, Robert Green made his first marks in
the NFL on special teams. And like Meggett did in recent years
before being released in the spring, he would like to make his mark
with this team as a special-teams player and third-down specialist.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, differences. Green brings none of the Pro
Bowl honors that Meggett brought. He brings only a small percentage
of the thousands of yards Meggett gained on rushes and catches and
returns in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But he does bring something otherwise lacking in what shapes up
as an extremely young Patriots running game: experience.
</P>
<P>
   This is his seventh year in the NFL since he joined the
Washington Redskins as a free agent out of William &AMP; Mary in 1992.
He'd love to run the ball all the time but figures he's more likely
to be called upon in third-down situations as well as on special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could look into a crystal ball or something, I think
basically I'd be a third-down back here,'' Green said, ``and show
some of the younger running backs some of the things they need to
to do to be successful in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when to get out of bounds, when to get down,'' Green
said. ``When to juke and when to run over a guy. All of that stuff
that only comes with experience. I think that's something I can
definitely bring to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he was beginning to get a little concerned about
whether he would get the chance to bring his experience to any
camp.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, things got a little close. Green had been released
by Chicago in March and didn't sign with Minnesota until two days
before camp.
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing compared to this year. He played in only three
games with the Vikings last year and was looking for work again.
And was still looking when NFL camps started.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the Patriots, looking for some experience to go
with the young legs of Robert Edwards and Sedrick Shaw, Derrick
Cullors and Harold Shaw, brought him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it gets closer to camp, you get a little more anxious
waiting to get that call,'' Green said. ``You try to think
positively. If you don't, it's tough to go work out with really no
reason to.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it did occur to him that this might be the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crosses your mind,'' he said. ``It's the first time I've
ever actually been late for camp. The first time in seven years.
There very definitely was a point where I thought maybe this is it.
You never know.'
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to get caught up in one of those
six-years-and-out situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start to tail off around the sixth year,'' Green said.
``I want to get this one in and go past that hurdle, and hopefully,
that will keep things going all right for me for the next couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Green was here Friday and scored a touchdown on a 12-yard
reception from Tom Tupa in Sunday's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews on the newest Patriot have been mixed thus far, said
Pete Carroll Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been up and down so far,'' the coach said. ``He missed a
couple of meetings. I think he and I have come back together and
(Ernie Zampese) has been letting him know what we're looking for.
He stuck the ball in pretty good today. I think he has made a
pretty good impression so far. He's very quick and instinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's here, said Green, he plans to make the most of the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about that kind of stuff,'' he said of making
the team. ``When I'm in camp, I let my work on the field talk for
me. It's never let me down to this point. I've got to keep on doing
the things I need to do and let them worry about who's going to
stay and who's not.''

   CLINTON-LEWINSKY _ WASHINGTON _ Both publicly and behind the
scenes, the White House is working to counter a week of legal
setbacks for President Clinton. His legal team is weighing options
including appeals, a possible constitutional challenge and even
deposing independent counsel Kenneth Starr's own team. As always,
Clinton remains free to simply describe to the public the nature of
his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky, an option
aides say has not received much attention in the Oval Office.
(Deans, Cox News Service 900).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky's immunity deal has
sent a new tide of anonymously sourced stories into print and over
the air, but prominent journalists defended them Wednesday as the
only way to get information to the public. While the sources refuse
to be identifed, they are reliable, the journalists said. ``They're

low-level nuclear waste dump in Texas near the Mexican border. The

Capitol Hill on Thursday to make one last-ditch push for passage of
a bill in the Senate that would allow Puerto Ricans to vote on
their island's future this year. The bill, which already passed the
House, would allow Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood,
independence, and commonwealth status. Senate Majority Leader Trent

   STATESCHOOL-BUS _ AUSTIN _ Throughout this fireball summer,
nearly 40 people with mental retardation were forced to endure bus
rides on the Austin State School campus in an unair-conditioned bus
where temperatures soared to 110 degrees. State inspectors deemed
the situation life-threatening, particularly because some of the
disabled residents have seizure disorders and take anticonvulsant
drugs that put them at high risk for heat stroke. (Gamino, Austin

   AUS-GANG -INJUNCTION _ The state wraps up its case today in
Texas' first-ever gang injunction lawsuit. If Judge Wil Flowers
approves the injunction _ which he seems inclined to do _ the group
of six would be prohibited for life from hanging out at businesses
and apartment complexes at Cameron and Broadmoor in Northeast
Austin. While ACLU and defense attorneys say such injunctions are
unconstitutional, state attorneys say they are an effective legal
tool helping police keep neighborhoods crime-free. If Flowers
approves this first one, lawyers say it is likely that the Travis
County district attorney's office, along with every other
prosecutor's shop in the state, will begin to use injunctions.

SPIELBERG'S `RYAN' IS THE MOTHER OF ALL WAR MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS and G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One reason ``Saving Private Ryan'' is being
talked about so much this summer is that it goes right after the
audience from the start, grabbing people out of their seats to drag
them through a half-hour of combat _ no jokes, no breathers, no
chance to relax. It's the first time a major war film has allowed
itself to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Other war movies have tried to be graphic about wounds and
killing and the cruelty of everyday combat. Other films have
broadcast the anti-war message, offering realistic dialogue and
shattering images. But ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with long,
teeth-grinding battle scenes that begin and end the movie, breaks
new ground _ it makes things uncomfortable for the audience from
start to finish, its idea of a breather being the haunted sound of
Edith Piaf playing from a gramophone before the final German
attack.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the bite-sized, bloodless combat in Audie Murphy's
``To Hell and Back'' becomes a comic book. Ditto for all the John
Wayne epics, from ``Flying Tigers'' to ``The Green Berets.'' That's
to be expected _ propaganda films like ``The Fighting Seabees,''
``The Purple Heart'' and ``Green Berets'' weren't meant to be
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   But in its commitment to unrelenting battle scenes, ``Saving
Private Ryan'' also breaks tradition with anti-war films, which
tend to parcel out their pain. It goes further than the original
``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' further than ``Platoon'' and
``Stalingrad,'' ``Attack!'' and ``The Bridge'' and ``The Hook.''
Further than ``The Bridges of Toko-Ri'' or ``Steel Helmet,'' and
much further than the smug ``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Steven Spielberg said he felt a duty to World War II
veterans ``to finally acquit them of their experience in a
non-Hollywood way, if I possibly could pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking with them, Spielberg said, ``The signal they were
giving me was, `Look, we're 80, we're 70, we're 75 years old. Tell
our stories. The way we experienced it. Not the way we're used to
telling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drew my own line in the sands of Omaha Beach. I just
couldn't sugarcoat what happened in Normandy,'' Spielberg said.
```Saving Private Ryan' would therefore fall into a long line of
WWII films that have simply used World War II as an excuse for
action and adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who extended the original D-Day scene from five to 35
pages, said, ``I made it about a 24-minute sequence because I
wanted to initiate the audience the way these boys were initiated
when they hit those beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Historian Stephen E. Ambrose said that, compared to ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' movies such as ``The Longest Day,'' ``A Bridge Too
Far'' and ``Patton'' ``are kindergarten films.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of war films, said Ambrose, is ``that every time a
GI gets hit, he's dead ... but in the vast majority of cases, he
suffers. He knows he's been hit, and he knows he's dying, and he's
trying to put his guts back in his stomach ... and that's what you
get with Spielberg. You do not get that in another American war
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous war films committed to degrees of realism, such as ``A
Walk in the Sun,'' ``Pork Chop Hill,'' ``Paths of Glory'' and ``Das
Boot,'' have to step aside for ``Saving Private Ryan.'' And formula
movies like ``The Victors,'' ``Midway,'' ``The Big Red One,''
``Patton'' and ``Catch-22'' become soap operas in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Fuller, director of ``The Big Red One'' and ``Steel
Helmet,'' acknowledged pulling his punches. In a recent documentary
he said, ``I lied with the camera. I lied like hell. I didn't want
people to leave.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those films, ``Saving Private Ryan'' doesn't take
periodic detours to preach at the audience or give people a chance
to say, ``Whew, that was pretty rough'' as they get up to go buy
some popcorn. Spielberg's movie keeps coming at you, from that
first moment when the ramp of the assault boat hits the water and
machine guns open up on the men crowded inside, the sound of
bullets hitting flesh and metal filling the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the beach-invasion movies you've seen, how the ramp
comes down and men run off, one falling over here, another over
there, some blips of sand exploding to show how close the bullets
are _ a kind of ``Aw, that's too bad'' sense of watching soldiers
die.
</P>
<P>
   You think of ``Beachhead'' and ``Battle Cry,'' of ``Guadalcanal
Diary,'' with a helmet rolling through the sand, a photo of a
family tucked inside. They're all shallow and serene, compared to
the blood-letting in the first few minutes of ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's Normandy scenes show up ``D-Day: The Sixth of June''
and Darryl Zanuck's ``The Longest Day'' for the contrived and
Hollywoodish movies they are. Robert Mitchum shouting ``Let's go!''
can't hold a candle to the confusion and slaughter that Tom Hanks
faces as he staggers and crawls to find one spot free from bullets.
</P>
<P>
   When Hanks falls to his knees on the beach, suddenly deaf,
turning through metallic silence to see a man casually pick up an
arm blown off by artillery, another clutching at an ooze of guts,
another, legless, thrashing at the sand, the audience is trained to
think, from past movies, that the slaughter will end in a minute or
two. It doesn't. Hanks leads an attack on a bunker that descends
into butchery, emotional breakdowns and the random killing of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   It marks perhaps the first time an American film has been able
to make war a truly gruesome experience for those sitting in the
safety of the theater _ an unrelenting attack on the senses, a
tension marathon, an endurance race toward the night air outside.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Saving Private Ryan'' will make any difference in the
way people see war _ World War II in particular _ remains to be
seen. But at least Spielberg tried. At least he didn't take it easy
on his audience, the way so many war films have done in the past.

`LUCKY BASTARD,' THE BEACH BOOK OF THE SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles McCarry's ``Lucky Bastard'' (Random House, $24.95, 385
pages) is going to be compared to Richard Condon's ``The Manchurian
Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, both books deal with a sleeper agent whose ultimate
goal is the takeover of the U.S. government. Both books are
political satires _ ``Manchurian'' wickedly sophisticated,
``Lucky'' devilishly politically incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky Bastard'' begins with Soviet agent Dimitri, the book's
narrator, trying to recruit students in New York during the Vietnam
War. A professor suggests Dimitri take a look at young John
Fitzgerald Adams _ a political science major from Ohio who believes
he is the illegitimate son of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   And young Jack is the perfect candidate _ he's amoral, a coward,
a draft dodger, a womanizer (he always carries a jar of Vaseline in
his pocket), a charmer, and everyone who meets him likes him.
Dimitri tells his control, Peter, about Jack, and the two rogue KGB
agents set in motion a plan to make Jack the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   First they get Jack a fellowship at the University of Heidelberg
in Germany, then get him into law school at Harvard, where he meets
the strong-willed Morgan, another sleeper agent who will become his
wife. Jack returns to Ohio and sets up a law practice with his best
friend from childhood, Danny, a crippled Vietnam veteran. And of
course, Jack runs for office, beginning with district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   What Jack's handlers don't know about and therefore can't
control is Danny's wife, Cindy, who has always hated Jack.
</P>
<P>
   This thriller is funny, well-crafted and, unfortunately, very
believable. You can't read it and not think of Clinton and the
Kennedys. McCarry goes a bit overboard with the sex scenes, but it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it, ``Lucky Bastard'' is this summer's must-read
beach book.
</P>

<P>
   ``The Dog Who Bit a Policeman.'' By Stuart M. Kaminsky. $22. 288
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky's 12th Moscow police procedural featuring one-legged
Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov is a worthy addition to the series.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Russia, a mafia member is found floating naked and
face down in the Moscow River and others turn up equally dead in
hotel swimming pools. Rostnikov must track down each mob's leader
and try to halt an all-out mafia war.
</P>
<P>
   As wild dogs roam Moscow streets in search of food, other
mobsters are setting up dog fights, and the profits are huge.
Rostnikov sends in an undercover team to track down the leaders and
close the fights down. Meanwhile, he sends his son and another
detective off to track a missing high government official who is
needed for a key vote and is assumed to be off on a long drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Rostnikov and his team of officers are dedicated, loyal even
when the paychecks are often delayed. From the mob bosses to the
underlings, the prostitutes to Rostnikov's family and friends _ all
the characters are well-defined and believable. My only quibble is
the too-cute title _ Rostnikov and gang deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Gatekeeper.'' By Philip Shelby. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25. 331
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby offers up a gutsy heroine facing life-threatening
situations in a fast-paced, first-rate international thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago during a lawn party at the U.S. Embassy in
Paris, a sniper known as the Handyman killed the parents of
11-year-old Hollis Fremont. However, he wasn't supposed to kill
Hollis' mother, so he's been hiding out in Marseilles all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now grown up, Hollis moves to Paris as a U.S. Foreign Service
officer. She falls madly in love with Paul McGann, a high-ranking
embassy official. He asks her to escort a white-collar criminal
back to New York. Unfortunately, the criminal kills a man in the
subway and forces Hollis to continue with him to New York. There
more killings occur, and special government agent Sam Crawford
saves Hollis when the killer goes after her. Crawford, whose main
task is hunting down assassins, at first believes Hollis was an
accomplice, but then realizes she was McGann's pawn. Crawford tells
her the killer is the notorious assassin Handyman, and now Hollis
must come to terms with the fact that the man she loves used her
and set her up to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford enlists Hollis' help in trying to stop Handyman before
he completes his assassination. But Handyman goes after them,
nearly kills them, and gets them put on all the most-wanted lists
after a SWAT team tracking them gets blown up.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough plot turns in ``Gatekeeper'' to make you dizzy,
as Shelby keeps you guessing right to end. He's crafted a wild
assortment of interesting characters, drops in realistic dialogue
and moves the storyline along at a brisk pace. A fine addition to
the genre.

TONI MORRISON EXPLORES A NEW KIND OF LOVE IN `PARADISE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To read the works of Toni Morrison requires a
certain intensity and patience. She will pull you in on the thread
of images that unravel humanity's mysteries and truths layer by
layer, paragraph by paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   If you manage to keep up, the end of the odyssey rewards you
with interior sight. Where you were blind to the weight of love,
joy and pain, she helps you see.
</P>
<P>
   It is not so different hearing her speak. One might be
intimidated by the authority her name, her novels and the title of
Nobel laureate carry, but the weight of her presence, not unlike
her words, lands gently, surely.
</P>
<P>
   So it was last week when she walked onto two San Francisco-area
stages, at the Marriott Convention Center in Oakland and the Palace
of Fine Arts in San Francisco. The audiences responded with regal
welcomes standing almost immediately as they saw her silver and
white crown of neatly wrapped dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Marriott Convention Center and the Palace of Fine Arts might
as well have been enlarged living rooms when she sat down first
with Marcus Books founder Raye Richardson and later with author
Dorothy Allison. The meandering conversations visited such
ponderous themes as hope in the face of despair and redemption at
the foot of unforgivable acts, both of which have re-emerged in her
latest novel ``Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a light side to Morrison. A thick giggle
emerges when she talks of the upcoming movie-version of her 1987
book, ``Beloved,'' or even the recent publication of Modern
Library's 100 Best English-language novels of the century.
</P>
<P>
   That list, which came out earlier this month, placed James
Joyce's ``Ulysses'' in the number one slot and boasted only eight
women authors, none of whom were African American.
</P>
<P>
   Raye Richardson, former chair of black studies at San Francisco
State University, called the list ridiculous for not including at
least two Morrison titles. And Dorothy Allison balked that
``Beloved'' wasn't at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that says 100 of anything, you know that's
marketing,'' Morrison said, laughter streaming between her words.
``Those are their (Modern Library's) books. I am in (published by)
the `Everyman' line that includes Proust and some international
writers. So there was never any way that Modern Library was going
to put me on that list since I was already in Everyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Intimately familiar with the publishing game _ she was a senior
editor for Random House for 15 years _ she has witnessed the
industry becoming consumed with multimillion dollar deals and big
money gambles. But Morrison said she was not discouraged by the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very energized by people telling me no, I can't do it. And
when something seems to be falling apart it makes me more eager to
do it well. ... You have to husband your work. You have to just
hold and feed it and cultivate it. The interesting thing about
novel writing is protecting it, cultivating it and at the same time
making it the one part of your life that's totally public.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be one of the aspects that Morrison loves about
her work; bringing her literary themes to the community table to
chew on.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Paradise,'' Morrison said she wanted to shift the public
discourse from one focusing on the legal to one exploring the
moral; from a fascination with crime to an examination of sin; from
an obsession with guilt to an openness to contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise'' is the third tome of what Morrison calls a trilogy
that includes ``Beloved'' and ``Jazz.'' She said when she first
began ``Beloved'' she thought she was writing one book with three
parts exploring the many types of love that, if indulged too much,
can overwhelm and destroy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beloved,'' the story of an escaped slave who kills her
child to keep the child out of slavery, Morrison explores interior
love, one that emerges in a mother for her child, that turns
destructive when it becomes excessive.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jazz,'' she examines the romantic love between a married
man and an 18-year-old woman. It is a love that consumes him so
that he kills her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradise'' looks at spiritual love, the love of God. ``It too
can be excessive, dictatorial and very all-knowing,'' Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The book, which some critics have described as a parable, takes
readers to the fictional all-black town, Ruby, Okla., started by
nine families whose ancestors had been shunned from other black
towns because they came with nothing, breaking the rule, ``Come
Prepared or Not at All.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the families literally carry their history in
stone and in their unbending, righteous view of themselves as the
chosen ones, until they begin to turn in on themselves and on a
nearby ``Convent'' of dispossessed women.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the creation of paradise you have a clear example of having
the privilege of a chosen people; that God is guiding and talking
to you, which is lovely and desirable,'' she said. ``Of course
within that phrase `chosen people' is the seed of destruction
because paradise is about the unchosen. Paradises tend to be
exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The story ``Paradise'' grew out of a question Morrison asked
while reading the history of 200 freed men who walked from
Mississippi to Oklahoma trying to settle in one of the black towns.
They had no money, few possessions and were turned away because
they did not come prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to those people who were told by ex-slaves you
can't come in? ... that must have been a blow,'' she said. ``That
would have been a knock-out for me to walk from Mississippi to
arrive there and some other black people say, `You can't come
in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Paradise'' and ``Beloved'' were placed on Oprah's Book
Club list, boosting sales by 3,000 percent at some major chains.
Now Oprah Winfrey has just finished co-producing and starring in
``Beloved,'' the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set in Ohio after the Civil War, with Winfrey
playing the main character, Sethe, backed by Danny Glover, Thandie
Newton and Kimberly Elise. Jonathan Demme directs.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said she sold the complete rights and had no say in its
production. But she has seen two versions of the movie and said she
was impressed with Winfrey's portrayal of Sethe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I don't know how to make movies,'' she said,
emphasizing that she writes books, not movie scripts. ``Even if I
could do that well, it's a complete life. You give a year over to
it and they don't let you fire anybody. So I can't say get off the
set. You have responsibilities without power and I don't like those
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her laughter was light but the point as resonant as her
presence.

HORSE RACING STRUGGLES TO COMPETE IN AN ERA OF SLOT MACHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GOTTLIEB  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The setting is an entertainment haven. The new racing season is
brief and loaded with family events. Quality horses are set to
compete and there isn't a slot machine to be found for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   It could be opening day at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But this is suburban Dallas, home of Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie, packing them in its second year of existence, even as
tracks nationwide are being turned over to dog races, festivals or
wrecking crews.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star relies on a formula heavy on atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you a couple of things we have in common with
Saratoga: Saratoga is an afternoon of entertainment and it just so
happens the core product is world-class racing,'' said Corey
Johnsen, vice president and general manager at Lone Star. ``We
pride ourselves in the same philosophy of entertainment. That's
what sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Race Course opened for its 130th season Wednesday, once
again becoming the main event of a resort atmosphere that reaches
well beyond the hard-core gambler. That is an environment the
nation's oldest racetrack shares with its successful counterparts,
such as Churchill Downs in Kentucky and Del Mar in California.
</P>
<P>
   As weaker tracks founder, these strong thoroughbred-racing
venues share other key virtues: they are situated in areas largely
uncluttered by other forms of gambling, and they schedule brief,
defined seasons that leave enthusiasts looking forward to the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the novelty of it,'' said jockey Richard Migliore, who
was the second leading New York Racing Association jockey last
year. ``Coming upstate is beautiful, you have the historical town
of Saratoga, the product is just fantastic and it's condensed into
six weeks. Sometimes, less is better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saratoga, the season stretches to Sept. 7, with the $750,000
Travers Stakes scheduled for Aug. 29. Last year 991,000 spectators
wagered an average $3.7 million a day, according to the New York
Racing Association, ranking Saratoga among the nation's most
successful tracks.
</P>
<P>
   New York Racing Association chief executive Terry Meyocks
cautioned that the success at Saratoga relies on a delicate balance
of marketing and atmosphere, which could be thrown off by
competition. Periodic efforts to introduce off-reservation casino
gambling in New York state are among perennial concerns to the
track. The state Legislature last year turned back a proposal to
allow gambling halls near Lake George, in the Catskills and western
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep the competition out of our doorstep,'' Meyocks
said. ``I hope people in New York realize what would be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   With betting on thoroughbreds up slightly nationwide, racing
analysts say the tracks themselves are on a Darwinian course.
Thoroughbred Racing Communications, a New York City-based industry
group, said the total handle was $11.6 billion in 1996, up from
$9.3 billion in 1990. But nearly 80 percent of the bets are placed
off-track, making the tracks themselves a less integral part of the
equation than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general there is too much product out there,'' said Tom
Merritt, executive director of Thoroughbred Racing Communications.
``I think you're already seeing the fittest survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent casualties include Atlantic City Race Course, which
concluded live racing last spring; Detroit Race Course, scheduled
to close this year; and Birmingham Turf Club, which now runs dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington International Race Course, outside Chicago, remains in
a suspended state, with no racing this year and no certainty that
the horses will be back in 1999. Like others that have foundered
before it, the track is being crushed by nearby competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the country's most profitable riverboat casinos is 10
miles from us, and we're seeing just a continual erosion of horse
racing as more and more casinos opened and feed off the Chicago
marketplace,'' said Scott Mordell, chief executive of Arlington.
``The horse racing just isn't as attractive anymore in Illinois.
What do we do?''
</P>
<P>
   One approach has been tried in Delaware, where a track decided
to join forces with gambling. Delaware Park benefited from state
legislation that enabled it to add slot machines at the track. The
move quickly boosted attendance and racing. However, some observers
wonder if the success of the slots might prove too much of a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What scares people now is the scenario that has mangers
saying, `Gee we don't need the water trucks and the barns and the
starting gates to simply run slot machines,''' Merritt said.

<P>
   He did not beat about the bush. The slaughter of Russia's royal
family, including a sad little sick boy and four girls, was, Boris
Yeltsin said, ``one of the most shameful pages in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing before the royal family's coffins as they were about to
be interred 80 years after the murder, Russia's head of state
publicly took the nation's guilt on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   No semantic quibbles. No expressions of regret or sorrow instead
of candid apology and acceptance of guilt. No mitigating mention of
the czar's own weak and incompetent, if not deliberately murderous,
autocracy. Yeltsin's repentance was timely and moving.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, in a larger sense, off the point. The murder of the
czar and his family was but a tiny speck on the vast canvas of
horror painted in Russian blood for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have, on the whole, dismally failed to face up to the
truth: that millions of them, many still alive, were directly
involved, as culprits as well as victims, in the biggest and most
prolonged mass-murder of modern times; that millions more were
morally submerged in a quagmire of silence and complicity; that
millions, even today, do not wish to know what really happened, or
to acknowledge the enormity of the crimes done in the name of
communism _ and have not told their children and grandchildren what
they do know.
</P>
<P>
   And until Russians face up to their past, they will never
achieve their vaunted aim of becoming a ``normal'' country.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable, in the awful trauma of post-communist
disorientation and loss of national pride, that people should fend
off the prospect of yet more self-abasing humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries with big histories have to wrench themselves into
gazing into the darker chasms of their past: Americans about
slavery and the near-genocide of their country's indigenous
peoples, Britons about the racial arrogance and cruel excesses of
empire, Spaniards and Italians about fratricidal war and fascism,
the French about collaboration and cowardice, and Germans _ most
acutely of all _ about the Holocaust and the slaughter of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time. Moreover, Russia's evil regime was not, like
Germany's, destroyed in battle. There was no conqueror to shove a
mirror before the face of the ideologically vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mikhail Gorbachev, liberal Russian historians and
journalists began to expose the past and devastate the old ideology
of lies. But, that done, the new thirst for the whole truth largely
vanished too.
</P>
<P>
   People, it seemed, did not want to know. It was, perhaps, too
painful. And ugly untruths about the past have returned to feed
unrepentant Communists and their strange quasi-fascist bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin's presidency fades, he should build on his statement
last week that ``We must not lie to ourselves.'' He should appoint
a grand commission, perhaps headed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, to
oversee a comprehensive history of Russia's own holocaust which, in
one form or another, would be compulsory reading in every school in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he should encourage historians to spell out, in every vile
detail, the horror of Russia's past _ so that it is never
repeated. &QL;

   It takes time. Moreover, Russia's evil regime was not, like
Germany's, destroyed in battle. There was no conqueror to shove a
mirror before the face of the ideologically vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mikhail Gorbachev, liberal Russian historians and
journalists began to expose the past and devastate the old ideology
of lies. But, that done, the new thirst for the whole truth largely
vanished too.
</P>
<P>
   People, it seemed, did not want to know. It was, perhaps, too
painful. And ugly untruths about the past have returned to feed
unrepentant Communists and their strange quasi-fascist bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin's presidency fades, he should build on his statement
last week that ``We must not lie to ourselves.'' He should appoint
a grand commission, perhaps headed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, to
oversee a comprehensive history of Russia's own holocaust which, in
one form or another, would be compulsory reading in every school in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he should encourage historians to spell out, in every vile
detail, the horror of Russia's past _ so that it is never
repeated. &QL;

   ST. LOUIS _ Come 2000, the state of Missouri may well have not
one but two favorite sons in the presidential race. One is Richard
Gephardt, the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives.
The other is John Ashcroft, the state's junior Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Gephardt disclaims any interest in another bid for the
White House _ concentrating instead, he says, on an effort to take
back control of the House and dethrone Newt Gingrich as Speaker _
Ashcroft has all but declared his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   He has already been in Iowa, favorite starting ground of
presidential contenders, scooping out ice-cream sundaes for
grateful members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Although some see him just as a more courteous version of Pat
Buchanan, the fact is that Ashcroft is fast emerging as the
consensus candidate of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   He has been all but endorsed by Pat Robertson, a televangelist
and former Republican candidate for president; and, with the
backing of the Christian Coalition, he has won the South Carolina
straw poll, beating contenders who included Governor George W. Bush
of Texas and a former vice-president, Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other Republican candidates, who put on religiosity
when it suits them, Ashcroft _ the son of a minister and a
semiprofessional gospel singer _ is a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate he has taken a vigorous part in the war on
``partial-birth'' abortions, needle-exchange programs and legalized
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   He has blocked the nomination of several candidates for federal
judgeships on ideological grounds, a tactic that even Republicans
implored him to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   He led an unsuccessful fight against the appointment of David
Satcher to the post of surgeon-general because of Dr. Satcher's
views on AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is also among the most outspoken of Bill Clinton's
Republican critics, demanding his resignation or impeachment on
grounds of immorality.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, his political career was notable less for his
achievements than for the fact that the Democrats never really put
up a convincing opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A spell as state attorney-general was followed by two terms as
governor, during which Ashcroft vetoed a bill allowing alcohol to
be sold on Sunday on the ground that one provision would have
allowed sales of alcohol-flavored sweets to minors.
</P>
<P>
   But his time in office was remarkably free of scandal. Perhaps
the most embarrassing incident was when he was caught ordering the
opening of the state library at a weekend to allow his children to
research their school projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is often contrasted with Kit Bond, his senior Senate
colleague and his predecessor in the governor's mansion. He is a
theoretician, people say, where Bond is a pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent vote on NATO expansion, for instance, Ashcroft
strongly opposed expansion on principle; Bond, mindful of the
defense jobs back home, voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ashcroft, too, has demonstrated flashes of pragmatism.
During his governorship, Missouri became one of the first states to
mark Martin Luther King's birthday; and when he was confronted with
a referendum to make Missouri a ``right-to-work'' (anti-union)
state, he jumped on the bandwagon that overwhelmingly defeated the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   How far will he go? Not as far as he hopes before he bumps up
against people more squeamish about the mixing of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   For Ashcroft, the abolition of the ``marriage penalty'' from the
tax code is a crusade to preserve the sanctity of family life.
Among his latest causes is a proposal to put public money directly
into church-run welfare programs. Thus is God's work accomplished,
according to the junior senator from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   That gleam in the eye is liable to make many Americans nervous. &QL;

IS AMERICA'S ECONOMY TOO HOT, TOO COLD, OR JUST RIGHT?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Americans accustomed to a continuous stream of
good economic news, recent days have been unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   First a barrage of statistics suggested the economy was slowing
down, fast. The trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion in May, as
exports to Asia plummeted. Industrial production tumbled 0.6
percent in June, its fastest drop in over five years, as the
General Motors strike took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually overnight, economic pundits slashed their estimates of
output growth; some suggested that the economy might have shrunk
between April and June.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton devoted his weekly radio address to the
plight of the country's farmers _ hit hard by overproduction and
falling demand in Asia _ and offered federal dollars to buy up
surplus wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, struck a
different note. In his half-yearly review of the economy to
Congress on July 21, he worried more about the threat of higher
inflation than of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that Asia's woes were ``demonstrably''
restraining demand for American goods, Greenspan reckoned there was
still a ``significant'' risk of a pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his concern was America's tight labor markets. He
pointed out (yet again) that the number of people working was
growing at a far faster rate than the working-age population.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot go on. To prevent inflationary wage pressure, demand
had to slow. If this did not occur naturally, Greenspan made it
clear (a number of times) that interest rates must rise.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You have reason to be, for America's economy, which
for so long has seemed neither too hot nor too cold, is
particularly tricky to interpret right now.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are several powerful forces cooling it down: the
Asian crisis, the General Motors strike, and an inventory
correction as firms reduce their stocks of unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side there are plenty of signs of heat: with low
unemployment, rising wages and high levels of consumer confidence,
domestic demand is still booming.
</P>
<P>
   The question is which factors will prove more powerful, and more
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Asia factor'' is probably the most important, and least
predictable, of the cooling elements. Economic boffins have long
promised that the region's financial woes would affect America, by
reducing demand for American exports and increasing imports as the
dollar strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   That began to happen during the first quarter of this year, when
a rising trade imbalance proved a modest counterbalance to booming
domestic demand, and its effect is intensifying as the trade
deficit widens.
</P>
<P>
   May's trade deficit caused particular alarm, partly because it
was much bigger than expected and partly because it showed a sharp
weakening of exports. Exports to Asia fell 21 percent compared with
a year ago, and total goods exports fell 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists reckon the Asia-inspired trade drag will
subtract up to 2.5 percentage points from second-quarter growth and
will be in evidence well beyond that, as it usually takes six to
nine months for trade flows to respond fully to economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can be certain either how big the impact will be or
how long it will last. That depends on what happens in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia effect may seem a distant concern to many Americans;
but some of them, such as farmers, are clearly suffering from it.
</P>
<P>
   The farms depend far more on exports than the rest of the
economy: around 30 percent of farm products are sent overseas,
compared with 13 percent for the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year East Asia provided a big, and growing, market.
But now a massive drop in demand from Asia has weakened prices that
were already softening from overproduction, both at home and
abroad. Coupled with disease and weather problems, this is hitting
farmers hard.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time many American farmers are learning to live with
a free(ish) market: the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act gave farmers more
leeway about switching crops, but also capped government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   As prices tumble, farmers have suffered. Hence Clinton's pledge
to buy 2.5 million tons of wheat and give it to needy Third World
countries, and hence a proposal by congressional Democrats to offer
$500 million in emergency farm assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural prairies of the upper Midwest, Goldilocks's economy
has long gone cold.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Midwest, the General Motors strike, now in its
seventh week, is claiming casualties. Virtually all of the car
company's plants and many of its supplier factories stand idle.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Reserve, June's drop in industrial
production was wholly the result of the GM strike. Greenspan
expects it to have reduced economic growth in the second quarter by
half a percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike continues until September, as union leaders
suggest it could, growth will also be slowed for a further few
months. But, unlike the protracted impact of Asia's financial woes,
the GM effect is clearly temporary. Once the strikers return to
work, production will snap back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The current ``inventory adjustment'' is another temporary brake
on growth. During the first three months of the year firms produced
more than consumers could buy, and so built up huge stocks of
unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
   This growth in inventories helped to boost the GDP growth rate
to 5.4 percent in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the
opposite occurred. Firms slowed their stocking sharply, knocking
maybe three percentage points off the economy's growth rate _ a
huge shift but, again, more a rebalancing than the sign of an
imminent downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Once you add together the probable effects of the trade balance,
the GM strike and inventory adjustment, it is apparent that
America's economy grew only marginally, if at all, between March
and June.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened will become clearer next week: the first
official estimates of the second quarter's GDP are due on July 31.
But certainly the figure will be much lower than the booming rate
of 5.4 percent in the first quarter, and last year's average of 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is neither surprising nor disturbing. As Stephen Roach of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter points out, every economic expansion
since the Second World War has had at least one quarter of growth
below 1 percent which did not become a serious downturn.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring (unsustainably fast) at the start of the year, the
economy is naturally and rightly slowing down. The magnitude of the
slowdown has simply been exacerbated by unexpected _ and temporary
_ factors such as the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, a sharp second-quarter slowdown will lead to a calmer
economy in the second half of the year as the Asia effect continues
to bite and domestic demand slows.
</P>
<P>
   In its new forecasts, the Federal Reserve expects total growth
this year to be between 3 percent and 3.25 percent. Unfortunately,
a natural cooling may not occur. Consumers are still spending
apace, business is investing and the housing market is bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's fear _ that all this demand will not slow enough to
forestall inflationary pressure _ is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldilocks economy may have cooled down a bit, but could
still be too hot for its own good. &QL;

a rising trade imbalance proved a modest counterbalance to booming
domestic demand, and its effect is intensifying as the trade
deficit widens.
</P>
<P>
   May's trade deficit caused particular alarm, partly because it
was much bigger than expected and partly because it showed a sharp
weakening of exports. Exports to Asia fell 21 percent compared with
a year ago, and total goods exports fell 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists reckon the Asia-inspired trade drag will
subtract up to 2.5 percentage points from second-quarter growth and
will be in evidence well beyond that, as it usually takes six to
nine months for trade flows to respond fully to economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can be certain either how big the impact will be or
how long it will last. That depends on what happens in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia effect may seem a distant concern to many Americans;
but some of them, such as farmers, are clearly suffering from it.
</P>
<P>
   The farms depend far more on exports than the rest of the
economy: around 30 percent of farm products are sent overseas,
compared with 13 percent for the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year East Asia provided a big, and growing, market.
But now a massive drop in demand from Asia has weakened prices that
were already softening from overproduction, both at home and
abroad. Coupled with disease and weather problems, this is hitting
farmers hard.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time many American farmers are learning to live with
a free(ish) market: the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act gave farmers more
leeway about switching crops, but also capped government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   As prices tumble, farmers have suffered. Hence Clinton's pledge
to buy 2.5 million tons of wheat and give it to needy Third World
countries, and hence a proposal by congressional Democrats to offer
$500 million in emergency farm assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural prairies of the upper Midwest, Goldilocks's economy
has long gone cold.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Midwest, the General Motors strike, now in its
seventh week, is claiming casualties. Virtually all of the car
company's plants and many of its supplier factories stand idle.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Reserve, June's drop in industrial
production was wholly the result of the GM strike. Greenspan
expects it to have reduced economic growth in the second quarter by
half a percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike continues until September, as union leaders
suggest it could, growth will also be slowed for a further few
months. But, unlike the protracted impact of Asia's financial woes,
the GM effect is clearly temporary. Once the strikers return to
work, production will snap back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The current ``inventory adjustment'' is another temporary brake
on growth. During the first three months of the year firms produced
more than consumers could buy, and so built up huge stocks of
unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
   This growth in inventories helped to boost the GDP growth rate
to 5.4 percent in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the
opposite occurred. Firms slowed their stocking sharply, knocking
maybe three percentage points off the economy's growth rate _ a
huge shift but, again, more a rebalancing than the sign of an
imminent downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Once you add together the probable effects of the trade balance,
the GM strike and inventory adjustment, it is apparent that
America's economy grew only marginally, if at all, between March
and June.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened will become clearer next week: the first
official estimates of the second quarter's GDP are due on July 31.
But certainly the figure will be much lower than the booming rate
of 5.4 percent in the first quarter, and last year's average of 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is neither surprising nor disturbing. As Stephen Roach of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter points out, every economic expansion
since the Second World War has had at least one quarter of growth
below 1 percent which did not become a serious downturn.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring (unsustainably fast) at the start of the year, the
economy is naturally and rightly slowing down. The magnitude of the
slowdown has simply been exacerbated by unexpected _ and temporary
_ factors such as the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, a sharp second-quarter slowdown will lead to a calmer
economy in the second half of the year as the Asia effect continues
to bite and domestic demand slows.
</P>
<P>
   In its new forecasts, the Federal Reserve expects total growth
this year to be between 3 percent and 3.25 percent. Unfortunately,
a natural cooling may not occur. Consumers are still spending
apace, business is investing and the housing market is bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's fear _ that all this demand will not slow enough to
forestall inflationary pressure _ is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldilocks economy may have cooled down a bit, but could
still be too hot for its own good. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Americans accustomed to a continuous stream of
good economic news, recent days have been unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   First a barrage of statistics suggested the economy was slowing
down, fast. The trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion in May, as
exports to Asia plummeted. Industrial production tumbled 0.6
percent in June, its fastest drop in over five years, as the
General Motors strike took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually overnight, economic pundits slashed their estimates of
output growth; some suggested that the economy might have shrunk
between April and June.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton devoted his weekly radio address to the
plight of the country's farmers _ hit hard by overproduction and
falling demand in Asia _ and offered federal dollars to buy up
surplus wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, struck a
different note. In his half-yearly review of the economy to
Congress on July 21, he worried more about the threat of higher
inflation than of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although he acknowledged that Asia's woes were ``demonstrably''
restraining demand for American goods, Greenspan reckoned there was
still a ``significant'' risk of a pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his concern was America's tight labor markets. He
pointed out (yet again) that the number of people working was
growing at a far faster rate than the working-age population.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot go on. To prevent inflationary wage pressure, demand
had to slow. If this did not occur naturally, Greenspan made it
clear (a number of times) that interest rates must rise.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You have reason to be, for America's economy, which
for so long has seemed neither too hot nor too cold, is
particularly tricky to interpret right now.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are several powerful forces cooling it down: the
Asian crisis, the General Motors strike, and an inventory
correction as firms reduce their stocks of unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side there are plenty of signs of heat: with low
unemployment, rising wages and high levels of consumer confidence,
domestic demand is still booming.
</P>
<P>
   The question is which factors will prove more powerful, and more
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Asia factor'' is probably the most important, and least
predictable, of the cooling elements. Economic boffins have long
promised that the region's financial woes would affect America, by
reducing demand for American exports and increasing imports as the
dollar strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   That began to happen during the first quarter of this year, when
a rising trade imbalance proved a modest counterbalance to booming
domestic demand, and its effect is intensifying as the trade
deficit widens.
</P>
<P>
   May's trade deficit caused particular alarm, partly because it
was much bigger than expected and partly because it showed a sharp
weakening of exports. Exports to Asia fell 21 percent compared with

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In America, the census is like a tetanus shot: one
of life's necessities you must endure every ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1790, the government has conducted a constitutionally
mandated count of Americans, which includes asking about everything
from their age and sex to, nowadays, the amount they spend to heat
their homes each year.
</P>
<P>
   In what is called ``the largest peacetime mobilization of the
American government,'' the data are collected, tabulated and used
to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and divvy up
over $180 billion of federal money among the states.
</P>
<P>
   Every census, because of its political repercussions, acquires
some political electricity; but never more so than now.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand Washington tradition of making esoteric subjects
controversial (read: partisan), the debate surrounding the proposed
use of statistical sampling in the 2000 census has become so heated
that the integrity of the entire process has been called into
question.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a fear that politics will prevent the Census Bureau
from carrying out its charge in 2000, resulting in the first
``failed'' census in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when the Clinton administration announced
a plan to move away from the ``actual enumeration'' of Americans
called for by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It argues that the size and diversity of the American population
make attempts at counting the whole lot futile, and lead to a
repeated undercount of urban minorities and Indians living on
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with this, the Clinton plan wants to count 90 percent of
the population and then, from what it finds there, make estimates
about the other 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this method will allow the Census Bureau to make more
accurate predictions about those portions of the population
repeatedly missed by the census.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious problems: which 90 percent do you aim at, for
instance, and what is 90 percent of a still unknown total, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress immediately denounced the plan as
unconstitutional, arguing that the president is attempting to
create a ``virtual America'' by using an untested device in place
of the process envisioned by the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miller, a Republican from Florida who is chairman of the
House subcommittee on the census, accuses Clinton of trying to
peddle ``statistical snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the highbrow constitutional argument masks a lowbrow
political reality: many Republicans fear that sampling will yield a
higher count of minorities, who generally vote Democratic, causing
more House seats to be allocated to their areas.
</P>
<P>
   More maliciously, Republicans claim that the Clinton
administration will attempt to pressure the Census Bureau into
rigging the sampling procedure, creating instant Democrats with a
stroke of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15 the Republicans started bringing things to a head; a
House committee gave the Census Bureau only half the money it wants
for the coming budget year, with the other half contingent on
congressional approval next March. The Clinton administration may
well veto this.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides accuse each other of ``holding the census hostage''
to base political interests. If the matter is not resolved, the
fight could bring on a semi-shutdown of government similar to the
one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since census appropriations are tied to cash for the entire
Commerce Department, the State Department and the Justice
Department, a dispute over statistics could mean a shutdown of all
three departments.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Republicans will probably shrink from that; the
1995 shutdown was a political disaster for them. Besides, they do
not want to be haunted by campaign advertisements accusing them of
closing the FBI in order to prevent blacks and Latinos from being
counted in the census.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will end up leaving the matter to the courts. Newt
Gingrich, the House speaker, has brought a suit against the
Commerce Department maintaining that sampling is unconstitutional,
and the Supreme Court will decide on the matter early next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the charges of corruption, Luddism and bigotry
lobbed by both sides will continue. Who would have thought that
statistics could be such fun? &QL;

   BLUE-MAN-APARTMENT (New York) _ Balls of blue paint sail and

kind of graduate-level kindergarten. But when head Blue Man, Chris
Wink, gets home, the scene changes dramatically. Wink, with his

from carrying out its charge in 2000, resulting in the first
``failed'' census in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when the Clinton administration announced
a plan to move away from the ``actual enumeration'' of Americans
called for by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It argues that the size and diversity of the American population
make attempts at counting the whole lot futile, and lead to a
repeated undercount of urban minorities and Indians living on
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with this, the Clinton plan wants to count 90 percent of
the population and then, from what it finds there, make estimates
about the other 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this method will allow the Census Bureau to make more
accurate predictions about those portions of the population
repeatedly missed by the census.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious problems: which 90 percent do you aim at, for
instance, and what is 90 percent of a still unknown total, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress immediately denounced the plan as
unconstitutional, arguing that the president is attempting to
create a ``virtual America'' by using an untested device in place
of the process envisioned by the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miller, a Republican from Florida who is chairman of the
House subcommittee on the census, accuses Clinton of trying to
peddle ``statistical snake oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the highbrow constitutional argument masks a lowbrow
political reality: many Republicans fear that sampling will yield a
higher count of minorities, who generally vote Democratic, causing
more House seats to be allocated to their areas.
</P>
<P>
   More maliciously, Republicans claim that the Clinton
administration will attempt to pressure the Census Bureau into
rigging the sampling procedure, creating instant Democrats with a
stroke of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15 the Republicans started bringing things to a head; a
House committee gave the Census Bureau only half the money it wants
for the coming budget year, with the other half contingent on
congressional approval next March. The Clinton administration may
well veto this.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides accuse each other of ``holding the census hostage''
to base political interests. If the matter is not resolved, the
fight could bring on a semi-shutdown of government similar to the
one in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since census appropriations are tied to cash for the entire
Commerce Department, the State Department and the Justice
Department, a dispute over statistics could mean a shutdown of all
three departments.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Republicans will probably shrink from that; the
1995 shutdown was a political disaster for them. Besides, they do
not want to be haunted by campaign advertisements accusing them of
closing the FBI in order to prevent blacks and Latinos from being
counted in the census.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will end up leaving the matter to the courts. Newt
Gingrich, the House speaker, has brought a suit against the
Commerce Department maintaining that sampling is unconstitutional,
and the Supreme Court will decide on the matter early next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the charges of corruption, Luddism and bigotry
lobbed by both sides will continue. Who would have thought that
statistics could be such fun? &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ The first hint that Vita Needle might be a slightly
unusual firm is in a job advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned by the door leading to a converted dance hall in the
Boston suburb of Needham that has served as the firm's factory for
66 years, it reads: ``Help Wanted. Light machine operators. Part
Time. Employees set own hours/days. Predominantly senior citizens.
Never had layoff. No retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita Needle is a classic family-owned success story. Having
served medical customers for half a century, it was forced in the
1980s by what its owner Fred Hartman calls ``the AIDS thing'' to
diversify into hundreds of other small niches.
</P>
<P>
   Its needles are now used to blow up basketballs, to inject sperm
whales and to embalm corpses. Its annual sales, now over $3
million, have grown by 20 percent a year for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Its 35 or so workers share in its profits. And by the way, the
average age of those workers is 73.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, a sprightly 46-year-old, started hiring retired workers
on a part-time basis partly because they were cheap. Now he boasts
that they are harder-working, more loyal and more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Production dips a little during the summer (when workers tend to
take vacations with their grandchildren), but Vita's workers have
all been trained how to do everybody's jobs, so they can cover for
each other. They also have their own keys, allowing some to start
work at dawn to avoid the midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vita is far from being merely a meeting place for old folk;
it wins business by being speedier and cheaper than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Vita Needle will be a little less unusual. American
managers are used to hearing about Europe's greying work force, but
few realize that they face a similar challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Every eight seconds somebody in America turns 50. The oldest of
America's 76 million baby boomers (the generation born between 1946
and 1964) will reach 55 in 2001. By 2025 the whole of America will
be as grey as Florida, the country's retirement home, is today.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the work force more than 20 years ahead rely
on assumptions about such things as immigration that can easily
prove wrong. Shorter-term estimates, however, are more reliable;
and they say that by 2005 the American work force will include 27
million people aged between 50 and 59, compared with 20 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers over 65 has edged up during the past
decade, from 3 million to 3.8 million; it should rise to 4.3
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of workers aged 25-44 is falling.
The median age of the work force will be over 40 by 2005; it was
34.7 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms that rely on young workers are already feeling the
pinch: McDonald's, for instance, is reckoned to have an average of
five ``senior helpers'' in every restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Another typical example is a client of Watson Wyatt, a firm of
personnel consultants. The company's average age will be above 40
by 2001, and Eric Lofgren of Watson Wyatt points out that its big
bulge of baby-boom workers will then still have a decade left
before they retire. So the average age is set to rise year by year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bulge is often the result of recent downsizing. Many of
the workers laid off in the past decade were over 50 _ from the
smaller ``Eisenhower'' generation that preceded the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, including Lockheed Martin, have had to pay up in a
number of discrimination cases brought by older workers whom they
fired. Most large companies now employ relatively few people over
55, and those that still have lots _ such as General Motors _ are
trying hard to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries aging baby boomers may find themselves
ejected as well. The director of one American bank recalls that
``the machine guns started firing on day one (after a recent
merger), with anyone over 50 in the front rank.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, nobody expects the baby boomers to suffer in
the same way as the Eisenhower generation. There are simply too
many of them; and there are also too few younger workers to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   The once fashionable idea that boomers will quit their jobs to
``discover themselves'' or to pursue new careers is hokum. Polls
show that most baby boomers expect to be working past 65; and they
also seem to be ``nesting'' at their current firms.
</P>
<P>
   According to Watson Wyatt, the average length of job tenure in
America has crept up from 12.3 years in the early 1990s to 13.1
years today.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few companies seem to have awakened to the challenge of
having a much older work force. Many have taken contradictory
approaches, picking on older workers for redundancies, but at the
same time increasing efforts to hire mature workers with
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As Vita Needle shows, an older work force can bring its own
bonuses. A recent report by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, another
consultancy, hailed the over-55s as the ``new workaholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their propensity for hard work is partly down to fear (all that
downsizing that got their friends); and partly because they do not
need to rush home to children in the evenings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a more elderly work force is likely to cost more in at least
three ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay and benefits. Once workers reach about 42, the cost of
their health-care coverage starts rising dramatically. In most
firms, both pay and holidays also tend to go up with seniority. And
older workers save about three times as much as younger ones in
their pension plans; if a company matches contributions, as many
do, they again face higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workplace safety. People over 65 have half as many accidents
at work as their younger and more careless colleagues. But they are
much more fragile. Older workers take longer to recover and are
more likely to die of job-related injuries. Many jobs may therefore
have to be redesigned if they are to be done by older people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee mobility. American companies are used to having a
mobile work force that can be sent just about anywhere. As workers
get older, however, they put down firmer roots. Vita was offered a
cheaper, more modern factory 20 miles away. If Hartman had taken
it, half his work force would have left.
</P>
<P>
   If an older work force simply meant increased costs, then
managers could take comfort from the fact that most of their
competitors would be in the same boat. However, greyer employees
also present more subtle management challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest may be to do with career paths. Despite some
delayering and a lot of guff about horizontal management, most
American businesses are still pyramid-shaped: the longer you stay,
the higher you rise.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby boomers age, they will create increasingly top-heavy
structures. Organizations may take on more of an egg-timer shape,
with people rising quickly in their 30s and 40s, and then rejoining
the wider work force for the final third of their career.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms _ such as Hewlett-Packard _ have managed to persuade
older people to take jobs that do not involve running things.
</P>
<P>
   The greying work force may also change the balance of power
between employers and employees. Incomes for young workers have
barely budged in the past decade, but as young workers become
harder to find they will demand more pay and security.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the growing demand for what Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas calls ``un-retirees'' _ older workers who can be coaxed
back to work _ is likely to give aging baby boomers more confidence
to walk away from jobs that they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms already go to considerable lengths to hang on to
senior staff. Finding and training a replacement typically costs
about 55 percent of a departing employee's annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon recently boasted that all the 2,700 engineers it had to
sack from its defense arm were offered at least one other job by
another part of the company. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In its own unusual way, Vita Needle proves that by changing a
little to accommodate an older work force _ being more flexible
about working hours, tolerating older people's technophobia (the
fax machine has been accepted, but computerization is still at
least a year away) and, above all, stressing trust _ it is possible
to gain a lot.
</P>
<P>
   As a note on the company's wall says: ``Remember, old people are
worth a fortune _ with silver in their hair, gold in their teeth,
stones in their kidneys, lead in their feet and gas in their
stomachs.'' &QL;

   The hardest may be to do with career paths. Despite some
delayering and a lot of guff about horizontal management, most
American businesses are still pyramid-shaped: the longer you stay,
the higher you rise.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby boomers age, they will create increasingly top-heavy
structures. Organizations may take on more of an egg-timer shape,
with people rising quickly in their 30s and 40s, and then rejoining
the wider work force for the final third of their career.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms _ such as Hewlett-Packard _ have managed to persuade
older people to take jobs that do not involve running things.
</P>
<P>
   The greying work force may also change the balance of power
between employers and employees. Incomes for young workers have
barely budged in the past decade, but as young workers become
harder to find they will demand more pay and security.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the growing demand for what Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas calls ``un-retirees'' _ older workers who can be coaxed
back to work _ is likely to give aging baby boomers more confidence
to walk away from jobs that they do not like.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms already go to considerable lengths to hang on to
senior staff. Finding and training a replacement typically costs
about 55 percent of a departing employee's annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon recently boasted that all the 2,700 engineers it had to
sack from its defense arm were offered at least one other job by
another part of the company. &QL;

   In its own unusual way, Vita Needle proves that by changing a
little to accommodate an older work force _ being more flexible
about working hours, tolerating older people's technophobia (the
fax machine has been accepted, but computerization is still at
least a year away) and, above all, stressing trust _ it is possible
to gain a lot.
</P>
<P>
   As a note on the company's wall says: ``Remember, old people are
worth a fortune _ with silver in their hair, gold in their teeth,
stones in their kidneys, lead in their feet and gas in their
stomachs.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The first hint that Vita Needle might be a slightly
unusual firm is in a job advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned by the door leading to a converted dance hall in the
Boston suburb of Needham that has served as the firm's factory for
66 years, it reads: ``Help Wanted. Light machine operators. Part
Time. Employees set own hours/days. Predominantly senior citizens.
Never had layoff. No retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   Vita Needle is a classic family-owned success story. Having
served medical customers for half a century, it was forced in the
1980s by what its owner Fred Hartman calls ``the AIDS thing'' to
diversify into hundreds of other small niches.
</P>
<P>
   Its needles are now used to blow up basketballs, to inject sperm
whales and to embalm corpses. Its annual sales, now over $3
million, have grown by 20 percent a year for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Its 35 or so workers share in its profits. And by the way, the
average age of those workers is 73.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, a sprightly 46-year-old, started hiring retired workers
on a part-time basis partly because they were cheap. Now he boasts
that they are harder-working, more loyal and more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Production dips a little during the summer (when workers tend to
take vacations with their grandchildren), but Vita's workers have
all been trained how to do everybody's jobs, so they can cover for
each other. They also have their own keys, allowing some to start
work at dawn to avoid the midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vita is far from being merely a meeting place for old folk;
it wins business by being speedier and cheaper than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Vita Needle will be a little less unusual. American
managers are used to hearing about Europe's greying work force, but
few realize that they face a similar challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Every eight seconds somebody in America turns 50. The oldest of
America's 76 million baby boomers (the generation born between 1946
and 1964) will reach 55 in 2001. By 2025 the whole of America will
be as grey as Florida, the country's retirement home, is today.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the work force more than 20 years ahead rely
on assumptions about such things as immigration that can easily
prove wrong. Shorter-term estimates, however, are more reliable;
and they say that by 2005 the American work force will include 27
million people aged between 50 and 59, compared with 20 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers over 65 has edged up during the past
decade, from 3 million to 3.8 million; it should rise to 4.3
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of workers aged 25-44 is falling.
The median age of the work force will be over 40 by 2005; it was
34.7 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   A few firms that rely on young workers are already feeling the
pinch: McDonald's, for instance, is reckoned to have an average of
five ``senior helpers'' in every restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Another typical example is a client of Watson Wyatt, a firm of
personnel consultants. The company's average age will be above 40
by 2001, and Eric Lofgren of Watson Wyatt points out that its big
bulge of baby-boom workers will then still have a decade left
before they retire. So the average age is set to rise year by year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bulge is often the result of recent downsizing. Many of
the workers laid off in the past decade were over 50 _ from the
smaller ``Eisenhower'' generation that preceded the baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, including Lockheed Martin, have had to pay up in a
number of discrimination cases brought by older workers whom they
fired. Most large companies now employ relatively few people over
55, and those that still have lots _ such as General Motors _ are
trying hard to get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   In some industries aging baby boomers may find themselves
ejected as well. The director of one American bank recalls that
``the machine guns started firing on day one (after a recent
merger), with anyone over 50 in the front rank.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in general, nobody expects the baby boomers to suffer in
the same way as the Eisenhower generation. There are simply too
many of them; and there are also too few younger workers to replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   The once fashionable idea that boomers will quit their jobs to
``discover themselves'' or to pursue new careers is hokum. Polls
show that most baby boomers expect to be working past 65; and they
also seem to be ``nesting'' at their current firms.
</P>
<P>
   According to Watson Wyatt, the average length of job tenure in
America has crept up from 12.3 years in the early 1990s to 13.1
years today.
</P>
<P>
   So far, few companies seem to have awakened to the challenge of
having a much older work force. Many have taken contradictory
approaches, picking on older workers for redundancies, but at the
same time increasing efforts to hire mature workers with
experience.
</P>
<P>
   As Vita Needle shows, an older work force can bring its own
bonuses. A recent report by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, another
consultancy, hailed the over-55s as the ``new workaholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Their propensity for hard work is partly down to fear (all that
downsizing that got their friends); and partly because they do not
need to rush home to children in the evenings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (475-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a more elderly work force is likely to cost more in at least
three ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay and benefits. Once workers reach about 42, the cost of
their health-care coverage starts rising dramatically. In most
firms, both pay and holidays also tend to go up with seniority. And
older workers save about three times as much as younger ones in
their pension plans; if a company matches contributions, as many
do, they again face higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Workplace safety. People over 65 have half as many accidents
at work as their younger and more careless colleagues. But they are
much more fragile. Older workers take longer to recover and are
more likely to die of job-related injuries. Many jobs may therefore
have to be redesigned if they are to be done by older people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee mobility. American companies are used to having a
mobile work force that can be sent just about anywhere. As workers
get older, however, they put down firmer roots. Vita was offered a
cheaper, more modern factory 20 miles away. If Hartman had taken
it, half his work force would have left.
</P>
<P>
   If an older work force simply meant increased costs, then
managers could take comfort from the fact that most of their
competitors would be in the same boat. However, greyer employees
also present more subtle management challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest may be to do with career paths. Despite some
delayering and a lot of guff about horizontal management, most
American businesses are still pyramid-shaped: the longer you stay,
the higher you rise.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby boomers age, they will create increasingly top-heavy
structures. Organizations may take on more of an egg-timer shape,
with people rising quickly in their 30s and 40s, and then rejoining
the wider work force for the final third of their career.

   A few firms _ such as Hewlett-Packard _ have managed to persuade

</P>

<P>
   TOKYO _ A penchant for wrapping everything in plastic and then
burning the trash indiscriminately has turned Japan into the dioxin
center of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxins, a highly toxic group of chemicals that are known to
cause birth defects, skin disease and cancer, are produced when
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other plastic waste is burned at
temperatures below 700 degrees celsius.
</P>
<P>
   So toxic is dioxin that a dose no bigger than a single grain of
salt can kill a man.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Nicholas Smith, from the Tokyo office of
Jardine Fleming, a stockbroking firm, found that more than 100 of
the 1,500 or so incinerators in Japan failed to meet the country's
(already lax) dioxin emissions criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese law allows 80 billionths of a gram of dioxin per cubic
meter of air _ 800 times greater than typical standards in Western
Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight incinerators in Japan actually meet the international
norm. And one, in Hyogo, continues to spew out dioxin at 10,000
times the concentration allowed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All that poison floating around in the air may pass unnoticed.
But when it falls to earth and contaminates the soil and
groundwater, it becomes harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   A wake-up call for Japanese industry _ on the scale of the Love
Canal incident in America in 1980 _ came in April when the soil
surrounding an incinerator in Nosecho, a residential suburb north
of Osaka, was found to contain a staggering 8,500 picograms of
dioxin per gram of soil.
</P>
<P>
   This has given Nosecho the unpleasant distinction of having the
highest recorded dioxin concentration in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the toxic waste that contaminated the soil at
Love Canal in New York state prodded the American Congress into
establishing a trust fund (the ``Superfund'') _ financed by a levy
on the oil and chemical industries _ to clean up such sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Nosecho has focused public anger on industrial
polluters in Japan. Rather than being hauled over the coals,
sensible firms have started to publish ugly details about the
frightening condition of some of their sites.
</P>
<P>
   First to come clean was Toshiba. In early June, the electrical
group reported illegally high levels of a carcinogen,
trichlorethylene _ an industrial cleaning agent that is believed to
cause kidney and liver damage as well as cancer _ in the
groundwater beneath four of its domestic factories.
</P>
<P>
   The company carried out on-site inspections of all its 25 plants
in Japan after detecting trichlorethylene levels at 15,600 times
the permitted level at a factory in Nagoya last October.
</P>
<P>
   Having found similar levels of the toxic waste outside the
plant, the local government is checking the health of residents in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Next a consumer-electronics giant, Matsushita, reported harmful
carcinogen levels in the groundwater beneath four of its factories
in the Osaka area.
</P>
<P>
   The level of the cancer agent tetrachlorethylene _ used for
cleaning semiconductors _ at one of the plants was 9,400 times the
permissible limit. At another plant, in Hokkaido, the groundwater
contamination was 5,200 times the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The company suspects that the groundwater beneath 80 of its 112
plants in Japan may be contaminated with harmful compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have come to light more than a year after Japan's
amended Water Pollution Prevention Act came into effect. But the
recent rush to reveal all has been prompted as much by the
``Nosecho effect'' as by the retroactive nature of the legislation,
which forces the original polluter to clean up an affected site.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces are at work, too. Japanese manufacturers have been
adopting the international ISO14,000 standard of environmental good
housekeeping faster than those of any other country.
</P>
<P>
   By February, some 730 industrial sites in Japan had become fully
compliant, compared with 525 in Britain and a mere 110 in America.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Japanese plants that have complied with the new ISO
standard are in the electronics sector. Being top exporters,
Japanese electronics firms have been understandably nervous about
having their goods barred from countries that are signatories to
the ISO14,000 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To be awarded the ISO seal of approval means making fundamental
changes in the way a plant is managed, with strict planning,
implementing, checking and reporting systems put in place. It is
these, as much as anything, that are encouraging Japanese firms to
clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is creating a handy new line of business for
Japan's environmental-protection industry. Soil remediation in
particular is seen as having huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   Kurita Water Industries, one of Japan's leading
environmental-engineering firms, started building its soil
remediation skills over a decade ago. It has carried out more than
400 surveys and soil purification schemes to date.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan's filthy incinerators, the remedial business could
be even more promising. Jardine Fleming's Smith reckons that
rebuilding all the faulty incinerators in Japan could cost a
whopping YEN 9.2 trillion ($66 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that the opportunities currently being exploited by
the cleanup industry in Japan are merely the tip of an iceberg. Now
that two of the country's most respected industrial names, Toshiba
and Matsushita, have voluntarily surveyed their sites for toxic
problems _ and gone public with their findings _ many more Japanese
companies are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for them to do so is increasing as they shut old
smokestack factories and redevelop the land for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   But the remedial work is not just required at big manufacturers.
The Environment Agency of Japan points to the plethora of small
plating shops as the country's worst offender in terms of toxic
waste, followed (surprisingly) by dry cleaners, hairdressers and
public bath houses. Big industries such as chemicals and
electronics follow close behind.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a fraction of the small backstreet offenders have
had their land surveyed. There is still a lot of nasty stuff out
there in the Japanese soil. And an awful lot of work will be needed
to clean it up. &QL;

   The company suspects that the groundwater beneath 80 of its 112
plants in Japan may be contaminated with harmful compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have come to light more than a year after Japan's
amended Water Pollution Prevention Act came into effect. But the
recent rush to reveal all has been prompted as much by the
``Nosecho effect'' as by the retroactive nature of the legislation,
which forces the original polluter to clean up an affected site.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces are at work, too. Japanese manufacturers have been
adopting the international ISO14,000 standard of environmental good
housekeeping faster than those of any other country.
</P>
<P>
   By February, some 730 industrial sites in Japan had become fully
compliant, compared with 525 in Britain and a mere 110 in America.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Japanese plants that have complied with the new ISO
standard are in the electronics sector. Being top exporters,
Japanese electronics firms have been understandably nervous about
having their goods barred from countries that are signatories to
the ISO14,000 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   To be awarded the ISO seal of approval means making fundamental
changes in the way a plant is managed, with strict planning,
implementing, checking and reporting systems put in place. It is
these, as much as anything, that are encouraging Japanese firms to
clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is creating a handy new line of business for
Japan's environmental-protection industry. Soil remediation in
particular is seen as having huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   Kurita Water Industries, one of Japan's leading
environmental-engineering firms, started building its soil
remediation skills over a decade ago. It has carried out more than
400 surveys and soil purification schemes to date.
</P>
<P>
   As for Japan's filthy incinerators, the remedial business could
be even more promising. Jardine Fleming's Smith reckons that
rebuilding all the faulty incinerators in Japan could cost a
whopping YEN 9.2 trillion ($66 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that the opportunities currently being exploited by
the cleanup industry in Japan are merely the tip of an iceberg. Now
that two of the country's most respected industrial names, Toshiba
and Matsushita, have voluntarily surveyed their sites for toxic
problems _ and gone public with their findings _ many more Japanese
companies are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure for them to do so is increasing as they shut old
smokestack factories and redevelop the land for other uses.
</P>
<P>
   But the remedial work is not just required at big manufacturers.
The Environment Agency of Japan points to the plethora of small
plating shops as the country's worst offender in terms of toxic
waste, followed (surprisingly) by dry cleaners, hairdressers and
public bath houses. Big industries such as chemicals and
electronics follow close behind.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a fraction of the small backstreet offenders have
had their land surveyed. There is still a lot of nasty stuff out
there in the Japanese soil. And an awful lot of work will be needed
to clean it up. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A penchant for wrapping everything in plastic and then
burning the trash indiscriminately has turned Japan into the dioxin
center of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxins, a highly toxic group of chemicals that are known to
cause birth defects, skin disease and cancer, are produced when
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other plastic waste is burned at
temperatures below 700 degrees celsius.
</P>
<P>
   So toxic is dioxin that a dose no bigger than a single grain of
salt can kill a man.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Nicholas Smith, from the Tokyo office of
Jardine Fleming, a stockbroking firm, found that more than 100 of
the 1,500 or so incinerators in Japan failed to meet the country's
(already lax) dioxin emissions criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese law allows 80 billionths of a gram of dioxin per cubic
meter of air _ 800 times greater than typical standards in Western
Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight incinerators in Japan actually meet the international
norm. And one, in Hyogo, continues to spew out dioxin at 10,000
times the concentration allowed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   All that poison floating around in the air may pass unnoticed.
But when it falls to earth and contaminates the soil and
groundwater, it becomes harder to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   A wake-up call for Japanese industry _ on the scale of the Love
Canal incident in America in 1980 _ came in April when the soil
surrounding an incinerator in Nosecho, a residential suburb north
of Osaka, was found to contain a staggering 8,500 picograms of
dioxin per gram of soil.
</P>
<P>
   This has given Nosecho the unpleasant distinction of having the
highest recorded dioxin concentration in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over the toxic waste that contaminated the soil at
Love Canal in New York state prodded the American Congress into
establishing a trust fund (the ``Superfund'') _ financed by a levy
on the oil and chemical industries _ to clean up such sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Nosecho has focused public anger on industrial
polluters in Japan. Rather than being hauled over the coals,
sensible firms have started to publish ugly details about the
frightening condition of some of their sites.
</P>
<P>
   First to come clean was Toshiba. In early June, the electrical
group reported illegally high levels of a carcinogen,
trichlorethylene _ an industrial cleaning agent that is believed to
cause kidney and liver damage as well as cancer _ in the
groundwater beneath four of its domestic factories.
</P>
<P>
   The company carried out on-site inspections of all its 25 plants
in Japan after detecting trichlorethylene levels at 15,600 times
the permitted level at a factory in Nagoya last October.
</P>
<P>
   Having found similar levels of the toxic waste outside the
plant, the local government is checking the health of residents in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Next a consumer-electronics giant, Matsushita, reported harmful
carcinogen levels in the groundwater beneath four of its factories
in the Osaka area.
</P>
<P>
   The level of the cancer agent tetrachlorethylene _ used for
cleaning semiconductors _ at one of the plants was 9,400 times the
permissible limit. At another plant, in Hokkaido, the groundwater
contamination was 5,200 times the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The company suspects that the groundwater beneath 80 of its 112
plants in Japan may be contaminated with harmful compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings have come to light more than a year after Japan's
amended Water Pollution Prevention Act came into effect. But the
recent rush to reveal all has been prompted as much by the
``Nosecho effect'' as by the retroactive nature of the legislation,

 &HT;    PUERTO RICO MAKES LAST-DITCH PUSH FOR STATEHOOD ON CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    With PUERTORICO-BOX-0730.
 &HT;    EDS:Contains optional trim.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Democratic governor of Puerto Rico will be knocking
on a lot of Republican doors in Washington Thursday during a
two-day visit to Capitol Hill, part of a last-ditch push for a
chance for his island to become the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   The visit comes on the heels of a call by pro-statehood Gov.
Pedro Rossello last Saturday for a non-binding vote in December on
whether the commonwealth should apply to become a state, request
independence, or remain a U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives breathed new life
into the issue of statehood by voting 209 to 208 for the first-ever
federally authorized plebiscite allowing Puerto Ricans to vote on
their future. Under the legislation, the vote would be held by the
end of this year. If a majority opted for statehood, the measure
would give Congress 10 years to decide whether to grant statehood
to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   But similar legislation in the Senate has been stalled this
summer, mostly by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans don't pass this, it will show an
anti-Hispanic strain in the Republican Party that will eventually
hurt them with Hispanic voters,'' said pro-statehood Puerto Rican
Sen. Kenneth McClintock. ``This bill won't cost the U.S. government
anything, so the only thing that could be at play is an
anti-Hispanic sentiment among Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a leading proponent of the plebiscite,
said he has enough votes in the full Senate to pass the
legislation, which is currently before the Senate Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge that we not become the victims of decision by
indecision,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton has pushed passage of the measure this
year, the 100th anniversary of U.S. control over Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   But persuading Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to
bring it to the floor this session has become an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has said there are more pressing matters to deal with this
session than Puerto Rico, such as lingering appropriations bills,
and that there simply isn't time to take up the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most Americans would agree that it's more
important to make sure the FBI is fully funded and the military is
fully funded, and that the budget is worked on than it is to deal
with Puerto Rico,'' said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that Puerto Rico is not the biggest concern
among Hispanics in the United States,'' he added. ``I believe they
share concerns over law enforcement, education, and the budget with
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview last March, Lott also relayed concerns
that Democrats would gain two senators and six representatives if
Puerto Rico became a state.
</P>
<P>
   But Xavier Romeu, executive director of the Puerto Rico
governor's office in Washington, said Republicans shouldn't
automatically assume that Puerto Ricans would vote democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's society is a conservative one, a place where
schools allow students five minutes for prayer and capital gains
taxes were cut from 20 percent to 7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Romeu added that Senate Republicans will send a dangerous
message if they don't act on legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are sending a message that they are a party of
exclusion, not inclusion,'' he said. ``Eventually, Puerto Rico will
become a state, and you can bet Puerto Ricans won't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   By announcing a non-binding plebiscite, Romeu said that Rossello
hopes to give momentum to the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Rossello also hopes that a decisive victory for
statehood could sweep aside fears that the Spanish-speaking island
might become the U.S. equivalent of Quebec, the restive
French-speaking Canadian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``If after 100 years, the U.S. Senate does not possess the will
to put an end to a century of colonialism, Puerto Rico does,''
Rossello told tens of thousands of cheering statehood supporters at
a rally marking the anniversary of the U.S. invasion of July 25,
1898.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's legislature will hold a special session Aug. 12 to
determine whether to authorize the referendum on the island's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 following
the Spanish-American War. Congress granted U.S. citizenship to
Puerto Ricans in 1917 and made the island a commonwealth in 1952.
Puerto Ricans are exempt from federal taxes and receive limited
federal aid -- some $10 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Ricans can't vote for president and have only one
nonvoting representative in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans maintain strong ties to the U.S. mainland, but
have retained a very real sense of sovereignty: they have their own
Olympic team and a beloved flag. And the population of 3.8 million
is a Spanish-speaking one, with only about 25 percent of islanders
able to speak fluent English.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Puerto Ricans voted on their future was in 1993,
during a non-binding referendum, when voters decided 49 percent to
46 percent to remain a commonwealth, with 5 percent choosing
independence.
</P>
<P>
   A San Juan Star newspaper poll in June showed Puerto Ricans are
still deeply divided over the issue, with 40.9 percent favoring
statehood, 40.2 percent a commonwealth, and 7.6 percent
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the U.S. Congress will ever agree to statehood
for Puerto Rico unless there is a clear consensus on the island
that this is what they want,'' said Max Castro of the University of
Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One problem that looms over future referendums centers on the
definition of ``commonwealth.'' In 1993, commonwealth supporters
pushed for a broad definition that would guarantee American
citizenship, in addition to other things.
</P>
<P>
   But the House rejected that guarantee in drafting new
definitions this year, and now commonwealth backers say they will
boycott any referendum that doesn't include the guarantee of
citizenship under commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some senators are now pushing for a scaled-down
version of the original legislation that would call for a
referendum without pushing Congress to implement the results within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's important to get something -- even a watered-down
version -- passed.
</P>
<P>
   The House-approved measure was the culmination of three years of
hearings, a mountain of work that would be wiped away if the Senate
fails to act before the 105th Congress ends this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scaled-back version is better than nothing because,
otherwise, we have to start all over again next year,'' said
Cuauhtemoc Figueroa, director of policy and communications for the
League of United Latin American Citizens, which supports a
plebiscite. ``And we've got no idea at all what kind of a ballgame
we'd face with a whole new slew of legislators.''

 &HT;    PUERTO RICO MAKES LAST-DITCH PUSH FOR STATEHOOD ON CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    With PUERTORICO-BOX-0730.
 &HT;    EDS:Contains optional trim.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Democratic governor of Puerto Rico will be knocking
on a lot of Republican doors in Washington Thursday during a
two-day visit to Capitol Hill, part of a last-ditch push for a
chance for his island to become the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   The visit comes on the heels of a call by pro-statehood Gov.
Pedro Rossello last Saturday for a non-binding vote in December on
whether the commonwealth should apply to become a state, request
independence, or remain a U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives breathed new life
into the issue of statehood by voting 209 to 208 for the first-ever
federally authorized plebiscite allowing Puerto Ricans to vote on
their future. Under the legislation, the vote would be held by the
end of this year. If a majority opted for statehood, the measure
would give Congress 10 years to decide whether to grant statehood
to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   But similar legislation in the Senate has been stalled this
summer, mostly by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans don't pass this, it will show an
anti-Hispanic strain in the Republican Party that will eventually
hurt them with Hispanic voters,'' said pro-statehood Puerto Rican
Sen. Kenneth McClintock. ``This bill won't cost the U.S. government
anything, so the only thing that could be at play is an
anti-Hispanic sentiment among Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a leading proponent of the plebiscite,
said he has enough votes in the full Senate to pass the
legislation, which is currently before the Senate Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge that we not become the victims of decision by
indecision,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton has pushed passage of the measure this
year, the 100th anniversary of U.S. control over Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   But persuading Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to
bring it to the floor this session has become an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has said there are more pressing matters to deal with this
session than Puerto Rico, such as lingering appropriations bills,
and that there simply isn't time to take up the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most Americans would agree that it's more
important to make sure the FBI is fully funded and the military is
fully funded, and that the budget is worked on than it is to deal
with Puerto Rico,'' said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that Puerto Rico is not the biggest concern
among Hispanics in the United States,'' he added. ``I believe they
share concerns over law enforcement, education, and the budget with
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview last March, Lott also relayed concerns
that Democrats would gain two senators and six representatives if
Puerto Rico became a state.
</P>
<P>
   But Xavier Romeu, executive director of the Puerto Rico
governor's office in Washington, said Republicans shouldn't
automatically assume that Puerto Ricans would vote democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's society is a conservative one, a place where
schools allow students five minutes for prayer and capital gains
taxes were cut from 20 percent to 7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Romeu added that Senate Republicans will send a dangerous
message if they don't act on legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are sending a message that they are a party of
exclusion, not inclusion,'' he said. ``Eventually, Puerto Rico will
become a state, and you can bet Puerto Ricans won't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   By announcing a non-binding plebiscite, Romeu said that Rossello
hopes to give momentum to the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Rossello also hopes that a decisive victory for
statehood could sweep aside fears that the Spanish-speaking island
might become the U.S. equivalent of Quebec, the restive
French-speaking Canadian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``If after 100 years, the U.S. Senate does not possess the will
to put an end to a century of colonialism, Puerto Rico does,''
Rossello told tens of thousands of cheering statehood supporters at
a rally marking the anniversary of the U.S. invasion of July 25,
1898.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's legislature will hold a special session Aug. 12 to
determine whether to authorize the referendum on the island's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 following
the Spanish-American War. Congress granted U.S. citizenship to
Puerto Ricans in 1917 and made the island a commonwealth in 1952.
Puerto Ricans are exempt from federal taxes and receive limited
federal aid -- some $10 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Ricans can't vote for president and have only one
nonvoting representative in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans maintain strong ties to the U.S. mainland, but
have retained a very real sense of sovereignty: they have their own
Olympic team and a beloved flag. And the population of 3.8 million
is a Spanish-speaking one, with only about 25 percent of islanders
able to speak fluent English.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Puerto Ricans voted on their future was in 1993,
during a non-binding referendum, when voters decided 49 percent to
46 percent to remain a commonwealth, with 5 percent choosing
independence.
</P>
<P>
   A San Juan Star newspaper poll in June showed Puerto Ricans are
still deeply divided over the issue, with 40.9 percent favoring
statehood, 40.2 percent a commonwealth, and 7.6 percent
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the U.S. Congress will ever agree to statehood
for Puerto Rico unless there is a clear consensus on the island
that this is what they want,'' said Max Castro of the University of
Miami's North-South Center.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One problem that looms over future referendums centers on the
definition of ``commonwealth.'' In 1993, commonwealth supporters
pushed for a broad definition that would guarantee American
citizenship, in addition to other things.
</P>
<P>
   But the House rejected that guarantee in drafting new
definitions this year, and now commonwealth backers say they will
boycott any referendum that doesn't include the guarantee of
citizenship under commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some senators are now pushing for a scaled-down
version of the original legislation that would call for a
referendum without pushing Congress to implement the results within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's important to get something -- even a watered-down
version -- passed.
</P>
<P>
   The House-approved measure was the culmination of three years of
hearings, a mountain of work that would be wiped away if the Senate
fails to act before the 105th Congress ends this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scaled-back version is better than nothing because,
otherwise, we have to start all over again next year,'' said
Cuauhtemoc Figueroa, director of policy and communications for the
League of United Latin American Citizens, which supports a
plebiscite. ``And we've got no idea at all what kind of a ballgame
we'd face with a whole new slew of legislators.''

INTERNET SEARCH SITE PLANS MAJOR MARKETING PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Got HotBot?
</P>
<P>
   Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, the San Francisco advertising
agency that created the ``Got Milk?'' campaign, will be creating a
multimillion-dollar advertising push for the HotBot Internet search
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be a catch-up move for HotBot
(www.hotbot.com), which is owned by Wired Digital, a Web-based
technology news and information company.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also represents one of the first corporate
initiatives for San Francisco-based Wired Digital since it split
from its Wired magazine counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Wired magazine was sold to Advance Magazine Publishers
Inc., a holding company owned by magazine mogul S.I. Newhouse.
Advance publishes such titles as GQ, Vogue and the New Yorker.
Wired Digital is now owned by a board made up largely of past
investors in Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew de Vries, Wired Digital's director of
marketing communications, the Goodby ad campaign is designed to
make HotBot a widely known Web search resource, instead of a
``word-of-mouth'' site used by information professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to ramp it up to take it to the next level,'' de
Vries said.
</P>
<P>
   HotBot's campaign launch will make it a latecomer to the Web
search engine party, and the hot Web ``portal'' craze fueling
astronomical stock prices of on-line companies such as Yahoo
(www.yahoo.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really reached the scale or popularity of other
search sites, like Excite, Lycos and Infoseek,'' said Bridget
Regan, an analyst with the Giga Information Group, a research and
advisory group. ``And in the race to become a portal, HotBot hasn't
really geared up.''
</P>
<P>
   A portal is a Web site designed to be starting point for
Internet users. They can attract millions of users, along with
millions in advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say the sale of the magazine helped this push,'' de
Vries said. ``It gave us a healthier balance sheet and a focus. Now
that we're a pure Internet company, we can make a pure Internet
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the advertising campaign is confidential, de
Vries said. But he added that Wired Digital expected to launch
about a dozen more ad campaigns showcasing Wired Digital
properties, at a cost of between $10 million and $15 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider ourselves starting late,'' he said.
``There's still plenty of the Internet pie left to go around.''

<P>
   Tens of millions of people have been forced from their homes
during the past decade by armed conflict, internal strife and
systematic violations of human rights, all the while remaining
within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   No continent has been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Africa today counts about 10 million internally displaced
persons, Europe and Asia some 5 million each, and Latin America up
to 2 million. These masses in flight _ who, unlike refugees, have
not crossed a border _ constitute the newest global crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement always has severe humanitarian
implications. These displaced"persons are at the greatest risk of
starvation, have the highest rates of preventable disease and are
the most vulnerable to human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement is a symptom of state dysfunction that
poses a threat to political and economic stability at the national
and international levels.  &LR; oth the communities left behind cnd the
towns"and villages in which the displaced find refuge are often
ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, so many people flee that whole societies are
uprooted. Violence and instability can spread through entire
regions, forcing neighboring states to bear the brunt of massive
refugee flows. Even countries continents away may have to contend
with a wave of desperate refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crisis of internal displacement is no less acute than
the refugee crisis that confronted Europe after World War II. Then,
humanitarian needs coupled with practical political and economic
interests brought about a system of international protection and
assistance for those displaced outside their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the position of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
created and a U.N. refugee convention adopted. Today, UNHCR has a
staff of 5,000, an annual budget of more than $1 billion, and 13.2
million refugees in its care.
</P>
<P>
   But those forced from their homes who remain under their
government's jurisdiction are not covered by any international
arrangements. Although their numbers now exceed those of refugees,
no international institution is specifically charged with their
protection or assistance. The absurdity is that if these people had
crossed a border, they would fall under U.N. protection.
</P>
<P>
   Internal displacement became a subject of international concern
in the late 1980s. When the numbers were first compiled in 1982,
1.2 million people were estimated to be displaced in 11 countries.
Four years later the total had grown to 14 million. Since the early
1990s, the numbers have fluctuated between 20 million and 25
million in 35 to 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The major reason for this dramatic increase was the rise in
internal conflicts as the Cold War came to a close. The proxy wars
the superpowers fought in the 1980s displaced millions of people
who came into full view only as Cold War tensions eased in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Cambodia and El Salvador. The
arms the United States and the Soviet Union had supplied to regimes
or opposition movements furnished the weaponry for the ethnic and
clan warfare that broke out once the superpowers departed.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia and Somalia, two countries that plunged into civil war,
were among the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance in
sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s. In Europe and Central Asia,
the collapse of the Soviet Union lifted the lid on nationalist
aspirations and ethnic rivalries that displaced millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vast disparities in wealth, land ownership and power
have been at the root of conflict. In Rwanda and Burundi, high
population density and limited fertile land exacerbated tensions
between Hutus and Tutsis. In Colombia, conflict over land has
forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, struggles between governments and minorities
have produced mass displacement. In Sudan, which has the world's
largest internally displaced population, the efforts of successive
northern governments to impose Islam on the black African south
have made 4 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, which has the second-largest displaced population,
government repression against the Kurdish minority has sent 2
million people fleeing for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have seen greater willingness on the part of the
international community to intervene in these situations, even
without the consent of the government concerned. A major motivation
has been the desire to forestall international flows of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of refugees has grown, Western governments as well
as those in Africa and elsewhere have become less welcoming to
those in flight. Their focus has shifted to keeping people in their
homelands. The U.N. Security Council justified the international
community's precedent-setting intervention on behalf of the Kurds
in Iraq in 1991 on the grounds that massive flows of refugees
threatened international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent Security Council resolutions on Somalia, Bosnia and
Rwanda have also authorized the use of force to facilitate the
delivery of relief and, in the latter two cases, to protect
internally displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity and noninterference in the internal affairs of states
present formidable obstacles to intervention by international
organizations. While some governments, such as Sri Lanka, invite
international assistance, others deliberately bar humanitarian aid,
seeing it as strengthening their opponents and undermining their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, for example, has obstructed humanitarian aid, while
Turkey has blocked all international assistance to its displaced
citizens. Some countries have deliberately starved the displaced
while invoking their sovereignty to keep the international
community at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the representative of the U.N. secretary-general on
internally displaced persons outlined guiding principles for the
rights of the displaced and the duties and obligations of states
and insurgent groups. These principles include a right not to be
arbitrarily displaced, access to humanitarian assistance and
protection while in flight and guarantees of reparations upon
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   While the principles lack legal force, they set standards that
should put both governments and insurgent groups on notice and give
international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOS) a basis for
legitimate action. The United Nations' acknowledgment of these
principles and call for their observance would be an important step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the international community has focused on providing
food, shelter and medical supplies. Yet displaced persons have
regularly pointed out that security is as great a priority as food.
Providing relief to uprooted people while ignoring the fact they
are being beaten or raped has led some to call the victims the
``well-fed dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance and development agencies of all stripes
will have to become more responsible for protecting the people they
assist. Many have silently witnessed abuses because of exaggerated
fears that confronting a host government will result in expulsion
of their personnel and termination of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort would be strengthened if governments and insurgent
groups were made aware that they were dealing with a united front
bound by common human rights and humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, military interventions have been more
successful in preventing starvation than in physically defending
people at risk. This failure underscores the need for strategies to
prevent genocide and other crimes against humanity that lead to
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts that are allowed to fester can produce mass
displacement and leave political and economic scars that damage the
economic well-being and political security of neighboring states,
regions and the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The world community cannot let this newest challenge go
unchecked.

E-MAIL SOFTWARE FLAW LEAVES COMPUTERS VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A security flaw found a month ago in several
popular electronic mail programs is shaking up the on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw, discovered by computer scientists at Oulu University
in Finland, has been confirmed by researchers at Microsoft Corp.
and Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's only a lab exercise,'' said Julie Herendeen,
Netscape's director of client product marketing, ``but it's a
serious one, and we're taking it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The bug, called the longfile e-mail bug, works by way of e-mail
attachments and can erase files on a hard drive, crash a computer
and create general havoc on a desktop. Attachments are data files _
usually pictures or word-processing files _ sent along with an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The malicious code, researchers say, can be hidden in the label,
or file name, of an attachment.
</P>
<P>
   According to both Microsoft and Netscape, the label to those
doctored attachments has to be longer than 200 characters. This
creates a buffer overload.
</P>
<P>
   A buffer is a chunk of a computer's memory that holds
information being used by a running program. Once the overload is
created, code contained in the label can run programs on the target
computer, programs that could erase files, crash the computer and
do other damage.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has confirmed that the flaw exists in its popular
Outlook Express and Outlook 98 e-mail packages used on Windows,
Macintosh and other machines.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape says it has confirmed the flaw on its Communicator
e-mail software for Windows-based computers only. A spokesman for
Eudora, another popular e-mail software, said it had not found the
flaw in its products.
</P>
<P>
   Though the longfile bug is still confined to computer
laboratories, Netscape, Microsoft and others are urging users to
fix their e-mail programs. ``The goal right now is to get this fix
out as fast and to as many people as possible,'' said George Meng,
group product manager of Microsoft's Outlook software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty obscure, hard-to-use flaw,'' said Joyce Graff,
an e-mail security expert at the GartnerGroup, a technology
consulting company in Stamford, Conn. ``But people need to get it
fixed before it gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some predict the flaw will become a widely used Internet weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of assume they aren't going to get hit by this,''
said Eric Allman, chief technical officer at San Francisco-based
Sendmail Inc., a leading provider of e-mail software for Internet
service providers. ``But now that the crackers know what to do,
it's only a matter of time before they use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crackers are those who use their computer expertise to damage
the systems of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Allman painted a bleak picture for the future of this flaw,
which he said could be sent to thousands of e-mail users. ``Its
only a matter of time, and not a lot of time at that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has posted fixes and more information at
www.microsoft.com/ie/security.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape plans to issue a fix within 10 days. It's posting
information about the bug at home.netscape.com/products/security.

TEXAS JUDGE REMAINS IN A COMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ State District Judge Mike Machado showed slight
signs of improvement from complications associated with a brain
aneurysm but still was in grave condition, according to a son of
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old judge and World War II hero has been in a coma
since undergoing emergency surgery Sunday afternoon and remained in
an intensive care unit at Santa Rosa Hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Machado Jr. choked back tears several times as he read from
a brief statement Tuesday with his brother Marc standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Machado Jr. said that only a few minutes earlier his father
``showed improvement in his ability to breathe on his own, and his
heart is strong. ... He's in no physical pain at this juncture, and
we're very grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's wife of 41 years, Rosa Elia, did not attend the news
conference at the hospital, choosing to stay by her husband's side.
</P>
<P>
   Machado Jr., a local lawyer, said his father was responding to
some stimuli from doctors. ``I really don't know exactly what it
means other than the doctors are encouraged by that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate about his father's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Machado, who must retire from the bench on his 75th birthday
Sept. 4, is the Democratic nominee for Bexar County district
attorney in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it's too soon and it's too painful to speculate
as to what's going to happen in the near future,'' Machado Jr.
said. ``My father's life is now in God's hands, and all we ask from
those who are concerned (is to) please pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in a phone interview, Machado Jr. was asked about
speculation that he would seek to replace his father on the ballot
if the veteran jurist couldn't make the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, in my mind he is still the leading candidate in
the race,'' he said. ``If things change and the climate is right,
I'll consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Machado, who has been a municipal and state district
judge for 41 years, is known for his toughness, which enabled him
to survive severe burns in World War II that put him in a military
hospital for three years.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Army Air Corps, the plane he was in crash-landed
after being hit by enemy fire. As he was rescuing two other men
from the downed plane, Machado received the burns that left him
with limited use of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Machado Jr. said if anyone can pull out of a coma, it would be
his father. ``Fighter doesn't even come close to describing him,''
he said. ``Nothing fazes him.''

<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that most Russian Israelis cannot tolerate the
rhetoric of the left because of their painful memories of the
Soviet Union. Having been exposed to intense anti-Semitism, many of
these insecure immigrants share the widespread ultra-Orthodox
distrust of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians, unlike the ultra-Orthodox, do not have an
echelon of young activists who dictate their political agenda, they
are nourished by several conservative daily newspapers printed in
their native language. This right-leaning Russian press is, in
fact, the unifying element of a highly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   However, with their secularism, heterogeneity and large number
of countries of origin, the Jews from the former Soviet Union are
the softest part of the soft right. Russian electoral behavior can
be quite pragmatic. While their rhetoric remains conservative, the
Russians are in nobody's pocket. Netanyahu will have to work hard
to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful to the soft right for its votes, Netanyahu has been
quick to recognize the price of its continued support. A superb
communicator, Netanyahu knows that this emotional constituency is
enamored of chauvinist rhetoric and attacks on Arab terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   When a crisis with the Palestinians, Hizballah, the Clinton
administration or alleged ``Arab sympathizers'' anywhere erupts, a
belligerent Netanyahu rushes for the cameras. The astounding
success of this media strategy was evident after the Mossad, the
Israeli security service, bungled an assassination attempt last
year on a Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from the Labor Party, the United States and a livid
King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

<P>
   As the grand old man of Palestinian nationalism, Yasir Arafat's
personal influence and political wiles have let him dominate and
change Palestinian politics in a way no other figure could.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat will not live forever, and Hamas, the radical
Islamist group, will not stay on the sidelines forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oslo peace process flags, Arafat falls and Hamas rises,
the mainstream, secular nationalist movement _ Arafat's al-Fatah _
could indeed lose its current hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, like their Israeli neighbors, are highly
politicized. The 1993 Oslo Accords call for an end to terrorism,
mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and the creation of the Palestine Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   How do Palestinians feel about these issues?
</P>
<P>
   Pundits often make sweeping generalizations about ``belligerent
Palestinian attitudes'' without bothering to offer evidence of any
sort. But since 1993, Palestinian public opinion has been surveyed
regularly and extensively, and can be quite accurately gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian students, like most other Arab students, tend to be
more radical, defending ideals rather than compromises. To be sure,
a general lack of responsibilities influences student thinking
about the peace process. But more important, students' perceptions
of Oslo are colored by the way they perceive their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Most students see the peace process as an American tool to
stabilize Arafat's regime and maintain a domestic status quo. The
more disillusioned the students are with Arafat's Palestine
Authority _ accusing it of corruption, mismanagement and lack of
democratization _ the more opposed to the peace process they
become.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, embrace the values of
political Islam and seek to establish an Islamic state. They
emphasize traditional values, including veiling women and limiting
their political role, but are not totally opposed to some liberal
and democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists oppose the peace process, refusing to acknowledge
the legitimacy of Israel. They have no consistent demographic
characteristic, even though disproportionately more support for
them is found among illiterates and the most educated youth.
</P>
<P>
   The nonaffiliated are likely to be older, female,
better-educated West Bank residents. But, excluding the
universities, Palestinian society remains deeply traditional.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, religion cuts different ways for the Palestinians.
Those who pray daily are as likely to support the secular
nationalists of Arafat's Fatah as they are to support Hamas. But
the Islamists have more support among those who oppose women's
participation in politics and less support among feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas increases significantly among those who
strongly oppose reinterpreting Islamic law to make it applicable to
conditions of contemporary life. Support for the mainstream and the
left increases among those who seek a more modern form of Islam.
While Fatah has done well at appropriating some religious
symbolism, the bottom line is that Palestinian traditionalism
provides a deep wellspring of support for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, surveys of Islamist public opinion
reveal significant heterogeneity. Palestinian Islamists are not a
special group with identifiable demographic characteristics. They
do not necessarily think alike, and they lack a unified worldview.
Logically, there is no limit to the support they could muster, were
Arafat to fall out of favor and they to act shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the peace process has transformed the Palestinian
psychological environment, leading more and more Palestinians to
support negotiations and oppose terrorism. But as the Oslo meetings
stalled during 1996-98, a significant number of Palestinians came
to simultaneously back violence and the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the Oslo process is moving, Palestinian support for
it remains strikingly strong, despite clear reservations about the
potential outcome. Many Palestinians seriously doubt that the final
talks will produce a mutually acceptable solution. In particular,
the young and educated are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the peace process has progressed, Palestinian support for
violence against Israeli targets declined. Opposition to terrorism
depends on diplomatic movement, national reconstruction, and
Arafat's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Support for attacks against Israelis has dropped from 57 percent
in November 1994, to 46 percent in February 1995, to 33 percent a
month later, and to 21 percent in March 1996 _ all dates of major
suicide bombings by members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. But
frustration creates a constituency for terror.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's response to violence, including a policy of closing off
the West Bank and Gaza, and the infliction of collective pain and
suffering, led to a rise in support for violence among Palestinians
after months of steady decline. One significant jolt occurred in
the spring of 1997 in response to groundbreaking for the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, violence is popular among Palestinian university
students. Almost 60 percent advocate armed attacks against Israeli
targets, while only 25 percent oppose them. Moreover, 70 percent
believe that armed resistance is a realistic option for
Palestinians if the current negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a clear majority of Palestinians not only rejected
terrorism against Israelis but also backed the March 1996 Palestine
Authority crackdown against the Islamists after the bus bombings
the month before, knowing full well that the raids sought to
prevent further attacks on Israelis. Only 32 percent opposed the
reprisals against Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   To most Palestinians, Islamist terrorism slows the return of
West Bank land, undermines the Palestinian economy, boosts the
right-wing Israeli Likud Party of Binyamin Netanyahu _ and pushes
the Palestine Authority to focus on Israeli security at the expense
of Palestinian democracy and civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinians, statehood is a sine qua non. A final peace
plan that did not grant Palestinian independence would be doomed on
the Palestinian street. Moreover, Palestinian opinion would buck
any resolution that did not give the new state of Palestine the
vast majority of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, are quite flexible about security
arrangements to ease Israeli jitters. The most important of these,
demilitarization of a Palestinian state, would almost certainly be
acceptable to Palestinian public opinion, so long as the state
comprised most of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent of Palestinians supported the establishment of
a sovereign but demilitarized state in 95 percent of the West Bank
and all of Gaza, but support dropped to only 16 percent if the
state took up a smaller area of the West Bank. Palestinians would
also probably tolerate continued security cooperation with Israel
and a limited Israeli troop presence.
</P>
<P>
   On two other contentious issues, settlements and refugees, the
Palestinians are also flexible. About a third of Palestinians would
accept Israeli annexation of some settlements, amounting to 5
percent of the West Bank. Over 40 percent of Palestinians support
having the settlers remain, under Palestinian sovereignty and law.
</P>
<P>
   As for one of the central grievances of Palestinian nationalism
_ the plight of the refugees who lost their homes during the
fighting after Israel was established in 1948 _ many West Bankers
and Gazans have abandoned the refugees' dream of returning to homes
in present-day Israel. Instead, they would have the 1948 refugees
settle for a ``right of return'' that exists only in principle,
accompanied by an actual return to a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest of the final status issues is Jerusalem. Here, the
Palestinian street gives Arafat little room for maneuver. The idea
of leaving Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital while
establishing a Palestinian capital in Abu Dis, a Palestinian
village adjacent to Jerusalem but technically outside its municipal
boundaries, won only 9 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian proposal, which spoke of the Arab neighborhoods of
East Jerusalem reverting eventually to Palestinian control, managed
to get 27 percent support, but such additional territorial
concessions in Jerusalem would be unthinkable for even a dovish
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, about half of Palestinians say that final talks with
Netanyahu are doomed to failure. Palestinians flatly distrust
Israel's leaders. When asked whether they trusted Israeli
government intentions toward the peace process, only 7 percent said
yes, while 81 percent said no. The suspicion intensified after the
election of Netanyahu and the groundbreaking at Har Homa, rising to
91 percent in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, more than half the Palestinians saw the Israeli
public as genuinely wanting Palestinian-Israeli peace. In other
words, even though most Palestinians say that they believe in the
good intentions of the Israeli public, they think that Netanyahu
has no intention of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Arafat's leadership is essential. He
remains the pillar of Palestinian politics. Positive evaluations of
his performance have risen steadily, with only minor hiccups. In
contrast, support for Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, the leader of Hamas,
dropped from 20 percent to 14 percent between November 1994 and
October 1995. Today, Arafat's positive rating stands at about 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Palestinians rank their democracy behind those of
Israel, the United States and France, and ahead of Jordan and Egypt
_ neither heretofore known as bastions of civil liberties. The
democratic systems of Israel and America get high marks not only
among supporters of the peace process but also among supporters of
the opposition, including the Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, fully 80 percent of Hamas supporters describe
Israeli democracy as good or very good, and 71 percent of them
evaluate American democracy as good or very good. Almost across the
board, Palestinians know quite clearly what kind of democracy they
admire. They also know they do not have it at home.
</P>
<P>
   The situation today is dire. If Arafat and the national movement
fail, the Islamists could take the initiative. It is only amazing
that they have not done so already. Hamas remains the sole credible
alternative to Fatah and the mainstream nationalists. Those who
have deserted the Islamists have not changed loyalties; most have
simply sat on the sidelines. They could become a reservoir for an
Islamist revival.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons that Yitzhak Rabin, known in Israel as
``Mr. Security,'' went to Oslo was his fear that his choice was to
deal either with the PLO today or Hamas tomorrow. Netanyahu faces
the same choice. However, he does not act like he knows it.

   _  &UR; NOTE: As the first anniversary of the death of Princess Diana
approaches, a theologian asks whether she is in heaven or hell.  &LR; 
__
</P>
<P>
   The popular beatification of Princess Diana forces an indiscreet
theological question: Where is she now?
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian scheme of things, God judged the most popular
woman on earth after her death and sent her soul to heaven,
purgatory or hell.
</P>
<P>
   If heaven was her fate, God smiles on her posthumous veneration.
Purgatory is where the saved burn off their impurities, so at least
a ticket to heaven is guaranteed (and prayers might even speed her
deliverance).
</P>
<P>
   Hell, however, cannot be ruled out. If Diana died with ``grave
sins'' on her soul _ a not unlikely circumstance _ she is probably
now in hell, beyond hope and prayer, and thus unworthy of the
slightest reverence, let alone a funeral service at Westminster
Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Let us consider the three possibilities in more detail. The 1994
Catechism of the Catholic Church, the most comprehensive modern
compendium of Christian doctrine (bearing the imprimatur of John
Paul II), is unequivocal. Although the Church of England differs
sharply from the pope on female ordination, married priests and
divorce, its beliefs about matters relating to Diana's salvation
(namely, adultery and fornication) are essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for heaven is, I am afraid, weak. Church tradition
reserves instant entry for saints, martyrs and baptized babies who
die before reaching the age of reason. Nobody else qualifies.
Diana's good works may have been very good, but her trespasses,
large and small, surely barred St Peter's gate, at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves purgatory or hell, depending on the state of her
soul at the moment of death. As the Catechism says, ``To die in
mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love
means remaining separated from him forever.'' In other words, hell.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana's soul was in dire peril of damnation on the
evening of Aug. 30, assuming that she and Emad ``Dodi'' Al Fayed
had committed unrepented fornication (``carnal union between an
unmarried man and an unmarried woman'') during their romantic
holiday in France. Let us remember that all sex acts outside
marriage, and not a few within, are hell-bent offenses in the
Catechism. Masturbation, homosexual relations and watching the
Playboy television channel rank, in scale of punishment, with
running drug cartels and exterminating aboriginal populations.
Adultery and fornication remain as satanic today as they were in
King Solomon's time.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Diana had begged God's forgiveness after
the car crash, and if she expired in his grace, she would have been
cast into the ``cleansing fires'' of purgatory, there to expiate
her sins before ascending to heaven. Diana's last thoughts are
unknown, but if they did not include sincere sorrow for lying with
Dodi, even purgatory is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, hell looms as the most plausible spot for the
princess's soul. Christian dogma, immutable and infallible,
requires sinners in her presumed spiritual condition _ stained by
mortal sin _ to be condemned. ``Depart from me, you cursed, into
eternal fire,'' said Christ of the doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, the pope overlooked the damaging evidence
against Diana and gave a positive signal as to her redemption.
``The Holy Father has offered prayers summoning her to our Heavenly
Father's eternal love,'' he wrote in the third person to Queen
Elizabeth on Sept. 1. His remark implied purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's father, is surely permitted to exclaim
in grief: ``God took their souls to live together in paradise.''
But how do we explain the pope's apparent blessing of the world's
most famous offender against the sixth commandment?
</P>
<P>
   A devil's advocate might detect hypocrisy in the papal posture.
People who meet their Maker en route to an illicit and scandalous
rendezvous do not generally receive benedictions from Vatican City.
The exception of the princess of Wales suggests that the church's
official position on sex crimes and punishment cannot withstand
rational scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Diana in hell seems cruel and repellent in human
terms, although it comfortably suits the divine. ``The gate is
narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find
it are few,'' declared Christ on the depressing odds against
anybody's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Roman/Anglican theology, which demonizes deviations of the
flesh, leaves little room for optimism in Diana's case. But that
tells us more about the chilling core of Christianity than about
the ultimate worth of a young, kind, sometimes foolish beauty who
had the misfortune to marry a prince and perish with a playboy.

<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva. For a time my life
was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy
operation, which removed my power of speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, I had been able to dictate to a secretary who could
understand me, but for a time, I could communicate only by raising
my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a card. At that
rate, it would have taken until the next millennium to finish my
book.
</P>
<P>
   However, a software developer called Walt Waltosz heard of my
plight, and provided me with a computer and a program that allowed
me to scan the screen and select words, which are printed on the
bottom half of the screen. Over the years, the system has
developed. My present version was made for me by Intel. It has a
mobile telephone, with access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim to be the most connected person in the world. I have
kept my original speech synthesizer, however, partly because I
haven't heard one with better phrasing, and partly because I now
identify with this voice, despite its American accent. But the
speech synthesizer uses chips which are now obsolete, so I will
have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I said I thought there was a 50 percent chance
that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in
time, I think it's more likely we'll find it in the next 20 years.

<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>

<P>
   The best things come in small packages: apart from breasts, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how slender and toned the rest of a woman's body may
be, a huge pair of bazongas stuck on the front is still the ideal:
witness Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Anna Nicole Smith, Jane Fonda
etc.
</P>
<P>
   And while slim hips and voluptuous bosoms tend not to coincide
in nature, a couple of bagfuls of silicone do the job _ these days
for less than the cost of a secondhand car.
</P>
<P>
   What the novelist Jay McInerny has elegantly dubbed ``party
tits'' have become so widespread as to not raise an eyebrow in the
States over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, the number of people who approved of plastic surgery
increased by 50 percent between 1982 and 1992, while the number who
disapproved fell by 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For women in the public eye it is not so much a question of
whether or not to be ``enhanced'' as when to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The natural bosom seems to have few allies. Last week, an
official British government enquiry into silicone breast implants
(banned in the U.S. since 1992) concluded that they are safe and
that surgeons can be allowed to continue using them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Britain's Great Page Three Silicone Debate, Sun
newspaper readers voted overwhelmingly to ban fake breasts on Page
Three; but the enhanced are still more than welcome on all the
other pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar spirit, American publisher Norm Zadeh launched a
glamor magazine called Perfect Ten, which only features
flesh-and-blood chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want readers to know what real breasts look like, because
they've forgotten,'' explained the helpful Norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think when a woman lies down, her breasts are supposed to
stand straight up, like rockets ready for launch.'' The magazine,
however, has not been a huge money-spinner.
</P>
<P>
   Now a rearguard action is being fought. Millions of pounds worth
of compensation has already been paid out to British women who
allege that leaking implants have damaged their health and consumer
groups such as Survivors of Silicone continue to lobby against
``party tits.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Haiken, author of ``Venus Envy,'' a history of
cosmetic surgery, argues spiritedly against using the surgeon's
knife as a beauty aid; novelist Joanna Briscoe also comes down hard
on surgery in her latest novel, ``Skin,'' which gives graphic
accounts of an aging beauty's lifetime under the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have breast implants to please themselves may not find
that it is as life-changing a step as they hoped. Dr. Gillian
Butler, consultant clinical psychologist and co-author of ``Manage
Your Mind,'' warns about ``overvalued ideas about body shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's role models for women, she says, ``are all a particular
weight and shape. This has a very poor effect on self-esteem. Women
fall into the trap of thinking, `If my body is right, everything
will be right,' and of course it simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   And women who have implants to please men may likewise be
wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are far less discerning than women take them for,'' says
Phil Hilton, editor of Men's Health magazine. ``Men think all
breasts are good and are delighted to have access to any at all.
The idea that they are connoisseurs is inaccurate. There's no need
for operations and scars and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the British government enquiry that has cleared
silicone implants recommends that stringent guidelines should be
laid down for practitioners; Professor David Sharpe, president of
the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, observed
that some clinics' sales techniques ``were more attuned to double
glazing than surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sharpe himself has expressed doubts about breast
implants _ not on safety grounds, but on cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who have small breasts are somehow seen as less
attractive,'' he observes. ``That is an indictment of society.'' &QL;

   The best things come in small packages: apart from breasts, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how slender and toned the rest of a woman's body may
be, a huge pair of bazongas stuck on the front is still the ideal:
witness Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore, Anna Nicole Smith, Jane Fonda
etc.
</P>
<P>
   And while slim hips and voluptuous bosoms tend not to coincide
in nature, a couple of bagfuls of silicone do the job _ these days
for less than the cost of a secondhand car.
</P>
<P>
   What the novelist Jay McInerny has elegantly dubbed ``party
tits'' have become so widespread as to not raise an eyebrow in the
States over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, the number of people who approved of plastic surgery
increased by 50 percent between 1982 and 1992, while the number who
disapproved fell by 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For women in the public eye it is not so much a question of
whether or not to be ``enhanced'' as when to get started.
</P>
<P>
   The natural bosom seems to have few allies. Last week, an
official British government enquiry into silicone breast implants
(banned in the U.S. since 1992) concluded that they are safe and
that surgeons can be allowed to continue using them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Britain's Great Page Three Silicone Debate, Sun
newspaper readers voted overwhelmingly to ban fake breasts on Page
Three; but the enhanced are still more than welcome on all the
other pages.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar spirit, American publisher Norm Zadeh launched a
glamor magazine called Perfect Ten, which only features
flesh-and-blood chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want readers to know what real breasts look like, because
they've forgotten,'' explained the helpful Norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think when a woman lies down, her breasts are supposed to
stand straight up, like rockets ready for launch.'' The magazine,
however, has not been a huge money-spinner.
</P>
<P>
   Now a rearguard action is being fought. Millions of pounds worth
of compensation has already been paid out to British women who
allege that leaking implants have damaged their health and consumer
groups such as Survivors of Silicone continue to lobby against
``party tits.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Haiken, author of ``Venus Envy,'' a history of
cosmetic surgery, argues spiritedly against using the surgeon's
knife as a beauty aid; novelist Joanna Briscoe also comes down hard
on surgery in her latest novel, ``Skin,'' which gives graphic
accounts of an aging beauty's lifetime under the scalpel.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have breast implants to please themselves may not find
that it is as life-changing a step as they hoped. Dr. Gillian
Butler, consultant clinical psychologist and co-author of ``Manage
Your Mind,'' warns about ``overvalued ideas about body shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's role models for women, she says, ``are all a particular
weight and shape. This has a very poor effect on self-esteem. Women
fall into the trap of thinking, `If my body is right, everything
will be right,' and of course it simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   And women who have implants to please men may likewise be
wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are far less discerning than women take them for,'' says
Phil Hilton, editor of Men's Health magazine. ``Men think all
breasts are good and are delighted to have access to any at all.
The idea that they are connoisseurs is inaccurate. There's no need
for operations and scars and that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the British government enquiry that has cleared
silicone implants recommends that stringent guidelines should be
laid down for practitioners; Professor David Sharpe, president of
the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, observed
that some clinics' sales techniques ``were more attuned to double
glazing than surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Sharpe himself has expressed doubts about breast
implants _ not on safety grounds, but on cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who have small breasts are somehow seen as less
attractive,'' he observes. ``That is an indictment of society.'' &QL;

THEY'VE BUILT A BETTER `PARENT TRAP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What girl can resist the fantasy that she really
deserves a fabulously rich secret father and a wonderfully wealthy
secret mother, plus a fun secret twin sister who will be her best
friend forever?
</P>
<P>
   Not many girls turned down ``The Parent Trap'' fantasy the first
time around in 1961, and today's girls will fall for ``The Parent
Trap'' remake all over again.
</P>
<P>
   They should because, in the land of endlessly tired Hollywood
remakes, this one is actually more fun than the original.
</P>
<P>
   The star, young Lindsay Lohan, in her first _ two _ roles, is
cute as two buttons and twice as funny.
</P>
<P>
   Lohan plays Hallie Parker and Annie James, two delightful
11-year-old girls who dislike each other instantly when they meet
at summer camp. Then the girls discover that they actually have a
lot in common, including the same mother and the same father.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Annie's English mom (Natasha Richardson) and Hallie's
American dad (Dennis Quaid) divorced when the girls were babies,
each taking one daughter and never telling either about her twin.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask why, the filmmakers have no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when summer camp ends, the girls decide to switch
places, so Annie can meet her long-lost father and Hallie can meet
the mother she never knew.
</P>
<P>
   The twins then decide to bring their parents back together, but
they'd better hurry because Dad is about to marry a conniving gold
digger who despises little girls.
</P>
<P>
   This second-time-around ``Parent Trap'' uses the same story as
the first. Usually, that's the kiss of boredom for a remake,
causing people who enjoyed the original to ask themselves: Why am I
watching this all over again, when it's not as good?
</P>
<P>
   This time around, it is. Director Nancy Meyers, part of the
writing-producing team behind such comic hits as ``Baby Boom'' and
``Father of the Bride,'' makes a zippier, peppier, spunkier
``Parent Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   This one has more laughs, more high jinks and more fun than the
original. It also has Lohan, who is doubly terrific. As endearing
as Hayley Mills was, Lohan is even more winning.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you treasure the original as an important event
from your own childhood, you may not want someone messing with your
memories.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't affect your own daughters. If they're under 12,
they should love ``The Parent Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder why the producers simply didn't hire twins to
play twins, instead of the complicated procedure of filming each
scene twice, then compositing the two images together.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers like to play around with their special-effects
gadgets. Cloning two girls from one creates a buzz. With twins,
you'd have to rely on acting alone.
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as ``The Parent Trap'' is, it does strike some odd
chords:
</P>
<P>
   - As a society, we've had 35 years of parenting lessons since
Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara were considered good parents despite
each one abandoning a beloved baby and treating twins so cruelly as
to deny one the other.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Hollywood would promote as '90s role models
parents who make the same dumb mistakes is a stretch to all but
actual Hollywood parents, where the idea of raising a child right
means conducting the nanny interviews personally.
</P>
<P>
   - Quaid (``Switchback'') has some trouble creating a dedicated
dad who would be smart enough to marry the girls' mother, yet dumb
enough to fall for the gold digger.
</P>
<P>
   - As for Richardson (``Nell''), she's oddly done up to remind us
of that other fantasy of English nobility: Princess Di.
</P>
<P>
   - Despite its comic energy, the remake does sag and at precisely
the same point as the original: during the efforts to reunite the
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The Parent Trap'' remains a fun family film, if for no
other reason than to watch a really talented young actress at work.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``The Parent Trap'' contains nothing offensive. 3
stars. &QL;

<P>
   ``If they asked you to put your hand in the fire I suppose you'd
do it?'' your mother always sighed. Well if you are a trainee at
one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Seven trainees at Eagle Life Star were hospitalized after a
daylong ``motivational course'' at a hotel near the company's
headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of problem-solving games, trainees removed their
socks and shoes and were invited, for the final exercise, to walk
on a bed of hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Star Life said a ``full and frank internal inquiry'' was
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of motivational weekends. What is it about
management theorists that they think if you have not spent a
weekend together learning how to get from one side of the room to
the other without touching the floor, or energetically paintballing
each other in the countryside, then your company will never make
the Fortune 500 list?
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind such courses is that workers should learn more
about each other, learn to trust their colleagues and become highly
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can be that people end up injured, humiliated or
falling out, and the majority of the bonding happens in the pub _
just like a normal weekday.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Eagle Life, was keen to point out
that the firewalking was the culmination of seven months of
training and that, in the past, they had found similar courses
``highly motivational, team building, confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, they had restricted themselves to
adventure courses. ``We're looking for things that will help people
discover how they can use their initiative.'' Which, according to
the chief of an electronics company who has been on a different
firewalking course, is not always what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh they say no one is compelled to walk across the coals but
you're made to feel such a jerk in such a subtle way if you don't
do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all such a big show. They get people all hyped up and
then they're left to go flat. They often have very good material,
there are good techniques but in the end it's all made into a show
and I think that's prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Common techniques that are used on management courses also
include hugging and kissing your neighbor in order to ``break down
comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact Development Training uses what it calls a ``pamper pole''
_ a telegraph pole that you climb to the top of and then jump
through a trapeze. This, it is said, is designed to develop support
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those who use such services are fiercely protective of them.
While conceding that the most recent outcome was less than ideal,
Isaacs said that other Eagle Life Star courses had been very
successful in building up team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been on courses themselves are less sure. A
management consultant is still sulking about one course he went on
some years ago. ``You had to make something out of limited
materials; paper, scissors etc., and see which would travel
furthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a paper boat but the people who won made a catapult. I
suppose it's all very well, but there's no skill in the
construction of catapults like there was with our boat. Everyone
normally ends up falling out anyway when someone starts an argument
because you won't do it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   And one former bank worker remembers with gritted teeth another
motivational course: ``We had to prepare a presentation for the
last day, to be given at 8 a.m. It was basically made up of
impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

<P>
   ``If they asked you to put your hand in the fire I suppose you'd
do it?'' your mother always sighed. Well if you are a trainee at
one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Seven trainees at Eagle Life Star were hospitalized after a
daylong ``motivational course'' at a hotel near the company's
headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of problem-solving games, trainees removed their
socks and shoes and were invited, for the final exercise, to walk
on a bed of hot coals.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Star Life said a ``full and frank internal inquiry'' was
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of motivational weekends. What is it about
management theorists that they think if you have not spent a
weekend together learning how to get from one side of the room to
the other without touching the floor, or energetically paintballing
each other in the countryside, then your company will never make
the Fortune 500 list?
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind such courses is that workers should learn more
about each other, learn to trust their colleagues and become highly
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can be that people end up injured, humiliated or
falling out, and the majority of the bonding happens in the pub _
just like a normal weekday.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Eagle Life, was keen to point out
that the firewalking was the culmination of seven months of
training and that, in the past, they had found similar courses
``highly motivational, team building, confidence building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, they had restricted themselves to
adventure courses. ``We're looking for things that will help people
discover how they can use their initiative.'' Which, according to
the chief of an electronics company who has been on a different
firewalking course, is not always what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh they say no one is compelled to walk across the coals but
you're made to feel such a jerk in such a subtle way if you don't
do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all such a big show. They get people all hyped up and
then they're left to go flat. They often have very good material,
there are good techniques but in the end it's all made into a show
and I think that's prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Common techniques that are used on management courses also
include hugging and kissing your neighbor in order to ``break down
comfort zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact Development Training uses what it calls a ``pamper pole''
_ a telegraph pole that you climb to the top of and then jump
through a trapeze. This, it is said, is designed to develop support
and trust.
</P>
<P>
   Those who use such services are fiercely protective of them.
While conceding that the most recent outcome was less than ideal,
Isaacs said that other Eagle Life Star courses had been very
successful in building up team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been on courses themselves are less sure. A
management consultant is still sulking about one course he went on
some years ago. ``You had to make something out of limited
materials; paper, scissors etc., and see which would travel
furthest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a paper boat but the people who won made a catapult. I
suppose it's all very well, but there's no skill in the
construction of catapults like there was with our boat. Everyone
normally ends up falling out anyway when someone starts an argument
because you won't do it their way.''
</P>
<P>
   And one former bank worker remembers with gritted teeth another
motivational course: ``We had to prepare a presentation for the
last day, to be given at 8 a.m. It was basically made up of
impossible tasks so that by 4 a.m. we were all hyper on blood sugar
boosts or killing each other with tiredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got it sorted by about 6 a.m., only to be told as
we walked into the presentation room that there were no
presentations _ it was to monitor how we operated under stress.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``Everyone got drunk and shagged each other.''
Well at least some kind of bonding was achieved. &QL;

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is a cultural encounter that foreshadows the
future of the United States _ but white America is so far taking
precious little notice.
</P>
<P>
   In its gleaming new convention center that sits right across
from the restored Amish market, this quintessentially WASP city of
William Penn is hosting upwards of 15,000 representatives of the
National Council of La Raza, the country's biggest organization of
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic delegates are conspicuous in a city center that
normally bustles with white and black. In the long corridors of the
convention center, there is a subdued air of Latin festivity and
the quiet buzz of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   From the mainstream U.S. media, however, you would hardly know
that the Hispanics were around _ a point that rankles perpetually
with their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics have been quietly advancing and earning a place in
this country in a way that is not always understood in many of the
cities of the nation. And Philadelphia, we are afraid, may well be
one of them,'' said a bilingual editorial in Al Dia, one of the
region's clutch of Spanish-language newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   An article in Hispanic magazine put it more emotively: ``We are
_ whether we like it or not _ in the midst of the Hispanization of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the America's fastest-growing ethnic minority.
Currently numbering around 30 million (11 percent), they are
expected to overtake the number of blacks within seven years.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2050, but probably before, Hispanics will comprise
more than 25 percent of the U.S. population and their growth will
be the main reason why, by that date, white Americans will find
themselves just another minority in the country they have regarded
for more than two centuries as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The vast implications of this demographic shift _ especially for
white Americans _ have hardly begun to be addressed, although they
lay at the heart of President Clinton's year-old initiative on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Where the population at large fears to tread, however, business
and _ more tentatively _ politics, are starting to venture.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition hall in the Philadelphia convention center is
crowded with exhibitors, more than 500 in all, from department
store chains to car manufacturers, from community action groups to
health and housing watchdogs, all courting the burgeoning Hispanic
market.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker at lunch Monday was the first lady, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother is standing for political office in Florida, one of
seven states where the Hispanic minority has electoral clout, so
`name recognition' is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker is the mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani,
in what is billed his ``first major address to a national Latino
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani does not need their votes _ he was reelected by a
landslide last year. The Republicans, on the other hand, do, as
they look to this autumn's midterm congressional elections and the
presidential race in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Their standing with Hispanic voters has been severely harmed by
California's anti-immigration measures which led, in the words of a
Republican consultant's report, to the ``utter collapse of the
Hispanic vote'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both parties must consider one salient fact of
political life. As early as the next presidential election, the
Hispanic constituency will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The big states of Texas and California, with 86 electoral
college votes between them, are already 25 percent Hispanic.
Hispanics are significant minorities also in Florida, Arizona, New
Mexico, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why there is now a rush by both parties to have
some sort of Hispanic representation on their presidential ticket
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the question has been when or whether it
would be politically decisive to have a black or a woman on the
ticket. Now, there is speculation that Bill Richardson, a former
senator from New Mexico who is about to go from the ambassadorship
of the U.N. to the post of Energy Secretary, is being considered as
a possible running mate for Al Gore for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's mother is Mexican, he is bilingual and popular with
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, son of the former president, present Governor of
Texas and a favored Republican candidate, has been assiduously
wooing Hispanic voters, helped by a Mexican sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Those who object that Hispanics cannot be treated as a
homogeneous ethnic minority or even as a solid voting block have a
point.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanics of California and Texas are predominantly recent
immigrants from Mexico and Central America and their families;
their opposition to tougher restrictions on immigration and
benefits has pushed them into the arms of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where the bias is towards Cuban exiles, with strong
anti-Castro sentiments, the vote has been Republican. In New
Mexico, where Hispanics constitute almost 40 percent of the
population, political sympathies are less clearly differentiated.
</P>
<P>
   At the La Raza convention this week, Hispanics are going out of
their way to present themselves as responsible and successful
Americans, a minority that has the highest male employment rate and
some of the best health indicators of any in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the monolingual mainstream, however, of a sizeable
minority that speaks a different language has yet to be gauged. In
California and Texas, it has already caused tension, with
California withdrawing funds for bilingual education, and Texas
employers dismissing workers who persist in speaking Spanish
between themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic mix in those states today is that of America in 50
years' time. &QL;

MILEWIDE ASTEROID COMES INTO VIEW  
 (ART ADV: GRAPHIC IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BySTEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - A milewide asteroid that could some day
collide with Earth was discovered recently by Arizona scientists
using a new device specifically designed to search for potential
killer space rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``1998 MQ,'' the asteroid is the first near-Earth space
debris discovered by Lowell Observatory's Near-Earth Object Search,
or LONEOS, which began scanning the night skies from Flagstaff in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers calculated that the asteroid is no immediate threat,
and that in its current orbit it likely will pass no closer than 10
million miles to Earth, or about 40 times the distance between the
Earth and the moon.
</P>
<P>
   However, the orbits of asteroids are chaotic, and their paths
can change over time because of the gravitational influence of
planets and collisions with other asteroids, said Ted Bowell, a
Lowell astronomer who discovered the asteroid with researchers
Brian Skiff and Bruce Koehn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that at some point in the distant future
(perhaps as long as 100 million years) it could hit the Earth,''
Bowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers will continue to track its movements along with
about 500 other known near-Earth objects, more than 100 of which
are larger than 1 kilometer across, or five-eighths of a mile, the
size that not only could penetrate Earth's atmosphere, but cause
catastrophic damage and mass extinctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an asteroid, or perhaps a comet, is believed to have caused
the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell researchers employ an electronic camera attached to a
telescope that can scan the entire visible night sky once every
four months. This year, the device will be improved so that it will
scan the sky once a month and detect asteroids as small as a
football field.
</P>
<P>
   The device uses a computer to compare electronic images. These
comparisons are used to detect the slightest movements and alert
astronomers to anything that does not appear to be a star, a planet
or a previously detected asteroid or comet. It eliminates the
time-consuming process of comparing night sky photographs by hand.
</P>
<P>
   LONEOS automatically notified researchers of 1998 MQ on June 18
after comparing three images taken over the course of an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Located high in the western sky after sunset, just above the
bright star Arcturus, the asteroid is moving at more than a mile
per second. But at 60 million miles from Earth, it is too small and
dim to see with the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid travels in an elliptical path once every 2.4 years
that takes it from the massive asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter to near Earth's orbit around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   LONEOS is part of a larger project funded by NASA, which has the
goal of discovering at least 90 percent of all near-Earth objects
within the next decade, thereby providing an early warning system
for any objects in space that could pose a threat to human
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The positions of less than 10 percent of the estimated 2,000
potential killer asteroids are known.
</P>
<P>
   This month, NASA established a near-Earth object coordinating
office at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are objects that are difficult to detect because of
their relatively small size, but are large enough to cause global
effects if one hit the Earth,'' said Donald Yeomans, director of
the new office. &QL;

   Up, down or sideways for U.S. interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Alan Greenspan started his twice-a-year Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony to U.S. Congress. It is an event which has taken on
enormous significance _ probably far too much _ as anyone involved
in the markets deconstructs each word of Dr. Greenspan to try and
judge when and which way the Fed might jump.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the testimony what should we think? You have to start
with the condition of the U.S. economy, where things are changing
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago it seemed that growth was bounding on, but
quite suddenly it seems that the East Asian crisis has struck.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the first quarter was 5.4 percent annual rate; growth
in the second _ well, we won't have the figures until July 31 but
the estimates I have seen range from plus 1 percent to minus 0.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, it is at least plausible that there will be a
recession in the U.S. this year.
</P>
<P>
   We are only just into the third quarter so it would be silly to
guess the outcome there. But if the second does turn out to be
minus something and the General Motors strike rolls on much longer
it is certainly within the bounds of possibility that there will be
two quarters of negative growth, the technical definition of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   This recession, if it were to take place, would be largely an
externally triggered one. There has been a sudden, sharp
deterioration in the U.S. trade account. Exports of the U.S. to
East Asia have collapsed while imports (on the back of that strong
home demand) have remained pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   Largely externally triggered, but not entirely, there may also
been a swing in the inventory cycle taking place, with a buildup in
the second quarter and a fall now. This at least is the view of the
U.S. economic team at HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. policymakers are in a bit of a quandary. On the one
hand it would be unwise to tighten policy now in the face of a
possible recession, albeit a brief one.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand while there is little visible sign of an
upsurge in inflation, the strong first quarter did push up
inflation a bit, and price rises are towards the top end of the
industrial world scale.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of demand in the economy probably remained as high in the
second quarter as in the first, an unsustainable 5 percent annual
rate. And of course asset prices, particularly the price of
financial assets, remain at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this, the question is whether the collapse in demand
from east Asia has done the Fed's work for it. It almost certainly
has. Had the American economy not taken the east Asian hit, it
would have had to take an interest rate hit.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few months the mood of most Fed members (though
less Greenspan's) has been that the Fed should incline towards a
modest tightening of policy.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of demand in east Asia and the knock-on impact of
this on the U.S. seems likely to put any rise in interest rates on
hold. Expect that signal to emerge this week from Greenspan. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (275-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that is right _ and the markets will hit the fan if it is not
_ what next?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is UK-based and has spent much time in the U.S. this
year will notice a marked difference in the mood between the two
countries. In the UK there is a widespread appreciation that the
country might move into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Actually there is less immediate practical evidence of that than
there is in the U.S. We are facing a slowdown at the moment but
there is nothing in the indicators yet which suggests that there
was negative growth in the second quarter. But that is not the
perception. We are aware of the dangers of overheating, for people
keep in talking about these.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., by contrast, hardly anyone outside the narrow
sphere of economics believes that anything might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There has been concern that the millennium bug might create a
recession by disrupting the world's computer systems, and of course
there are the worries about east Asia noted above.
</P>
<P>
   But there is very little perception that there might be the
threat of recession from within the U.S., in particular that the
widening trade deficit might be unsustainable. Instead everyone
focuses on inflation: no inflation, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is therefore extremely ill-prepared for bad economic
news.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic demand has been sustained in large measure by the
willingness of foreigners to cover the U.S. current account
deficit, and the ability of American consumers to continue
financing their own spending by building up financial assets in the
stock market. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Question: how will America react to bad economic numbers? My
guess is that one negative GDP number, assuming it is negative,
will not do much harm to confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The almost mystical faith that Americans seem to have that
somehow or other the Fed can manipulate interest rates to sustain
growth forever can probably stand the odd blow.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is further out. It is that the east Asian slump will
continue to deteriorate and that it will prove more contagious to
the U.S. than at present appears to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, if you are U.S.-based, to take on board the full
fragility of the world economy at this moment. Greenspan's judgment
on these dangers has proved pretty accurate in recent months, and
it will be particularly interesting to see how his view has moved
as the story has unrolled.
</P>
<P>
   So I think the thing to look for this week will be twofold.
First, listen more to what Greenspan says about the world and not
so much what he says about America.
</P>
<P>
   And second, watch the reaction in the U.S.: to what extent does
the ``R'' word, recession, come into the headlines?
</P>
<P>
   It would be safer for the rest of us if American opinion was
more aware of the fact that the economic cycle is not dead, just
sleeping. &QL;

 &HT;    WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The United States and Mexico are neighbors
with a historic and dynamic relationship that is pulling them
closer every day. But the road to the future has some bilateral
bumps: illegal immigration, consumption and trafficking of illicit
drugs, trade and border issues are just a few. They provide fodder
for political rhetoric in both countries. Yet, in spite of this,
the relationship remains strong.

 &HT;    DAN DIAL: You are a respected career diplomat with nearly 30
years experience, including considerable time in Latin America.
Does your posting to Mexico reflect the importance of Mexico to the
United States?
 &HT;    JEFFREY DAVIDOW: Well, I wouldn't put it that way, because I
think Mexico is perceived as being extraordinarily important to the
United States. The contacts that we've had over the last few years,
such as President Clinton's trip to Mexico, were very important. A
very high level of coordination of contact that we've had with
Mexico has been building _ all of this indicates that Mexico is
extremely important to the United States.
 &HT;    Now, in terms of my appointment, I'm just very honored to have
been chosen for the job and to be able to follow people like Jim
Jones and John Negroponte and others who have done a good job
there. I want to do as well as I can.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: During your May confirmation hearing before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee you demonstrated a broad knowledge on
Mexican and bilateral issues. Once you assume your post, what will
be your most pressing objective?
 &HT;    A: There are multiple objectives which reflect the fact that our
relationship with Mexico is so multifaceted. The obvious thing: We
have a number of areas of focus of concentration, trade being one;
making NAFTA work _ and I do believe NAFTA does work for both
countries.
 &HT;    But obviously, there's continuing trade issues that have to be
confronted. I suspect probably there will always be continuing
trade issues.
 &HT;    Certainly, the issue of immigration is extremely important for
Mexicans. And, in this regard, I pay a lot of attention to how we
as a government deal with Mexicans who want to visit the United
States. We give out over 600,000 visas a year.
 &HT;    We have a new program that we're putting into action, as you
know, the new border crossing cards, the laser visas, which is a
major undertaking.
 &HT;    All issues relating to the frontier and the border are important
to me. Of course narcotics and what I see as improving what has
been a very positive development in terms of increasing levels of
coordination and cooperation over the last few years.
 &HT;    And then there's a multitude of other issues.
 &HT;    Q: One issue that's very important to me is service to the
American community. I do believe that the American embassy has as
its primordial role being responsive to the American community,
protecting American citizens, helping American citizens when
they're in difficulty.
 &HT;    A: This is something I've always taken very seriously.
 &HT;    Q: Operation Casa Blanca, the drug-money laundering
investigation, is still in the news. Given as it was conducted on a
``need-to-know'' basis _ in both countries _ it still strained
bilateral relations. Will the accords signed last week in
Brownsville by Attorneys General Jorge Madrazo and Janet Reno help
avoid this kind of incident in the future?
 &HT;    I think so. I think, though, that agreement was very important.
Actually, the agreement that was signed _ which talks about
increasing levels of coordination or cooperation of information
passing _ is far more reflective of the kind of relationship that
has developed over the last couple of years than Operation Casa
Blanca was.
 &HT;    We have said, and I've said personally, that I think Casa Blanca
was useful in that it caught crooks. And it was going to put people
in jail who have been breaking the law.
 &HT;    And this is important because the money trail is one of the most
sensitive and important elements of the whole narcotics trade. That
goes without saying.
 &HT;    Yet, at the same time, I think mistakes were made. I believe
there could have been better coordination between the government of
the United States, the government of Mexico. There could have been
better coordination (ital) within (end ital) the government of the
United States.
 &HT;    We are addressing those issues. I think the agreement between
Reno and Madrazo is a very important step in that regard.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Recently U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's answer
to a question regarding Chiapas was misunderstood because of a
simple translation error _ ``pressure'' versus ``press'' _ again
causing some allegations of U.S. lack of respect for Mexico's
sovereignty. What is the U.S. position on Chiapas?
 &HT;    A: Well, our position on Chiapas has been a steady one. We do
not pressure the Mexican government. And the Mexican government
knows that. And we have had conversations, many of which have been
introduced by officials of the Mexican government, in which they
talk about Chiapas.
 &HT;    We believe that the problem in Chiapas is one that has to be
resolved through peaceful means. Dialogue, negotiation,
communication is the way to move ahead in resolving an issue which
has both political factors, but this also relates to issues of
social and economic development in the Chiapas region.
 &HT;    We believe that the government of Mexico is making a serious
effort to find a peaceful resolution. We believe that the
government of Mexico is making a serious effort to promote social
and economic development in that part of Mexico, as it is
elsewhere.
 &HT;    The Chiapas problem is, above all, a Mexican problem. It's not a
U.S. problem or a French problem or an Italian problem. And it will
have to be resolved by Mexicans working together in a peaceful way.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You are a strong supporter of free trade. Some people _ in
Mexico and the United States _ say signing the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a mistake. What are your views on
NAFTA?
 &HT;    A: Well, I think those who think NAFTA was a mistake are just
dead wrong. Everything that I've been able to witness indicates to
me that both the Mexican and the U.S. economy has profited from
NAFTA.
 &HT;    The flow of trade now is _ I don't have the exact figures, but
it's well over a $150 billion a year. The percentage increases
since NAFTA have been quite striking.
 &HT;    Mexico's ability to recover from the shock of the peso crisis
was immeasurably enhanced by NAFTA, and by the fact that this new,
stronger trading relationship with the United States has made it
easier for Mexico to work itself out of the difficulties caused by
the peso crisis.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: For our readers, Mexicans and Americans, property and
personal crime is so rampant that many of them have been forced to
alter their lifestyle. In fact, former Ambassador James R. Jones
told us last year that truck hijackings pose a serious threat to
future investment in Mexico. Is there anything the United States
can do to help Mexico, particularly regarding U.S. citizens living
there?
 &HT;    A: Well, I think you have to look at this in a couple of ways.
Certainly, the U.S. Embassy and our various consular sections have
an obligation to provide up-to-date information to people visiting
Mexico and living in Mexico.
 &HT;    And we've done that. We have, on a permanent basis, through the
consular information sheet, which is available on the Internet,
available at the embassy or the consulates, and which talks about a
number of these issues of personal security.
 &HT;    Ultimately, personal security, of course, becomes the
responsibility and primary concern of the individual involved. But
we can provide information. We can, it seems to me, help American
citizens when they do get in difficulty, either difficulty with the
law or difficulties with their cars.
 &HT;    I'd like to see the embassy be as responsive as possible in that
regard.
 &HT;    In the larger context, the problem of crime in Mexico is a major
one. I mean, it's one that I think all Mexicans in the Mexican
government understand. There are no easy answers, but it does seem
to me that improving the efficiency of police forces, improving the
efficiency of judicial systems, so that when criminals are
detained, they are quickly judged and prosecuted and sentenced.
 &HT;    All of this requires, on the part of Mexican authorities and
Mexican society, it seems to me, the dedication and even greater
efforts, greater levels of resources, greater focus on the need for
institutional reform in both law enforcement and the judiciary.
 &HT;    And, as I say, it's not an easy problem. I mean, it's not one
that's unique to Mexico. But I think a concerted effort on the part
of the Mexican authorities on the issue of crime is something that
would bring results.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: When discussing Mexico-U.S. bilateral issues, drugs and
corruption always seem to enter the picture. What are your views _
from both sides of the border _ on these issues?
 &HT;    A: Well, on the drug front, this is obviously a major issue in
the relationship, because such a high percentage of the drugs
entering the United States come through Mexico. This is a
development of recent years. Again, it has had significant effect
on the bilateral relationship.
 &HT;    What is important is that we see drugs as a shared problem. I
think to a degree this is happening. The dual concept of divisions
based on supply and demand, divisions based on rich and poor,
divisions based on the United States really being the only cause of
the problem is something of an innocent victim.
 &HT;    I think those kinds of ways of looking at things are changing.
It does seem to me that, in all countries of the region, we're
seeing increased problems of consumption. And I would say probably
in Mexico itself there are in increasing levels of consumption.
 &HT;    It is not an issue that can be dealt with without significant
levels of cooperation _ for long-standing, long-lasting approaches
that will lower the level of the drug trade. Both countries have
got to assume responsibility. Both countries have got to cooperate
with each other and with other countries, and confront the problem
at all levels.
 &HT;    That includes eradication, interdiction, following the money
trail, fighting against money laundering, levels of cooperation
among judicial authorities and police authorities.
 &HT;    And I'd have to say that for, you know, even with all the press
coverage and some of the negative things that we hear on both sides
of the border, having worked on this very closely now for
two-and-a-half years, it does seem to me that the level of
cooperation that we have today, and interaction and understanding
between the U.S. government and the Mexican government is higher
than it's ever been.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: While U.S. President Bill Clinton and his administration seem
to be understanding toward Mexico on major bilateral issues,
Congress seems to take pleasure at ``Mexico bashing.'' Is there
anything you can do about this?
 &HT;    A: First, I think one has to distinguish between the easy
rhetoric and polemic of members of Congress and the really
substantive issues that Congress can deal with. It's quite easy to
give a speech. It's quite easy to take a vote on a subject that is
probably on a bill that is probably never going to get to the point
where it will become law.
 &HT;    It's always easy to talk to the press and sound tough. And this
is a particular feature of political life, and I would dare say on
both sides of the border.
 &HT;    I think if I had to spend all my time correcting the
inappropriate statements of American congressmen and Mexican
congressmen, I'd have to work about 26 hours a day. There's just
not enough time to do that. It's one of the features of democratic
life.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Former Amb. Jones said one of the important tools for an
effective ambassador is ``access'' (which he had) to the top
person. Have/Has President Clinton and/or Secretary Albright
assured you of this kind of access?
 &HT;    Well, you know, I've been working in this job as head of the
Inter American bureau for two-and-a-half years. My relationship
with the secretary of state is, I would say, a close one. We are in
permanent, sometimes almost daily, contact. I've traveled with her
on a large number of trips and I consider her not only my boss, but
my friend. She is a friend I'm proud to have.
 &HT;    With the president, I've traveled with him three times to the
hemisphere _ just in the past year. That was, I think, one of the
most important developments in the U.S. hemispheric policy. And, of
course, I have sat in on numerous meetings with him, have been with
him when he's met with President Zedillo, was with him up in New
York not long ago when he met with President Zedillo up at the
United Nations.
 &HT;    So I feel comfortable that I will have access to those
authorities in Washington who are very much concerned about Mexico.
 &HT;    And I think this will be important and will be a factor not so
much of my personal qualities, whatever they may be or not be, but
the fact that there is a very heavy focus here on our relationship
with Mexico.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you think you will have the same level of access to
President Ernesto Zedillo and Secretary of Foreign Relations
Rosario Green?
 &HT;    A: Well, of course, you know, that's a decision for President
Zedillo and Foreign Secretary Green. I've met both of them on
several occasions.
 &HT;    Again, having worked in my current position for two-and-a-half
years, I've had a lot of opportunity to have contact with numerous
Mexican government officials, including both the president and the
foreign secretary. There are many others in the Mexican government
whom I consider colleagues and friends. And I hope we can deepen
that relationship.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We would like to shift focus now. Can you tell us a little
about you and your family: hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc.?
 &HT;    A: (LAUGHING) It's hard for me to talk about myself. But, you
know, my life has been, for the past 30 years, very much wrapped up
in both my family and my career.
 &HT;    I got married the same year I entered the foreign service, which
was 1969. And our life together as a family has been one of moving
around the world. We've served in seven different foreign countries
in Latin America, in Guatemala and Chile _ twice in Venezuela.
 &HT;    I'm very excited about going to Mexico. We had two daughters.
One was born in our first post, which was Guatemala. The other was
born at our second post, which was Chile. They're both now pursuing
graduate studies and leading their own lives.
 &HT;    And it's a very close family. I think foreign service existence,
where one transports a family from one country to another, promotes
closeness. And that's been great.
 &HT;    My career has been just something that has given me a great deal
of pleasure. I've gotten to travel around the world, meet all sorts
of interesting people and lived in fascinating places. And I get
paid for it! Which I actually appreciate that part of it too.
 &HT;    We're looking very much forward to Mexico City. My wife is an
active participant in community affairs. She always has been,
wherever we've been. We're looking forward to coming to a greater
understanding of Mexico: its art, its culture, its people. We're
very excited.
 &HT;    Q: Once you assume your official duties in Mexico City, do you
plan to carry on with some of the extra-official duties, honorary
president of the American Society and sponsorship of the Annual
Golf &AMP; Tennis Charity Classic for examples, as well?
 &HT;    A: (LAUGHTER) We intend to continue with very active
participation in community affairs. You know, we'll have to talk to
people once we get there to see what we would be involved in.
 &HT;    But we've always felt that the embassy and the ambassador and
the ambassador's spouse not only has a responsibility to be active
in the American community, but it can be a lot of fun too, and
interesting. And so, I think people can assume that we will be
active and visible and participatory.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is there any message for our readers you would like us to
take back to Mexico?
 &HT;    A: No. No, I don't give messages. We're looking forward to it.
We'll be in Mexico on July 22. And I'll be ready to go to work July
23 in the embassy. And then, of course, I have to wait until I
present my credentials to President Zedillo before I can become
publicly active in Mexico. But I hope that will happen quickly.
 &HT;    We intend to do a lot of traveling in Mexico as well, you know.
We have our consulates that perform an extraordinarily important
function. I want to visit them. I want to visit the major cities. I
want to get around.

 &HT;    WASHINGTON, D.C. _ The United States and Mexico are neighbors
with a historic and dynamic relationship that is pulling them
closer every day. But the road to the future has some bilateral
bumps: illegal immigration, consumption and trafficking of illicit
drugs, trade and border issues are just a few. They provide fodder
for political rhetoric in both countries. Yet, in spite of this,
the relationship remains strong.
 &HT;    In separate exclusive interviews, Dan Dial, editor of The News,
in Mexico City, spoke with the two men most knowledgeable on the
subject: JEFFREY DAVIDOW, U.S. ambassador to Mexico, and JESUS
REYES HEROLES, Mexico's ambassador to the United States.

inappropriate statements of American congressmen and Mexican
congressmen, I'd have to work about 26 hours a day. There's just
not enough time to do that. It's one of the features of democratic
life.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Former Amb. Jones said one of the important tools for an
effective ambassador is ``access'' (which he had) to the top
person. Have/Has President Clinton and/or Secretary Albright
assured you of this kind of access?
 &HT;    Well, you know, I've been working in this job as head of the
Inter American bureau for two-and-a-half years. My relationship
with the secretary of state is, I would say, a close one. We are in
permanent, sometimes almost daily, contact. I've traveled with her
on a large number of trips and I consider her not only my boss, but
my friend. She is a friend I'm proud to have.
 &HT;    With the president, I've traveled with him three times to the
hemisphere _ just in the past year. That was, I think, one of the
most important developments in the U.S. hemispheric policy. And, of
course, I have sat in on numerous meetings with him, have been with
him when he's met with President Zedillo, was with him up in New
York not long ago when he met with President Zedillo up at the
United Nations.
 &HT;    So I feel comfortable that I will have access to those
authorities in Washington who are very much concerned about Mexico.
 &HT;    And I think this will be important and will be a factor not so
much of my personal qualities, whatever they may be or not be, but
the fact that there is a very heavy focus here on our relationship
with Mexico.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you think you will have the same level of access to
President Ernesto Zedillo and Secretary of Foreign Relations
Rosario Green?
 &HT;    A: Well, of course, you know, that's a decision for President
Zedillo and Foreign Secretary Green. I've met both of them on
several occasions.
 &HT;    Again, having worked in my current position for two-and-a-half
years, I've had a lot of opportunity to have contact with numerous
Mexican government officials, including both the president and the
foreign secretary. There are many others in the Mexican government
whom I consider colleagues and friends. And I hope we can deepen
that relationship.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We would like to shift focus now. Can you tell us a little
about you and your family: hobbies, likes, dislikes, etc.?
 &HT;    A: (LAUGHING) It's hard for me to talk about myself. But, you
know, my life has been, for the past 30 years, very much wrapped up
in both my family and my career.
 &HT;    I got married the same year I entered the foreign service, which
was 1969. And our life together as a family has been one of moving
around the world. We've served in seven different foreign countries
in Latin America, in Guatemala and Chile _ twice in Venezuela.
 &HT;    I'm very excited about going to Mexico. We had two daughters.
One was born in our first post, which was Guatemala. The other was
born at our second post, which was Chile. They're both now pursuing
graduate studies and leading their own lives.
 &HT;    And it's a very close family. I think foreign service existence,
where one transports a family from one country to another, promotes
closeness. And that's been great.
 &HT;    My career has been just something that has given me a great deal
of pleasure. I've gotten to travel around the world, meet all sorts
of interesting people and lived in fascinating places. And I get
paid for it! Which I actually appreciate that part of it too.
 &HT;    We're looking very much forward to Mexico City. My wife is an
active participant in community affairs. She always has been,
wherever we've been. We're looking forward to coming to a greater
understanding of Mexico: its art, its culture, its people. We're
very excited.
 &HT;    Q: Once you assume your official duties in Mexico City, do you
plan to carry on with some of the extra-official duties, honorary
president of the American Society and sponsorship of the Annual
Golf &AMP; Tennis Charity Classic for examples, as well?
 &HT;    A: (LAUGHTER) We intend to continue with very active
participation in community affairs. You know, we'll have to talk to
people once we get there to see what we would be involved in.
 &HT;    But we've always felt that the embassy and the ambassador and
the ambassador's spouse not only has a responsibility to be active
in the American community, but it can be a lot of fun too, and
interesting. And so, I think people can assume that we will be
active and visible and participatory.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is there any message for our readers you would like us to
take back to Mexico?
 &HT;    A: No. No, I don't give messages. We're looking forward to it.
We'll be in Mexico on July 22. And I'll be ready to go to work July
23 in the embassy. And then, of course, I have to wait until I
present my credentials to President Zedillo before I can become
publicly active in Mexico. But I hope that will happen quickly.
 &HT;    We intend to do a lot of traveling in Mexico as well, you know.
We have our consulates that perform an extraordinarily important
function. I want to visit them. I want to visit the major cities. I
want to get around.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    DAN DIAL: You have been here for eight months now. Is the job
what you expected? I expected an intense, complex and dynamic
bilateral relationship and great interest about Mexico in the U.S.
government. Even with enormous diplomatic challenges to improve
understanding, there have been a few crises along the way.
 &HT;    JESUS REYES HEROLES: What has surprised me is the magnitude of
the relationship and the speed of events, the degree of
misinformation about Mexico in the United States in general, and
the difficulty to reverse an unfavorable situation and prevent it
from becoming a setback for the relationship.
 &HT;    Let me start with the issues that surprised me. The first one,
with which basically you can see the magnitude of the relationship
in terms of intensity and the speed of events, and secondly the
misinformation about Mexico in the U.S. in general, and third, the
difficulty to reverse an unfavorable situation.
 &HT;    Let me dwell on the last two of them very quickly. I have been
very surprised about the lack of enough strategic thinking in the
United States about the relationship with Mexico. If you see what
happened in the eighties and even the early nineties, when NAFTA
(North American Free Trade Agreement) was crafted, there was a lot
of thinking in the United States about why Mexico was important to
the United States, why something like NAFTA was needed to cement
the relationship and to give a different kind of spin to that
relationship.
 &HT;    I think that helped to get NAFTA passed, and that made a lot of
people think about the relationship for quite some time. But now,
if you go around asking think tanks, going over the literature,
asking the people in the universities or in the critical offices of
the administration _ my perception, my very personal perception _
is that they have been doing very little thinking about Mexico, the
relationship, what's going on in Mexico and what does it mean for
the future of this relationship with the United States.
 &HT;    So, I'm trying to enhance and induce more strategic thinking in
the United States about Mexico as much as possible. I think now, as
compared with the past, we have been doing more strategic thinking
about our relationship with the United States in a cooler, more
objective, more academic, more intellectual way than what the
United States has been doing about Mexico.
 &HT;    In that sense, there has been a reverse on those two things
where I think there is a need to do more here, in terms of the
relationship. So that's one point about the misinformation about
Mexico which is stated right there.
 &HT;    Now, regarding the last point, I want to mention _ in relation
to Casa Blanca _ it is very easy to enter into today's world of
almost a virtual reality, where information flows instantly. When
you have something that is a surprise, something, an event that is
surprising, unexpected _ and then with the role of the media,
governments are really handicapped in terms of their capacity to
react. It is expected for them almost to react in the same
information cycle when the original news was announced.
 &HT;    And that's really very complicated, because within the
government, first, there's a fact-finding period that has to be
done. You really need to know exactly what happened, and you don't
want to react to things you thought had happened. You want to react
to things that really happened. So, that fact-finding period takes
some time.
 &HT;    Second, even if you, when you know about the facts that happened
_ take the case of Casa Blanca _ still you need to go and do some
coordination, interagency coordination in any government. That
applies to the U.S. government or to the Mexican government, in
terms of saying, `Well, we have this very, this extraordinary
situation.'
 &HT;    Let's try to figure out what would be the response to this which
would be acceptable for everybody, acceptable or at least so that
it's adequate to the circumstances that we're in right now. Once
you take care of these two periods, fact-finding and internal
coordination, what happens is that you're already missing the
initial information cycle. And it's inevitable for public opinion
to come out and say the government reacted late to the event that
happened.
 &HT;    I find that extremely worrisome. It's not easy to figure out how
to get out of that, not only in terms of what happened in the past,
but even the surprises that we might get in the future. It's
complicated to figure out a mechanism, a strategy to react
instantly or even more speedily to unforeseen situations. And that
is what makes it very complicated, to reverse the unfavorable
situation and to become set up for the relationship. That's a
comment I wanted to make on that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How has your experience _ both in the public and private
sectors _ helped you as ambassador, or is this a whole new ball
game?
 &HT;    A: It is a new game in the sense that no other position I have
held, either in the public or private sectors, has been as
challenging or complex, requiring such a diverse array of skills
and resources. At the same time, having been in the private sector
has helped me understand the dynamics of the non-governmental
relations between Mexico and the United States. It has given me
another perspective to better understand this country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: While U.S. President Bill Clinton and his administration seem
to be understanding toward Mexico on major bilateral issues,
Congress seems to take pleasure at ``Mexico bashing.'' Is there
anything you can do about this?
 &HT;    A: In general terms, your perception is correct. But it is not
that simple. There are some agencies in the Executive branch that
join, or even foster, attacks on Mexico. Just as well, in Congress
there are several congressmen and senators that very openly try to
better understand the issues and avoid easy and irresponsible
positions that blame Mexico.
 &HT;    The real problem is those who want to reap political benefits
from blaming others for their own problems. For them,
Mexico-bashing has become profitable.
 &HT;    We are trying to better inform both Congress and the
administration while at the same time increase the cost of bashing
Mexico. There are several groups in this country, from businesses
to Mexican-American communities, who can take action in that
regard.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What is your biggest challenge here?
 &HT;    A: I think my response follows up from my previous answer.
Promoting a better understanding of Mexico, preventing crisis in
the relationship and dealing with those on Capitol Hill and other
places that extol in attacking Mexico.
 &HT;    I want to institutionalize relations with Congress. The relative
weight of Congress in shaping foreign policy decisions in this
country has been rising rapidly over the past few years. And
everything indicates that it will continue to do so over the next
few years.
 &HT;    And that means that an embassy like the Mexican Embassy has to
have more capacity to be present in Congress, to share information
with them, to respond to the information needs, and, when invited
to do so, to participate in the public debates in topics that
affect Mexico's interests.
 &HT;    And that is simple to say, but it's a complicated thing to do,
because you're talking about 435 congressmen, and 100 senators, all
of whom are constantly up for election. That's maybe another thing
I could add to the surprises. I mean, I thought that they, the U.S.
Congress, was a little bit more stable, if I may use that word. But
that's not the case, they have elections every two years.
 &HT;    It's really a continuously changing, reshaping, reconstituting
body. And that requires an additional effort in that regard. So I
``institutionalized'' relations with Congress, to figure out a
mechanism that could work at being a continuous presence of the
embassy. The goal is to provide them information, to share our
views about the issues with the congressmen, the congressmen who
are interested, so that we can not only anticipate what kind of
legislative decisions might be taken that could affect our
interests and our rights, but even more to actually make them aware
of the areas of opportunity there are if we work together. So I
would give a lot of weight to this as one of my biggest, our
biggest, challenges here.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You and the SRE consular offices seem to be taking a more
active role in protecting the human rights of Mexican citizens in
the United States. How do you explain this higher profile of an
important bilateral issue?
 &HT;    A: The protection of civil, labor and human rights of Mexicans _
irrespective of their migratory status _ is one of the highest
priorities of Mexican foreign policy. We have tried to better
coordinate the efforts between the consular offices throughout the
country and the Embassy here in Washington.
 &HT;    We have established liaison mechanisms at the border to increase
communication and understanding at the local level while doing the
same with federal authorities here in Washington.
 &HT;    A recent example of this was the establishment of a liaison
mechanism between the embassy and the U.S. attorney general's
office to deal with high visibility cases of police brutality.
 &HT;    We must also defend rights of workers. On the migration issue,
one has to start by making a very blunt distinction between the
issue of undocumented migration, immigration into the United
States, and the issue of legal migration to the United States.
 &HT;    To try to defend or talk on behalf of any kind of undocumented
migration, it's a non-starter. And we never do it. And that's
important, because in Mexico sometimes this is not adequately
understood. The United States has a right to enforce its migration
laws on the border exactly the same way we have the right to
enforce our migration laws on our borders. That's what we do on our
Northern border. That's what we do on our Southern border. Let's
not forget that last year we repatriated to Central America about
100,000 persons from Mexico to Central America.
 &HT;    So that is an area that we have to separate from the area of
legal migration to the United States. And if we don't separate
those two aspects, it's very difficult to talk about the second
one, based upon a more objective, intellectual basis.
 &HT;    On the first issue, undocumented migration to the United States,
what we do is precisely what we stated here. Our worry is to make
sure that when the United States applies its migration law, at the
same time the civil and human rights of our Mexican nationals are
fully respected in the United States. All of these activities of
protection are being spelled out in elements to be answered.
 &HT;    On the other aspect _ legal migration _ that's where we have a
big opportunity to work together. From issues as simple and
important as the change of the border crossing guards to the new
laser visas, where Mexico has been very active in promoting the way
it's done. The U.S. State Department does it in a way that
minimizes the problems to the population in Mexico and that it does
it at the minimal cost for the Mexicans so as to minimize the
negative impact into the border communities.
 &HT;    As for more complicated issues, for example, let's consider
programs of temporary guest workers in the United States. As long
as they fulfill conditions that are required both by the Mexican
government, some of them, and some others by the United States
government and public opinion _ like in our case that Mexican
workers are not exploited.
 &HT;    That means that they are being paid and treated according to the
corresponding laws in the United States. And from the United
States, that any kind of guest worker program warrants that the
people who come work here will return to Mexico and will not stay.
 &HT;    By the way, we have a program like that with Canada, which has
been working very well for the last 12 to 15 years. And there are
no complaints, either of exploitation or about Mexicans staying in
Canada. So this is simply an example of the kind of things that we
would have, of opportunities we have on the legal migration area.
 &HT;    But to be able to discuss this in the way we're talking about
now we have to make sure that we never suggest _ I mean this is
essential _ that we are not in any sense making a case for
undocumented migration to the United States. It's in the best
interests of Mexico to make sure that at no moment is there an
interpretation that we are proposing undocumented migration to the
United States. Although we want the rights _ the civil and human
rights of all our migrants _ to be respected when the United States
actually applies its laws at the border.
 &HT;    And in that regard, we are taking, sort of backing some actions
by the civil society of the United States to protect the workers'
rights of Mexican nationals who are legally working in the United
States, they are documented workers. A very brief example is the
filing of the class action suit against the De Coster Egg Farm.
This is an example of the kind of things that we have to be aware
that exist. We have to act on them and we are acting on them.
Because if we want to move in terms of legal migration, we also
have to make sure that the Mexican workers who come to the United
States are going to be respected in terms of workers' rights.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How would you sum up the state of bilateral relations between
Mexico and the United States?
 &HT;    A: I think that at this point we are undergoing a very difficult
stage in the relationship. Casa Blanca did a lot of damage to the
spirit of trust and cooperation we had built for several years. At
the same time, it is clear that nobody benefits from a sour
bilateral environment. I would say that currently we are in a
``damage repair'' mood.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What will it take to recover from the damage to relations
caused by Operation Casa Blanca?
 &HT;    A: We can only return to the previous cooperative environment if
we can recover mutual respect and mutual trust. I have said that we
need three things for a good bilateral relations: full disclosure,
total cooperation to search for joint solutions and no surprises.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Recently U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's answer
to a question about Chiapas was misunderstood because of the
translation and caused an uproar in Mexico. Do you think the
Mexican press and/or politicians are overly sensitive to what they
perceive as ``foreign intervention''?
 &HT;    One of the negative consequences of Casa Blanca was it created
an unfavorable environment for Mexico-U.S. relations. It increased
our sensitivities and at the same time stirred anti-Mexican
sentiments here. In this atmosphere, any misunderstanding tends to
be magnified.
 &HT;    On the other hand, we must stress that domestic questions, such
as Chiapas, can only be dealt with by Mexicans ourselves.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What is your opinion of U.S. Ambassador-designate Jeffrey
Davidow?
 &HT;    A: I have established an excellent personal relationship with
him. I am sure he will be a very successful U.S. ambassador in
terms of contributing to better communication and cooperation
between our governments.
 &HT;    I offered a farewell dinner for him. We had a very interesting
group: (Jesus and Regina Reyes Heroles, Jeffrey and Joan Davidow,
Thomas and Donna McLarty, Jim and Toril Dobbins, Paul and Diane
Begala, Leon and Lynn Fuerth, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Xavier and
Carolina Becerra, Jim and Olivia Jones, John and Diana Negroponte,
Jorge Castro-Valle, Charles and Kathleen Manatt, Lee H. and Nancy
Hamilton and Christopher Dodd). We also had several congressmen.
 &HT;    We see his nomination as a positive sign. After more than a year
without a U.S. ambassador in Mexico, his arrival is very important.
His previous position makes him very knowledgeable about Mexican
issues. He has worked with several Mexican officials from that
position.
 &HT;    He also has knowledge of contemporary Mexico, sensitivities and
a sense of humor. I think any future ambassador to Mexico needs to
have those three basic characteristics. He has to have a good
knowledge of the bilateral relationship.
 &HT;    And he has it, as undersecretary of Inter-American Affairs he
knows that very well. He speaks Spanish and that's very useful. And
there are very few individuals in the United States who have such
as good a knowledge of the bilateral issues right now as does
Davidow.
 &HT;    The second characteristic the next ambassador to Mexico has to
have, is to be aware of our sensitivities, especially on some
topics that are very, very key to Mexicans. Jeffrey Davidow has
shown over time that he has that sensitivity. He's very careful in
terms of the way he presents his ideas.
 &HT;    That doesn't mean he compromises on the issues, that kind of
thing. But he knows how to go, what kind of terrain he's stepping
on, and on that he's very good.
 &HT;    So we are lucky because he's a sensible man.
 &HT;    And third, I think that any ambassador, the next ambassador to
Mexico needs to have a good sense of humor. And he has an excellent
sense of humor, because it's magical to really, you know, cope with
the stress and cope with the kind of criticism that any U.S.
ambassador to Mexico gets. You need to have a good sense of humor,
and Jeff Davidow, among other qualities, has a very good sense of
humor. So that will help him. That will help Joanna, his wife, and
that will certainly help everybody to really have a smoother
relationship. So I couldn't be more pleased about the nomination of
Jeff Davidow. Not the nomination now, the appointment of Jeff
Davidow as the next ambassador to Mexico.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: If asked, what advice would you give him?
 &HT;    A: I would not give him any advice. I want to be very sure that
I never have some ``advice.'' But I think that he coincides on the
three principles that I have been repeating, the basic operation of
... having a good relationship between the United States and
Mexico. Which are basically that we need to have full disclosure of
all our areas.
 &HT;    We need to know exactly what the other party thinks about each
and every issue of the bilateral agenda. If we keep some things to
ourselves, it complicates things. We don't get to have a real,
direct communication.
 &HT;    We need to prevent surprises as much as possible, not to have
surprises, which is a very important exercise. There are two kinds
of surprises: There are surprises which are preventable and there
are others which are not. We will, therefore, have some surprises
in the future, because we cannot foresee everything with full
precision. Therefore, there will be some things that will happen in
the future which we didn't have the capacity to anticipate.
 &HT;    But it is our responsibility to try to anticipate as many events
as possible _ future events that could become a surprise _ because
surprises damage the relationship very, very much.
 &HT;    And the third principle is that we _ with the kind of problems
we face _ require that we look for joint solutions to these
problems. I mean, the United States is not going to solve the
problem of drug trafficking by themselves. We have to do it
together. It's a problem for the U.S.; it's a problem for Mexico.
And we have to come out to solve it together.
 &HT;    The problem of poverty in Mexico requires the cooperation of the
United States as a country, as an economy _ within the NAFTA
context _ to actually make the North American economy grow.
 &HT;    Solving the problem of migration; that's something we can't
solve by ourselves. That's something the U.S. can't solve by
themselves. It's something that requires a joint solution. So this
is the third point. We have to go out and search for joint
solutions to our problems, and also to face the challenges and the
opportunities that we have.
 &HT;    The best example of it was NAFTA. And in the case of NAFTA, we
really came out, sat down at the table and discussed how to get the
most benefit out of our neighborhood, in terms of trading, with
each other.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Under the new Dual Nationality Law, Mexican citizens living
in the United States can vote in the year 2000 elections.
Considering the sheer numbers, how are you preparing for this?
 &HT;    It is ``non-loss'' of Mexican nationality, not ``dual
nationality.'' There is an important difference between nationality
and citizenship. This will have an effect once the possibility for
Mexicans to vote abroad is enacted, since people will not be able
to vote in two countries. So far, the possibility to vote abroad
has not been enacted, since Congress has not passed legislation in
that regard.
 &HT;    Some groups are pressuring for Congress to deal with this issue
as soon as possible, but apparently technical obstacles may not be
solved in order for us to have the legislation and its
implementation ready for the elections in 2000.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What has been your most satisfying moment as ambassador here?
 &HT;    A: Well, in terms of my most satisfying moment as an ambassador
here, I think there has not been just one moment. But it has been
related with some letters that I have been getting from different
people. Some of them important.
 &HT;    After my visit to the border where we were working to resolve
some of the issues there, like helping to make the U.S. government
realize it was not convenient to establish the exit, the pilot case
for exit controls. And they decided to move it away. I got several
very helpful letters from people on the border saying they didn't
think when I visited them there that something like that could
happen. But at the end of the day we were successful.
 &HT;    Or, especially letters _ letters from some Mexicans who have
been helped by us _ it's not my merit by the way. I want to make
that very clear _ that I have been helped. I have received
assistance from our consulate personnel and our diplomatic
consulars when they are in trouble in the United States. That's
part of our protection and duties.
 &HT;    I think that's how to be motivating and encouraging. It's always
a very human thing to see. If you go to the border, you see these
people who are being caught every day _ captured every day by the
border patrol, and how frightened they are, and how much they are
willing to risk because they want to get to the United States to
get a job. And then, the perils that they go through when they are
actually repatriated to Mexico.
 &HT;    Then when some of them actually write you and tell you they
really appreciated the help of our consular personnel, it's
gratifying to me and it's especially gratifying to the personnel of
the Mexican Foreign Service, who are working so hard on these
issues. And thirdly, I have been getting some communiques from
people in Congress that do appreciate sometimes the efforts we make
to overcome this gap of information, and this problem of
misinformation that I mentioned in response to other questions.
 &HT;    They realize that it is the worst enemy to the bilateral
relationship, for the future of the bilateral relationship, this
misinformation and incorrect perceptions. Anything that we can do
to actually know each other, to talk to each other more directly,
more candidly _ that would be, that would be indeed _ in the best
interests of the two nations.
 &HT;    So it's not one single moment. It's this kind of moment, I have
one every week, or something like that, that are really very, very
rewarding from the position of being ambassador to the United
States.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Washington, D.C., is quite different from Mexico City. How do
you and your family find life here?
 &HT;    A: Washington is a very, a very, _ first of all _ an interesting
city. I hadn't had the chance to know Washington by coming here for
business before. So I sort of didn't know the downtown area. And I
hadn't had the chance to explore the suburbs of Washington. That
has been a very pleasant discovery.
 &HT;    Washington is a city where you can combine both a very intense
and challenging professional life with family life. I mean, you
have more control about your time schedules in general. It's not
that you don't work a lot; you work a lot everyday. But you know,
more or less, at what time you are going to end your day. That's
with few exceptions. That's one thing.
 &HT;    Second, you can do some family life during the week _ that's
very pleasant. People do that; people get together; people visit
each other. You have the chance to stay with your family or to do
things with your family during the week. Washington in that regard
is a very warm and very humane city. We are certainly enjoying it
in that regard.
 &HT;    I think we have only seen the tip of the iceberg now. Everyday
we come out with the assurance that we will find something else
that is going to make it even more enjoyable to be here. And this
is a very convenient combination a top job which requires hard work
and, at the same time, the capacity to have some time for
ourselves, personally and in terms of the family.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you have children here?
 &HT;    A: Yes, we have three kids _ a daughter who's 16 years old, a
son 14, and a daughter 8 years old. So we have the whole array of
ages, from teen-agers to quasi teen-agers and to a little kid that
can cope with the other quasi- and full teenagers. (LAUGHING) So we
have the full array.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    DAN DIAL: You have been here for eight months now. Is the job
what you expected? I expected an intense, complex and dynamic
bilateral relationship and great interest about Mexico in the U.S.
government. Even with enormous diplomatic challenges to improve
understanding, there have been a few crises along the way.
 &HT;    JESUS REYES HEROLES: What has surprised me is the magnitude of
the relationship and the speed of events, the degree of
misinformation about Mexico in the United States in general, and
the difficulty to reverse an unfavorable situation and prevent it
from becoming a setback for the relationship.
 &HT;    Let me start with the issues that surprised me. The first one,
with which basically you can see the magnitude of the relationship
in terms of intensity and the speed of events, and secondly the
misinformation about Mexico in the U.S. in general, and third, the
difficulty to reverse an unfavorable situation.
 &HT;    Let me dwell on the last two of them very quickly. I have been
very surprised about the lack of enough strategic thinking in the
United States about the relationship with Mexico. If you see what
happened in the eighties and even the early nineties, when NAFTA
(North American Free Trade Agreement) was crafted, there was a lot
of thinking in the United States about why Mexico was important to
the United States, why something like NAFTA was needed to cement
the relationship and to give a different kind of spin to that
relationship.
 &HT;    I think that helped to get NAFTA passed, and that made a lot of
people think about the relationship for quite some time. But now,
if you go around asking think tanks, going over the literature,
asking the people in the universities or in the critical offices of
the administration _ my perception, my very personal perception _
is that they have been doing very little thinking about Mexico, the
relationship, what's going on in Mexico and what does it mean for
the future of this relationship with the United States.
 &HT;    So, I'm trying to enhance and induce more strategic thinking in
the United States about Mexico as much as possible. I think now, as
compared with the past, we have been doing more strategic thinking
about our relationship with the United States in a cooler, more
objective, more academic, more intellectual way than what the
United States has been doing about Mexico.
 &HT;    In that sense, there has been a reverse on those two things
where I think there is a need to do more here, in terms of the
relationship. So that's one point about the misinformation about
Mexico which is stated right there.
 &HT;    Now, regarding the last point, I want to mention _ in relation
to Casa Blanca _ it is very easy to enter into today's world of
almost a virtual reality, where information flows instantly. When
you have something that is a surprise, something, an event that is
surprising, unexpected _ and then with the role of the media,
governments are really handicapped in terms of their capacity to
react. It is expected for them almost to react in the same
information cycle when the original news was announced.
 &HT;    And that's really very complicated, because within the
government, first, there's a fact-finding period that has to be
done. You really need to know exactly what happened, and you don't
want to react to things you thought had happened. You want to react
to things that really happened. So, that fact-finding period takes
some time.
 &HT;    Second, even if you, when you know about the facts that happened
_ take the case of Casa Blanca _ still you need to go and do some
coordination, interagency coordination in any government. That
applies to the U.S. government or to the Mexican government, in
terms of saying, `Well, we have this very, this extraordinary
situation.'
 &HT;    Let's try to figure out what would be the response to this which
would be acceptable for everybody, acceptable or at least so that
it's adequate to the circumstances that we're in right now. Once
you take care of these two periods, fact-finding and internal
coordination, what happens is that you're already missing the
initial information cycle. And it's inevitable for public opinion
to come out and say the government reacted late to the event that
happened.
 &HT;    I find that extremely worrisome. It's not easy to figure out how
to get out of that, not only in terms of what happened in the past,
but even the surprises that we might get in the future. It's
complicated to figure out a mechanism, a strategy to react
instantly or even more speedily to unforeseen situations. And that
is what makes it very complicated, to reverse the unfavorable
situation and to become set up for the relationship. That's a
comment I wanted to make on that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How has your experience _ both in the public and private
sectors _ helped you as ambassador, or is this a whole new ball
game?
 &HT;    A: It is a new game in the sense that no other position I have
held, either in the public or private sectors, has been as
challenging or complex, requiring such a diverse array of skills
and resources. At the same time, having been in the private sector
has helped me understand the dynamics of the non-governmental
relations between Mexico and the United States. It has given me
another perspective to better understand this country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: While U.S. President Bill Clinton and his administration seem
to be understanding toward Mexico on major bilateral issues,
Congress seems to take pleasure at ``Mexico bashing.'' Is there
anything you can do about this?
 &HT;    A: In general terms, your perception is correct. But it is not
that simple. There are some agencies in the Executive branch that
join, or even foster, attacks on Mexico. Just as well, in Congress
there are several congressmen and senators that very openly try to
better understand the issues and avoid easy and irresponsible
positions that blame Mexico.
 &HT;    The real problem is those who want to reap political benefits
from blaming others for their own problems. For them,
Mexico-bashing has become profitable.
 &HT;    We are trying to better inform both Congress and the
administration while at the same time increase the cost of bashing
Mexico. There are several groups in this country, from businesses
to Mexican-American communities, who can take action in that
regard.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What is your biggest challenge here?
 &HT;    A: I think my response follows up from my previous answer.
Promoting a better understanding of Mexico, preventing crisis in
the relationship and dealing with those on Capitol Hill and other
places that extol in attacking Mexico.
 &HT;    I want to institutionalize relations with Congress. The relative
weight of Congress in shaping foreign policy decisions in this
country has been rising rapidly over the past few years. And
everything indicates that it will continue to do so over the next
few years.
 &HT;    And that means that an embassy like the Mexican Embassy has to
have more capacity to be present in Congress, to share information
with them, to respond to the information needs, and, when invited
to do so, to participate in the public debates in topics that
affect Mexico's interests.
 &HT;    And that is simple to say, but it's a complicated thing to do,
because you're talking about 435 congressmen, and 100 senators, all
of whom are constantly up for election. That's maybe another thing
I could add to the surprises. I mean, I thought that they, the U.S.
Congress, was a little bit more stable, if I may use that word. But
that's not the case, they have elections every two years.
 &HT;    It's really a continuously changing, reshaping, reconstituting
body. And that requires an additional effort in that regard. So I
``institutionalized'' relations with Congress, to figure out a
mechanism that could work at being a continuous presence of the
embassy. The goal is to provide them information, to share our
views about the issues with the congressmen, the congressmen who
are interested, so that we can not only anticipate what kind of
legislative decisions might be taken that could affect our
interests and our rights, but even more to actually make them aware
of the areas of opportunity there are if we work together. So I
would give a lot of weight to this as one of my biggest, our
biggest, challenges here.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: You and the SRE consular offices seem to be taking a more
active role in protecting the human rights of Mexican citizens in
the United States. How do you explain this higher profile of an
important bilateral issue?
 &HT;    A: The protection of civil, labor and human rights of Mexicans _
irrespective of their migratory status _ is one of the highest
priorities of Mexican foreign policy. We have tried to better
coordinate the efforts between the consular offices throughout the
country and the Embassy here in Washington.
 &HT;    We have established liaison mechanisms at the border to increase
communication and understanding at the local level while doing the
same with federal authorities here in Washington.
 &HT;    A recent example of this was the establishment of a liaison
mechanism between the embassy and the U.S. attorney general's
office to deal with high visibility cases of police brutality.
 &HT;    We must also defend rights of workers. On the migration issue,
one has to start by making a very blunt distinction between the
issue of undocumented migration, immigration into the United
States, and the issue of legal migration to the United States.
 &HT;    To try to defend or talk on behalf of any kind of undocumented
migration, it's a non-starter. And we never do it. And that's
important, because in Mexico sometimes this is not adequately
understood. The United States has a right to enforce its migration
laws on the border exactly the same way we have the right to
enforce our migration laws on our borders. That's what we do on our
Northern border. That's what we do on our Southern border. Let's
not forget that last year we repatriated to Central America about
100,000 persons from Mexico to Central America.
 &HT;    So that is an area that we have to separate from the area of
legal migration to the United States. And if we don't separate
those two aspects, it's very difficult to talk about the second
one, based upon a more objective, intellectual basis.
 &HT;    On the first issue, undocumented migration to the United States,
what we do is precisely what we stated here. Our worry is to make
sure that when the United States applies its migration law, at the
same time the civil and human rights of our Mexican nationals are
fully respected in the United States. All of these activities of
protection are being spelled out in elements to be answered.
 &HT;    On the other aspect _ legal migration _ that's where we have a
big opportunity to work together. From issues as simple and
important as the change of the border crossing guards to the new
laser visas, where Mexico has been very active in promoting the way
it's done. The U.S. State Department does it in a way that
minimizes the problems to the population in Mexico and that it does
it at the minimal cost for the Mexicans so as to minimize the
negative impact into the border communities.
 &HT;    As for more complicated issues, for example, let's consider
programs of temporary guest workers in the United States. As long
as they fulfill conditions that are required both by the Mexican
government, some of them, and some others by the United States
government and public opinion _ like in our case that Mexican
workers are not exploited.
 &HT;    That means that they are being paid and treated according to the
corresponding laws in the United States. And from the United
States, that any kind of guest worker program warrants that the
people who come work here will return to Mexico and will not stay.
 &HT;    By the way, we have a program like that with Canada, which has
been working very well for the last 12 to 15 years. And there are
no complaints, either of exploitation or about Mexicans staying in
Canada. So this is simply an example of the kind of things that we
would have, of opportunities we have on the legal migration area.
 &HT;    But to be able to discuss this in the way we're talking about
now we have to make sure that we never suggest _ I mean this is
essential _ that we are not in any sense making a case for
undocumented migration to the United States. It's in the best
interests of Mexico to make sure that at no moment is there an
interpretation that we are proposing undocumented migration to the
United States. Although we want the rights _ the civil and human
rights of all our migrants _ to be respected when the United States
actually applies its laws at the border.
 &HT;    And in that regard, we are taking, sort of backing some actions
by the civil society of the United States to protect the workers'
rights of Mexican nationals who are legally working in the United
States, they are documented workers. A very brief example is the
filing of the class action suit against the De Coster Egg Farm.
This is an example of the kind of things that we have to be aware
that exist. We have to act on them and we are acting on them.
Because if we want to move in terms of legal migration, we also
have to make sure that the Mexican workers who come to the United
States are going to be respected in terms of workers' rights.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How would you sum up the state of bilateral relations between
Mexico and the United States?
 &HT;    A: I think that at this point we are undergoing a very difficult
stage in the relationship. Casa Blanca did a lot of damage to the
spirit of trust and cooperation we had built for several years. At
the same time, it is clear that nobody benefits from a sour
bilateral environment. I would say that currently we are in a
``damage repair'' mood.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What will it take to recover from the damage to relations
caused by Operation Casa Blanca?
 &HT;    A: We can only return to the previous cooperative environment if
we can recover mutual respect and mutual trust. I have said that we
need three things for a good bilateral relations: full disclosure,
total cooperation to search for joint solutions and no surprises.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Recently U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's answer
to a question about Chiapas was misunderstood because of the
translation and caused an uproar in Mexico. Do you think the
Mexican press and/or politicians are overly sensitive to what they
perceive as ``foreign intervention''?
 &HT;    One of the negative consequences of Casa Blanca was it created
an unfavorable environment for Mexico-U.S. relations. It increased
our sensitivities and at the same time stirred anti-Mexican
sentiments here. In this atmosphere, any misunderstanding tends to
be magnified.
 &HT;    On the other hand, we must stress that domestic questions, such
as Chiapas, can only be dealt with by Mexicans ourselves.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What is your opinion of U.S. Ambassador-designate Jeffrey
Davidow?
 &HT;    A: I have established an excellent personal relationship with
him. I am sure he will be a very successful U.S. ambassador in
terms of contributing to better communication and cooperation
between our governments.
 &HT;    I offered a farewell dinner for him. We had a very interesting
group: (Jesus and Regina Reyes Heroles, Jeffrey and Joan Davidow,
Thomas and Donna McLarty, Jim and Toril Dobbins, Paul and Diane
Begala, Leon and Lynn Fuerth, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Xavier and
Carolina Becerra, Jim and Olivia Jones, John and Diana Negroponte,
Jorge Castro-Valle, Charles and Kathleen Manatt, Lee H. and Nancy
Hamilton and Christopher Dodd). We also had several congressmen.
 &HT;    We see his nomination as a positive sign. After more than a year
without a U.S. ambassador in Mexico, his arrival is very important.
His previous position makes him very knowledgeable about Mexican
issues. He has worked with several Mexican officials from that
position.
 &HT;    He also has knowledge of contemporary Mexico, sensitivities and
a sense of humor. I think any future ambassador to Mexico needs to
have those three basic characteristics. He has to have a good
knowledge of the bilateral relationship.
 &HT;    And he has it, as undersecretary of Inter-American Affairs he
knows that very well. He speaks Spanish and that's very useful. And
there are very few individuals in the United States who have such
as good a knowledge of the bilateral issues right now as does
Davidow.
 &HT;    The second characteristic the next ambassador to Mexico has to
have, is to be aware of our sensitivities, especially on some
topics that are very, very key to Mexicans. Jeffrey Davidow has
shown over time that he has that sensitivity. He's very careful in
terms of the way he presents his ideas.
 &HT;    That doesn't mean he compromises on the issues, that kind of
thing. But he knows how to go, what kind of terrain he's stepping
on, and on that he's very good.
 &HT;    So we are lucky because he's a sensible man.
 &HT;    And third, I think that any ambassador, the next ambassador to
Mexico needs to have a good sense of humor. And he has an excellent
sense of humor, because it's magical to really, you know, cope with
the stress and cope with the kind of criticism that any U.S.
ambassador to Mexico gets. You need to have a good sense of humor,
and Jeff Davidow, among other qualities, has a very good sense of
humor. So that will help him. That will help Joanna, his wife, and
that will certainly help everybody to really have a smoother
relationship. So I couldn't be more pleased about the nomination of
Jeff Davidow. Not the nomination now, the appointment of Jeff
Davidow as the next ambassador to Mexico.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: If asked, what advice would you give him?
 &HT;    A: I would not give him any advice. I want to be very sure that
I never have some ``advice.'' But I think that he coincides on the
three principles that I have been repeating, the basic operation of
... having a good relationship between the United States and
Mexico. Which are basically that we need to have full disclosure of
all our areas.
 &HT;    We need to know exactly what the other party thinks about each
and every issue of the bilateral agenda. If we keep some things to
ourselves, it complicates things. We don't get to have a real,
direct communication.
 &HT;    We need to prevent surprises as much as possible, not to have
surprises, which is a very important exercise. There are two kinds
of surprises: There are surprises which are preventable and there
are others which are not. We will, therefore, have some surprises
in the future, because we cannot foresee everything with full
precision. Therefore, there will be some things that will happen in
the future which we didn't have the capacity to anticipate.
 &HT;    But it is our responsibility to try to anticipate as many events
as possible _ future events that could become a surprise _ because
surprises damage the relationship very, very much.
 &HT;    And the third principle is that we _ with the kind of problems
we face _ require that we look for joint solutions to these
problems. I mean, the United States is not going to solve the
problem of drug trafficking by themselves. We have to do it
together. It's a problem for the U.S.; it's a problem for Mexico.
And we have to come out to solve it together.
 &HT;    The problem of poverty in Mexico requires the cooperation of the
United States as a country, as an economy _ within the NAFTA
context _ to actually make the North American economy grow.
 &HT;    Solving the problem of migration; that's something we can't
solve by ourselves. That's something the U.S. can't solve by
themselves. It's something that requires a joint solution. So this
is the third point. We have to go out and search for joint
solutions to our problems, and also to face the challenges and the
opportunities that we have.
 &HT;    The best example of it was NAFTA. And in the case of NAFTA, we
really came out, sat down at the table and discussed how to get the
most benefit out of our neighborhood, in terms of trading, with
each other.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Under the new Dual Nationality Law, Mexican citizens living
in the United States can vote in the year 2000 elections.
Considering the sheer numbers, how are you preparing for this?
 &HT;    It is ``non-loss'' of Mexican nationality, not ``dual
nationality.'' There is an important difference between nationality
and citizenship. This will have an effect once the possibility for
Mexicans to vote abroad is enacted, since people will not be able
to vote in two countries. So far, the possibility to vote abroad
has not been enacted, since Congress has not passed legislation in
that regard.
 &HT;    Some groups are pressuring for Congress to deal with this issue
as soon as possible, but apparently technical obstacles may not be
solved in order for us to have the legislation and its
implementation ready for the elections in 2000.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What has been your most satisfying moment as ambassador here?
 &HT;    A: Well, in terms of my most satisfying moment as an ambassador
here, I think there has not been just one moment. But it has been
related with some letters that I have been getting from different
people. Some of them important.
 &HT;    After my visit to the border where we were working to resolve
some of the issues there, like helping to make the U.S. government
realize it was not convenient to establish the exit, the pilot case
for exit controls. And they decided to move it away. I got several
very helpful letters from people on the border saying they didn't
think when I visited them there that something like that could
happen. But at the end of the day we were successful.
 &HT;    Or, especially letters _ letters from some Mexicans who have
been helped by us _ it's not my merit by the way. I want to make
that very clear _ that I have been helped. I have received
assistance from our consulate personnel and our diplomatic
consulars when they are in trouble in the United States. That's
part of our protection and duties.
 &HT;    I think that's how to be motivating and encouraging. It's always
a very human thing to see. If you go to the border, you see these
people who are being caught every day _ captured every day by the
border patrol, and how frightened they are, and how much they are
willing to risk because they want to get to the United States to
get a job. And then, the perils that they go through when they are
actually repatriated to Mexico.
 &HT;    Then when some of them actually write you and tell you they
really appreciated the help of our consular personnel, it's
gratifying to me and it's especially gratifying to the personnel of
the Mexican Foreign Service, who are working so hard on these
issues. And thirdly, I have been getting some communiques from
people in Congress that do appreciate sometimes the efforts we make
to overcome this gap of information, and this problem of
misinformation that I mentioned in response to other questions.
 &HT;    They realize that it is the worst enemy to the bilateral
relationship, for the future of the bilateral relationship, this
misinformation and incorrect perceptions. Anything that we can do
to actually know each other, to talk to each other more directly,
more candidly _ that would be, that would be indeed _ in the best
interests of the two nations.
 &HT;    So it's not one single moment. It's this kind of moment, I have
one every week, or something like that, that are really very, very
rewarding from the position of being ambassador to the United
States.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Washington, D.C., is quite different from Mexico City. How do
you and your family find life here?
 &HT;    A: Washington is a very, a very, _ first of all _ an interesting
city. I hadn't had the chance to know Washington by coming here for
business before. So I sort of didn't know the downtown area. And I
hadn't had the chance to explore the suburbs of Washington. That
has been a very pleasant discovery.
 &HT;    Washington is a city where you can combine both a very intense
and challenging professional life with family life. I mean, you
have more control about your time schedules in general. It's not
that you don't work a lot; you work a lot everyday. But you know,
more or less, at what time you are going to end your day. That's
with few exceptions. That's one thing.
 &HT;    Second, you can do some family life during the week _ that's
very pleasant. People do that; people get together; people visit
each other. You have the chance to stay with your family or to do
things with your family during the week. Washington in that regard
is a very warm and very humane city. We are certainly enjoying it
in that regard.
 &HT;    I think we have only seen the tip of the iceberg now. Everyday
we come out with the assurance that we will find something else
that is going to make it even more enjoyable to be here. And this
is a very convenient combination a top job which requires hard work
and, at the same time, the capacity to have some time for
ourselves, personally and in terms of the family.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you have children here?
 &HT;    A: Yes, we have three kids _ a daughter who's 16 years old, a
son 14, and a daughter 8 years old. So we have the whole array of
ages, from teen-agers to quasi teen-agers and to a little kid that
can cope with the other quasi- and full teenagers. (LAUGHING) So we
have the full array.

<P>
   A new era in cancer therapy could be opened later this year with
the launch of a vaccine which tackles the disease in a new way and
could spell the end of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine is the first cancer vaccine which has been developed as
a treatment for advanced melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin
cancer which claims 2,000 lives a year in the UK.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is expected to win approval from the U.S. Food and
Drugs Administration within the next six months after trials in
patients showed ``promising'' results.
</P>
<P>
   A further five or six cancer vaccines are in the pipeline and
are expected to be launched within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts predict that they could spell the end of
chemotherapy _ treatment with large doses of toxic drugs whose
effects can be worse than the disease _ and usher in kinder
therapies for people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer vaccines are so-called because they work by harnessing
the body's immune system to fight the disease. They differ from
conventional vaccines because they are given as a treatment rather
than to prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first new class of drugs for cancer in a decade
since the taxanes were developed in the late 1980s. These include
the drugs Taxol, for advanced ovarian cancer, which is derived from
the bark of the Pacific yew tree and Taxotere, for advanced breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the first cancer for which researchers have
identified antigenic molecules on the surface of the cancer cells
which act as a trigger for the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Melacine, made by the U.S. biotechnology company Ribi
Immunochem, is one of a number of vaccines being developed for
melanoma which primes the immune system to recognize the molecules
and boosts the immune response to destroy cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Angus Dalgliesh, director of the Gordon Cancer Vaccine
Laboratory at St. George's Hospital, London, said: ``Cancer
vaccines may well take over from chemotherapy. They will probably
knock out chemotherapy in some adjuvant regimes (where it is given
with other drugs).''
</P>
<P>
   Most cancers had been developing for years in the body before
they were diagnosed during which they turned the immune response
off. The idea of cancer vaccines was to reawaken the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Where cancer vaccines are going to work is in cases
where a solid tumor is removed and there is a high chance of the
cancer coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the people who will get the vaccine to kick start the
immune system. In most cases it will only delay the inevitable but
if you can do that with a non-toxic treatment that will be a
valuable advance.'' &QL;

CHEERS!: HEMP BEER IS HERE _ BUT YOU WON'T GET STONED

   The country's first hemp beer is being consumed in London's bars
and clubs. But anti-drug campaigners need not worry _ you would
need to drink 3,000 bottles to get stoned.
</P>
<P>
   A German company has teamed up with an English importer to bring
the grass-flavored drink to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Asbjorn Gerlach, one of the founders of the Berlin-based Bier
Company, said: ``Hops and hemp are very closely related. In 1996,
when growing hemp became legal, we decided to try making beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using hemp as a flavoring agent in beer is a very old idea and
was popular in the Middle Ages. The drink has a slightly fruity,
grassy flavor but tastes very similar to lager.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain of hemp used for beer-making is a sister plant of
cannabis and contains only minute amounts of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlach said: ``You would have to drink so many bottles that it
would kill you before you got stoned. We are not promoting cannabis
_ we are promoting hemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called the beer `Turn' because we want people to turn
their minds to the idea of using hemp. It is good for the
environment. To make paper it takes 12 hectares of rainforest but
only one hectare of hemp.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Haddow, an Englishman living near Munich, was already
exporting chocolate from Germany to Britain when he came across the
new 4.9 percent brew and instantly had the idea of introducing it
to the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Haddow and his nephew Paul set up in business and have so far
exported Turn to England and Denmark. It is also bound for France,
Italy, Spain and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Haddow said: ``Brian is a real fan of German beers and hemp
beer tastes very similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are targeting the 18- to 32-year-olds in trendy London bars
and clubs. After that we want to take it to the rest of the
country.'' &QL;

newspaper in London.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For 85 years, the Owens Valley in central
California has been sucked dry by the city of Los Angeles, its
natural spring and lake water diverted to feed the sinks, jacuzzis
and lawn sprinklers of the ever-expanding metropolis 250 miles to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of recrimination and threats of legal action,
Los Angeles has at last agreed to take responsibility for some of
the environmental havoc it has wreaked.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from new federal air-pollution legislation, the
city has promised to treat the dustbowl _ once a lake _ at the
heart of Owens Valley with a mixture of water, vegetation and
gravel in an effort to curb the worst source of particle air
pollution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached between the two sides last week, 22
1/2 miles of the lake bed will be treated by 2006 at an estimated
cost of 120 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The city will continue to treat further stretches of the lake
after that until air quality meets standards set down in the
federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The water of Owens Valley was the key to the massive expansion
of Los Angeles in the first few decades of this century, and _ as
Roman Polanski and Robert Towne evoked in their acclaimed film noir
``Chinatown'' _ also a symbol of the bad faith, big business
interests and corruption that has accompanied the uncontrolled
sprawl of America's biggest and wildest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers of Owens Valley sold their land in 1913 to a group
of businessmen posing as cattle ranchers who in fact were acting as
agents for the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The locals were thus cheated not only of their water and their
livelihoods, but also of the compensation to which they might have
been entitled if the city authorities had approached them directly.
</P>
<P>
   While the new water source paved the way for the settlement of
the San Fernando Valley immediately north of Los Angeles _ making a
handful of property speculators very rich into the bargain _ the
Owens Valley economy descended into a slump from which it has never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Owens Valley has been prone to storms of white dust
containing arsenic and numerous toxic metals that cause heart and
lung ailments in the local population. The battle to force Los
Angeles to take responsibility for the disaster has been waged in
earnest for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest, and arguably the most important, of a
series of concessions that L.A. has made over its water supply in
recent years. Interest groups at Mono Lake, another 50 miles
further north, prised similar concessions from Los Angeles a few
years ago, but only after protracted legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, Los Angeles stands to lose about 40,000
acre-feet of water per year, enough to service 80,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   But by settling the issue now it averts the risk of a the far
deeper and more costly commitment to environmental cleanup, as
initially demanded by the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control
District, representing the interests of Owens Valley. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politics is a little dull in America at the moment,
but help is at hand. J Danforth Quayle, the former vice president,
is emerging from the shadows to get his campaign for president on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The man who taught American students how to spell ``potatoe'' is
back in the saddle again.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has a serious chance of the Republican nomination for the
Presidency in the 2000 election. He was, after all, a congressman
at 29 and senator at 33 as well as vice president. He is a favorite
of many conservatives, especially on the religious right, and he
scores well in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But what will count against Quayle, inevitably, is his startling
verbal track record.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the word potato that he has managed to mangle: in
the annals of American politics, Quayle has delivered some of the
most astonishing sentences and paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   His legendary ability with language comes close to brilliance,
producing quotations that are a parody of the pol-speak that every
American politician must learn.
</P>
<P>
   He has come up with little gems that echo the empty rhetoric of
his colleagues, but with far greater simplicity. ``If we do not
succeed,'' he said once, ``we run the risk of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his utterances have been near misses at important
truths. ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend towards more
freedom and democracy _ but that could change,'' he said on another
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it is hard to divine what, exactly, is going on in his
head. As he himself once said, ``Verbosity leads to unclear,
inarticulate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even more riveting: ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind.
Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest we believe that this habit has been exorcised in the years
away from the spotlight, Quayle popped up on television recently to
demonstrate his insight into the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just be very clear that the Republican Party will
select a nominee that will beat Bill Clinton,'' he said. This is an
admirable aspiration. But Clinton, sadly, is prohibited by the
Constitution from running in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll in May by CNN, USA Today and Gallup showed
Quayle as one of the top four possibles alongside the Texas
governor, George W. Bush, (son of the former president), Elizabeth
Dole (wife of former candidate Robert) and Jack Kemp, another
former candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is discreetly putting his hat in the ring. He has a
political action committee gathering funds, Campaign America, based
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He made a campaign swing through Iowa, a key state, recently,
using the opportunity to take a poke at Bill Clinton and his team,
which he called ``the most scandal-plagued administration in the
history of our republic.''
</P>
<P>
   He is quietly recruiting friends and associates to work on his
campaign, which is likely to gather steam in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   He is distancing himself from his one-time patron, George Bush,
and will put himself forward as an anti-establishment candidate _
an odd position for a man who has spent most of his adult life in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the Republican candidacy at the moment is
George W. Bush, who is, by the standards of the Republican Party in
1998, a relative moderate.
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates who will try to snatch the support of
the religious right, but none has Quayle's name recognition, and
few have his fund-raising potential and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes about him will not exactly help, but Quayle has become
better at deflecting them and even capitalizing on his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you shake this image that you had during your
vice-presidency as sort of a bumbling vice president who couldn't
spell?'' he was asked on a recent television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' he replied. ``I'll let all the perfect
spellers support Al Gore and those who have trouble spelling should
support me.'' On that basis, he could be on for a landslide
victory. &QL;

SMALL-TOWN COOKBOOKS OFFER BIG FLAVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every city and town in Texas has its own cookbook. I think it
goes along with getting a charter.
</P>
<P>
   The garden club or the Junior League or a bunch of guys with big
smokers on wheels put together pages of recipes, get them published
and sell them to buy new uniforms for the cheerleaders, or maybe
new hooks for the hook-and-ladder truck down at the volunteer fire
station.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, these books are genuinely fascinating, full
of good food, or at least good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is finding them. Some find their way to big
distributors that sell to the Barnes &AMP; Nobles of the world, but
most just sit around on dusty shelves at the chamber of commerce or
the downtown bank.
</P>
<P>
   I like what the Community Garden Club of Johnson City did.
Members painted a sign extolling the virtues of their book and put
it right there on U.S. 281, near the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   The new book is called ``Second Helping, Potluck on the
Pedernales.''
</P>
<P>
   The first helping was served up in 1981 and won the McIlhenny
Company's Tabasco Community Cookbook contest for the Southwest
region. When the members of the garden club cookbook committee
entered the contest, they promised to do another book if they won.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they apparently wanted to get out of the way first was
the geography of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pedernales River is one of the last free-flowing rivers in
Texas with no major dams,'' the book explains. ``The river bisects
the LBJ heartland, rising in southeast Kimble County, flowing
eastward for 106 miles through Gillespie County, central Blanco
County and onward to northern Hays County, finally joining the
Colorado River in western Travis County.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedernales, the book explains, is pronounced ``Purd'nalis.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the joys in these kinds of cookbooks is the simplicity of
the recipes. There is no shame in opening cans. If you need a
sauce, Campbell soups work just fine.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of unusual chapters in this newest book.
After the normal sections on appetizers and soups and sandwiches,
main dishes and vegetables, is ``Look Who's Cooking? Macho Meals
Men Make, Including Wild Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an additional chapter on ``Tried-and-True Recipes Fifty
Years or Older,'' and ``Jarring Ideas, Puttin' Up Advice, Hints,
Proverbs and a Few Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The real charm of the book is in the small notes the
contributors sent along with their recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Ola Matus, for example, wrote this note above her chicken
enchilada offering: ``My daughter, Suzanne, won first place at the
District 4-H Food Show in Austin with this recipe. She was 13 years
old and received this recipe from her Aunt Sharon Matus in Texas
City. Gov. Ann Richards was the speaker at the food show that day.
She was then Commissioner Richards. We were very impressed with her
speech; she said, `I am going home this very night and make these
enchiladas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Penny Mengers sent in the same recipe.
She said: ``I served this to Billy's family and friends when he
graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1987 when I was still Penny
Liles. It has become a family favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the recipe:
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN ENCHILADAS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 6 _ 6 chicken breasts _ 2 cans cream of chicken soup _
16-ounce container sour cream _ 2 4-ounce cans green chiles _ 1
onion, chopped _ 1 cup chicken broth _ 1 pound sharp Cheddar
cheese, grated _ 12 flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Boil chicken in water to cover until fork-tender; reserve broth.
Cool, chop into small pieces. Combine soup, sour cream, chiles,
onion and 1 cup broth. Line 13-by-9-by-2-inch casserole with small
amount of soup mixture. Dip tortillas in chicken broth, fill with
small amount of chicken and cheese. Roll. Place in casserole. Cover
all with rest of soup mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
The last 10 minutes, add the rest of the grated cheese on top.

BLACKSTONE HOTEL'S BLACK-BOTTOM PIE, CHOCOLATE MOUSSE ANGEL FOOD
CAKE

By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am always amazed at what readers come up with from their
recipe boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, a reader called looking for the recipe
for the black-bottom pie that was once served at the old Blackstone
Hotel in Fort Worth. (The Blackstone is under renovation and will
reopen next year.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the hotel has been closed for at least 10 years, I was
sure this was an impossible request. But no.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha McAfee of Fort Worth used to live near one of the mothers
of one of the Blackstone's chefs. In the early 1950s, she gave
Bertha the recipe for the pie. Bertha writes that everyone loves
the pie _ one friend said he thought it had medicinal properties.  &QL;

THE FILMMAKING TRAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This takes guts.
</P>
<P>
   Remaking ``The Parent Trap,'' the 1961 Hayley Mills twin farce
beloved of preteens and soccer moms everywhere, could not be just
another crass, commercial update like such recent Disney
vault-raids as ``101 Dalmatians'' and ``Flubber.'' It had to
capture the strong, primal allure of the original movie _ itself an
unpretentious family comedy _ while carefully giving it a '90s
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you can't be disrespectful to the original,''
says producer Charles Shyer, who co-scripted the remake with his
wife, director Nancy Meyers. ``And you have to be smart enough to
know what it was about the original movie that appealed to people,
because that doesn't ever change. Then, while keeping those intact,
you try to bring it up to contemporary times and put your own stamp
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic plot line is pretty well-preserved. Two 11-year-old
girls meet at summer camp, immediately dislike each other despite
(or because) they look identical, soon discover they're twins who
were separated at birth, switch places in order to meet the parent
they've never known, then scheme to reunite their mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   A few new wrinkles: rather than living in Boston, Annie James,
the mother's girl, is from London. Hallie Parker, the dad-raised
daughter, still hails from California, only this time her home is a
Napa Valley winery. Each unit also has a beloved employee who
serves as a surrogate parent _ for Hallie, it's an earthy
housekeeper; for Annie, a playful British butler.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, things follow the basic pattern, with high-tech
assists from computer-connected, motion-control cameras that allow
Lindsay Lohan, the young actress who plays Annie and Hallie, to
interact with herself in ways Hayley Mills never could.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that also made filming much more complicated and
work-intensive than the original, which employed relatively simple
split-screen technology and a locked-down camera. With more than
100 digital shots that required meticulous staging and restaging,
Meyers had a lot to handle in her directing debut (Shyer helmed the
couple's previous features: ``Irreconcilable Differences,'' ``Baby
Boom'' and the ``Father of the Bride'' remakes).
</P>
<P>
   She didn't really have time to worry about whether ``Trap'' fans
would approve of her interpretation. Then again, she didn't feel a
need to worry, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of those people,'' she says. `` `Father of the Bride'
wasn't anything I was personally attached to, but `Parent Trap' is
a different story. I absolutely adore the film, so I wasn't nervous
about that. I thought I knew the picture well enough to know what
not to change and what I could modernize to make it work for kids
today. People who love `The Parent Trap' should be real happy with
this movie. I did not betray them.''
</P>
<P>
   What about ``The Parent Trap'' strikes such unlikely, deep
chords in people?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically the fantasy of every divorce child, of putting
your parents back together again,'' says Dennis Quaid, who plays
Nick Parker, the father role originated in the first film by Brian
Keith. ``I think all of us who come from divorced families have
that; I still have it, even though my dad's not even around
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a lot of women's favorite movie, too,'' adds Quaid,
who confirms one of those fans is his wife, actress Meg Ryan. ``I
think that's because it was their introduction to romance as
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers debates the perception that the story skews female.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it just empowers girls; it empowers kids,'' she
says. ``My experience is that it isn't just moms who like this
film. I can't tell you the amount of guys on this set _ these guys
with big belts full of tools _ who said `I love ``The Parent
Trap.'' ' I think the element of discovering you have a twin, that
there's another you and you're not alone in the world, is also a
big part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to that one, though, audiences have to accept a view of
divorced families that was questionable in 1961 and seems
unconscionable 37 years later, after the emotional practicalities
of raising children in broken families have become much better
researched and widely experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, what kind of parent just gives up one of their
children for good with, apparently, no second thoughts? And why on
Earth would the abandoned, deceived child want to meet the absent
parent ... or still trust the one who's been hiding this from them
her whole life?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a monster!'' Natasha Richardson says of her ``Trap''
character, the female parental unit Elizabeth James. ``We decided
it was a can of worms you can't open, but I was bothered by it. The
truth is, I cannot justify any mother giving one up,'' adds the
actress, herself the mother of two and the child of an amicable,
custody-sharing divorce between actress Vanessa Redgrave and the
late director Tony Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the most difficult question in the movie is why
they did it _ how could they?'' Meyers acknowledges. ``But if
you're going to make this movie, you've got to buy into that. You
can't change that and make `The Parent Trap,' right?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few weeks, before I fully committed, when I
tossed and turned about it, being a mother,'' adds Meyers, who has
two daughters with Shyer. ``It's not a decision I could make. But
then again, I wrote `Private Benjamin' and I never would've joined
the Army. There are premises in films that are outrageous. I mean,
when was the last time an asteroid hit the planet? It's a fantasy
that turns positive in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they never address why Nick and Elizabeth broke up, Shyer
and Meyers did try to give it some basis with an opening credits
sequence in which the couple meets and impulsively weds on an ocean
liner. They also separated the two halves farther apart physically
_ on the other side of the world rather than just across the
continent _ so they'd be less inclined to initiate contact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it all boils down to a movie concept you either buy or
you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you don't ask those questions while you're watching
the movie,'' Quaid says. ``But you know, the story is told from the
twins' point of view. You never really find out an adult reason why
we split up, and that's the point of view of a child as well.
Anyway, it's intended to be light and airy entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Light entertainment that some love as passionately as others
react to ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I wouldn't want to remake `The Apartment','' says Shyer,
referring to Billy Wilder's sophisticated, Oscar-winning romantic
comedy. ``I'm not stupid; that's great filmmaking. But I didn't
consider it a sacrilege to remake this movie because it wasn't,
like, the greatest film of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a beloved movie, though, so you have to aim high. I'm
real proud of this movie, though; the production values are first
rate, the acting is great. You'd better not be inferior to the
original, or you're in a lot of trouble.'' &QL;

fROM KAVA SODAS TO SNAPPLE SMOOTHIES TO EXTREME SPORTS DRINKS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have one advantage this summer over the heat wave of 1980. We
have a whole new segment of drinks with which to quench our thirst,
from organic sodas to flavored iced coffees to a super-macho sports
drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really identified the alternative beverage audience about
10 years ago,'' says Gary Hemphill, vice president of Beverage
Marketing Corp., a consulting and information group for suppliers
and manufacturers of soft drinks. ``Colas, while still growing as a
category, are losing some share to sports drinks, premium waters,
bottled tea, premium and natural soda, nutraceuticals.''
Nutraceuticals are beverages souped up with herbs or extracts, such
as Saint Johnswort, kava or ginseng.
</P>
<P>
   Demographically, Hemphill sees the market for alternative drinks
as 20- and 30-somethings, generally college-educated with a little
higher-than-average income. They prefer to buy the drinks cold.
Women, particularly, like the ``health halo'' of many of the new
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   David Podeschi, vice president for food for Southland Corp.,
sees the market as broad and growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something for almost everyone in some segment of the
market,'' Podeschi says. ``I would say that women buy the sports
bottles of water. Men like the larger sizes, and they prefer the
wide-mouth bottles. The segment has experienced explosive growth
since 1990 and 1991, and I think it's going to continue to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a toast to the hot cool drinks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Cruz Sparkling Ginger Ale: Certified organic (no
artificial flavor, no preservatives, no caffeine), about $1.19.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's Premium Ginger Brew: Jamaican style (strong) ginger ale,
about $1.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Total Sport: ``Extreme thirst quencher'' fortified with
vitamins A, C, E and ginseng extract and lemon-lime, about $1.39,
supermarkets and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   Cappuccino Coolers: Flavored powders turn cold milk into French
vanilla or hazelnut coolers, about $1.99 in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Kogee Iced Latte: Certified organic, decaffeinated coffee blend,
about $1.39.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Tonics: Herb-infused drinks include a Relaxation Cocktail
with kava and an Energy Elixir with ginseng and guarana,
$1.29-$1.79, General Nutrition Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Whipper Snapple: Fruit smoothies in orange dream, peach mango
and strawberry banana flavors, approximately $1.25 for one, $4.19
for four-packs, supermarkets and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   V8 Splash: Vegetable drink brand branches out to combinations
including strawberry kiwi, about $1 at supermarkets and convenience
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Twister: Tropicana combinations include ruby grapefruit and
tangerine juice, about $1 at supermarkets and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   Mega Mountain Twists: Kool-Aid branches out with
strawberry-flavor lemonade, about $3 supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Light Tropical Passions: The powdered-drink basic
punches up its line with flavors such as watermelon-strawberry,
about $3, supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Country Time Lem'N Berry Sippers: Lemonade gets a shot of
strawberry, about $3, supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Sky's Dr Becker: Organic knockoff of the Texas favorite,
about 39 cents.

FDA WALKS A TIGHTROPE BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, whenever I heard the word ``recall,'' I thought
of cars. My dad would never buy a new model during the first year
of production. He said that they needed time to work the bugs out.
Quite often, he was right. More frequently than we like to
acknowledge, new cars are recalled for things as minor as a gauge
not working properly or as major as the brakes locking up or the
fuel tank exploding on impact.
</P>
<P>
   But now, when I hear the word ``recall,'' I think of the Food
and Drug Administration. It's gotten so bad that some critics have
proposed that the new FDA slogan should be: ``What doesn't kill you
makes you sicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Viagra and its potentially dangerous side effects for heart
patients is just a Popsicle on an iceberg. A recent Associated
Press article on the subject said: ``Almost as many prescription
drugs were yanked off the U.S. market in the past 10 months as were
banned in the entire previous decade. One longtime FDA
pharmacologist told The Associated Press that she just left the
agency in frustration with pressure to skim over safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's just a little different than Mama blowing on your
soup to make sure it's not too hot, isn't it? If Mama doesn't blow
long enough, you burn your tongue, but if the FDA approves a drug
with serious safety concerns, people could die.
</P>
<P>
   Every drug has potential side effects. Many people are allergic
to the widely used antibiotic penicillin, for example. However,
four patients died and eight others required liver transplants
before the painkiller Duract was banned. Granted, the FDA issued a
warning with its approval, but there were many safer competitors on
the market. Was Duract worth approving in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   The blood-pressure drug, Posicor, caused hundreds of problems
and several deaths. The diet medications Fenfluramine and Redux
caused heart damage in many patients. The antihistamine Seldane
interacted negatively with the commonly prescribed antibiotic
erythromycin. It is not clear that any of those drugs was clearly
superior to proven drugs on the market. Each of them was recalled
after thousands of patients had received prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are under a lot of pressure from patients to prescribe
the latest ``wonder drug.'' Pharmaceutical companies target
patients with aggressive advertisements touting the benefits of
their new drugs. Patients ask for drugs by name now, instead of
simply depending on the doctor's recommendations. Being an informed
consumer is good, as long as you have ALL the information.
Obviously, there are some things that those ads aren't telling us.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science is rapidly evolving, and far more people are
being saved than killed by legal drugs. Still, it only takes one
fatality to be statistically significant if you're the one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they shouldn't even use the word ``recall'' for drugs.
After all, how do you return a swallowed pill?

   ``I Know This Much Is True''
</P>
<P>
   By Wally Lamb
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, 897 pages, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   THE AUTHOR: Meet Wally Lamb, a literary cross between John
Grisham and Pat Conroy. He's like Grisham because of his singular
knack for telling a story; like Conroy for his writing talent, the
pithy one-liners sprinkled throughout the book, and a penchant for
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey discovered Lamb some time after he published his
first book, ``She's Come Undone,'' which became a monster
bestseller. ``I Know This Much Is True'' shot to No. 1 on the
bestseller lists soon after Lamb's recent appearance on Oprah's
show. But it didn't stay there long. The book's daunting length is
probably why.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOT: Narrator Dominick Birdsey is the supposedly sane
identical twin. His brother, Thomas, suffers from acute
schizophrenia, which causes him to enter a public library and chop
off one hand in a protest against the looming Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the two never knew their real father; their stepfather
was a raging jerk, and their grandfather was an immigrant from
Sicily with a closet full of skeletons. Dominick, we soon learn, is
not exactly an exemplar of mental health himself. The dramatic
possibilities here are endless.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Lamb insists on exploring all of them _ at
length. By page 600 or so, this gets maddening. We don't need to
know all this stuff. The story sizzles in the beginning, but
reading for the umpteenth time how angry Dominick Birdsey is at the
world gets a little tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just when you want to lay the book down and never again pick
it up, the story regains its momentum. Come to think of it, I had a
hard time putting the book down at all, even during the tedious
times, because Lamb writes so well, and his characters are so well
drawn. They linger continually on the edge of crisis and/or
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   I read the last 150 pages in one sitting, and was rewarded with
a satisfying ending.
</P>
<P>
   IS THERE AN EDITOR IN THE HOUSE? Lamb, even with the oomph of
Oprah, has cost himself readers because of the book's unnecessary
tonnage. ``I Know This Much Is True'' could have lost a third of
its length and none of its considerable power.
</P>
<P>
   But on balance, it's still worthwhile. After 900 pages and three
weeks, I admit to being a little sad upon coming to the last page,
the frustration of the middle pages long forgiven.
</P>

YOU'LL LONG FOR A `NEGOTIATOR' TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson is the most insolent of actors. Even his
softest statements are peppered with the venom of threat, so it
makes all the sense in the world to cast him as a man whose talent,
and whose job, is talking people out of something.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he does in ``The Negotiator.'' And outside of his
work in ``Pulp Fiction,'' it would be hard to imagine a better role
for Jackson. Imagine if Sylvester Stallone, who walked away from
the role, had done it; odds are that a hostage-taker would come out
of the building just to get a clearer idea of what words were
trying to force their way out of Stallone's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when you see the poster for ``The Negotiator,'' with
Jackson and his co-lead, Kevin Spacey, sporting matching bad
hairpieces, you kinda wonder when the star of the movie is going to
show up. Despite their gifts, Jackson and Spacey haven't exactly
lit up the screen like leading men. They are sublime character
actors, but the generic action-movie setting of ``The Negotiator''
is unlikely to earn them a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that ``The Negotiator'' isn't nearly a
good enough movie for either of them. Few actors understand the
weight and power of language as Jackson and Spacey do. (If you
close your eyes, you can actually hear the smirk on Spacey's face.)
The most enjoyable scene in ``The Negotiator'' plays to the actors'
strengths. After Jackson humiliates a befuddled negotiator _ you
can see the guy's eyes spinning like pinwheels _ Spacey expertly
glides into the movie and takes over. Spacey's gleaming confidence
leads him to bask in his own magnificence.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is Danny, the best negotiator on the Chicago police
force, who is so crudely set up as the fall guy in a
police-corruption investigation that you wonder how the cast
managed to keep a straight face while he's booked and indicted.
Faced with the prospect of prison, Danny flips the script and
stages a hostage situation of his own. He barges into police
headquarters and points a gun at the lead investigator on his case
(J.T. Walsh, wasted in the last performance before his untimely
death) and demands that Chris Sabian (Spacey) come in and negotiate
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Danny wants Sabian because Sabian is not a member of his own
precinct; he doesn't trust any of the cops that he works with. If
only ``The Negotiator'' had been made on a smaller scale, so that
real tension could have been generated. Perhaps in a lower-budget
movie, we might have been forced to wonder whether Danny really
were on the take. But ``Armageddon'' has more ambiguity than ``The
Negotiator.'' We know that Danny is too heroic ever to have
considered taking a payoff. (A dawdling opening in which he
outfoxes a sweaty, stubbly kidnapper spells it out for us.) But the
only question in this movie is which of the weaselly co-stars will
be tricked into confessing by the leads, who have such fluency and
command that they seem to be members of a better, smarter race.
</P>
<P>
   Director F. Gary Gray's talent is manufacturing chemistry.
Certainly, no one who has seen ``Friday'' can accuse him of being a
filmmaker _ to his credit, you probably paid more to get in than he
spent making it _ but the performers connected in a likably raw,
lowdown way. And in ``Set It Off,'' the actresses rise above the
shamelessness of the concept; when they fired up a joint on a
rooftop, there is a true warmth and affection that the script never
provides. But in ``The Negotiator,'' Gray seems to be auditioning
to direct the next ``Die Hard'' rip-off. It has the faceless
hackery of a Richard Donner movie and, like those films, it feels
way too long. (At nearly two hours and 20 minutes, it is too long.)
</P>
<P>
   Gray does get in a few good scenes, particularly an early one in
which a bunch of happy, drunken party animals stumble through a
step-dance version of the old Electric Slide. There's also a sense
of resentment of Danny's skill which, in a better movie, might
register as a rationale for setting him up. (Danny may be a decent
man, but he's not humble.) The assemblage of undistinguished stunts
is just boring, and a propensity for this explosion-by-the-yard
stuff may suggest why Warner Bros. has had such a surfeit of
clunkers; the flying shards of glass could be from ``Batman &AMP;
Robin'' or ``Lethal Weapon 4.''

   Jackson and Spacey triumph where they can, but the sad fact is
that a movie of this kind wastes actors who have pride, wit and

ETHNIC CHINESE URGE ACTION IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chinese and Indonesian organizations in the San
Francisco area are urging the U.S. government and the United
Nations to condemn violence against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia,
including the reported gang rapes of women and young girls.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the economic crisis and democracy demonstrations in
Indonesia made world headlines, the upheaval culminating in
hundreds of deaths and the downfall of President Suharto after 33
years in power.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the violence was aimed at Indonesia's 8 million
ethnic Chinese. During weeks of looting, rioting and arson attacks,
hundreds of Chinese women and young girls were gang-raped,
survivors and human rights observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were silent when they looted our businesses and burned our
property,'' said John Oei of San Francisco. ``But we can't stand it
when our sisters have been raped.''
</P>
<P>
   Oei, who works as an insurance broker, helped organize the
Indonesian Chinese American Network (Icanet) earlier this month to
bring attention to the ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Icanet is leading a petition drive urging Congress and the
United Nations to condemn the rights violations. The group also is
calling on the United States to cut off military aid to Indonesia,
an Asian nation of 210 million people, until conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Chinese violence has resonated beyond the estimated
12,000 to 15,000 Indonesian Chinese in the San Francisco area, Oei
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has created a furor among the overseas Chinese all
over,'' said San Francisco attorney Edward Liu, who helped start a
Web site (www.huaren.org) to keep track of developments. ``We're
getting hits from Mauritius, Norway, South America and, of course,
Southeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty Chinese organizations in the San Francisco area are
helping to collect signatures for the petition and the topic has
dominated Chinese newspapers and radio shows, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution last
week, co-sponsored by Supervisors Mabel Teng and Leland Yee, urging
Congress to call for an investigation into the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the worst violence took place over a three-day period
in May, Oei said reports of rapes persist. Chinese continue to live
in fear as the political situation remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relatives live in terror,'' Oei said. ``If they go out in
the street and look Chinese, they could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Indonesia's economy sparked violence, both
against the government and prosperous ethnic Chinese
businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   An Indonesian government agency has said it was investigating
468 reported rapes of ethnic Chinese women after riots erupted in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The National Unity Development Board said it had interviewed
many victims, their families and witnesses. Some victims testified
that they had been raped in front of their parents, said Rosita
Noer, chairwoman of the board. A number had been hospitalized, many
had been traumatized, and at least one later committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has given Indonesia more than $1 billion in
military aid in the last 25 years, according to Ben Terrall, San
Francisco coordinator of the East Timor Action Network, a
human-rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries have shared close trade relations despite
human rights problems in Indonesia, and the Clinton administration
has supported International Monetary Fund efforts to stabilize the
Indonesian economy.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As early as 1985, President Reagan and I, at our first summit,
said that nuclear war can never be won, and must never be fought.
Even then we knew something very important about the
inadmissibility of nuclear war.
 &HT;    Today, it is just as true that if nuclear war, on any scale,
were ever to be unleashed, or were ever to become a reality, it
would threaten the very existence of life on earth.
 &HT;    It is particularly important to keep this in mind, in the wake
of the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. All must condemn those
tests and the dangerous era which they rekindle.
 &HT;    What is not being discussed by the established nuclear powers
today is that the process of nuclear disarmament has been stalled
for several years now; it is just marking time. I believe we have
not been properly using the opportunities that were open since the
end of the Cold War, the possibility to move toward a really new
world order based on stability, democratic cooperation and
equality, rather than on the hegemony of one country.
 &HT;    Instead, the geopolitical games are continuing; we are seeing
those old geopolitical games in places such as Bosnia, and we know
the dangerous potential of such conflicts. During the years of the
Cold War, many of those wars in small places festered for decades
and became worse because the two superpowers and the two military
alliances were self-interestedly fueling the hostilities.
 &HT;    During the years of the arms race, the United States and the
Soviet Union spent $10 trillion each on weapons production. It is
true that the danger of nuclear war has significantly diminished,
but it has not disappeared for good. The so-called conventional
wars and regional wars are still claiming thousands of human lives
and tremendous resources, as well as ravaging nature, the unique
source of life on our planet.
 &HT;    After the Cold War, instead of defense conversion, we are still
seeing the continuation of defense production, of the arms trade
and weapons-export policies. After the breakup of the Soviet Union,
while Russia was immersed in its domestic problems, the United
States captured 70 percent of the world weapons-trade market, while
not doing much for defense conversion.
 &HT;    The result is that Russia now too has decided to step up the
production and transfer of the most sophisticated weapons, and is
pushing in the same direction and trying to capture that market.
 &HT;    Behind this is the underlying assumption of defense and security
planning in most countries: that all the time we should consider
the possibility of war. Thus we see the arms race, weapons
production and also the increasing sophistication of arms,
including very exotic weapons.
 &HT;    And at the same time we see poverty, backwardness and disease in
territories that account for almost two-thirds of the population of
the world. So as we face the 21st century, let us think about what
is happening. It is a trap to perpetuate those systems that existed
during the Cold War _ relaunching the arms race and planning on the
supposition of a resumption of war.
 &HT;    We must say very firmly to the United States and Russia that in
dragging their feet on further nuclear disarmament, they are
setting a bad example for others.
 &HT;    We should also once again raise the issue of missiles,
intermediate- and shorter-range missiles, because those are weapons
of a particularly regional nature. We should do more not just to
limit the nuclear-arms race but even further to move toward the
elimination and abolition of nuclear arms.
 &HT;    Certainly we should bear in mind, in cooperating with
less-developed countries in the area of commercial nuclear power,
that we should always be vigilant that this is not taken further,
and does not stimulate the production of nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    Finally, we should put an end to the myth that nuclear weapons
guarantee peace. Everyone, for example, should understand that
security on the Indian subcontinent has not improved because of
recent developments; it has deteriorated very sharply.
 &HT;    We should do all we can to help Pakistan and India understand
that they're not gaining anything. They're actually losing a lot by
embarking on the nuclear path. In the context of the conflict that
has been festering in that region, this is really an ominous
development. We should work very hard to ensure that India and
Pakistan sign without delay the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
 &HT;    The 20th century has seen more bloodshed and cruelty than the
whole rest of human history and left us a complex and challenging
heritage. The tradition of resolving national and international
problems by force, violence and arms is a political disease of our
epoch. We must do away with it _ which is the great and noble
imperative of our time.

FORMER LAWMAN ADMITS BRIBERY, AGREES TO HELP PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Robert Rodriguez, 32, a former Webb County
deputy sheriff here, pleaded guilty Wednesday to helping a suspect
who was facing cocaine charges bribe a district attorney's
investigator in an effort to keep the accused's record clean.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors cleared the way for Rodriguez to tell a
grand jury all he knows about alleged criminal activity at the Webb
County DA's office.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, outlined in a hearing before U.S. District Judge
George Kazen, follows recent guilty pleas by a former state
district judge who bribed DA officials to fix the outcome of drug
cases and a sheriff's department employee who sold crime
information illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors could recommend leniency in sentencing the
defendants, depending on how well they cooperate with a federal
probe of the district attorney's office and the Webb County
sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dead serious about pursuing this investigation as
expeditiously as we can,'' James DeAtley, U.S. attorney for the
southern district of Texas, said after attending Wednesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to say where his investigation was headed other
than to focus on corruption among law enforcement officials in this
border city.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, accompanied by Laredo attorney Jeff Czar, stood
quietly before Kazen as the judge explained that Rodriguez faced up
to 20 years in prison and a $150,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is reserving the right to say whether you have
cooperated or not,'' Kazen told Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a done deal _ the government is leaving the door open
for you to cooperate,'' Kazen continued.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea bargain, Rodriguez could get as little as
probation if he fully cooperates with federal investigators. He is
to give them any documents or other information he has that would
further their probe.
</P>
<P>
   If he lies or withholds information, he faces a longer prison
sentence and perjury charges, the judge warned.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who was a deputy sheriff from August 1985 to January
1997 when he was fired, was a go-between for a defendant arrested
in 1996 by Laredo police for possession of cocaine, according to
court documents.
</P>
<P>
   He had conversations on the phone and in county offices during
which he crafted a deal that involved paying $2,000 to the district
attorney's office investigator to shape the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the defendant and the investigator have not
been made public.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a promissory note for $2,500 was signed as part of
a bribe that would give the defendant six months' probation instead
of two years' probation and would keep the cocaine possession
charge from being recorded against him, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told the judge he was unemployed after being fired
from the Sheriff's Department in 1997.

   The choreographer Jerome Robbins has died. We will move a 3,500

</P>
<P>
   OBIT-ROBBINS (New York) _ Jerome Robbins, who simultaneously
became one of 20th-century ballet's greatest choreographers and a
towering innovator in Broadway musicals, died Wednesday at his home
in Manhattan. He was 79. Robbins joined the City Ballet in 1948 and
helped shape the company's creative profile with daring and brio
for half a century through his often startling, always experimental
choreography in ballet's classical idiom. At the same time, he
enjoyed phenomenal success on Broadway. From 1944 to 1964, Robbins'
golden touch was evident in musicals as disparate as ``On the
Town,'' ``The King and I,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``West Side Story'' and
``Fiddler on the Roof.'' By Anna Kisselgoff.

   Harvard Common Press is starting to make quite a name for itself
in the cookbook world. First, the little press published the hefty
barbecue trilogy written by Bob and Cheryl Alters Jamison. Harvard
also published the couple's award-winning ``The Border Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the publisher has produced ``The Joy of Pickling,'' by Linda
Ziedrich ($14.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book is an intense look at pickles from the sweet to the
half-sour to the dilled guys we all know and love. There are fresh
pickles, fermented pickles, pickled cabbage, quick pickles, freezer
pickles as well as chutney, salsa and other relishes. It's a big
ole brining party.
</P>
<P>
   Ziedrich takes the fear out of the processing, and for those who
don't want to process with boiling water, there are lots of
alternatives. Making pickles does not have to mean buying lots of
special equipment you'll only use once, and Zeidrich tells you how.
Following are two alternate ways to put up pickles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIME-MINT FREEZER PICKLE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4 pints
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds of pickling cucumbers
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pickling salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sliced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 small red bell pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Gently wash cucumbers and slice them thin, discarding a slice
from both ends of each cucumber. You should have about 8 cups. In
large bowl, toss cucumber slices with salt. Let cucumbers stand for
2 to 3 hours, then drain them.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl, stir together remaining ingredients. Pour
mixture over cucumbers and stir well. Refrigerate mixture for 8-10
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pack cucumbers and syrup in freezer bags or rigid containers and
freeze the containers.
</P>
<P>
   Thaw pickles for about 8 hours in refrigerator before serving.

   Nutritional analysis per 1/4 cup: 18 calories, trace fat, 5
grams carbohydrates, trace protein, 0 cholesterol, 184 milligrams
sodium, 2 percent of calories from fat.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   POLISH PICKLED MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1 pint
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, wiped clean with a damp cloth
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons black peppercorns

   In nonreactive saucepan, bring all ingredients to a boil. Reduce
heat and simmer 15 minutes. Place mushrooms and their liquid in a
pint jar. Let the jar cool.
</P>
<P>
   Cap the jar. Store it in the refrigerator for several days
before eating the mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerated, the mushrooms will keep for about 3 weeks.

DEMYSTIFYING ALL THAT MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, when America was awakening to its puppy love
for personal computers, there was much talk about how digitized
data would start to replace books. Anyone remember the paperless
office?
</P>
<P>
   Much like the shelves overstocked with software in computer
stores, shelf space in stores, offices and homes is increasingly
being crammed with books _ old-fashioned paper books _ about
computers and all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   Some publishers today say that encyclopedias and other reference
books on CD-ROM are starting to spell doom for their printed
predecessors. But over all, the proliferation of computers in the
last decade has instead spelled boom for the publishers of books
that explain, support and demystify computers and all that they do.
</P>
<P>
   With the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98 operating system only two
months old, stores already offer scores of books _ ``Windows 98 for
Dummies,'' ``Learn Windows 98 in a Weekend,'' ``The Windows 98
Bible'' _ that promise to guide users through the program's
installation and use. More are on the way, publishers say.
</P>
<P>
   In total, 3,000 computer books were released last year,
according to industry statistics. And while some come bearing
companion CD-ROMs to run on multimedia computers, most of these
books are so low-tech that Gutenberg wouldn't have had trouble
using them.
</P>
<P>
   And these books are not just dry users' manuals from
manufacturers. IDG Books Worldwide, publisher of the ``For
Dummies'' series for general users (``DOS for Dummies,''
``Upgrading and Fixing PC's for Dummies'' and more than 300 other
computer-related titles) has sold more than 50 million books,
translated into 38 languages.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, computer book publishers recorded a 40
percent increase in sales, said Peter Breen, managing editor of
Computer Publishing &AMP; Advertising Report, a biweekly newsletter
that tracks the computer book industry. In the same period, he
said, overall book sales grew by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mirroring the growth of the computer industry, the computer
book business saw a big boom in the early and mid-80s and then
trailed off for the rest of the decade,'' Breen said. ``It started
picking up in the early 1990s and has grown ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   So many publishers are rushing so many computer books to market
that one company, Wiley Computer Publishing, decided that it would
focus its books on more experienced computer users, at intermediate
and expert levels. For years, Wiley has been cranking out titles
like the popular ``Data Warehouse Toolkit'' and its forthcoming
follow-up, ``The Data Warehouse: Lifecycle Toolkit.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies like IDG, Jamsa Press and Macmillan Computer
Publishing U.S.A., the world's largest producer of computer books,
also publish some titles for those more knowledgeable users.
</P>
<P>
   But any brief inspection of a book section of a computer store
indicates that many books, most of them costing between $19.95 and
$49.99, are aimed at the broad lower middle tier of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Even with rising sales, the computer publishing world has its
own particular problems. One is the difficulty of getting computer
books reviewed. Another, Breen said, is that computer books seldom
sell fast. They tend to build a following slowly, often by
word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   And because computer books are tied to the rapid changes in
computer software and hardware they try to explain, they are more
subject to revisions or to simply disappearing in a matter of
months. Player guides for popular computer games are particularly
vulnerable to the extremely short life span of computer games. Once
a game ends up in the discount bin, so does the book about it.
</P>
<P>
   The three computer books reviewed here are each different and
reflect deepening trends in the computer publishing marketplace.
All three are self-help guides.
</P>
<P>
   One is aimed at general computer users who simply want to know
how their computers work, another is a primer for users of
Macintosh computers, and the third is a strategy guide to help
players get the most from a popular new computer game. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOW COMPUTERS WORK, THIRD EDITION, WITH INTERACTIVE CD-ROM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Ron White (Que, $39.99). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many computer users, the notion of probing beneath the
covers of these expensive machines and noodling with their innards
is not appealing. Even if someone works up the nerve to look around
in there or dares to make some useful upgrades, poking around
motherboards and expansion cards will probably feel like a perilous
walk in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   But if knowledge is the light of the world, then the contents of
the 292-page book ``How Computers Work,'' which comes with a
complementary CD-ROM, will certainly illuminate much about the
inner workings of today's home and business computers _ without
requiring the user to look under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike instruction manuals that often come with computers and
are either so laden with jargon or so simplified that they read
like maps without street names, this large, well-illustrated book
strikes a good balance between the needs of the beginner and those
of the more experienced user.
</P>
<P>
   Its author, Ron White, a senior editor at PC Computing magazine
and founder of one of the first PC online user groups, is an old
hand at these kinds of books. A patient teacher, he writes in a
clear and well-informed voice that says, ``You, too, can understand
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening of chapter six, ``How Windows Uses Memory,'' for
example, White writes, ``Memory is the staging area for the
processor, the place where the processor receives the instructions
and data it needs to do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, this book, while conveying some information that is
universal to practically all computers, is more or less aimed at
explaining the ins and outs of Windows-based PCs with Intel chips,
commonly known as Wintel computers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention, for example, of Macintosh computers.
Windows 95 and Windows NT figure prominently in the book's
explanations of software, and Intel's Pentium Pro chip gets its own
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the book covers some of the most common computer
peripherals, like printers, scanners, joysticks and even digital
cameras. And ``How Computers Work'' delves into the unseen world of
what is actually going on inside, say, a transistor, the building
blocks of computer chips _ the kind of exploration that is a must
for any computer book worth a tree's life and limbs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Interested in the interplay of electrons on P-type silicon?
White tries to make it seem oh so simple _ most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The generous use of large, colorful illustrations practically
turns ``How Computers Work'' into a picture book. And the CD-ROM
that comes tucked in a pocket inside the back cover is an
imaginative interactive guide into the hardware of multimedia
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Through sound and animation, the CD-ROM offers a 3-D vision,
rather than the book's X-ray vision, of how computers work _ for
example, what happens when a floppy disk is formatted.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of this book-and-CD-ROM combination, the computer
might have a tough time holding on to the mystery of its inner
workings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRIMA'S OFFICIAL STRATEGY GUIDE: UNREAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Joe Grant Bell (Prima Publishing, $19.99). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever played even a mildly engaging computer game,
especially multimedia, 3-D challenges like Quake 2, Mech Warrior 2
and Warcraft II, knows that it takes only a few minutes to learn
how to play but dozens of hours to learn to play well.
</P>
<P>
   Who has the time? It didn't take hard-core game players long to
realize that they could considerably shorten their learning curves
by trading tips and secrets about popular computer games.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't take the publishing world long to realize that
there was a growing need among the millions of computer game
players for well-written, easy-to-follow help in navigating the
spooky digital domains of, say, Myst, or the temples of Tomb Robber
II.
</P>
<P>
   Prima Publishing, among others, took up the challenge, and the
result is a long line of official as well as unauthorized guides to
computer games. Joe Grant Bell's guide to Unreal, an intense,
fight-your-way-through-a-hostile-alien-world game, is one of the
latest.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the Prima guides, the book has numerous but rudimentary
illustrations in black and white. But what makes the books such hot
sellers (Prima's ``Myst: The Official Strategy Guide'' sold more
than a million copies) is the apparent depth of knowledge they
impart about the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unreal'' is broadly organized into four sections: first, the
many weapons and devices, like flak canons and antitoxin suits, and
the myriad capabilities a player must know about them.
</P>
<P>
   Next there is a detailed discussion, bordering on the
anthropological, about various enemies a player is likely to
encounter. What constitutes the bulk of this 193-page guide is a
step-by-step tutorial in how to survive and win in the game's
creepy labyrinths of terror and sudden game-ending mayhem. That
includes a section on advanced combat techniques like circular
strafing, which is the constant circling of a target while firing,
inflicting maximum damage while making it difficult to get hit by
enemy fire. The last section is for players who wish to enter the
game's multiplayer matches on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the guide, Bell effectively maintains an air of
authenticity about the elements of the Unreal environment. Whole
passages never hint that all the firepower specs and tactics
concern a world that is only a game, a game that exists only on the
shiny surface of a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bell writes about the flak cannon that it ``fires
high-velocity metal shards that rip a hole in your enemy in seconds
flat. It isn't the prettiest weapon, but it makes up for its lack
of beauty with raw power.'' Or consider his advice about fighting
on the go: ``Never stop. Even the weakest alien in the galaxy is
capable of hitting you if you stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing the aliens can't read Prima's guides. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LITTLE MAC BOOK, FIFTH EDITION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Robin Williams (Peachpit Press, $19.95). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THIS is a book for beginners that, in many editions over the
years, has become a classic among users of Apple Macintosh
computers. More than 350,000 copies of the book are in print in
eight languages.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Little Mac Book'' was first published, in 1990, it
actually was a little book. Reflecting the growing complexity of
Macs and their uses, Robin Williams' fifth edition of her book is a
softcover tome of 369 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, who has written more than a dozen best-selling
computer books, says in this book's opening pages that all the
extra words were unavoidable. She writes that while the Mac is
still the easiest computer on the planet to use, ``it is a fact
that there are some things that are now a little more confusing to
use than they used to be.'' Progress obviously has its price.
</P>
<P>
   But much of ``The Little Mac Book'' stays close to the basics.
In a friendly, downright chatty tone, Ms. Williams guides Mac users
through some of the most fundamental functions, like opening files
and using the keyboard's numeric pad.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a section on ``important keys'' on the keyboard,
like the asterisk (readers are told that the word is Greek and
means ``little star''). Helpful additions to this book include a
light discussion of Macintosh's OS 8 operating system and three new
chapters on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is little trace of geekspeak jargon. Chapter 14 is titled
``Word Processing (also known as `typing').'' Ms. Williams is
apparently much less concerned about telling her readers how
something works and more intent on explaining to them how to get
something to work. She also carries the Mac banner high and more
than occasionally takes all-in-fun shots at PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe the World Wide Web would not have
happened if the Macintosh computer had not been invented,'' she
writes deep into the book. She says the Mac's pioneering use of
graphics, sound and animation helped open minds to what could be
possible on a vast network of computers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Microsoft Corp., she writes that it ``copied'' (the
words ``ripped off'' are crossed out in the text) Macintosh
technology, so that PCs now ``clumsily'' mimic Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Further reflecting the Mac's ethos, ``The Little Mac Book'' is
peppered with clear and clever black-and-white illustrations and is
easy to follow. To make sure readers are getting it, Ms. Williams,
a former teacher, placed quizzes at the ends of chapters.
</P>
<P>
   There are also helpful sections near the end of the book _ one
is titled ``Aaack!! HELP!'' _ crammed with tips and
trouble-shooting solutions.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a page of handy Web sites like www.amazon.com and
www.apple.com. Hmmmm. ... looks as if www.microsoft.com didn't make
the cut.

INTERNET-FLUENT MIT STUDENTS TEACH BASICS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Dwyer, a sophomore at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, knew that spending last summer hooking up a high school
in Beijing to its first Internet connection was not going to be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest obstacle was not tussling with the Chinese
bureaucracy or outmaneuvering government restrictions on Internet
access. It was the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to call the high school's computer director at
home one evening, ``the person who answered the phone said, `You'll
have to call right back,' '' Dwyer said. ``It was one phone line
that was shared by two families living in adjacent apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the wonders of the Internet with the rest of the world
is a noble pursuit, but bringing thousands of dollars' worth of
equipment and all that cutting-edge knowledge to a country where
phones are still party lines, computers are scarce and few have
even heard of the World Wide Web might seem laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Not to the students who volunteer for the China Educational
Technology Initiative, an MIT program that sends college students
overseas to teach high school students about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, two graduate students, Jake Seid and Ron Cao, not
only persuaded MIT to let them go, basically unsupervised, to set
up the first Web site at a high school in China, they later
persuaded the school to talk big-name companies into sponsoring
them. Last summer, the program sent 13 students.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 24 new interns have traveled to 9 high schools.
They go in teams of two or three, including at least one student
who speaks either Cantonese or Mandarin and at least one who speaks
the more exotic languages of Java and HTML. Together they set up a
server and teach the students to create Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Seid and Cao (pronounced Sow) came up with the idea as an
alternative to the typical graduate-student project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it important that two MIT students write a report on
telecommunications that nobody is going to read?'' said Seid
(pronounced Sayd). ``It really made us think, what do we want to
accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   And where? News articles they read in 1996 described China as
extremely cautious in its exploration of the Internet. Those who
did have Internet accounts had to register with the police, and
those who applied for accounts had to sign an agreement to abide by
Chinese law and not endanger state security.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT students soon learned, however, that they could set up
sites on the Chinese Educational Research Network, which connects
all the universities.
</P>
<P>
   True, some schools are hesitant to encourage access to sites
outside China, not because of censorship but because most are
charged for every such site they call up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago there were a lot of questions about who should
be hooked up to the Internet,'' Seid said. ``I think they took a
chance on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the student-built Web sites are written in both English
and Chinese. The Fudan High School site has pictures of the school,
names of award-winning students, even a photo of Cao Tianren, the
headmaster. Another school's site offers a practice test for the
college entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just connecting the wires or getting a computer
into the school,'' said Robert Yung, Sun Microsystems' director for
technology in Asia and a project mentor. ``This is about how do we
teach, how do we show people how to use the technology?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sun Microsystems and other companies have donated more
than $250,000 worth of hardware and software. Each team has to
figure out a strategy for its project, from getting the hardware
shipped to figuring out how to teach Java programming to 40 ninth
graders in six weeks, a commitment that impressed Yung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at their energy level,'' he said. ``It was finals
week at MIT this week, and I still get e-mail from them at 3 in the
morning. I look at them and say, `Why don't I take care of this
problem? You go and study.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The months leading up to the trip are filled with incessant
e-mails, faxes and phone calls. (The translators have the worst of
it, they agree, because they have to deal with the 12-hour time
difference.) Another first _ setting up a wireless Internet
connection to a Chinese high school _ required days of back and
forth.
</P>
<P>
   The five-floor high school building did not have telephone
wires, so the volunteers used antennae to connect it to a
university, and its dedicated line, about a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never even saw the buildings _ it was all through e-mail,''
said Roger Hu, who went to Shanghai as a freshman. ``We needed to
see what buildings were in the way, if they would interfere with
the line of sight. They would go up and on the roof and say, `Oh,
yeah, I can see the building from there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The MIT students' Chinese hosts were eager to help. Some of the
schools updated their computers or bought new ones. So many people
were interested in their progress that last summer the American
students held a conference about the Web in education that drew
corporate chief executives, school principals and Chinese
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The China Education Technology Initiative inspired another MIT
student, Ameet Ranadive, to start a similar program in India last
year. The population there is approaching one billion, but only
100,000 have Internet access. Ranadive, who will be a graduate
student in the fall, said he planned to have the Indian students
start pen-pal relationships with the Chinese students using e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start with small steps like that, at least it's
promoting connections with the two sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The interns have their share of concerns about nuclear testing
in India, human rights violations in China and civil war in Africa,
where yet another MIT student is looking to start a similar
program. But they manage to keep their corner of cyberspace
apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I heard about China was all very negative things,'' Seid
said. ``You'd hear about issues like Taiwan, you hear about the
Dalai Lama and Tibet, you hear about Tiananmen. Then you hear about
the people. It's a very different perspective than what you hear
about the government.''

   NEW YORK _ You don't need a separate room for meditation,''
designer Diane Von Furstenberg said. ``I meditate every morning in
my bed for a half- hour before I get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she moved her showroom and offices to an enormous
carriage house in Greenwich Village last year, she created a yoga
room. She painted it sea green (``for serenity and calm'') and
installed a regal-looking nomadic-style tent. It's made of
banana-fiber panels, edged with antique ribbons from India. With
each current of air, the panels waft gently like sheets hanging on
a clothesline in summer. The effect is calming, and so is the sound
of trickling water in the mosaic-tile pool below.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the Chinese, moving water brings good luck and
serenity,'' Ms. Von Furstenberg said. Of course, money often brings
serenity, too, and she is one of many people of means who have
devoted a room to pursue it through meditation.
</P>
<P>
   The serene Madonna has a yoga room in her Miami home. Donna
Karan has a rock garden in East Hampton, N.Y. Her husband, Stephan
Weiss, a sculptor, has installed a Balinese teak temple on the
terrace of his studio in Greenwich Village. Around the corner,
Deneen and Raymond King own an indoor pool, which they say has a
meditative effect on their lives, while in Bedford, N.Y., John
Fowle and Gina Sharpe have converted the dining room and guest
cottage of a house once owned by Giancarlo Menotti into Buddhist
meditation spaces. Although they find that having a room with an
altar is helpful, the discipline of stilling the mind through
meditation remains a challenge. After all, they're both former
lawyers. ``Once a lawyer, always a lawyer,'' Fowle said.

<P>
   In 1959, when Mircea Eliade wrote in ``The Sacred and the
Profane'' that ``cosmic symbolism is found in the very structure of
the habitation,'' popular awareness of the ceremonial use of space
in the home was limited largely to Christmas trees and Sabbath
candles.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in House &AMP; Garden last winter showed that more than 80
percent of respondents believed that having a quiet place in the
home for meditation is a necessity. For many of these people, such
spaces are more about esthetics and therapy than about faith;
others take their spiritual pursuits seriously. But most mix and
match their disciplines to taste.
</P>
<P>
   In West Hollywood, for instance, Rick Rubin, a founder of Def
Jam records, once the powerhouse of rap music, and president of
Sony's American Recordings, uses a room he designed specially in an
old mansion for transcendental meditation, yoga, tai chi and other
practices. The room has air purifiers, sheepskin yoga mats and a
stained-glass Buddha etched in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And that's nothing compared with the much-publicized yoga house
that Lynda Guber built behind her Bel Air mansion. A ``working
spiritual environment,'' she calls it, where the Dalai Lama once
spoke. It has a kitchen for boiling greens, sofas that can
accommodate people sitting in the lotus position and a guest room
for enlightened visitors. It's a far cry from meditating in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In India, holiness is still associated with poverty and
homelessness,'' said Brad Gooch, who was there in the spring to
research ``Travels in Spiritual America,''a book scheduled for next
year. ``So the interface in the United States between yoga,
spirituality and upscale design seems a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed that the spiritual would require so much
of the material?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can meditate everywhere because this whole house is about
ritual,'' said Hedy Klineman, an artist who practices an amalgam of
Eastern ritual. She has a meditation room in a spectacular Fifth
Avenue triplex, which she and her husband, a venture capitalist,
renovated then filled with shrines, Buddhas, Krishnas, Shivas and
prayer tables. ``I call it my home in the sky. In a sense, it's a
temple.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the Park Avenue apartment of Alice Harris, who is not a
practicing Buddhist. ``My apartment is so Zen that when people
first see it, they plotz,'' she said. Ms. Harris, author of ``The
White T'' (HarperCollins, 1997), and her husband, Stanley Harris, a
magazine publisher, enlisted the decorator Robert Metzger to give
their home a theatrical Zen makeover. The yoga room floor is
covered with black sisal, and there's an 18th-century Japanese
screen of Buddhist tranquillity gods. Over the kitchen table, a
wooden sculpture of Daikoku, the Japanese kitchen god, presides
near a bowl of oranges on a marble counter lighted with a pin spot.
It's very Shinto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make pot roast and chicken soup in here,'' Ms. Harris said,
adding that she hired a ``feng shui guy'' to help her find out
where the spirits were moving in her home, but she warned him that
she wouldn't move any furniture because she just finished
redecorating. ``All that over-the-top spirituality stuff makes me
nauseous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marian McEvoy, the editor in chief of Elle Decor feels the same
way, especially when she's asked to remove her shoes before setting
foot in someone's Zen palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, your shoes are part of your outfit,'' she said.
``And if you ask me to mess up my outfit by taking them off, that
isn't a spiritual experience. It's torture. If I'm going to be a
pleasant and chatty guest in your home, don't expect me to ruin my
stockings on your floor. If we're in Japan, that's another story.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. McEvoy doesn't think you need a Zen overhaul to
establish a serene space for reflection in your home. ``Just clean
out your bedroom,'' she suggested. ``Get rid of some of those books
and the clutter and light some candles. That should calm you way
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who don't have the resources to devote a whole room
to meditation, can transcend their earthly concerns as successfully
as the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a million dollars to have a space,'' said
Gurmukh, a kundalini yoga teacher in Los Angeles, who has
instructed David Duchovny, Madonna, Tim Burton and Courtney Love,
among others. ``You just need a place to return to, to remember who
you are on a daily basis. A home is a spiritual metaphor for the
self. Anyplace in it can be sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hindu tradition requires that every home, no matter how
humble, has a place for the family to pray, meditate and make
offerings of food. ``Many Americans find having this kind of sacred
space meaningful,'' said Dvendra Patel, a Hindu scholar who teaches
at the Swaminarayan Temple in Edison, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good. But what we believe is that after you pray, you
still have to be humble in life and you still have to control the
senses.'' Still, he takes no offense at the way some less than
humble Americans are mixing rituals to taste. ``If it's good for
people, they should do what they like.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Books have been published about creating sacred spaces in the
home, including ``Altars Made Easy'' (HarperCollins, 1997) by Peg
Streep. It details how a physical place can be set up in the home
where ``the divine or supernatural can be glimpsed or experienced,
where we can get in touch with that which is larger than
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Sarasohn, a vice president of the Corcoran Group real
estate company, said altars are the next big thing. Her company
will soon install a custom-made glass altar of prosperity in its
office above Barneys, and Corcoran may also put altars in empty
properties to make them more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our clients are concerned with the spiritual
atmosphere of our properties,'' said Ms. Sarasohn, who has brought
channelers in to inspect homes for clients. ``We think working with
altars may also create good publicity for our firm.''
</P>
<P>
   On a late-spring Sunday, when the faithful were gathered at
traditional altars in churches all over town, a single woman was at
home installing a love altar in a corner of her studio apartment on
West 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something mindful with the space,'' she said
about the top two shelves of her built-in bookcase. For help, she
hired Yoanna Da Vinci, an ``interior design and well-being
consultant.'' Ms. Da Vinci designed the Corcoran Group's altar and
has made others for clients like Barbara Biziou, a writer in
Greenwich Village. She helps clients customize their altars for
multicultural rituals as varied as the choices in a food court. If
something's lacking in your life _ job, health, fertility _ it's
likely that Ms. Da Vinci has the right altar for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep in mind how spiritual you are,'' said Ms. Da Vinci, who
would like to supply hip hotels with altars, too. ``If you're a
Wall Street lawyer, you may want to install only a prosperity
altar. If you're more religious, I can teach you a mantra to go
with the altar.''
</P>
<P>
   After a first consultation with her client ($125 an hour), Ms.
Da Vinci returned with a few items: some CD's and red fabrics from
India to drape over the furniture for romantic ambiance. She also
brought complimentary red candles and pink roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to feng shui, this is my love and relationship
corner,'' said her client, who did not want to be named lest she
appear to be running a personals ad. In what she calls her
``helpful people'' corner to the north, she had created a shrine of
sorts, with framed photographs of friends, a Nativity plate and a
statue of Lakshmi, the Hindu fortune goddess. Next to that was her
``career'' corner, which, oddly enough, housed her bed. ``It's the
only space where it fits,'' said the woman, a former television
producer, who is now a freelance magazine writer. ``What can you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   After leading a Hindu prayer asking for wisdom, then salting the
shelves (a Chinese tradition), Ms. Da Vinci supervised as her
client arranged her love altar with the care of a child decorating
a dollhouse.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper shelf, she placed things that she said were
symbolic of the higher self: the two of cups tarot love card, a
mandala, a book of Mediterranean love poems, a tiny cherub, some
hard candies wrapped in red and an old wristwatch, so that love
would arrive in a timely manner. On the shelf below, she placed
objects from a more material plane.
</P>
<P>
   These included photocopies of $100 bills, so that money would
not be an issue in her relationship; a book called ``Unleashing the
Sex Goddess in Every Woman'' by Olivia St. Clair (Harmony Books);
her passport and Berlitz dictionaries, so that Prince Charming
would be a worldly guy. She also placed opera glasses on the altar.
``I want my lover to be comfortable in dressy situations,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Da Vinci asked the woman to stick her ring finger on a
red ink pad and make an imprint on the back of her bookshelf, she
demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too pushy,'' she told Ms. Da Vinci. ``I'm not a ring
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' said Ms. Da Vinci, who invented the rite herself. ``It's
a ritual that's more popular on the Upper East Side. I guess
they're more ring-oriented over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for a closing ceremony. Ms. Da Vinci (who would
return four more times to make sure the altar was properly tended)
had her client walk barefoot on a long red sari as if she were a
bride marching down the aisle. Then she directed her to sit on the
floor and meditate on her ideal. To aid the process, she played a
CD of songs adapted by Ravi Shankar from the Kama Sutra, the Indian
manual of love. A trembling voice soared into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fill this empty pot with the nectar of love,'' it sang.
</P>
<P>
   There was something wistful about a ritual offering the client
solace but no real solution for what was missing from her life, but
she seemed uplifted when it was over. With a hopeful expression on
her face, she opened her eyes and looked out her window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's raining,'' she said. ``I think that's a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   In life, so many things are. But sometimes it takes a sacred
nudge to see them.

<P>
   ``Hi-fi'' from tiny, inexpensive multimedia speakers plugged
into your computer? Don't count on it _ unless you are willing to
stretch the term hi-fi beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Computer sound cards packed with cheap parts and low-grade
digital-to-analog converters are not designed for quality music
reproduction. The computer environment, awash in sound-polluting
radio frequencies and electromagnetic radiation, doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   That said, adding a sound system to your computer can enhance
your computing pleasure, whether you're playing games, exploring
the Internet or listening to music as you work.
</P>
<P>
   Most multimedia systems consist of a powered bass unit (woofer)
and a pair of compact speakers (satellites), which handle from the
upper midbass range to the highest frequencies. Getting a seamless
sonic blend between the satellites and woofer is the key to getting
a big, satisfying sound.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs I used to test some of these systems included Olu Dara's
``In the World'' (Atlantic), a new 20-bit remastering of ``Sinatra
at the Sands'' (Reprise) and ``The Fantasy Film World of Bernard
Herrmann'' (Mobile Fidelity). If a system can do justice to complex
music, it should have no trouble with video games.
</P>
<P>
   Though it doesn't include a separate woofer, the $219 Bose
Mediamate system (www.bose.com) offers surprisingly fine midbass
performance from one tiny 2{-inch full-range speaker in each
cabinet. But there is little below about 80 hertz, so you cannot
really feel the bass.
</P>
<P>
   The Mediamate's overall balance is smooth and appealing, though
on the soft side, with a noticeable lack of high-frequency detail,
despite a cannily placed upper-midrange emphasis that greatly
increases clarity and listening pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The system plays impressively loud without distortion, but the
louder you play it, the more it accentuates the midbass bump that
imparts a chesty quality to things like male voices and violas.
Imaging (the ability of a speaker system to focus, producing a
sonic picture of Frank Sinatra on the Sands' stage, for example) is
satisfactory, though somewhat enlarged directly between the
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mediamate is impressive, given its size and
portability, pass on it unless you absolutely have no room for a
woofer.
</P>
<P>
   While today's Altec Lansing (www.altecmm.com) has nothing to do
with the company that made movie-theater sound systems during
Hollywood's golden age, the new owners have done the name proud
with the ASC48 Powercube Plus Multimedia Speaker System.
</P>
<P>
   It includes two plastic molded satellites, each 3{ by 5 inches,
with a 3-inch full-range driver, a }-inch tweeter and a 6-inch
woofer in a compact, 14-by-12-by-8-inch wooden cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The Powercube Plus offers a reasonably smooth, extended
top-to-bottom frequency response with moderately deep, though
somewhat thumpy, lows and detailed highs. The tweeter can sound
brash, but careful placement helps.
</P>
<P>
   The Powercube's sound is surprisingly big and well focused, but
it gives instruments like brass and the human voice a harder than
natural edge. An asking price of $300 would be reasonable, but an
Altec Lansing spokesman said the street price for the Powercube
Plus was around $149, making it an even better value.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kloss, a veteran speaker designer, now creates products
for Cambridge Soundworks (www.hifi.com), a mail-order company,
including the top-of-the-line Microworks multimedia speaker, which
consists of two small, heavy cubes, about 4 inches on a side, and a
6{-inch woofer in a 16-by-8-by-9-inch box.
</P>
<P>
   The Microworks system provides the deepest, tightest bass of any
system in this survey. Although it overemphasizes the
upper-midrange frequencies somewhat, it is the best-balanced, most
dynamic-sounding system of the lot. The Microworks system plays
extremely loud without strain. At $249.99, it offers the
high-frequency clarity, focus and separation usually associated
with far more expensive systems. Effective woofer and satellite
integration creates the illusion of a much bigger system.
</P>
<P>
   The Bose Acoustimass Multimedia system and the exotic Eminent
Technology LFT-11, which each cost $599, are the most expensive
systems surveyed here. The 3-inch satellite cubes of the
Acoustimass are the smallest of the speakers reviewed, so easiest
to place.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But getting a satisfactory blend with the compact woofer unit
(18{ by 8{ by 7{ inches) is difficult because inexplicably, the
Acoustimass system does not offer a bass-level control, something
offered by both the Altec and Soundworks systems, which are less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Acoustimass system sounds somewhat thin, especially compared
with Microworks. The 5\-inch woofer's bass response is not as
extended as that of the Microworks system, which is less than half
the price. The small satellites offer good overall clarity, and the
system can play reasonably loud, but it sounds strained when
pushed, at a volume where Microworks is still coasting. It is hard
to justify the Acoustimass' high price.
</P>
<P>
   The boxless Eminent Technology LFT-11 (www.eminent-tech.com)
planar magnetic speakers use flat voice elements etched upon small
sheets of mylar instead of conventional coils and paper cones. The
sheets are stretched and sandwiched between opposing magnets that
are held in place under great force.
</P>
<P>
   The units are dipolar, which means that they produce sound both
in front and behind equally. Less than one inch thick, each Eminent
Technology driver unit is slightly smaller than the 6\-by-9-inch
solid oak panel in which it is set. The disadvantage of such
technology is that the speakers must be aimed at you just so or you
will hear no high frequencies at all.
</P>
<P>
   Eminent Technology's 10-by-15-by-8-inch woofer box, containing
two high-quality 6{-inch drivers and finished in oak veneer and
acrylic, is extremely heavy and well braced.
</P>
<P>
   Both its construction and its nuanced sound put it in a
different league from the other woofers, though it lacks the punch
of the self-powered Microworks unit. Getting a blend is not easy,
but once that is accomplished, you will know you're listening to
something special: a piece of genuine high-end audio.
</P>
<P>
   The LFT-11 system is available unpowered (without an amplifier)
for $499. Add $100 and you get a small Radio Shack Optimus
amplifier, which fits into an attractive oak stand for your
monitor. Of all the systems surveyed, the LFT-11 offers the most
credible, most convincing and least distorted sensation of a
three-dimensional musical performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Eminent Technology system creates a big, rich, creamy
picture you will gladly put your face into _ as if it were the
breeze from an air-conditioner on a hot day. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting Up &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer listening takes the room out of the acoustics: you're
sitting closer to the speakers than with a normal hi-fi. The result
can be almost holographic sonic imaging if you place the speakers,
also called satellites, equidistant from you and spread them a few
feet apart for a bigger ``sound stage'' and better separation.
</P>
<P>
   Play a good recording like ``Sinatra at the Sands'' and begin
listening with the satellites pointed straight ahead. Vary the
angle at which they face you. One position will create the best
balance of frequency response, image focus and sound stage size,
depending on your tastes and the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bass reinforcement is tricky. Depending upon where you place
your woofer, you will either get plenty of good bass, boomy bass or
very little of either.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of us have but one option _ under the desk _
but even there, moving the woofer closer or farther away from the
wall can have a big effect. Once the woofer is positioned, blend
its output with the satellites to achieve a seamless sonic
transition.

JEROME ROBBINS, 79, FAMED BALLET CHOREOGRAPHER AND BROADWAY
LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: also seen an abridged version, OBIT-ROBBINS-SHORT, about
700 words)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins, who simultaneously became one of
20th-century ballet's greatest choreographers and a towering
innovator in Broadway musicals, died Wednesday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who also had a house in Bridgehampton, N.Y., was in
Manhattan when he suffered a stroke Saturday, said Deborah Koolish
of the New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined the City Ballet in 1948 and helped shape the
company's creative profile with daring and brio for half a century
through his often startling, always experimental choreography in
ballet's classical idiom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he enjoyed phenomenal success on Broadway.
From 1944 to 1964, Robbins' golden touch was evident in musicals as
disparate as ``On the Town,'' ``The King and I,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``West
Side Story'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his acclaim on Broadway, Robbins made it clear that his
first love was dance, and ballet in particular. He returned to the
commercial theater briefly in 1989 with ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' but even this hit was an anthology of dance sequences
from past shows.
</P>
<P>
   His association with the City Ballet began when George
Balanchine, the company's artistic director, invited him to join at
the troupe's founding. Balanchine named Robbins associate artistic
director in 1949. After Balanchine's death in 1983, he and Peter
Martins served jointly until 1990 as the company's artistic
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance is about relationships,'' Robbins said. Attached to this
credo, he imbued his ballets, no matter how plotless, with human
insights and emotions that had a universal resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he was a very American choreographer who knew how to
distill the spirit of his time. But unlike others who created
ballets with pioneers and cowboys, Robbins did not indulge in
``Americana.'' He was not concerned with the myth of America but
with its reality.
</P>
<P>
   This genius for capturing the essence of an age was the Robbins
signature. It could be sensationally overt in a landmark Robbins
musical like ``West Side Story,'' with its indelible images of
1950s gang rumbles. But the same gift was even more vividly
expressed in any Robbins ballet, beginning with ``Fancy Free,'' an
evergreen masterpiece about three sailors on the town during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater,
Robbins created ``Fancy Free'' in 1944 as his first ballet. The
score was by a fellow unknown, Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, the choreographer said that he was more
interested in a world ``where things are not named,'' and his
exploration of ballet's classical idiom became more abstract and
profound. Nonetheless, he never lost sight of the pulse of his
times. In the epic ballets he created to music by Chopin and Bach,
he extended technical virtuosity and the art of partnering but also
defined contemporary encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation was a favorite Robbins theme, restated in works as
different as ``The Cage,'' an early masterpiece; ``Moves,'' a
ballet without music; the impressionistic ``Ives, Songs,'' and
cool, classical essays like ``Glass Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' artistic voice was distinctly his own, dazzling in its
originality. Remarkably, and unlike other choreographers, he never
seemed to repeat himself, especially in his 66 ballets. The same
was true to a lesser degree in the 15 Broadway musicals he
choreographed and occasionally directed (he was also production
supervisor for ``Funny Girl''). Shows from ``West Side Story'' to
``Peter Pan'' made Robbins' name familiar to hundreds of thousands
in the 1950s and '60s, and yet all differed in tone and style.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' inventiveness, in both ballet and musicals, stemmed in
large part from his willingness to mix disparate theatrical
elements. In 1945, while still in Ballet Theater, he wrote that his
vision of classical ballet encompassed a ``combination with other
theater forms in order to experiment and achieve a wider horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, he introduced conventions from ballet and
vernacular dance styles. A Robbins show was a model of integration,
driven especially by the idea that dancing, like words and music,
could carry the story forward. Descended from the innovators of
18th-century ballet d'action, Robbins never saw dance as just a
divertissement.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, his works for ballet companies were usually
essays in dramatized emotion, as seen in ``Afternoon of a Faun''
and ``The Cage,'' two provocative studies of male-female relations
that became Robbins classics. Even his 1969 Chopin masterwork,
``Dances at a Gathering,'' was, for all its plotlessness, a study
of a community.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical appeal of Robbins' ballets was quickly recognized
by Balanchine, and Robbins was as responsible as Balanchine in
establishing the City Ballet's reputation after 1948. The crucial
role that he played in the City Ballet's initial success was
recalled in 1988 by Todd Bolender, a former choreographer and
principal dancer in the company: ``Jerry was a great incentive for
Balanchine, contributing an American dance creativity in his
ballets that was of great importance to our early 1950's tours,
especially in Europe, where the Robbins ballets had an explosive
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure was, in fact, anathema to Robbins. Often abrasive in his
demands on both Broadway and in ballet, he ruthlessly drove his
collaborators, including actors and dancers, to extend themselves
beyond their own expectations.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional person who was known as something of a prankster in
his early career, Robbins, trim and white-bearded as time went by,
eventually acquired a solemn, patriarchal air. But anyone who knew
Robbins knew him as the ultimate perfectionist; he cast himself
aptly as a whip-cracking ringmaster in ``Circus Polka,'' a witty
piece he created for the City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival in 1972.
Here as well, he declared that his primary allegiance was to
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   After 1964, show business had ceased to interest him as a
serious endeavor. Rightly, he sensed that whatever his success on
Broadway, his eventual reputation would rest on his enduring
ballets. It was this output that made him the first major
American-born classical choreographer and a member of the
20th-century ballet pantheon that included Balanchine, Sir
Frederick Ashton, Michel Fokine and Antony Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins was born to Harry and Lena Rabinowitz on Oct. 11,
1918, in New York City. Robbins and his parents legally changed the
family name in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Success came early to Robbins. At the age of 3, he played the
piano in a public children's concert. Rabinowitz operated a
delicatessen, and with his wife, offered Jerome and his older
sister, Sonya, a breadth of cultural opportunities. ``I grew up in
the Jewish tradition that children must get all the culture
possible,'' Robbins said in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   When his father went into corset manufacturing in Union City,
N.J., the family moved to nearby Weehawken, where Robbins graduated
from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1935. Although he entered New
York University, planning to major in chemistry, he left in a year
because of a slump in his father's business.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Robbins had also taken lessons with his
sister's modern-dance teachers, Gluck Sandor and Felicia Sorel, who
directed the Dance Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor, whom Robbins later called his ``guru,'' attracted
considerable attention with his experimental productions. These
included ``Petrouchka,'' with Constructivist costumes by Vincente
Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor also worked with theatrical companies, and it was in
``The Brothers Ashkenazi,'' a 1937 Yiddish Art Theater production,
that Robbins made his professional debut with a two-word walk-on
role.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tenets crucial to Robbins' future success might be
traced to the influence of the Dance Center. Sandor impressed him
most, he said, by ``an imagination that evolved a different style
for every production.'' The Robbins gift for establishing immediate
audience contact stemmed from these early years. ``We dancers were
taught to perform with the concentration of actors,'' the
choreographer said, explaining that this meant ``the centering of
everything to pull the viewers into the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance, not ballet, was dominant in the 1930s, and no
American ballet troupes independent of opera houses managed to
survive. But Sandor told his student: ``Study ballet. It's going to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins immersed himself in ballet classes with Ella Daganova.
He also studied Spanish dancing with Helene Veola, oriental dance
with Nimura, interpretive dancing with his sister and Alyce Bentley
and choreography with Bessie Schoenberg at the New Dance League.
Many of the classes were subsidized by the New Deal's Works
Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Fancy Free'' was his first work for a ballet company,
Robbins had started choreographing while performing in summer shows
at Lake Tamiment, a Poconos resort in Bushkill, Pa., that served as
an incubator for rising talent like Danny Kaye and Imogene Coca.
The dancers there ranged from members of Martha Graham's company
like Dorothy Bird and Anita Alvarez to Balanchine disciples like
Ruthanna Boris. ``Jerry was considered to be a modern dancer at
that time, although he was deeply committed to ballet,'' Miss Bird
recalled in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' choreography at Tamiment included a duet for himself
and Miss Alvarez set to ``Strange Fruit,'' Billie Holiday's
recording of Lewis Allen's song about lynchings. Named after the
song, the work displayed the political commitment then common in
modern dance. Like-minded Robbins pieces, later seen in New York,
were ``Incident in Harlem'' and ``Death of a Loyalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also created a dance version of ``Our Town'' that was
incorporated into ``The Straw Hat Revue,'' which Max Leibman,
Tamiment's entertainment director, and the Shubert Organization
brought to New York in 1939. The show introduced Kaye to Broadway
and was in fact Robbins' Broadway choreographic debut although he
received no credit.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Robbins danced in the chorus of four musicals.
Some, including ``Keep Off the Grass'' in 1939, were choreographed
by Balanchine, then bereft of a ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined Ballet Theater only in its second season in
1940-41. Although not primarily remembered today as a dancer, he
left an impact on many who saw him perform at Ballet Theater and in
his own and Balanchine's works at the City Ballet. In any event,
his dancing career was overshadowed by his sensational success as a
choreographer. Robbins retired from dancing in 1952, although he
later appeared in cameo roles at the City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   While at Ballet Theater and in his early years on Broadway,
Robbins was also politically active. When called before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities in May 1953, the choreographer
said he had belonged to the American Communist Party's Theatrical
Transient Group between 1943 and 1947. Many in the arts never
forgave Robbins for naming eight colleagues as members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Velde, R-Ill., chairman of the committee, praised
Robbins for his testimony, which the choreographer justified on the
grounds that he had made ``a great mistake in joining the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his testimony, Robbins had already choreographed
hits like ``On the Town,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and ``The King and
I.'' His Broadway career was at stake: had he not cooperated with
the panel, he risked being blacklisted in the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for the Soviet Union was nonetheless common when that
country and the United States were allies in World War II. A more
universal statement about that period came from Robbins in ``Fancy
Free.'' A shrewd, warm and idiomatic picture of young people in
1944, ``Fancy Free'' offered something new in ballet: ``The
revelation of democratic human relationships,'' as George Amberg
wrote in his book, ``Ballet in America'' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   The same writer saw Robbins' next and equally enduring ballet,
``Interplay'' (1945) as proof ``that the contemporary American
style is not determined by the nature of the subject but by the
character of the execution.'' In The New York Times, John Martin
wrote that the work's ``eight dancers perform in an idiom and a
style that have meaning for them.'' The idea that Robbins ballets
offered a collective self-portrait of an entire American generation
was shared by the choreographer himself through the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the success of ``Fancy Free'' catapulted
Robbins into a second, parallel, career on Broadway. Oliver Smith,
the ballet's designer, urged Robbins and Leonard Bernstein to
expand the sailors-on-leave theme into a musical comedy. With a
book by two unknown writers, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and the
authority of a veteran director, George Abbott, the collaborators
had a hit on their hands. The musical, called ``On the Town,''
opened on Dec. 28, 1944, and struck a responsive chord in a
war-weary audience that identified with its urban comedy.

CIA AGENT'S SON SAYS HE REGRETS HIS DAD'S PLEA BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Douglas F. Groat's son said he is disappointed
that his dad, a former CIA officer and Glenville, N.Y. policeman
who believed in never backing down, would strike a plea bargain to
settle the espionage charges brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he thinks he's doing the right thing, then I'm behind
him,'' Shawn D. Groat said Tuesday, one day after his father
pleaded guilty to trying to extort $1 million from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the government agreed to drop four espionage
charges that could have meant the death penalty. For his plea,
Douglas Groat will serve five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his home in Toledo, Ohio, Shawn Groat said his
father had written him two letters since his March 2 arrest. In one
dated July 20, Douglas Groat told his son he was being detained in
a 12-by-16-foot room at a U.S. marshal's facility about 30 miles
outside Washington, D.C. He didn't know exactly where, he wrote,
because he was taken there in a van with curtains drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My abode is like a small windowless hotel room with a TV, bed,
clock radio, toilet, sink and shower,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Groat, 27, said his father didn't seem depressed by the
arrangement but noted that ``the only contact he has with the
outside world is when they bring him his meals.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shawn Groat heard about the plea bargain Monday night, he
wrote a short poem, which begins: ``Never back down/ Stand up for
your rights/ Give them a battle/ Go out with a fight/ Your words
meant so much/ I thought you spoke true/ First chance you get/ Look
what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Groat, who lived in Glenville between ages 1 and 7, said
he grew up watching his father refuse to quit in battles such as
one that he waged with the local police department. In 1976,
Douglas Groat was suspended after being accused of filing a false
statement against a man in a case. But after nearly three years of
struggles and a lawsuit, he won reinstatement to the police force,
plus a $15,000 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him fight Glenville and never back down,'' Shawn Groat
said, adding he was surprised and upset by Monday's plea bargain.
Shawn Groat said he believes his father did nothing wrong but
figured federal officials would find a way to make one of the
charges stick.

 NEW YORK: urban comedy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dance became a major component of any Robbins musical. In 1945,
he choreographed ``Billion Dollar Baby,'' also directed by Abbott,
while ``High Button Shoes'' (1947) confirmed his ingenuity for
period stylization. The Roseland Ballroom honored Robbins and
Martha Graham simultaneously with an award, she for ``bringing art
to the masses'' and he for being ``tops in Terpsichore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Ma _ I'm Dancing'' (1948), with a book by Robbins and
directed by him and Abbott, was a takeoff on a touring ballet
company. The typical Robbins comic timing was illustrated by a
Pullman car scene in which sleepwalkers tumbled in and out of
berths. In quick succession, Robbins choreographed ``Miss Liberty''
(1949), ``Call Me Madam'' (1950), ``The King and I'' (1951) and
``Two's Company'' (1952).
</P>
<P>
   Although not the first to treat serious subjects in musical
comedy, Robbins impressed Broadway with ``The Small House of Uncle
Thomas,'' his unconventional antislavery ballet in ``The King and
I.'' The sequence borrowed from Asian dance idioms. La Meri, an
American modern dancer, had earlier retold ``Swan Lake'' in the
same way, but ``The Small House'' looked fresh, not derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' integrated vision of musicals became more pronounced in
shows when he took over the role of director as well as
choreographer. He was co-director of ``The Pajama Game'' (1954)
with Abbott; he adapted, directed and choreographed ``Peter Pan,''
starring Mary Martin (1954), and he directed ``Bells Are Ringing''
(1956).
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he directed and choreographed ``Gypsy,'' and in 1964,
he served as production supervisor of ``Funny Girl.'' But the two
most successful musicals of his career were those he conceived,
directed and choreographed: ``West Side Story,'' an updated version
of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in 1957, and ``Fiddler on the Roof,''
inspired by Sholom Aleichem's stories, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also acted as show doctor, patching up five productions.
He choreographed Aaron Copland's ``Tender Land'' for the New York
City Opera (1954) and directed two nonmusical productions: Arthur
Kopit's ``Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm
Feelin' So Sad,'' and Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage and her
Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his acclaim in show business (which included five
Donaldson Awards, four Tonys, two Oscars for the 1961 film version
of ``West Side Story'' and an Emmy for a televised version of
``Peter Pan''), Robbins remained primarily devoted to ballet.
</P>
<P>
   His later works were more classical but in 1946, he typically
caused a stir with ``Facsimile,'' the first of his ballets about
contemporary neuroses. The cast consisted of Robbins and two Ballet
Theater stars, Nora Kaye and John Kriza. The ballet's love triangle
came to an end with Ms. Kaye's cry of ``Stop!'' Looking back in
1990, Robbins said, ``It was sort of a transitional piece, and it
came out of a situation in my own life when I was involved with two
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaye, in fact, told The New York Times in 1951 that she
planned to marry Robbins on April 16 of that year. The engagement
was broken and Robbins, who was very private about his life, never
married. He is survived by his sister, Sonya Cullinen of
Wilmington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins had cast Miss Kaye in ``The Cage,'' an allegory about
man-eating female insects that commented at best on the eternal
battle of the sexes and at worst suggested that women instinctively
hate men. For all its sensational aura, it became one of the
classics Robbins choreographed in his first decade at the City
Ballet. In 1953, ``Afternoon of a Faun'' stunned audiences by its
mix of sensuousness and simplicity. An updated gloss on Nijinsky's
1913 ballet to the same Debussy score, the work epitomized the
Robbins genius for discovering the rightness of every movement.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Robbins was shuttling between Broadway and
ballet. In 1958, he took a step that led to an informal leave from
the City Ballet. For the first Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, that summer, he directed an ad hoc group of dancers that
became Ballets: U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Although short-lived, this Robbins troupe had a huge success in
Europe and embodied a specifically American spirit in ballets like
``Moves'' and ``N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz.'' The group disbanded in
1961 but reassembled for a White House dinner in 1962 given by
President John F. Kennedy for the Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Robbins returned to Ballet Theater to choreograph his
version of a peasant wedding in ``Les Noces.'' Just as
surprisingly, he then embarked on three years of quiet
experimentation in a project that he called the American Theater
Laboratory. His unrealized aim, he said later, was to create
theater pieces in the way that he composed ballets.
</P>
<P>
   On some level, the experience reopened the floodgates of his
creativity. Returning to the New York City Ballet in 1969, where
Balanchine named him ballet master, he astonished both the theater
and dance worlds with the invention that poured into ``Dances at a
Gathering.'' Subsequent major ballets included ``The Goldberg
Variations,'' an 85-minute exposition of the ballet lexicon, and
``Watermill,'' in which Edward Villella reclined onstage,
meditating on life and phases of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Balanchine, who had choreographed little between 1968
and 1972, was subject to increasing speculation that his creativity
had come to an end. That he then needed Robbins by his side was
obvious. Yet even after he recovered from this dry spell,
Balanchine continued to work with Robbins in a relationship of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before Balanchine died on April 1, 1983, the City
Ballet's board named Robbins and Peter Martins, a principal dancer
in the company, as artistic directors. After Lincoln Kirstein, the
company's co-founder, resigned in September 1989, Robbins announced
that he wished to work on other projects and would resign his own
post on Jan. 1, 1990. He continued to rehearse the company for its
``Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets'' and, in effect, left the
troupe in June of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after restaging his works for the Paris Opera Ballet,
Robbins choreographed a plotless Bach ballet, ``Two- and Three-Part
Inventions,'' in June 1994 for the School of American Ballet. It
was transferred in the fall to the City Ballet. Robbins explained
that he was returning from ``a break.'' A few months earlier, he
had created a solo to Bach for Mikhail Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the City Ballet acquired a hit in ``West Side
Story Suite,'' based on dances from his show, Robbins had a heart
valve replaced. But in 1997, he finished a major work for the
company, ``Brandenburg,'' to the Bach concertos. During rehearsals,
he had said, ``I feel I have one more big ballet in me.'' It was
his last new work.

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y.:north of Cooperstown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Farmers' Museum ((607) 547-1450) and Fenimore House Museum
((607) 547-1400) vary their hours from week to week, so it's smart
to call ahead. Both have unique charms. The Farmers' Museum
ventures beyond the obvious rusty tools and baling machines; its
quilt collection is considered among the finest in the country. At
Fenimore House, docents wear Iroquois regalia _ it is guaranteed to
brighten the day of any baseball-despising kids (or adults) in your
party.
</P>
<P>
   If you book well in advance, where to stay involves places
within Cooperstown city limits instead of the hundred-mile zone
annually scoured by desperate souls, often without success, in the
latter stages of July.
</P>
<P>
   The bed and breakfasts are uniformly elegant but a bit pricey.
Figure $90 a night, though some $60-$75 bargains are occasionally
available. Even the motels are slightly upscale in appearance and
rates; after all, proprietors realize that you either stay with
them or drive a long way to find alternatives. You do get quality;
many of these places have their own beaches and make paddle boats
available to guests.
</P>
<P>
   The most upscale is the tony Otesaga Resort Hotel, whose rooms
top out at $185 a night but whose porch is mere steps away from the
hall of fame. Convenience combined with elegance always costs a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide not to stay in Cooperstown, be prepared to search
for accommodations during Hall of Fame Induction Weekend. Room
scarcity is intensified when a so-called name player is enshrined,
and in 1999 Nolan Ryan is expected to be joined in the hall by
fellow superstars George Brett and Robin Yount. Usually,
sportswriters vote in one or two players, at most. An old-timers'
committee also chooses inductees, but generally the honorees are
either deceased or much lesser-known. This anticipated modern-day
threesome means that the always-crazed hotel/motel demand will be
tripled.
</P>
<P>
   After you've booked a place to stay and ensured that
non-baseball fans in your group have plenty of other diversions,
it's time to turn your attention to the hall.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to worry about induction ceremony tickets per
se: The program, always held Saturday afternoon in front of
Cooperstown's Clark Sports Center, is free. That doesn't assure
proximity; fans shoulder their way into good viewing positions, and
the lawn in front of the center is staked out early by people
spreading blankets or setting up those ubiquitous plastic folding
lounge chairs. The best advice is the most obvious: Get up early to
nail down a choice spot.
</P>
<P>
   The National Baseball Hall of Fame is open daily, with summer
hours of 9 a.m.- 9 p.m. Considering the multitude of treasures
inside and the full day it can take just to give most exhibits a
first look, ticket prices _ $9.50 for adults, $8 for seniors, $4
for kids 7-12 and free for those under 7 _ are not exorbitant. But
during induction weekend, the crowds are egregious. Be there when
the doors open.
</P>
<P>
   Another annual Induction Week highlight is Sunday's hall of fame
game between two Major League teams; the match-up is announced each
spring. The game is played on Doubleday Field, erroneously
identified once upon a time as the spot where Gen. Abner Doubleday
invented baseball. What myths lack in accuracy, though, they often
make up for in comfortable familiarity, and if you're lucky enough
to score a game ticket you really won't care if baseball's genesis
occurred in that converted cow pasture or not. Doubleday Field is
small, perhaps one-fifth the size of The Ballpark in Arlington, and
its cozy confines are perfect for optimum viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Game tickets are $10 for reserved seats and $9 for outfield
perches. They traditionally go on sale in late April; mailed
requests should be sent to Hall of Fame Game Tickets, Cooperstown
Baseball Committee, Box 590, Cooperstown, NY 13326. No checks or
cash, please: The committee does want your letter to include a
credit card type, number and date of expiration. Master Card, VISA,
Discover and American Express are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Forget buying a ticket on the day of the game; it will have been
sold out for months, and Cooperstown discourages scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   It is traditional for most living hall of fame members to find
their way back to Cooperstown during induction weekend. Especially
if you stay at the Otesaga, you're likely to rub shoulders
occasionally with childhood idols. The hall sponsors a couple of
golf tournaments over the weekend, and many hall of famers compete.
For grown-up fans, this is a good opportunity to ask for
autographs. The hall also sponsors two free autograph sessions for
kids ages 7-12.
</P>
<P>
   There are other activities, notably a minor-league game at
Doubleday Field and a ``town ball'' exhibition, which serve as
secondary treats.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains for Nolan Ryan fans is the hall's announcement
of its 1999 induction weekend dates. July 23-25 or July 30-Aug. 1
are the best bets; call the hall around September or October this
year to find out for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if you want to be with Ryan on his big day, make your next
call to the Cooperstown Chamber of Commerce. Only early birds can
enjoy all the hall of fame worms.

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ A year from now, Nolan Ryan will undoubtedly
become the Deerslayer's neighbor, and area baseball
fans-turned-tourists will want to be there when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   But if they don't plan far ahead, they'll have to settle for
reading about Ryan's induction into the National Baseball Hall of
Fame instead of seeing it. Cooperstown, in upstate New York, home
of the hall and setting for two of James Fenimore Cooper's buckskin
potboilers, is one of America's most delightful country towns.
Besides the hall of fame, Cooperstown has enough other attractions
to make it a good vacation choice for even non-baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last week in July, when the annual hall
inductions are usually scheduled, the sleepy town of 2,500 morphs
into the center of the baseball universe. Hotel reservations, let
alone tickets to induction events, are impossible to come by. If
you want to share Ryan's glorious moment, start making arrangements
as soon as the hall announces its induction ceremony dates for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good idea to make Cooperstown's acquaintance ahead of
time. Begin by realizing that New York state is a whole lot bigger
than New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people assume that Cooperstown is a quick drive from
the Big Apple. In fact, Cooperstown is many miles northwest of New
York City. It takes as long to drive between the two locales as it
does to motor from Fort Worth to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow at least 3 1/2 hours,'' cautions a Cooperstown Chamber
of Commerce staffer. The New York State Thruway, also known as
Interstate 87, offers a boring multilane route north from New York
City to Albany. But then there is a sharp left turn on State
Highway 20, and you're almost instantly immersed in gently rolling
woodlands. The scenery is lovely, but the driving isn't. Every mile
is lengthened by innumerable twists and turns. It is much like the
Pacific Coast Highway between Los Angeles and San Francisco,
meaning that you might as well relax and enjoy the view.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a sleepy country hamlet, albeit one with a
tourist-driven economy, Cooperstown is long on charm and short on
parking spaces. Forget driving into town and parking at a meter.
Instead, follow the ``Perimeter Parking'' signs to any one of
several lots on the outskirts of town. There is no parking charge,
and for $1.50 a person, you can take a delightful trolley ride to
the town square.
</P>
<P>
   Your first sight of Cooperstown may make you catch your breath.
It is a wonderfully preserved tribute to early-1900s America.
Unlike Colonial Williamsburg, Cooperstown is a real village. Its
shops serve residents as well as visitors. The resulting atmosphere
is delightfully homey.
</P>
<P>
   The area had historic allure long before the hall of fame opened
in 1939. Otsego Lake served as a seasonal fishing camp for American
Indian tribes before the first white settlement appeared on its
shores in the early 1600s. Only after the first century of its
existence did that settlement become known as Cooperstown _ for
William Cooper, whose heir, James Fenimore Cooper, immortalized
Otsego Lake as ``Glimmerglass'' in ``The Deerslayer.'' Cooper also
put his hometown to fictional use in ``The Pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   Otsego and the surrounding countryside offer ample opportunity
for recreational boating, hiking and other pleasurable outdoor
pursuits. But Cooperstown's distance from outlying metropolitan
areas, in driving time if not in miles, eventually threatened to
turn the Deerslayer's stamping grounds into a ghost town.
Fortunately, Cooperstown also had claim to the title of
``Birthplace of Baseball,'' thanks to a popular myth about Abner
Doubleday and the game he was supposed to have invented there. When
the hall of fame opened up, so did Cooperstown tourism. The town
has thrived ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But part of Cooperstown's ongoing success has been determination
to be something other than homes and shops surrounding the hall of
fame. Besides the venerable hall, Cooperstown has a world-class
opera, two gorgeous golf courses, nearly two dozen motels, a
reasonable selection of restaurants and a half-dozen museums that
have nothing to do with baseball. There are antiquarian book
dealers, antiques stores, art galleries, a pair of glittering state
parks and enough canoe rentals to float the Deerslayer and an
entire Iroquois tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Initial information about these amenities, particularly how to
book in-town lodging a minimum of six months in advance of hall of
fame induction activities, is readily available on the Internet
(www.cooperstown.net/cnatract.html) or by calling the Cooperstown
Chamber of Commerce ((607) 547-9983).
</P>
<P>
   Non-baseball fans often like to call ahead and book tickets for
performances by the Glimmerglass Opera, which cannily focuses on a
summer season during the months when the hall of fame attracts the
most visitors. Glimmerglass offers an eclectic performance mix,
often following tried-and-true favorites such as ``Tosca'' with
lesser-known or quirky works: ``L'Italiana en Algeri'' is a recent
example. Tickets fall into a wide $19-$70 range; information and
reservations are available at (607) 547-2255 or
glimmer\Ntelenet.net. Most performances are held in the lovely
Alice Busch Opera Theater eight miles north of Cooperstown. MORE: &QL;

JEROME ROBBINS, 79, FAMED BALLET CHOREOGRAPHER AND BROADWAY
LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>

words)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins, one of 20th-century ballet's greatest
choreographers and a towering innovator in Broadway musicals, died
Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins suffered a stroke Saturday, said Deborah Koolish of the
New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined the City Ballet in 1948 and helped shape its
creative profile with daring and brio for half a century through
his often startling, always experimental choreography in ballet's
classical idiom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he enjoyed phenomenal success on Broadway.
From 1944 to 1964, Robbins' golden touch was evident in musicals as
disparate as ``On the Town,'' ``The King and I,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``West
Side Story'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his acclaim on Broadway, Robbins made it clear that his
first love was dance, and ballet in particular. He briefly returned
to the commercial theater in 1989 with ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' but even this hit was an anthology of dance sequences
from past shows.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' association with the City Ballet began when George
Balanchine, the company's artistic director, invited him to join at
the troupe's founding. Balanchine named Robbins associate artistic
director in 1949. After Balanchine's death in 1983, he and Peter
Martins served jointly until 1990 as the company's artistic
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was a very American choreographer who knew how to
distill the spirit of his time. But unlike others who created
ballets with pioneers and cowboys, Robbins did not indulge in
``Americana.'' He was not concerned with the myth of America but
with its reality.
</P>
<P>
   This genius for capturing the essence of an age was the Robbins
signature. It could be sensationally overt in a landmark Robbins
musical like ``West Side Story,'' with its indelible images of
1950s gang rumbles. But the same gift was even more vividly
expressed in any Robbins ballet, beginning with ``Fancy Free,'' an
evergreen masterpiece about three sailors on the town during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater,
Robbins created ``Fancy Free'' in 1944 as his first ballet. The
score was by a fellow unknown, Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, Robbins said he was more interested in a
world ``where things are not named,'' and his exploration of
ballet's classical idiom became more abstract and profound.
Nonetheless, he never lost sight of the pulse of his times. In the
epic ballets he created to music by Chopin and Bach, he extended
technical virtuosity and the art of partnering but also defined
contemporary encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' artistic voice was distinctly his own, dazzling in its
originality. Remarkably, and unlike other choreographers, he never
seemed to repeat himself, especially in his 66 ballets. The same
was true to a lesser degree in the 15 Broadway musicals he
choreographed and occasionally directed (he was also production
supervisor for ``Funny Girl''). Shows from ``West Side Story'' to
``Peter Pan'' made Robbins' name familiar to hundreds of thousands
in the 1950s and '60s, and yet all differed in tone and style.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins was born to Harry and Lena Rabinowitz on Oct. 11,
1918, in New York City. Robbins and his parents changed the family
name legally in the 1940s. He grew up in Weehawken, N.J., and
briefly attended New York University.
</P>
<P>
   While at Ballet Theater and in his early years on Broadway,
Robbins was politically active. When called before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities in May 1953, the choreographer
said he had belonged to the American Communist Party's Theatrical
Transient Group between 1943 and 1947. Many in the arts never
forgave Robbins for naming eight colleagues as members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who was very private about his life, never married. He
is survived by his sister, Sonya Cullinen of Wilmington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the City Ballet acquired a hit in ``West Side
Story Suite,'' based on dances from his show, Robbins had a heart
valve replaced. But in 1997, he finished a major work for the
company, ``Brandenburg,'' to the Bach concertos. During rehearsals,
he had said, ``I feel I have one more big ballet in me.'' It was
his last new work.

   The Pet Snail Vine
</P>
<P>
   Q. A friend purchased a snail vine in California, brought it
home and planted it. The blossoms are blue and curled up, hence the
snail name. What is it, and will it grow and overwinter in
Oklahoma?
</P>
<P>
   A. The snail vine, Vigna caracalla, is a kind of bean. It used
to be called Phaseolus caracalla and is still sometimes referred to
that way. The seeds are edible but slow to form, and most gardeners
grow it for the unusual, highly fragrant flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In its native South American tropics and similarly toasty
climates, the snail vine is a perennial. Growers in places that see
frost are usually advised to dig up the tubers in fall and store
them as they would dahlias. This works fine, but only if you GET
tubers, which is by no means guaranteed, especially in the first
year. A safer alternative is to keep your plant in a big pot and
bring it in and out as the seasons dictate.
</P>
<P>
   That is what they do at Monticello, where the snail vine is a
particular pet and very popular with garden visitors, said Peggy
Cornett, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic
Plants at Monticallo. Thomas Jefferson didn't grow it, she said,
but he wanted to. In a letter to Benjamin Hawkins, one of his
garden suppliers, he wrote that the snail vine was ``the most
beautiful bean in the world,'' then went on to say, ``I never could
get one of these in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The snail vine was a popular greenhouse plant in England by
1786, when Jefferson visited Kew Gardens, and Ms. Cornett thinks
that is probably where he saw it. Later Americans had better luck
than Jefferson did. The snail vine was common here by the mid-19th
century, and it was a florists' favorite in the high Victorian
1890s.
</P>
<P>
   Then it fell out of fashion and is only now reappearing. Seeds
are sold by Thompson and Morgan (P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J.
08527; 800-274-7333; free catalog), and plants are available from
the Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic Plants (P.O. 316,
Charlottesvilles, Va. 22902; 804-984-9821; free catalog) and
Logee's Greenhouses (141 North Street, Danielson, Conn. 06239;
888-330-8038; catalog, $3).
</P>
<P>
   Be warned that the color is somewhat variable. The flowers are
often more purple than blue and may have a lot of yellow in them as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling Aphids
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Would you please tell me what to do about the black bugs
that are making a home and multiplying on my nasturtiums? I don't
know what to spray them with because I would love to use
nasturtiums in my salads.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wrote: ``My rose has been attacked by aphids
since last month, and I've been spraying it with a hot chili pepper
spray. It worked for a while but now there are more. I tried garlic
water, and mild soap, too. Is there something else I can use
without resorting to harsh chemicals?''
</P>
<P>
   A. The heat of summer brings out aphids in force. Though the
second questioner might try planting a diversionary ``trap crop''
of nasturtiums, which, as the first questioner has observed, aphids
adore, nasturtium growers will obviously have to consider something
else.
</P>
<P>
   Aphids come in so many different varieties it sometimes seems
like there's a special one for every plant that grows. But all of
them have the same basic habits and the first line of defense is
always the same: attend to the health of the plants. Aphids
concentrate their attacks on the weak and sick.
</P>
<P>
   Start by being sure the victim has plenty of water;
drought-stress is notorious for inviting hordes of aphids. Then try
a spray of foliar fertilizer, preferably one that contains some
seaweed. Avoid fertilizers that contain a lot of nitrogen; the
soft, lush growth it promotes is another favorite aphid target.
</P>
<P>
   First aid for the plants, along with a strong spray of water to
wash off the more persistent stragglers, will usually bring aphid
populations down to tolerable levels within a week or two. (Total
elimination is not an organic concept.) If the infestation is still
severe, insecticidal soap or, in extreme cases, a pyrethrin-based
insecticide, will help. Spray carefully in the evening, when
aphid-eating beneficial insects like ladybugs are least active.
Unfortunately, insecticidal soap doesn't taste very good, and
pyrethrin is poisonous. So when it comes to edible leaves and
flowers, all you can do is wash them off.
</P>
<P>
   Who Ate the Leaves?
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the last two years I noticed large pieces missing from
the leaves of our edible-podded peas as they began to grow. I
couldn't find any bugs, nor any traces of slugs. I recently
observed some sparrows and/or finches biting the plants. They seem
to be the culprits. Is this a recognized problem? If so, what are
the best ways to prevent it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Birds are most likely to pull up new plants (they know
there's a big seed under there), or to bite chunks out of peas and
beans shortly before they're ready to pick. In the latter case,
it's usually moisture they're after, and putting out a birdbath
with clean water in it often solves the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf-eating birds are not a common complaint, and as a general
rule, neither finches nor sparrows are interested in vegetables. I
wonder if perhaps the birds you saw were thirsty, or in the case of
the sparrows, going after small bugs that weren't readily visible
to you.
</P>
<P>
   Was the damage to the leaves confined to young, low-growing
plants? If so, you might have voles. Or, more accurately, you might
have a vole. Anything more than one and there wouldn't have been
any leaves left to take chunks out of.
</P>
<P>
   The only reliable organic vole remover is a cat, though
mousetraps baited with peanut butter work pretty well (be sure
there are no skunks around if you go for the traps. Skunks are very
fond of peanut butter.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are sure it is the birds, the best defense is to tent
young plants with the bird netting sold at garden centers. The wide
variety of ugly bird-scare devices, from fake owls to flapping
silver strips, also work pretty well and are readily available. But
on balance, birds in the garden do more good than harm, so it's
better to keep them around.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Balls of blue paint sail and splatter. The players
catch marshmallows in their mouths and spew colored gum balls onto
the stage. At the Astor Place Theater here, during a typical Blue
Man Group performance, it's art as a kind of graduate-level
kindergarten. But when the head Blue Man, Chris Wink, gets home,
the scene changes markedly.
</P>
<P>
   One step in, and the frenetic city itself disappears. The floors
are painted a Creamsicle white. Windowpanes are frosted and cool,
like shaved ice. The ceiling has the faintest tint of blue, like
the gleam of a glacier. Refreshed, one seems to sense a drop in
body temperature of several degrees. Surfaces are rounded and
smooth, as though scooped, not constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Wink and his wife, Jen Graffam-Wink, a painter, have made their
800-square-foot apartment in a landmark building on Lafayette
Street a peaceful escape: a holiday from Wink's work a few steps
away. Call it light-Blue, like the tones of much of its pacific
palette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater is dark and industrial,'' said Wink, 37, one of
the three founding members of Blue Man Group, which began
performing 10 years ago. There are now 20 Blue Men in the extended
troupe, which performs nationally. ``I'm proud of that esthetic,
but I didn't want any trappings of Blue Man in the apartment. As
artists, you're sort of anti-materialist, but we wanted a space
that we looked forward to being in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sculptors who became the Winks' designers helped them set
sail at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to create a light, airy, weightless environment,''
said one of them, Blake Moore. ``I think we made it feel like a
cloud.'' He and his partner, Christian Bunce, had both shown in
galleries. In the past year, they have begun to work together on
design projects. The Winks gave them their first full-house
assignment. The designers and their clients _ artists all _
considered the apartment an artists' collaboration as much as
design. That explains the originality of their resources _ from
bass-fishing-boat chairs to wrestling mats _ and their success.
</P>
<P>
   The Winks met when Ms. Graffam-Wink's mother took her to a
performance of Blue Man Group, where she was pulled onstage to eat
Twinkies with the troupe. She met Chris. They were married a year
ago. They rented the apartment below the one they were living in,
planning to renovate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at a real challenge,'' Wink said. ``It was a
shell, with no kitchen or dining room, not a lot of space and some
odd architectural details.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were open to ideas. They were unafraid of excitement.
And they wanted something new: design as contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with the cabinets. Bunce's studio was close to Ms.
Graffam-Wink's. She mentioned that they needed someone to hang
kitchen cabinets. Bunce suggested himself and Moore as designers.
</P>
<P>
   Because there were now four artists' esthetics at work, the
designers presented the Winks with miniature prototypes of cabinets
that had interchangeable combinations of materials and colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of my work in theater, it was really important to
visualize our choices,'' Wink said. ``Going to see the prototype
was like going to look at an installation in a gallery. I was
really blown away.'' The presentation sold the work.
</P>
<P>
   What the four chose together managed to surprise everybody:
cabinets with a seamless appearance, made from sheets of
medium-density fiberboard (MDF) and painted with an automotive
lacquer in three delicate shades of blue and cream. The Plexiglas
doors were sanded with plastic kitchen abrasive pads to give them a
soft translucence. All edges of the cabinets were smoothed, to make
them look more molded than built and friendly to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   With the Winks' confidence growing, the job expanded one project
at a time, like a series of installations. During the next eight
months, Bunce and Moore designed the entire one-bedroom apartment
and much of its furniture. The collaborative spirit prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   As a continuation of the serenity that marked the project, the
designers created a dining room within one of two brick-arched
alcoves. With its low lacquered table and leather-seat chairs, it
is like a Japanese dining room _ a style that interested all four
artists. Rounded maple steps that lead up to it echo the alcove's
arch. The windows are frosted glass panes at the bottom half,
allowing light in but shielding an unsightly view. Bunce and Moore
designed and built the furniture. The low chairs are store-bought
stools with the legs cut short.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Graffam-Wink finds the table and chairs practical, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to finish dinner and lean back with your knees up,''
she said. ``It's incredibly comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunce said, ``We were constantly fiddling with scale.'' In these
experiments, playfulness began to creep into the apartment _ like
Blue Men _ in addition to the sophisticated calm spreading across
the walls and floors.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom, the designers created a bed the size of two
double beds. Call it the King Ultra. The rounded fiberboard bed
platform was painted a soft lime green. It also sits low, to
accommodate the Winks' two dachshunds, Boone and Thermis _ the
project's other collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs were definitely a big consideration in the design of
the apartment,'' Moore said, referring to how low almost everything
is. Not just teahouse, but doghouse.
</P>
<P>
   And why such a big bed?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' Wink said. ``It feels like Alice in
Wonderland. We wanted a bed large enough for us and the dogs.
Something that we could run and jump on.''
</P>
<P>
   The designers ordered wedge-shaped wrestling mats from Resilite,
a wrestling supply company in Sunbury, Pa., to use as dog ramps for
the bed and the couch. They also ordered a flat wrestling mat,
which they painted white, to use in the living room as a supple
area rug, where Ms. Graffam-Wink does her yoga.
</P>
<P>
   As with the wrestling supply company, the designers showed
resourcefulness, to say the least, with their other suppliers. They
spotted bass-fishing stools while leafing through the catalog of
the Bass Pro Shop, a fishing supply company in Springfield, Mo.
They bought them for the kitchen's work island. The air-piston
fishing chairs slide up and down, to eating level or living room
sitting level. They were $80 apiece _ cheap for a design original.
Complementing their functional directness, the kitchen counter tops
are hand-poured concrete.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to high craftsmanship, the designers' knowledge of
the art of sculpture brought an artist's understanding of materials
and a sense of perfectionism to the project, which the Winks
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't understand something, we were smart enough to try
to figure it out,'' Bunce said. They created their own plastering
tool, for instance, because the smoothness of the finishes was so
important to the way they complemented one another.
</P>
<P>
   The four lived with an artist's risks too. Jobs took hours and
days longer than expected _ because of collaborative
experimentation, no one knew what to expect. There was never a
budget. The sculptors billed for materials and by the hour. The
serene dining corner was once blood orange. Bunce had to be coaxed
into painting the bed lime green. Days were as tiring as if the
work had been their own art, not renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The clients, artists themselves, were happy to deal with
obsession instead of the neglect that is typical in renovation war
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kept going over the ceiling over and over again,''
Wink said. ``When it was finally done, I understood. They created
it to feel like you were gazing up at the sky. The moment it had a
crack, it wouldn't have been a sacred place anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time anyone heard a contractor say that?

   Phil Noble, president of Politics Online, a company in
Charleston, S.C., that provides Internet tools for politics, is
betting steak dinners these days on the following prediction: this
fall, he says, ``we're going to see the first candidate who won or
lost an election on the basis of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares 1998 on the Internet to 1964 on television _ the
year Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign pummeled Barry M. Goldwater with
negative television advertising. Candidates who tap the Internet's
potential could be just as successful this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be some 32-year-old first-time candidate in a
statehouse or city council race who unseats an old white guy who's
been sitting there for 20 years and hasn't even heard of the
Internet _ and he'll never see it coming,'' Noble said. ``Every
newspaper in the country is going to do a story, and every
politician in the country is going to say, `I want to get me some
of that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Noble and other political consultants who use the Internet say
this is the first election year in which the Net can be considered
a mass medium. In California, the pioneering state in political
uses of the Internet, a recent Field Poll showed that 41 percent of
likely voters used e-mail and that 67 percent used a computer
regularly at home, work or school.
</P>
<P>
   Many political consultants predict that those proportions of
Internet use among voters will prevail nationwide in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, however, say the Internet has not matured enough to
be an effective medium to convey political messages. The problem,
they say, is twofold: the Internet, unlike television, is not
universally available, and online information reaches only highly
interested voters.
</P>
<P>
   So strategists are turning to television to reach larger numbers
of potential voters, even though those viewers are likely to be
less interested in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, you decide you want to watch `Seinfeld,' and you get
our ad,'' said Mark Mellman, a Washington political consultant
whose clients have included Sens. Tom Daschle of South Dakota and
Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats. ``The problem is, not
many people want political information. When you go to the Web, you
have to want to go to a political site.'' Still, he is keeping his
eye on the Internet numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' Mellman said, ``as a tool of political
communication, the Internet today is of marginal value, but
increasing value.''
</P>
<P>
   Some signs of that increasing value are found in research
showing that more people are using the Internet this year to find
political information. Bruce Bimber, a political science professor
at the University of California at Santa Barbara, conducted a
nationwide telephone survey of 1,021 adults in February.
</P>
<P>
   In that survey, he found that 46 percent of adults nationwide
had access to the Internet and that the proportion of people
engaged in political uses of the Internet had roughly doubled since
a similar survey conducted before the elections of November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bimber found that 17 percent of the respondents used
the Internet to express political views, to learn about political
issues, to browse for political information or to get in contact
with elected officials or candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, he considered 7 percent actively engaged; that group
had either made contact with an official on line or expressed an
opinion. Only 3 percent had done so in 1996. The survey drew from a
random sample that was weighted to reflect the adult population.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wired voters'' that Bimber and others are studying this
year may look a lot like Terry Rolland. Ms. Rolland, 45, is a
federal employee in Hayward, Calif., who is so busy with work and
night school that she had time for an interview only by e-mail. She
first went on line in the last year and says she spent many hours
researching candidates and ballot measures on the Internet before
the California primary.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns' use of the Internet played a critical role in her
decisions. She started by reading the official voter pamphlet and
narrowing the field of candidates based on their statements. After
narrowing the field, she researched the remaining candidates on
line. Here is how her system worked during the attorney general's
race:
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the Web addresses provided in the voter pamphlet,'' Ms.
Rolland wrote, ``I e-mailed each candidate and asked them to
address the 10 top questions that I was concerned with. One
candidate responded within 24 hours. Three others responded within
three days, and the final person did not respond until the day of
the election. My decision was made based on how they responded to
my questions and the time it took them to answer my e-mail.
Obviously, the last candidate was not considered because I had
already cast my ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Highly motivated voters like Ms. Rolland are clearly rare. And
finding a target audience of likely voters on the Web is nearly
impossible. Doug Thompson, an associate with the Eddie Mahe Co., a
Washington consulting business whose clients have included Sens.
Conrad Burns of Montana and Slade Gorton of Washington, both
Republicans, said: ``There's just no way to know where all of that
effort is going. Right now, I can do more targeting with direct
mail and radio and television advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, few candidates running for high office this year are
neglecting the new medium. Though many campaigns are still
producing dull, static Web sites with only candidates' pictures and
biographies, the spirit of innovation is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   A tactic that is becoming common this year is the electronic
newsletter. From coast to coast, campaigns are attracting
subscribers on their Web sites. People receive weekly updates by
e-mail that keep the candidates' names in the minds of voters.
Aides in several statewide campaigns reported that their
newsletters had attracted 1,000 to 2,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   That concept goes a step further on the Web site of Senator
Boxer. Visitors to her site can sign up others to get e-mail about
the senator. The feature has been used 50 to 60 times at the site
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garvey, a Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin,
lists campaign contributors on line. The tactic furthers his
message on overhauling campaign finance laws. Garvey said
contributors did not mind being identified. In fact, being listed
seems to be an incentive for some to donate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got people saying, `Hey, I sent you $100 and I'm not on
the page,' '' Garvey said. Besides, the risk of listing
contributors is lower in his campaign than it might be in others.
``We're doing a $100 limit, so there's nothing interesting,''
Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the innovation this year is positive. The Internet's
capacity as a playground for pranks is nurturing dirty tricks as
well. In Alabama, on the day before the June 6 primary, someone
sent anonymous e-mail to 150 of the state's top Republican leaders
that smeared Jim Bennett, the Republican incumbent running for
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail addresses of the recipients had been gathered from
the state Republican Party Web site. The message presented a phony
news story that said Bennett had switched back to the Democratic
Party. Bennett, like more than 50 officeholders in the state,
switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1996,
and the move had been an issue in the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unexpected and disconcerting,'' Bennett said of the
e-mail, whose sender has not been identified. ``I don't know that
anybody took it seriously _ except us. Unfortunately there is no
way to control such things. That's the nature of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the Internet, in this case, was that creating a
response was fast, cheap and easy. Bennett's aide, Cam Ward, sent
an e-mail to the 150 Republicans within two hours. It was directed
at the sender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations!'' Ward's response began. ``You have won the
prize for the lowest campaign tactic I have ever witnessed.''
Bennett won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most watched Web sites in politics is for the
campaign of Jeb Bush, the likely Republican nominee for governor of
Florida. Known as the ``Jeb site,'' it is the envy of Internet
political consultants, a $26,000 site in a field where $5,000 is
the going rate.
</P>
<P>
   Information is updated daily with pictures from the road. Bush's
aides carry two digital cameras. They take pictures at every stop,
then pop the disk from the camera into a laptop and post the
pictures on the site. The pictures are one of the site's top draws.
</P>
<P>
   The address for the site is integrated into all campaign
material, from letterheads to television commercials _ a concept
that sounds basic, but one that many campaigns have missed. Adding
features every few weeks has also helped make the site successful.
</P>
<P>
   The latest innovation scheduled to go live on the site sometime
this summer is the Marvin the Dog Chat Room, where visitors can
converse with the Bush family pet. Marvin is also featured in
television ads, and plans for the Web site include adding video
clips of the dog in action.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in regard to the chat room feature, Bush had a
confession. ``I think someone will interpret for Marvin,'' he said.

THE LARGE IN THE SMALL: THE ART OF NOTICING

<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple-green paint fascinates John R. Stilgoe, the professor of
landscape history at Harvard. He sometimes finds it inside the
cupboards or broom closets of old kitchens, a token of the 1920s, a
time when that color was thought to be soothing to the soul. Public
schools wore that green; its relative survives in too many halls
under the name ``landlord green.''
</P>
<P>
   Stilgoe's eye for such things begins in the home, strides across
the porch, strolls Main Street, and bicycles breezily past strip
malls to the edge of the Interstates. His evocative new book,
``Outside Lies Magic: Regaining History and Awareness in Everyday
Places'' (Walker), is less a guide than a tool for seeing, like a
pair of binoculars taken on vacation for bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a clarion call to what he calls, almost mystically,
``exploration'' _ wandering on foot or bike, in search not of
cardiovascular fitness but of mental agility. Ultimately, it's
about becoming the proverbial person on whom nothing is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out now,'' he exhorts readers, ``not just outside, but
beyond the trap of the programmed electronic age.''
</P>
<P>
   Stilgoe is part of a new flowering of interest in looking at how
culture shapes the wide, mundane world around us. The principal
founder of modern landscape thinking and looking was the late J.B.
Jackson, the author of ``The Necessity for Ruins, and Other
Topics'' and the founder of Landscape magazine. He was praised by
the architect Robert Venturi as a prophet who inspired him to look
again at Main Street and Route 66. Stilgoe was Jackson's only
doctoral student at Harvard, and today, his course, nicknamed ``Gas
Stations,'' is regularly oversubscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Stilgoe looks under, behind, beneath and beside what most people
overlook. He explains how the American house tends to have light
and openness on four sides, a legacy of placing the dwelling in the
middle of the property, the better to get to its distant reaches;
European houses sat on the edge of their much smaller plots.
``Letting light and wind strike all four sides of a house remains
peculiarly American,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   He records how a small thing like angled parking can lure
customers to shops on languishing Main Streets. Malls, he says,
have killed the skill of parallel parking. He points out that since
fear arose about electromagnetic radiation, luxury homes and condos
are not built anywhere near power lines. And he explains why
fast-food chains use only dwarf evergreens so that they can
landscape instantly and never prune thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But Stilgoe's specific observations constitute examples to
illustrate a method, not a thesis; his book is a guide for the
private eye in the public realm. His point about apple green is
less about the specific color _ a neon pink is now in fashion as a
calming hue in police stations and the admitting rooms of
mental-health clinics _ than about the survival of old paint
schemes in hidden places, places that require notice.
</P>
<P>
   Stilgoe's own exploring began as a boy in Norwell, Mass., south
of Boston, where he still lives. When he was 13, his parents gave
him a Raleigh bicycle. He said he acquired his eye and interest
from his mother, who ``had always been someone who noticed
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a theory,'' he said, ``that noticing is part of what
used to be called feminine intuition. Women were more discerning
than the men, who were so busy doing. They transmitted that to
children.'' This pattern holds less true today, he said, because
more mothers are working.
</P>
<P>
   Being a noticer, Stilgoe said, is a secret to success in many
areas. A former Stilgoe student, now a physician, linked a series
of aches and pains his male patients reported to their wallets:
spending more time in the car, sitting on fatter wallets, they
found their legs growing numb.
</P>
<P>
   He urges, too, the importance of seeing what is absent: no weeds
at the edges of fast-food restaurants (gravel and black plastic
sheeting beneath keep them down); no shrubs more than knee-high,
the better to reassure customers that no carjacker can lurk.
``Discerning what is not in the picture enables the explorer to
make connections,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   A characteristic Stilgoe moment comes in his discussion of
fences. Cedar fences took over suburban backyards in the 1960s, he
notes, marking property rather than providing privacy. By walking
or biking rapidly, one can see through their cracks into the yards
beyond _ the picket-fence effect. This is his method in a nutshell:
the full picture, chink by narrow chink, rendered with the magic of
a nickelodeon _ noticing made dramatic.

ANYONE CAN DIAL IN FOR YOUR DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   To most people, few things are more private than their money _
such as how much they have and where they keep it. But with the
help of just a touch-tone telephone, some banks permit just about
anyone to learn the approximate balance of a checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Using a decades-old system reserved for small businesses called
merchant check verification, someone with enough curiosity can
simply call the bank's customer service line, input the customer
account number printed at the bottom of a check and input a dollar
amount. (Some banks require a check number as well; some don't.)
</P>
<P>
   The system then tells the caller whether the amount is in the
account. After a half-dozen or so inquiries involving different
amounts, the caller can typically learn approximately how much
money is in the account.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of a handful of banks proved how easy it was. The
automated system at Chase Bank, for example, asks for a check
number, but from there it was easy to guess other check numbers and
request verification of other amounts. Within a few minutes, we had
learned roughly how much money was in the account.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America's merchant check verification system was equally
easy to manipulate, as was that of Wells Fargo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It proved more difficult to get the same information through the
merchant check services of a credit union, because a live bank
representative handled the call.
</P>
<P>
   To some privacy rights advocates, this is just one example of a
system in dire need of better controls. One concern is that
manipulating such a system will become even simpler as banks move
more of their consumer operations online. Someone could then,
conceivably, write a software program to automatically check the
balance of a certain account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it quite bothersome because how much money you have is
one of the most private things,'' said Brad Templeton, a board
member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ``And then to find
out it's not really a secret at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Mierzwinsky, consumer programs director for CALPIRG, a
consumer watchdog group in Washington, said he thought merchant
check systems could add better controls, such as automatically
shutting down after someone makes more than one entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, companies have the right to reduce their risk,'' he
said. ``But it should be a `go-no go' thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all privacy advocates view the merchant check system as
all that bad. Marc Rotenberg of EPIC, a leading privacy rights
organization in Washington, D.C., said he thought the system
adequately protected privacy rights because it gave merchants the
least amount of information available.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to manipulate it by inputting multiple check numbers was
``a little like trying all possible combinations on a lock on a
suitcase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco
said that the phone-in system is quickly being replaced by
point-of-sale technology that automates the check verification
process. In the meantime, the bank isn't aware of abuses to the
system, which it has used in some form for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, view it as just one example of the need for
better privacy controls in banking. ``That's just one of the flaws
in the banking system,'' Mierzwinsky said. ``This is where things
are headed.''

   It was the best of shopping, it was the worst of shopping. When
Stephen Kornelis of Waconia, Minn., found the mint-condition vinyl
album _ still in cellophane and only $8 _ that he had spent the
last 15 years searching for, it made the fruitless, two-month Web
search for paintball gear almost worth it.
</P>
<P>
   And his discovery of an obscure Keef Hartley CD
(italics)almost(end italics) erased the annoyance of those
unreturned phone calls from the paintball Web site guys who work
from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and, he said, were probably ``just trying to
hustle a few bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had as many negative experiences as I have good
experiences'' with shopping over the Internet, said Kornelis, a
software engineer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 19.7 million Americans visited retail Web sites from
their homes, according to Mediametrix, a Web rating service.
Jupiter Communications, a research company, measured revenue
numbers for American online consumer transactions and found $707
million in 1996 and $2.6 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It projected $5.8 billion in 1998, in a $2.6 trillion retail
economy, according to an LJR Redbook Research report. E-commerce is
expected to generate between $34 billion and $37.5 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some people love it, some tolerate it, others fear it. Fans of
Internet commerce find it tremendously convenient. Consumers can
shop when it is raining without getting wet. No need to dress, let
alone find taxis, tokens or quarters for the meter. No more surly
sales clerks, no more mall Muzak.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey by Forrester Research, active Web shoppers
rated convenience the No. 1 reason to shop on line, although in
off-line shopping, they found price and service as important.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the convenience they offer, digital shops like CD
Now, Amazon.com and Etoys don't need to discount items so deeply,
said James McQuivey, an analyst in online retail strategies at
Forrester. ``If they build the brand so it's going to be
convenient, you're not going to say, `Oh, I can get it for 5
percent less at a bargain bookstore,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Petersen of Hoboken, N.J., an editorial director for
Barnesandnoble .com and an early Web shopper, knows how easy it is
to go on a buying binge by the blue glow of a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they'd run specials and you'd find yourself buying
stuff just because it was really easy to buy it,'' she said of
certain sites in the Web's earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   When her daughter, who is 15 months old, was born, Ms. Petersen
became a major fan of Ibaby, which sells supplies for infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself checking every day because they'd have
specials,'' she said. ``If you're the kind of person who can spend
the night with a catalog and spend $300 on stuff, you're equally
susceptible on line, even more so perhaps, because it's that much
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web's wide selection is also a major draw. ``You have
available to you a global, worldwide selection, and that is perhaps
the real advantage'' of Web shopping, said Kurt Barnard, president
of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a forecasting business in Upper
Montclair, N.J., who added that so many choices could be
paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fancy going through a department store looking for a blouse,
like Macy's on 34th Street, carrying nothing other than blouses
from the basement to the top floor,'' he said. ``It would not be
very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   But online shopping is not for everyone. It can be more
time-consuming than a simple trip to a local store, especially if
delivery times are considered. Some items, particularly brand-new
ones, have limited availability and no discount. The marketplace
changes from day to day, it is lonesome and impersonal, and it can
be slower than a left-turn exit lane from the mall at 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And while 54 percent of American businesses have a Web page,
according to a study this year by the Simmons Market Research
Bureau, there are some items that lose something in the translation
to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tupperware is really discouraging people from setting up Web
sites because they want people to burp the Tupperware, to feel
it,'' said Michael Solomon, a professor of consumer behavior at
Auburn University. And it is harder to generate peer pressure to
buy from a Web site than from a kaffeeklatsch.
</P>
<P>
   Without some serious revision, he said, the Web will lose out on
the buying potential of a whole breed of shoppers: those who travel
in packs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go shopping in groups, they buy more than when
they're on their own,'' Solomon said. ``Until you can simulate
that, you're losing some sales potential.'' He suggested the
creation of a Virtual Shopping Partner to say, ``Go ahead, treat
yourself.'' After all, shoppers separated from their peers are less
vulnerable to making spontaneous, serendipitous purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people going with you, the more likely you are to be
taken to places you wouldn't go to on your own,'' he said. A
partial fix would ``program some spontaneity in these sites,'' he
said, maybe by having them pipe up with random suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   McQuivey, at Forrester, said some sites are already catching on
to the social needs of surfing shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just want to transact,'' he said. ``We like being
with people, and having that interchange, the feeling of people
being with us. So when we go to Amazon.com we can read what
everybody else thinks about a book. The site is putting people in
touch with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon noted that Internet shopping can emphasize the gap
between the haves and the have-nots. ``Poor people are obviously
not going to avail themselves of these things, which is ironic
because they have the most to gain because of their limited access
to stores in urban neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even though physically disabled people and the elderly have
a great deal to gain from the convenience of shopping on line, he
said, ``these are the people that right now are the most
Web-averse.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another flaw in shopping-by-surfing comes from unrealistic
expectations, some analysts say. On-line shoppers looking for
instant gratification become disappointed when they discover the
World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   McQuivey not only studies online shopping; he also does it.
``When I'm on line I have illusions of getting perfect information,
that I'm going to go to Junglee on Yahoo and find all the jeans
that are going to fit me,'' he said, referring to a shopping
software robot that searches a large number of stores. ``When I
surf to Slate's Web site, I get so ticked off when I can't find any
way to locate the pants I want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really got mad at them on line'' _ until he remembered that
he could easily have gone all the way to a store and found that the
slacks were out of stock without feeling quite so wronged.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not unreasonable to think that with such
comprehensive information, educated E-consumers would be able to
find killer bargains and that anyone charging above wholesale would
be gradually pushed out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a boon for consumers?'' Barnard said. ``Theoretically,
but only theoretically. Prices on the Internet have not proven to
be exactly bargains, but to the extent that they are, our own
research has shown that the costs of shipping, mailing and handling
seem to obliterate whatever price difference there may be between
the Internet and brick-and-mortar stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Services like Priceline, a travel site at which consumers name
the price they are willing to pay for an air fare, are
``theoretically the best thing since sliced bread,'' McQuivey said,
but not the economic model of the future. Besides, when consumers
name a price that is higher than the value of the item for sale,
they lose out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy to turn the whole thing upside down to let
the consumer name the price,'' he said. ``I don't see that becoming
a major model for trading goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Key in Berwyn, Ill., says conventional pricing will have
to change. He has bought everything from rare stamps to a 65-gallon
rain barrel on line, usually for less than he would have paid
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the margin of profit in regular retail is going to
have to go down, and stores are going to have to be pulling people
in with sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts predict that Internet shopping will simply
attract the same kind of customers who use mail-order catalogs,
others think it will draw more people into new marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy CDs like candy, but never at the mall, because the
18-year-old kid behind the counter is going to make fun of me if I
put down the CD I want, say, John Tesh,'' McQuivey said. ``Plus
they are playing horrible music by somebody called the Fumbling
Planets. Where's my space in that store?''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows his place in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can listen to selections on line, and I can't do that in the
store,'' McQuivey said. ``I can't take the shrink wrap off there.
The point is, the potential to expand the total market is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the modern store's days are numbered? Will the
kindly yarn shop owner be available when a customer has dropped
seven stitches and can't pick them up? Will Salvation Army minions
ring their bells in empty streets at Christmas, and the malls be
leveled into soccer fields?
</P>
<P>
   Faith Hope Consolo, senior managing director of Garrick-Aug
Worldwide, a large retail leasing firm, doubts that E-retail can
conquer traditional retail. ``Tourists, they'll never do Web
shopping, and your ladies who lunch will never do Web shopping,''
she said. ``I really think it takes the touchy-feely out of the
whole experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barnard said he thinks obsolescence for some stores is a
possibility. ``I can easily see that groceries could perhaps become
the victims of the Internet,'' he said, ``which would be a pity.''
And without stores, he wondered, how would people be exposed to new
products?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very often people are attracted just by the package of the
thing, where they can take it off the shelf, hold it in their
hand,'' Barnard said. ``That's not really going to be possible on
the Internet, the way we know it at this time.'' But today's Web
technology is comparable to the dial telephone, he said, and
advances will very likely change the online marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   So why not a scratch-and-sniff pad on the desktop for sampling
perfumes? Or cyber-sandboxes to sink your feet into, so a distant
cobbler can create the world's most comfortable, custom-fit shoes?
An online makeover salon with an uploaded snapshot of each
customer, who could try on different hair styles and colors in the
privacy of home?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the horizons of imagination are the limit of what can
be done,'' Barnard said. ``You imagine it, and it will be done.''

THE ROBOTS THAT RUMMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of letting their fingers do the walking through the
Yellow Pages to get information from merchants, many consumers now
let a software robot do the crawling to find bargains on line.
</P>
<P>
   So-called softbots, or bots, are software programs that go out
to numerous Web sites at once and come back with search results.
They can reach into the more obscure crevices of the Internet as
well as regular Web pages. Think of it as a wild pack of
investigative reporters doing your bidding at a click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more useful bots is www.acses.com, which will search
about 25 online bookstores for the title you desire. It first
displays how many vendors have been polled and how long your search
will take. Its searches include foreign sites, so users in the
United States have to proceed through an extra screen to indicate
which currency they want their quotes in, but it is probably worth
the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The site provides a comprehensive listing, from cheapest to most
expensive, listing prices, delivery costs and estimated times of
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Jango (jango.excite.com), one of the earliest softbots,
presented quick information on computers and fragrances recently on
this user's first experiments with it. But the results could not be
replicated in later tries because of to snoozing servers or
shifting availability.
</P>
<P>
   Jango, which was developed at the University of Washington, goes
to several hundred stores and several auction and review sites, and
it can search the hidden Web (databases not accessible through the
common search engines).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really nice about Jango is you're contacting sites in
real time so you can get up-to-the-minute information,'' said one
of Jango's inventors, Oren Etzioni. ``That's important with stores
and essential with auctions. Others get the information once a
night _ every night you send a copy of your catalog to the softbot
_ which means the information will not be as up to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Another softbot, Junglee (www.junglee.com), provides six sites
willing to serve your shopping needs _ Web Market, Yahoo Travel,
Yahoo Visa Shopping Guide, Hotbot, Snap and Compaq, though it can
be hard to tell which one is best for a particular item. The Compaq
site, for example, has searchable categories ranging from apparel
to outdoor gear, as well as electronics.
</P>
<P>
   A downside to the bots: you do not always know if you are
surfing the entire Web or just the merchants who have paired up
with particular search sites.
</P>
<P>
   Jango is working on a version that will allow shoppers to do
one-click ordering from within Jango without having to go to the
store's ordering page.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the superbot that searches all these sites, then
searches your house or apartment to see what you really, really
need?

WHERE NEW DADS CAN GO ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a proud first-time father _ one too proud, perhaps, to ask
his partner or own parents about such tricks of the trade as
eliciting the perfect burp _ the shelves of any bookstore can offer
a stack of road maps, yet few written for anyone other than the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But any new father who chooses, instead, to cruise the Internet
in search of guidance and solace, long after mother and infant have
retired for the night, should be forewarned that the path is muddy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, punching the phrase ``new dad'' into Dogpile.com, a
compendium of various search engines, quickly turns up numerous
sites devoted to fathers seeking to win back custody of children
lost in bitter divorces. Hardly the sort of stuff that should be
occupying the mind of the bewildered parent of a 7-day old.
</P>
<P>
   Forging on, there is A Man's Life (http://www.manslife.com),
which, in its ``family forum'' the other day, posted a message from
a new dad seeking the counsel of others on how long to wait to
circumcise a new son. A thought-provoking discussion, to be sure,
but one that had difficulty competing with the nearby notices from
women advocating that their partners sleep in the nude. (``It
always leads to sex,'' wrote someone named Tahlia. ``And good sex,
at that!'') Again, probably not what the new father should be
thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   The web site of Fathering Magazine (http://www.fathermag.com),
would seem to offer few such distractions. The site contains
articles dating back to July 1995 on topics like ``Long-Distance
Daddy'' and ``Who Are the Child Snatchers?'' but virtually the only
material that is geared strictly to new fathers is poetry written
for them. One entry, ``Our Baby Is a Boy,'' by A.A. Talbert,
begins:
</P>
<P>
   Today we found out that our baby is a boy
</P>
<P>
   In spite of holding back our wish it charged our joy
</P>
<P>
   The doctor took a picture showed his beating heart
</P>
<P>
   And showed the little place at which his manhood starts.
</P>
<P>
   But just when all hope of finding practical help seems lost, two
home pages beckon, like warm bottles of formula.
</P>
<P>
   One, www.babycenter.com, has a special section devoted to ``new
dads.'' Its index includes such topics as ``How to bond with your
baby'' (two suggestions, from a new mother, of course: ``Take a
bath together'' and ``Have a staring contest''), as well as tips on
``Sex after baby.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a place to relay questions to experts and a huge
online store.
</P>
<P>
   If babycenter.com is like a Wal-Mart for new fathers, then
Raffaelle Borelli's home page is the neighborhood hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Borelli, an amateur magician and science teacher from the small
Canadian town of Portage la Prairie, 60 miles outside Winnipeg,
writes that ``being a new dad, I discovered there was a variety of
information available for the new father (but you had to look real
hard).''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I decided to do,'' he adds, ``was pool some of this
information together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Borelli, then the father of a new
daughter, Victoria, inaugurated the Web site Dads Den
(http://megamach.portage.net/rborelli/dads.html). On the site,
Borelli has organized his material under user-friendly headings
like ``Colic: how to deal with that dreadful crying'' and ``Diaper
rash: preventing it, and dealing with it.'' Under ``diaper rash,''
Borelli passes on such clinical advice as how to wipe a baby girl,
from front to back, to minimize the spread of germs and infection.
He also suggests using athlete's foot cream for rash relief.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending ways to distract a colicky baby, there are the
usual gimmicks, such as turning on a vacuum cleaner, but also a
recipe: ``Boil a half-cup of water with one bay leaf. Let cool for
15 minutes. Remove leaf and give to baby in bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Borelli's site has received nearly 21,000 hits _ and 300
questions conveyed via e-mail _ since its debut.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some new mothers out there, at least those with
computer-literate husbands, have been able to get a little sleep
after all.

SECURITY FEARS STILL PLAGUE CYBERSHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Mass.)   (af)

<P>
   While not many of the 19.7 million Americans who visited retail
Web sites from their homes in 1997 have reported problems with
Internet credit-card use, some surfers _ and security experts _ say
they are concerned enough about Internet crime that they would
rather auction off their firstborn child than use a credit card to
buy something on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Bailey, a computer security expert with Regence Blueshield
in Seattle, will not shop on line now. But he said he could foresee
a time when he might.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a provocative environment and lots of things
can fail, even with good intentions and best practices,'' he said,
citing some instances in which criminals have obtained credit-card
numbers taken from inadequately protected servers on the Internet.
``It's much more dangerous than people think. It's not the $50 you
get charged for each unauthorized use, but the crooks use this
information to steal your identity.''
</P>
<P>
   James McQuivey, an analyst in online retail strategy at
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said online security was a
problem of perception, not technology. Instead of bragging about
``SSL level 5 encrypted browsers,'' he said, sites would do well to
post slogans on every page like ``Worried about your credit card?
So are we,'' and offer a toll-free number for the electronically
timid to call to give their card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, some retailers will not store credit-card
numbers, or they assign identification numbers to their customers
for online use while keeping credit-card numbers behind a fire
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to see any big data warehouses get hacked,''
McQuivey said.
</P>
<P>
   But Molly Bell, an information specialist with a communications
firm in Washington, said she suspected she had been hit by a hacker
when, soon after using her credit card in January to sign up for
Compuserve, the Internet service provider, she had to contest
several unauthorized credit-card charges to something called
``XPICS Publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   When she called the company, which distributes pornography on
line, it told her there had been charges to her card from two other
e-mail accounts, neither of which were on Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   After two more unsolicited charges appeared in April, she
canceled her credit card and said Compuserve required her to give
her new card number unless she opened a corporate account for $75
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this confusion demonstrates just how easy it is for
someone to commit Internet retail fraud,'' she said after quitting
Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fiore, an online shopping guide for the Mining Co., the
Web search engine, said he had never heard of an online theft of a
credit-card number. But he said he was wary of person-to-person
sales through auctions or news groups when nothing was known about
the parties except their e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   He advised obtaining and verifying phone numbers, street
addresses and as much information as possible about prospective
partners in E-commerce, whether they are individuals or businesses,
and using an Internet escrow service.
</P>
<P>
   Such services as www.iescrow.com or www.tradesafe.com will, for
a fee, act as security middlemen, holding payment for an item until
both seller and purchaser are satisfied with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders in online auctions should be careful to research the
market value of the desired item so as not to bid higher in the
heat of the moment, he said. And beware of auction sites that do
not control the transactions and the products sold, as these are no
more secure than transactions with individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there are the more direct rip-offs, where they have every
intention of taking your money,'' he said, citing pyramid schemes,
work-at-home plans and offers to clean up credit reports. ``Now
instead of reaching thousands of people, they can reach hundreds of
thousands, through E-commerce.''

A MULTIMEDIA ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BLACK HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Louis Gates Jr., an academic all-star, chairman of Harvard
University's African-American studies department and a staff writer
for The New Yorker, is rarely short of ideas. But the inspiration
for his current big project _ a comprehensive reference work on
Africa and people of African descent _ goes back nearly a century,
to W.E.B. Du Bois, who first advanced the notion of an
``Encyclopedia Africana'' in 1909.
</P>
<P>
   Du Bois envisioned the project as an act of progressive
scholarship. ``He believed that you could help defeat racism if you
could codify the knowledge of the black experience, undermining all
sorts of stupid myths and prejudices,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has pursued the Du Bois vision in the same spirit, though
he also has technological and entrepreneurial ambitions. His
encyclopedia, Encarta Africana, is a collaboration between a team
led by Gates and Kwame Anthony Appiah, a Harvard professor of
African-American studies and philosophy, and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the multimedia encyclopedia began two years ago and
Gates has made no secret of his venture with Microsoft. Encarta
Africana is being formally announced Thursday at the National
Association of Black Journalists convention in Washington. The
CD-ROM encyclopedia will go on sale next January with an estimated
retail price of $50, after a $20 rebate offer.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1999, a text version of the encyclopedia is expected to
be published by Perseus Book Co. Yet if recent trends in reference
works, especially encyclopedias, are any guide, it will be the
multimedia version played on personal computers that attracts by
far the largest audience and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the multimedia encyclopedias have overrun their
print predecessors. The early multimedia works were limited and
often shunned as playthings by teachers and librarians. But such
products have improved greatly, partly because of increased data
storage capacity, links to the Internet and the migration of
traditional encyclopedia editors into the new media field.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta Africana will include 2 million words of text in more
than 3,000 articles and more than 2,500 multimedia entries _ video
clips, audio recordings and maps. ``It goes from early humans in
Africa millions of years ago to today, from Lucy to rap music,''
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   His subject, Gates says, lends itself particularly to the
multimedia format. ``Where African-Americans have excelled,
especially in the 20th century, are in the expressive arts of
dance, jazz and entertainment, which do not lend themselves to
text,'' he observed. ``You can write all you want about Billie
Holliday or Duke Ellington, but the only way to truly understand
what they accomplished is to listen to their music. Ninety years
later, the technology has caught up with W.E.B. Du Bois' dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also said that he hopes his multimedia encyclopedia will
help draw more African-Americans into the computer age. Several
studies have shown that African-American children are less likely
to use computers or have access to the Internet than other American
children. The main reason, of course, is that a higher proportion
of African-Americans live in low-income families and neighborhoods
than whites. But some research has also shown that even adjusted
for income, black families are less likely to have computers in
their homes than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he hopes that his multimedia encyclopedia can help
stir technological enthusiasm within the black community, as well
as efforts to put more computers in schools and libraries in
predominantly African-American neighborhoods. ``I want Encarta
Africana to seduce our people further into using computers and help
them become more computer literate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An early glimpse of Encarta Africana was presented to a panel at
the American Library Association's annual conference in June.
Initial impressions were positive. ``What I saw was very
professional,'' said Pam Berger, a librarian at Byram Hills High
School in Armonk, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In academic circles, questions have been raised about whether
Gates, 47, given his many ventures, would be able to give enough
first-hand attention to the huge reference project. Not a problem,
Gates said during a telephone interview on Wednesday from
Johannesburg, where he was finishing up the filming of a BBC-PBS
documentary series, tentatively titled ``Into Africa With Henry
Louis Gates Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry the articles with me on my IBM laptop, take notes and
get back to the writers,'' Gates said. ``I'm through about 1.1
million words by now.''

FORGET JOYCE; BRING ON AYN RAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Literature has certainly come a long way since it really
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the example of the Modern Library, which recently
published its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the
20th century, starting with James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' at No. 1 and
ending with Booth Tarkington's ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' at No.
100.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, critics and intellectuals would have dismissed
a list like this one as a cheap marketing ploy. Today, critics
celebrate the marketing smarts behind the Modern Library list but
confess that they cannot be bothered to read the great works
anymore. Once, we loved literature and scoffed at the list; now, we
love the list and laugh at ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library list has uncovered one place, apparently,
where books still matter, and that is the Internet. Concurrent with
its publication of the list, Random House, Modern Library's parent
company, established a readers' poll, where online visitors could
vote for their favorite works of fiction at
www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100best.
</P>
<P>
   If the Modern Library list represents the middlebrow
sensibility, the poll, which runs until September, gives a snapshot
of the literary tastes of the online community, what could be
called netbrow.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the poll has yielded a few predictable
trends, like a predilection for science fiction and fantasy, a
bizarre affection for Ayn Rand, who has four books in the top 30,
including ``Atlas Shrugged'' at No. 1, and a few mysteries, like
who is Charles de Lint and how did he get four books among the top
50?
</P>
<P>
   But the readers' poll does have its virtues, especially when
placed beside the Modern Library list. Readers who also use the
Internet, for example, seem less afraid of experimental fiction,
like Thomas Pynchon's ``Gravity's Rainbow'' (No. 8) and less
ashamed of big, historical crowd pleasers like ``Gone With the
Wind'' (No. 48) and ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' (No. 95), all of
which failed to make the Modern Library list.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the Modern Library entries were written before
1950, many readers' poll books were written in the last 20 years.
Only nine of the Modern Library books were written by women. The
readers' poll list, helped along by Ayn Rand, has 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library list has also been attacked for being too
American. The Internet list is, if anything, too Canadian, with
books by Margaret Atwood, Robertson Davies, various Tek War
novelizations from the Modern Library reject William Shatner and
the four entries from Charles de Lint who, it turns out, lives in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   And the readers' poll, however its voting may be stacked, is
free of the taint of self-interest. The Modern Library, after all,
has published many of the titles on its list and would like to sell
more. The bulk of the readers' list could be bought at the local
7-11.
</P>
<P>
   The real sport of the readers' poll site is found in the forum,
where readers defend their choices, attack other people's choices
and murmur darkly about Random House's attempt to filter out votes
for Howard Stern. (An unsuccessful attempt, apparently: ``Private
Parts'' was as high as No. 20 at one point.)
</P>
<P>
   In the forum is the kind of passion for literature that Random
House must have hoped to inspire with its Modern Library list.
Internet readers tend to be cranky, argumentative, a little
perverse and full of resentment toward the crushing weight of
history and good taste _ the attributes that were once ascribed to
modern literature. &QL;

   Q. My brother wishes to meet a writing deadline via e-mail while
crossing the Atlantic Ocean by ship. How is this best done from a
laptop, and what are the expected costs?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many large cruise ships have fax machines, telephones and
e-mail access for passengers to use. Your brother should call the
ship's operating company to find out what equipment is available on
board the ship he's taking and what software he might need on his
laptop to use various services.
</P>
<P>
   While most ships don't have e-mail access directly from
passenger staterooms, arrangements can usually be made with the
vessel's radio room to use a satellite modem with a guest's laptop
computer. Connection time will cost from $7 to $10 per minute.
</P>
<P>
   If your brother is taking a ship with fewer technical perks, his
options are much pricier because satellite access and special
equipment are needed. The transceiver that attaches to the laptop
and is needed to send and receive data via satellite, plus the
required antenna, can cost well over $3,000. That price does not
include access to an Internet service provider, and connection
charges can run about $3 per minute.
</P>
<P>
   More information on these marine devices is available on the Web
at www.elec-unlimited.com and www.landseasystems.com.

FOR CLANCYLAND, A GAME-TO-NOVEL PIPELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tina, Tom Clancy beat you to it.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, feeling the need to have his motors raced, so
to speak, the all-star author embarked on a new media venture, Red
Storm Entertainment, whose stated mission is ``to develop and
publish stimulating entertainment for multiple media.''
</P>
<P>
   With imperial backing from Pearson PLC, Red Storm produces
digital media projects that morph into all sorts of juicy ancillary
cash spinners: books, movies, board games, strategy guides, action
figures and other globally distributed merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Red Storm will release Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six
CD-ROM (for Windows 95, $49.95), a counterterrorism strategy action
game, with a multimillion-dollar cross-promotional marketing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the company's mandate for synergy, the PC game
will be released in conjunction with a hardback novel of the same
title, based on the game, also written by Clancy and published
under the Berkley imprint by Penguin Putnam, a book tentacle of
Pearson's media empire. Movie discussions are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to rely on one revenue stream,'' explained Doug
Littlejohns, a former British submarine captain and longtime Clancy
technical adviser who is now Red Storm's chief executive. ``What
we're trying to do here is approach the market with a broad aim and
establish Rainbow Six as a brand, of which the book is a major
component and probably the biggest money spinner. But there are
many other issues to contemplate. We're certainly going to do a
sequel. Having established the brand Rainbow Six, we'll be able to
extend the franchise even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other game-book-merchandise clusters are scheduled for
release in the fall. Behold, the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the Rainbow Six product line _ the game _ is
a classic piece of Clancyana, a geopolitical action thriller in
which the player leads a counterterrorism task force. Choosing from
a crack team of 20 skilled international operatives, each with a
unique skill, you assign the personnel and plot their military
advances on a blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   The game segues into high-adrenaline real-time action mode, and
you do your best to take out the terrorists, rescue the hostages
and get out alive. As the game progresses, isolated terrorist
incidents form the outlines of a more cohesive and sinister plot of
global proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these episodes is highly interactive, from the blueprint
phase to the crisis decisions and gunplay. But the story _ the
mission sequence and the culmination of events _ moves forward
along a non-negotiable arc.
</P>
<P>
   By stringing these self-contained missions, in which the player
has lots of control, into a modular story, the game creates the
illusion that the player is immersed in an interactive drama. The
enemy plot unfolds. Incidents acquire a critical mass and forward
momentum, and you are carried along.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to fail _ if you lose your sniper and your
safecracker in an early mission and you need those pivotal people
in mission 10, you're in trouble. But the story never branches. The
challenge is basically to get through it, to barrel through to the
end. It's as linear, in its own way, as a movie or a novel.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of computer game that is easily turned into a
Clancy novel, for the same reason that Clancy novels are easily
translated into films. These stories are not heavily psychological.
They're not scenic. They're not about language. They're about
action. They're driven by strategy and driven by technology _ there
is always something to pick up, fire, launch or drive, and an array
of buttons to push.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the characters navigate through these gear-laden
environments through a series of action sequences. It's not hard
for them to leap, as the bomb ticks down, from Clancy's literary
universe into the context of a computer game. Or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Rainbow Six,'' the novel, ``I started off with
the two principal characters, John Clark and Domingo Chavez, and
their thoughts, and how they're developing as characters,'' Clancy
said. ``Which is something you don't put into the game because the
characters are the people playing the game. But generally speaking,
they're faced with the same tactical situations as John and Domingo
are faced with, and they have to find their way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelizations are not new, of course, even in the computer game
world. This one just happens to be written by one of the most
bankable authors on Earth and promises to be the first book on The
New York Times best-seller list to be excerpted in PC Gamer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the CD-ROM stands to benefit enormously from the
publicity surrounding a blockbuster book tour. ``I think Penguin's
going to make me do it,'' Clancy said with a sigh. ``It's sort of
the literary equivalent of being held by Abu Nidal.''
</P>
<P>
   The author makes a show of stoically submitting to the ordeal of
it all, but methinks he protests too much. If there is any hostage
here, it's Penguin Putnam because, at this point, Tom Clancy is
running his own media company.
</P>
<P>
   Red Storm is developing other people's content _ Anne McCaffrey
just sold them the rights to develop her staggeringly commercial
fantasy sci-fi universe into a line of products.
</P>
<P>
   The company is releasing a volley of non-Clancy products in the
fall and has struck alliances with IBM, Microsoft and AT&AMP;T
Worldnet; the latter deal delivers Worldnet as the ``preferred,''
instantly clickable Internet provider to Red Storm online gamers.
</P>
<P>
   When your company is leveraging digital content and signing
telecommunications deals, you're not a part of the publishing
economy anymore. You're a part of the Internet economy. Clancy has
reached escape velocity. He doesn't need a publisher. He is a
publisher. He needs a distributor for the dead-tree version of his
product.
</P>
<P>
   But in a concentrated media industry utterly dependent on
name-brand stars, Rainbow Six is Clancy's pie to slice, and Penguin
Putnam can take it or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably one of the reasons why Pearson
invested in the company,'' Littlejohns said. ``They can see the
change in media. And here was an opportunity to work right across
the Pearson empire.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent tribute to its own media machinations, Red Storm
will be releasing a game entitled Ruthless.com in November. In the
words of Littlejohns: ``Ruthless is warfare in business. The back
story is that you are the CEO of a small electronics company. There
are five other companies in the game. One of them is called Evil
Soft. I'm not telling you where it's based, but it is the largest,
and it's trying to take over the world and crush you. So what you
do in Ruthless the game is all the things that every businessman
would ever like to do but can't because of law. So you can team up
with other CEOs, you can assassinate CEOs, you can burn their
buildings down, you can hack into their equipment, you can steal
their money. It appeals to the most base instincts of the average
businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy was quick to add, ``We're trying to make a movie out of
this one, too.''

   MASTIGOUCHE, QUEBEC _ Stripped to the waist, wearing long braids
and deerskin moccasins, Pierce Brosnan is no James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan, who recently portrayed that Hollywood staple, Agent
007, in ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' has come to this wilderness camp
two hours north of Montreal to shoot one of the feature films that
is turning Canada into Hollywood North.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Grey Owl, the Indian trapper turned celebrity
conservationist, in Lord Richard Attenborough's coming film of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by a lucrative mix of tax credits, enthusiastic, less
costly local crews and a depressed Canadian dollar, now worth about
68 U.S. cents, foreign investment has turned the Canadian film and
television industry into one of the busiest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Added to these financial incentives, a number of bilateral
treaties make Canadian co-productions a convenient way to sidestep
local quotas on imported films and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of treaties with some 40 countries, notably
excluding the United States, foreign co-productions also qualify
for a range of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A French-Canadian production, for example, is considered French
in France and Canadian in Canada, gaining access to government
subsidies in both countries and bypassing restrictions on imported
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, the Canadian government sweetened production deals
still further, giving tax credits amounting to 11 percent of labor
costs. This is on top of similar credits offered by the various
provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is now the third busiest production center in the world,
after Los Angeles and New York, according to industry sources.
Vancouver, where ``The X-Files'' and other American television
series are shot, is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario alone, a third of film and television programs
generated last year _ 56 out of 161 _ were foreign productions,
according to the Ontario Film Development Corp. Other provinces
recorded a similar proportion of foreign to domestic production.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, total production amounted to $1.25 billion in the
three most active provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec,
according to statistics compiled by provincial film authorities, a
rise of $250 million over 1996 figures.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment accounted for $540 million, or slightly less
than half the 1997 total production budgets within the three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and tiny Prince Edward Island
are getting in on the act, with a rising number of feature films
and made-for-TV movies being shot in these eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   All told, some 65,000 people work in film and television
production in Canada, according to the local film boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers save around 15 percent making a film in Canada over
making the same film in the U.S.,'' said Jake Eberts, a veteran
Canadian producer whose film credits include ``Gandhi,'' ``A River
Runs Through It'' and ``Grey Owl.''
</P>
<P>
   As a British-Canadian co-production, the Attenborough-Brosnan
film qualifies for tax breaks in both countries, amounting to
around $5 million to $6 million of the $30 million budget,
according to Eberts.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies for television productions are even higher, as much as
a third of production costs.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Paddington Bear,'' an animated series co-produced by the
Canadian company Cinar and the French television network TF1, 20
percent of the $9.3 million budget comes from Canadian subsidies
and a further 10 percent from French subsidies, according to Ronald
Weinberg, president and chief operating officer of Cinar. The
proportions reflect the amount spent on production in the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberts and other filmmakers say they also appreciate the
chameleon quality of Canadian locations, with parts of Montreal
able to double for Liverpool in the 1930s and parts of Quebec City
standing in for a European city in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen Paris a million times, London a gazillion times,
but we haven't seen Quebec that often,'' Eberts said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others point to the ready availability of experienced
crew members as another advantage to Canada. ``The crews are also
very good at doing things with not very much money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian director Norman Jewison, who filmed ``Agnes of
God,'' ``Moonstruck'' and other films largely in Ontario, said that
there had been a quantum leap in film production in Canada in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost impossible to make a feature film in Canada 20
years ago,'' Jewison said. He was one of the first to set up shop
in Toronto in 1978, converting an abandoned warehouse into a sound
stage and editing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Toronto is teeming with film activity, with the Canadian
Film Center celebrating its 10th anniversary promoting local
productions and talent and at least four studios churning out
special effects and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Animators graduating from Sheridan College in Toronto are being
snapped up by Walt Disney Co., Warner Brothers and other Hollywood
companies, according to Jewison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian talent that used to automatically head for Los
Angeles and New York is staying in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by this growing pool of skills, even Hollywood
productions are relying on Canadian filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to suffer from the `coffee-boy syndrome,' where the
Americans brought in everyone but go-fers to fetch coffee,'' said
Alan King, president of the Directors Guild of Canada. Now programs
like ``The X-Files'' hire Canadian directors, some of whom, such as
Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, have achieved international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the surge in Canadian production, films in
Canadian cinemas are overwhelmingly American. Only 1 percent of
films shown in English-speaking provinces and 3 percent in
French-speaking provinces are Canadian, King said. &QL;

 &HT;    Golden Bear stock remains frozen; shareholders file suit
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Trading of Golden Bear Golf Inc. stock
remained halted on the 28th for the same reason that a
shareholders' lawsuit was filed against Jack Nicklaus' North Palm
Beach-based company: The company said former employees falsified a
subsidiary's records, hiding nearly $22 million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was stopped at 2:45 p.m. Monday, July 27, on the Nasdaq
exchange, with Golden Bear stock (JACK) at $4 a share. It will
remain halted until Golden Bear can satisfy Nasdaq's request for
additional news, according to a Nasdaq statement.
</P>
<P>
   National Association of Securities Dealers spokesman Reid Walker
said it is typical to halt trading in a stock with ''material
news.'' Nasdaq's Stock Watch Department makes the decision, and
typically resumes trading after the news ''has been fully
disseminated over the news wires.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida in West Palm Beach, seeks class action
status for all of Golden Bear's investors who wish to join the
lawsuit. It was filed by the Pennsylvania law firm Schiffrin Craig
&AMP; Barroway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The case is simple. They misstated their earnings,'' said
Andrew Barroway, the attorney handling the case. ''We're basically
trying to get back the investors' money.''
</P>
<P>
   The action came one day after Golden Bear announced it would
restate its losses for last year because it had discovered a former
manager had falsified records, hiding nearly $22 million in losses
of its Paragon Construction International unit.
</P>
<P>
   The company had originally reported a net loss of $2.9 million,
or 53 cents a share, on revenues of $67.7 million. The restated
loss will be $24.7 million, or $4.49 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Bear has said it began looking at the projects and the
books of its subsidiary, Paragon Construction International unit,
after it began losing some big deals due to disagreements and
delays. Paragon President John Boyd and three other executives left
the company in April before the review began.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Bear officials did not return repeated calls for comment,
and Boyd could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not named the employees it is accusing of
falsifying records.

<P>
   The Canadian director Norman Jewison, who filmed ``Agnes of
God,'' ``Moonstruck'' and other films largely in Ontario, said that
there had been a quantum leap in film production in Canada in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost impossible to make a feature film in Canada 20
years ago,'' Jewison said. He was one of the first to set up shop
in Toronto in 1978, converting an abandoned warehouse into a sound
stage and editing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Toronto is teeming with film activity, with the Canadian
Film Center celebrating its 10th anniversary promoting local
productions and talent and at least four studios churning out
special effects and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Animators graduating from Sheridan College in Toronto are being
snapped up by Walt Disney Co., Warner Brothers and other Hollywood
companies, according to Jewison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadian talent that used to automatically head for Los
Angeles and New York is staying in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by this growing pool of skills, even Hollywood
productions are relying on Canadian filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to suffer from the `coffee-boy syndrome,' where the
Americans brought in everyone but go-fers to fetch coffee,'' said
Alan King, president of the Directors Guild of Canada. Now programs
like ``The X-Files'' hire Canadian directors, some of whom, such as
Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, have achieved international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the surge in Canadian production, films in
Canadian cinemas are overwhelmingly American. Only 1 percent of
films shown in English-speaking provinces and 3 percent in
French-speaking provinces are Canadian, King said. &QL;

<P>
   MASTIGOUCHE, QUEBEC _ Stripped to the waist, wearing long braids
and deerskin moccasins, Pierce Brosnan is no James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan, who recently portrayed that Hollywood staple, Agent
007, in ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' has come to this wilderness camp
two hours north of Montreal to shoot one of the feature films that
is turning Canada into Hollywood North.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Grey Owl, the Indian trapper turned celebrity
conservationist, in Lord Richard Attenborough's coming film of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by a lucrative mix of tax credits, enthusiastic, less
costly local crews and a depressed Canadian dollar, now worth about
68 U.S. cents, foreign investment has turned the Canadian film and
television industry into one of the busiest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Added to these financial incentives, a number of bilateral
treaties make Canadian co-productions a convenient way to sidestep
local quotas on imported films and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of treaties with some 40 countries, notably
excluding the United States, foreign co-productions also qualify
for a range of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A French-Canadian production, for example, is considered French
in France and Canadian in Canada, gaining access to government
subsidies in both countries and bypassing restrictions on imported
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, the Canadian government sweetened production deals
still further, giving tax credits amounting to 11 percent of labor
costs. This is on top of similar credits offered by the various
provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is now the third busiest production center in the world,
after Los Angeles and New York, according to industry sources.
Vancouver, where ``The X-Files'' and other American television
series are shot, is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario alone, a third of film and television programs
generated last year _ 56 out of 161 _ were foreign productions,
according to the Ontario Film Development Corp. Other provinces
recorded a similar proportion of foreign to domestic production.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, total production amounted to $1.25 billion in the
three most active provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec,
according to statistics compiled by provincial film authorities, a
rise of $250 million over 1996 figures.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment accounted for $540 million, or slightly less
than half the 1997 total production budgets within the three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and tiny Prince Edward Island
are getting in on the act, with a rising number of feature films
and made-for-TV movies being shot in these eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   All told, some 65,000 people work in film and television
production in Canada, according to the local film boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers save around 15 percent making a film in Canada over
making the same film in the U.S.,'' said Jake Eberts, a veteran
Canadian producer whose film credits include ``Gandhi,'' ``A River
Runs Through It'' and ``Grey Owl.''
</P>
<P>
   As a British-Canadian co-production, the Attenborough-Brosnan
film qualifies for tax breaks in both countries, amounting to
around $5 million to $6 million of the $30 million budget,
according to Eberts.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidies for television productions are even higher, as much as
a third of production costs.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Paddington Bear,'' an animated series co-produced by the
Canadian company Cinar and the French television network TF1, 20
percent of the $9.3 million budget comes from Canadian subsidies
and a further 10 percent from French subsidies, according to Ronald
Weinberg, president and chief operating officer of Cinar. The
proportions reflect the amount spent on production in the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberts and other filmmakers say they also appreciate the
chameleon quality of Canadian locations, with parts of Montreal
able to double for Liverpool in the 1930s and parts of Quebec City
standing in for a European city in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen Paris a million times, London a gazillion times,
but we haven't seen Quebec that often,'' Eberts said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others point to the ready availability of experienced
crew members as another advantage to Canada. ``The crews are also
very good at doing things with not very much money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian director Norman Jewison, who filmed ``Agnes of
God,'' ``Moonstruck'' and other films largely in Ontario, said that
there had been a quantum leap in film production in Canada in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost impossible to make a feature film in Canada 20

<P>
   While she was the former Soviet Union's first lady, Raisa
Gorbachev was often villified in the press, both at home and
abroad. A strong, intelligent, stylish, articulate woman, she was
frequently criticized for her hemlines, her shoes, her sunglasses,
her ``willfulness,'' her opinions, her lack of a traditional female
demeanor _ and for having ``too much control'' over her husband,
Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton, in
fact, the Gorbachevs' longlasting relationship has been notably
egalitarian. Gorbachev himself once revealed in an NBC-TV interview
with Tom Brokaw that he ``discussed everything'' with his wife _
igniting a storm of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Only after becoming a sixtysomething grandmother _ and keeping a
high profile through activism in issues concerning women, children
and families _ has Raisa Gorbachev come to rank high in Russian
public-opinion polls. Today she is one of the most admired women in
her troubled nation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hillary Clinton, on reaching 50 and packing her
healthy daughter Chelsea off to college _ while keeping a heavy
schedule of activities on behalf of women, children and families _
suddenly began to rank high in U.S. public-approval surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Today Mrs. Gorbachev regards with almost motherly empathy the
trials of other first ladies in the spotlight, including those of
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted in June at the elegant Copley Plaza
Hotel in Boston, after Mrs. Gorbachev had received an honorary
degree from Northeastern University, where The Gorbachev
Foundation, a political, social and environmental think tank, has
its North American headquarters.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE MORRISON: As a Russian first lady on the world stage,
you were quite a revolutionary _ was that a strategy of some sort?
</P>
<P>
   RAISA GORBACHEV: The fact is that we really didn't have first
ladies, in the traditional sense of that term. In many civilized
countries _ say, the United States or Germany or France _ there are
laws or traditions or rules that set out the responsibilities and
rights of the wife of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, we did not have that. There were czarinas, there were
empresses. Lenin's wife surely had her own personality, but then
came Stalin, and after Stalin, we very simply did not have any role
for the wife of the head of state. No one knew them, they were
invisible and basically nonexistent for the society.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev broke with that tradition, and I was not just a first
lady. My problem was that I was the first first lady in our
country. And the problem was not so much my individual traits or
personal characteristics, but the fact that we had to create a new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you didn't take it personally, if there was criticism that
you were ``too much out in front''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. For example, in our country no one was concerned when
Nancy Reagan or Hillary Clinton or wives of Turkish prime ministers
came to Russia on a state visit. Everyone said OK. But so far as I
was concerned, given the patriarchal tradition of our culture, it
caused a very mixed attitude that I was a visible first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few people too were very proud of me, and are still
proud of me and say, ``We regard you as a person who enhanced the
dignity of the Russian woman.'' But there are those who grumbled
and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I wonder about a comparison of you and Hillary Clinton _ two
intelligent, educated women who had careers, and opinions, and were
criticized for not, in effect, altering your personalities to meet
public expectations after becoming first ladies. Do you feel
anything in common with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.

   A: I've been told very often that I resemble Hillary Clinton;
I've been told that in Europe. However I am older, I was before her
and I was the first first lady _ so maybe she resembles me. That's
maybe just a joke, a humorous aside, but so far as Hillary Clinton
goes, I have a lot of respect for her.
</P>
<P>
   I like that she has a lot of energy. I respect women who have
had a professional career. It seems to me that she is very
intelligent. I also like women who are dedicated. And some of the
things she has had to go through recently, I think, indicate that
she has a lot of pride and dignity. She is going through what is
happening with a lot of dignity and professionalism _ this is an
element of character one has to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the circumstances have decided that I was not
able to get together with her. There are, maybe, working against
that, political, maybe some other things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about other American first ladies you've known? I
believe that Barbara Bush wrote in her memoir that you were ``a
pretty package,'' or some such.
</P>
<P>
   A: (laughs) I like Barbara Bush, in a very different way. I had
an easy time with her. I mostly have an easy time with people who
are open, communicative. Barbara Bush is a very natural person, a
very outgoing person. She is as she is. And so what you see is what
you get. ``Heart on her sleeve,'' I heard that phrase. And I
believe she is that kind of an American woman. In a way, I think,
that's a similarity between the American and Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mrs. Yeltsin, I believe, met quite openly with Mrs. Clinton
in November when she toured Russia and the republics and visited
the capital of the Urals, in Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what we see here is that the tradition of the role of
the first lady has now been established. President Yeltsin is
always accompanied by his wife. In the past, wives of Soviet
officials never accompanied them on trips. She is with him, also
working in some charitable activities, opening exhibits, greeting
other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   No one is concerned, no one pays it any attention. She is there,
it's OK. The wife of former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also was
traveling with him and our people were no longer upset about it. So
I broke with the old tradition and created a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think Russia will ever have a woman president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not in the near future. A lot in our country would have to
change. It would be many years before a woman could be president.
Whether it is 10 years or more no one can tell, but I think it will
be more than 10 years. It would take a change toward a civil
society. Russia doesn't have a civil society yet. I would say that
only in countries where democracy is truly established, where a
civil society is truly established, can a woman become president or
prime minister.

Dolphins' head coach strolled off the field and, in his daily

 &HT;    Soccer coach hopes to clear his name with new trial
 &HT;    By Christine Stapleton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At the time _ with his wife's pregnancy
in jeopardy, his brother dying of AIDS and his business on the
skids _ Bruce Brian Wiita figured he was doing the right thing when
he pleaded guilty to having sex with a 15-year-old baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita, a North Palm Beach real-estate agent, said he is
innocent. But the 1991 plea bargain would let him keep his record
clean if he could complete 10 years probation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wiita says he didn't get what he'd bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   How could he have known that six years after he accepted the
plea deal, lawmakers would pass a law that required Wiita's name
and photo to be posted on the Internet? A law that required telling
his neighbors and the parents of children he coaches on youth
soccer and Little League teams that he had been dubbed a sex
offender? Wiita, 39, is trying to clear his name. He's hired a
public relations expert and adept lawyers. His lawyer has written
letters to probation officials and neighbors, warning them not to
spread misinformation, he said. And Wiita wants his day in court.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a judge allowed Wiita to cancel his plea bargain,
meaning the case begins again. Prosecutors are appealing, but as
details of Wiita's situation unfold, more questions are being
raised about how Wiita's case has been handled: _ Wiita was twice
arrested for violating his probation, a charge that normally
requires a defendant to be held without bond until a judge
schedules a court appearance. But Wiita was freed within hours of
each arrest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although Wiita was found guilty of violating his probation, he
still has no felony conviction.
</P>
<P>
   _ For his battle to withdraw his plea, Wiita hired Richard
Lubin, a friend of State Attorney Barry Krischer. After several
phone calls from Lubin, Krischer decided to take no position on
Wiita's request to take back his plea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Krischer, who had defended two of Wiita's brothers in criminal
cases before he was elected State Attorney in 1992, saw no conflict
in getting involved in Wiita's case this year.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors lose their appeal and are forced to take Wiita to
trial, they face other hurdles: the he-said, she-said nature of the
case, the victim and the evidence. The woman, now 22, threatened to
sue Wiita after he pleaded guilty. To avoid a lawsuit, Wiita paid
the woman an undisclosed settlement and she agreed not to discuss
the case, according to Wiita and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The baby sitter and her lawyer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would have to get a court order to force
the victim to testify about what happened at Wiita's home on Dec.
29, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the problem of the evidence. After Wiita pleaded
guilty in 1991, the evidence _ panties the baby sitter was wearing
that night _ were destroyed. Assistant State Attorney Darren Shull
said that shouldn't affect the case because the panties had ``no
evidentiary value'' since no semen was found on them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lubin plans to investigate whether his inability to have
his own experts examine the lost evidence hurts Wiita's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita's decision to withdraw his plea and reopen the case comes
after years of trying to avoid publicity. The only reason Wiita
accepted the plea was to avoid the publicity and stress of a trial,
Lubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita knows that his decision to go to trial now has brought him
more notoriety than if he had stuck with his plea deal and accepted
the notification law. Still, he doesn't regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably one time in life I rolled over,'' Wiita said
of his plea deal. ``This is a travesty and I'm not going to roll
over anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested in February 1991, his wife had already had
four miscarriages and was pregnant again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with various doctors and no one could assure us we
wouldn't lose another child from the stress,'' Wiita said in a
recent interview. ``Do you risk that for your wife?'' She later
delivered the baby.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1991, Wiita agreed to plead guilty to lewd assault and
sexual activity with a child. In exchange, he agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   _ serve 10 years probation
</P>
<P>
   _ pay court costs and the baby sitter's therapy bills
</P>
<P>
   _ have a psychological evaluation
</P>
<P>
   _ refrain from unsupervised contact with children unless a
psychologist approved.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita also won a concession: Probation officers would be barred
from contacting him at home or work and would have to rely on Wiita
to contact them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day I went to see my probation officer he said, `I
can't live with this,' '' Wiita said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1991, Wiita's probation officer said Wiita had
failed to report on time, make a weekly call to his probation
officer while on vacation and pay a fine, court costs and
restitution, according to a probation report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject has been arrogant, vindictive and manipulative
throughout his brief and unsuccessful probation,'' probation
officer David Denler wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Denler recommended revoking Wiita's probation and sending him to
prison for 10 years: ``It is clear that he believes society's rules
and court's orders do not apply to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. on Sept. 11, 1991, Wiita was arrested on the probation
violation charge.
</P>
<P>
   People accused of violating their probation are not entitled to
bond. Barring a special arrangement, most defendants are stuck in
jail without bond until a judge can schedule a hearing days _
sometimes weeks _ later, probation officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet two hours later, Wiita was free on bail. His attorney, David
Roth, made an arrangement with a prosecutor that was approved by a
judge earlier in the day for Wiita to be released on $10,000 bond,
court records show.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1992, the charge was withdrawn. Wiita's probation was
reinstated with new rules: Probation officers could now contact
Wiita at home and get written verification of his travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Wiita was wrangling with his new
probation officer, Martha Tyndal. Wiita had not done any of the 500
hours of community service ordered for his first five years of
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita was coaching youth soccer and Little League, but wouldn't
claim it as community service because his probation officer would
have to tell team officials of his case, according to probation
reports. Tyndal said she was ``not going to play games'' and set a
court date.
</P>
<P>
   At an October 1992 hearing, Circuit Judge James R. Stewart Jr.
told Wiita that ``he doesn't get to tell the Probation Department
what to do.'' Stewart also told Tyndal to file a violation report.
</P>
<P>
   Tyndal reported that Wiita had been argumentative and combative,
saying, ``He insists on doing things `his way.' '' Witta was
arrested at 2:15 p.m. on Oct. 30, 1992. By 4 p.m., Roth reached an
agreement with another prosecutor to set a $10,000 bond. Wiita, who
had been facing a weekend in jail, was released later that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Edward Rodgers, who has since retired, found that
Wiita had violated his probation. But Rodgers agreed to put him
back on probation and to withhold convictions on the original sex
charges and probation violation. He also ordered that soccer and
baseball team officials be told of Wiita's case.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer wasn't in office when Wiita was arrested on the
probation violation charges. If Wiita were arrested on those
charges today, Krischer said, he never would have gotten out of
jail so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the policy we put in place, everybody has to stay in
jail, go see the judge the next morning, and then we'll talk about
bond,'' Krischer said. Otherwise, ``the rich, white guys with
lawyers get out right away and the poor minorities would be stuck
in jail overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1993, Wiita received a psychologist's approval to
work, unsupervised, with children. He did well on probation for the
next four years, although he didn't like his probation officer
calling his home.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Wiita's new probation officer told him to have
his photo taken for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Web
site listing of sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   After his photo was taken, Wiita hired attorney Jack Scarola,
who wrote to probation officials. Wiita was not a sex offender,
Scarola wrote, and should not be on the Internet: ``We trust that
you will take appropriate steps to be certain that no mistake
occurs . . . an error would obviously be devastating to Mr.
Wiita.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials disagreed. Wiita's photo appeared on the Internet
and was posted in the North Palm Beach Police Department, where a
den mother escorting her Cub Scout troop saw it. Neighbors and
parents began to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita decided to move out of North Palm Beach and started trying
to clear his name. Wiita's wife, Cinde, said the family moved to
Singer Island primarily because their home was being renovated.
However, Wiita's probation officer reported that Wiita had ``moved
simply while he is in this legal bind, and claims when he untangles
the situation with community notification, he will move back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiita also hired Richard Lubin, a prominent West Palm Beach
criminal defense attorney, who in turn called Krischer.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer said he decided to get involved because Wiita's case
could set a statewide legal precedent. If Wiita was allowed to
abandon his plea, other defendants could also try to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Although Krischer had defended Wiita's brothers in a petty theft
case and a misdemeanor drug case before being elected, he saw no
conflict in getting involved in Wiita's case now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no conflict,'' Krischer said. ``He was never a client
of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Wiita _ who might have feared Krischer could have
gathered personal information about him when defending his brothers
_ ever ask him to remove himself, Krischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Krischer has requested excusing his office from prosecuting 15
cases this year, according to records from the governor's office.
Most are cases involving relatives of employees at his office. One
involved a former client, but none involved relatives of past
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Lubin planned to argue that the law should not apply to Wiita,
who had pleaded guilty but was not convicted of a sex crime before
the law went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a fairness issue,'' Lubin said. ``They changed the
rules mid-stream. It wasn't part of his plea.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true, Krischer acknowledged. But he said he would not
agree that Wiita could withdraw his plea. Instead, Krischer
instructed an assistant, Terry Nolan, to leave it up to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   On June 11, Lubin and Nolan went to court. Lubin told Circuit
Judge Harold Cohen that prosecutors would not block efforts to
withdraw Wiita's plea.
</P>
<P>
   But Darren Shull, another prosecutor assigned to the case,
arrived and objected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge ruled Wiita could drop his plea and set his
trial for Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Wiita said he's confident he'll beat the charges: ``If I thought
there was a chance I'd lose the case, do you think I'd risk this?''
</P>
<P>
   Four days after Wiita withdrew his plea, Scarola sent another
letter to Wiita's probation supervisor, requesting the correction
of ``misinformation which previously has been circulated, and to
assure that Mr. Wiita is not in any way identified as a sex
offender (or predator) in any future communications . . . ''
Wiita's photo has been removed from the Internet because he's no
longer listed as pleading guilty to a sex offense. Wiita has since
moved back to his home in North Palm Beach with his wife and four
children.
</P>
<P>
   He said his business is thriving and he still loves coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold him in the highest regard,'' said Peggy Rafferty, a
North Palm Beach mother whose son and daughter were coached by
Wiita. ``I think he's wonderful and hope he's around to coach my
third child.''

 &HT;    Photographer captures more than football at Cowboy camp
 &HT;    By Tyler Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ It was like the summer's mega blockbuster, but
even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In this red-dirt town, practically all 140,000 locals had
something to say about Dallas Cowboys football. Banners and
billboards everywhere. ``Welcome Jerry and the Boys,'' proclaimed
the sign in front of the Kleen Kar Wash _ pretty much summing up
the feelings across the community.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a week chronicling the Cowboys training in their new
camp. Once, it was a Wichita Indian encampment on a vast grassland
prairie; now it's a modern community with more than 39 fast-food
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The big event was at Midwestern State University, where the MSU
Indians hosted the Cowboys. Bivouacked in my little yellow dorm
room, No. 136 Pierce Hall, I started each day much the same: Wake
up to the sound of ``Mad Mark'' and classic rock on my new Kmart
clock radio. ``Freebird.'' ``Stairway to Heaven.'' I was on
vacation from carpet and cable. Cokes in the microfridge, bathroom
down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   There was more to photograph here than just sweaty athletes. A
whole gaggle of characters _ crazed fans, zealous community leaders
and regular guys _ was caught up in the extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   All geared up, I hit the door. Then POW!, the heat hit back. Not
counting Laredo, the Texoma area, as natives lovingly call this
region, was the hottest spot in the state with the heat index
reaching 110 degrees. Fans gathered at the practice field, piled up
like so many wind-blown tumbleweeds against the chain-link fence.
Nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon they had drifted in from all over. Sun-crazed
stargazers down from Lawton, Okla., and up from Archer City. Three
thousand of them. Carolyn Price-Woods, of Dallas, screamed at wide
receiver Michael Irvin and the Cowboys fans around her laughed.
Like some possessed preacher leading her flock, she screamed,
really screamed, ``Michael, Michael !!'' The playmaker, not 30
yards away, ignored her. Price-Woods' odds on a conversation with
her hero? An ice storm in August?
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the Cowboys' newest big man, second-round draft
pick Flozell Adams from Michigan State, was in trouble. The
335-pound mountain was perched on an orange cooler with little
wheels. It was an uneasy scene. The new millionaire rookie was
spent. Doubled up in pain, ``The Hotel'' hunkered down and tried to
suck in enough air and water to keep from passing out. You have to
be tough, he was learning, to play offensive tackle in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of the field, along autograph alley, a jumble of
serious 12-year-old boys was on station. As afternoon practice
broke up and football players walked their way, the grim task of
obtaining autographs began. With Emmitt Smith just feet away, Cody
Henderson's face kinked up as he tried to will the man in his
direction. But the most important sports hero on the planet walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Harold Bufford, a skinny, twentysomething working
at the 7-Eleven on U.S. 281, told anybody who would listen how
blasted he got at the big Cowboys pep rally Tuesday night. ``Yeah,
they was charging two bucks a whack,'' Bufford said. ``I should've
packed a couple of beers in my boot.'' Another local who was too
busy working to visit training camp, Bobby Zentgraf, owner and auto
mechanic at Three Sons Auto on Missile Road, had experienced some
of the Cowboys mystique personally. ``Man ... can they dance!''
said Zentgraf, referring to what he considered the best thing about
the Dallas Cowboys _ the cheerleaders, who had performed ``quite a
show'' over at Sheppard Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wichita Falls Country Club, a different scene prevailed.
Well-scrubbed real estate brokers and attorneys played 18 holes in
the ninth annual Cowboys Golf Classic. That's where I ran into Kay
Yeager, the Wichita Falls mayor and shameless promoter of Cowboys
vibes. On the third tee she talked about the spirit of community,
the excitement and the economic impact of ``a once in a lifetime
opportunity for a town this size to host a world-famous sports
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on campus, with practice over, fans gone and calm restored,
Sue Raagas, 43, stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes scanned the fenceline around the Clark Student Center
cafeteria where the athletes ate. Raagas watched over the players'
golf carts and talked about her role as a member of the event staff
_ a kind of gatekeeper, crowd controller and mother hen for the
team. Raagas used to be a chaplain at Parkland Hospital in Dallas.
Her job there was to help people die. ``People died in my arms, and
I listened to their last words. Many of these people were so filled
with regret,'' she said. ``They did not think their life would end
so soon; they had left so many things undone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Raagas decided to follow her dream. She loved the
Dallas Cowboys and wanted to be involved with them. Now, 10 years
later, she is a fixture with the team, doing a lot of small things
that make a big difference for players and fans _ like helping a
kid with a disability get Troy Aikman's autograph. ``I love this
sport and I love people. It's like being in the ministry,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Dixon elevated, Avery deflated in J.J.'s daily praise agenda
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Steamy summer heat. Two-a-day practices. The
crunching of pads and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to hear the words ``training camp'' and think of a
grueling, physical test. But this particular pre-season ritual is
more than that. It is a test of body and head. Especially with
Jimmy Johnson in charge.
</P>
<P>
   A reminder of that came on a recent morning when the Miami
Dolphins' head coach strolled off the field and, in his daily
interview session, made a point to pump up Mark Dixon, an offensive
lineman who has spent the past three seasons in the Canadian
Football League, and to tear down running back John Avery, the
team's first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Let the (mind) games begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about John Avery,'' Johnson said. ``He
can crack jokes with (the media) or do whatever. I'm not real happy
with John Avery right now. ... He doesn't have pads on. And he's a
rookie. And I'm not real happy with rookies without pads. Every
minute that he misses hurts our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent most of the first week of camp praising Avery. He
laughed when the rookie made a joke about his hair at the annual
breakfast. He smiled as he watched Avery burst through holes in
practice. He cut Lawrence Phillips _ and cited Avery's play as one
of the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, it seemed, had become Johnson's pet player.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Avery lost 6 yards on six carries. Worse, as far as Johnson was
concerned, he pulled a hamstring muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins players had Monday off. And on Tuesday, the rookie
from Mississippi wasn't ready to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day he misses is going to hurt his contributions to our
season early on,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, who during the first week of camp was easily the most
media-friendly player on the team, wasn't available for interviews
Tuesday. Dolphins media relations officials said he was
rehabilitating his hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Once Johnson's words make it to Avery's ears, the rookie won't
have to look far to find someone to offer a little historical
perspective on the sudden change of favor. All he has to do is turn
to the guy at the next locker, Karim Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago as a rookie, Abdul-Jabbar became a student in the
Jimmy Johnson Motivational Academy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Abdul-Jabbar held out, albeit only for a few days. Then,
once he arrived at camp, he sprained his ankle. He quickly found
himself No. 5 on the depth chart and a target of some Johnson
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about guys who are hurt,'' Johnson said at the
time. ``I talk about guys who are out there and practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before one pre-season game, Johnson walked up to Abdul-Jabbar
and said, ``At UCLA, you had a four-year scholarship. Around here,
it's day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   The message got across to the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned,'' Abdul-Jabbar said, ``is that you have to
learn to play hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has since admitted that some of the talk, especially the
notion that he might cut Abdul-Jabbar, was part of a motivational
ploy. Johnson, however, is a bottom-line kind of coach. And the
bottom line in this instance was that Adbul-Jabbar played hurt in
pre-season, started the first regular-season game and finished the
year with 1,116 rushing yards _ most ever by a Dolphins rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all motivate people in different ways,'' Johnson said
later. ``I made a mistake on him. I was skeptical about his injury.
I also was frustrated because I knew what kind of talent he had,
and I wanted to groom him to stay in the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as Johnson was expressing frustration about Avery
dropping into the background of the current picture, he also was
talking about a surprise addition to the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dixon. Front and center. OK, front and left guard.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that Dixon has moved to the top of the depth chart
at the same position containing Anthony Redmon, the former Arizona
starter that the Dolphins signed last week for a $600,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dixon) is really a steady player,'' Johnson said. ``He
doesn't say a whole lot. He's fairly quiet. But you look at
performance and start grading every play, and he did a great job
(in the scrimmage).''
</P>
<P>
   This is the flip side of the mind game. A player being built up.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, 6-feet-4 and nearly 300 pounds, is the second strongest
player on the team, having bench-pressed 315 pounds 17 times. Yet,
he readily admits that his weakness is his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's all confidence,'' he said. ``It's up and down
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it got a boost from Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read much into it,'' Dixon said. ``Who knows where
I'll be this afternoon. I might be back to third string or on my
way back to Canada.''

 &HT;    Spielman's choice reassuring to us here in Cynic City
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it was The Bridges of Madison County, the wholly
incomprehensible wedding of Clint Eastwood to a weepy chick flick.
Maybe it was Dale Earnhardt's admission that tears welled up in his
eyes on the final lap of his Daytona 500 victory in February.
</P>
<P>
   Something is happening to me, that's certain. Something soft.
Something too sensitive to discuss with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I'm talking to you, dear friend. Over the years you
have heard me grouse about what's wrong with sports, from the greed
of players to the arrogance of owners, to the epidemic of agents.
You have wondered, at times, who stole my parking space or closed
the elevator door in my face in order to summon up so much venomous
ink.
</P>
<P>
   Bless you for your concern. A lifetime in locker rooms, the most
macho environment this side of Parris Island, tends to shape a
personality. One laughs too loudly at cruel jokes, runs too quickly
to the sounds of a fight, pushes each hint of sentimentality out
into the open so it can be piled upon like a fumble or scored as an
error.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about the Chris Spielman story that fascinates?
</P>
<P>
   Here is a linebacker no longer on the Buffalo Bills roster. He
counts against no one's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   This is of Spielman's choosing, right down to the forfeiture of
$1.8 million that was due him this season. The Bills invested $8
million altogether to get Spielman as a free agent from Detroit two
years ago. It was money well spent on an unquestioned leader, a
player so intense that he showed up before the coaches at training
camp and was in full uniform before Bruce Smith was even fully
awake.
</P>
<P>
   Then it all changed last week with a visit to the doctor.
Spielman's neck, surgically repaired last winter, was fine. No
problem there. His wife, Stephanie, however, was in trouble. First,
a miscarriage, then a diagnosis of breast cancer. Sudden surgery
followed, with months of chemotherapy promised thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily this is where the coach steps in and offers that the
thoughts and prayers of the team go out to the player and he can
take as long as he needs _ three days, four days, whatever _ to get
things squared away at home and get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Spielman didn't wait to get a second
opinion from Bills coach Wade Phillips. Without hesitation, he
walked away from the NFL and into the real fire. Spielman decided
to sit out this season so he can stand up by his wife and by their
children, too.
</P>
<P>
   What choice did the guy have? According to the long-established
rules of the locker room, there is only one. A player plays the
hand that is dealt him. He plays on through adversity. He plays on
for the team, always for the team, and for the obvious reason that
great sums of money have been dedicated to his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   David Williams had no problem with that picture, earning a
starting spot on the Florida Gators' offensive line as a freshman
in 1985 and never relinquishing it until the conclusion of his
All-America collegiate career 46 games later. The picture changed,
however, when Williams' wife became pregnant in 1993. The big man
blew off his obligation to the Houston Oilers, skipping a game in
order to be present at the birth of his son. One-sixteenth of his
annual salary, Williams figured, was a small price to pay for a
once-in-a-lifetime family miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is out of the league now, cut by the New York Jets in
June. Sooner or later it was bound to happen. Credit him with
knowing that life's other landmarks aren't so predictable.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening to me is a growing desire to run, screaming,
from sordid tales of players losing control of their lives and
toward quiet, calming stories like these. No longer will I
entertain, even for a moment, the boyhood fantasy of being a sports
superstar. The price is too high.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of real men, like Chris Spielman, is too low.

PROBE IN CLEVELAND RAISES NEW CONCERN OVER SAN FRANCISCO HOUSING
CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Department of Housing and Urban Development
has suspended the head of the public housing agency in Cleveland,
raising questions about her former assistant who went on to direct
the housing authority in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, HUD said it was sanctioning Claire Freeman-McCown
over her alleged use of public funds to pay for her own private
townhouse while head of public housing in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Davis, who has headed the San Francisco Housing Authority
since November 1996, was a trusted lieutenant to Freeman-McCown at
the Cleveland agency and Utah corporate records show he was
registered as a manager and member of her private business.
</P>
<P>
   Davis denies ever doing any business with Freeman-McCown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We independently started our own companies,'' Davis said.
``I've never done business with her.''
</P>
<P>
   But records show that, while they worked as the top two managers
of Cleveland's low-income housing in 1996, Freeman-McCown and Davis
signed papers to register a limited corporation in the name of
Claire E. Freeman in Mapleton, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Documents provided by the Utah Department of Commerce list
Freeman and Davis as the only members and managers of the company,
which was suspended from the Utah corporate rolls in March because
no annual report was filed. Davis said he believed the registration
information was a mistake. But even if he did sign the registration
papers, he said, he never did any business with the company.
</P>
<P>
   From the records, it is not clear whether any work was ever done
by the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   However, current and former housing officials say they remember
Freeman-McCown and Davis seeking jobs as consultants to other
housing authorities, including San Francisco's, prior to the time
the corporation was formed.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Leland Yee has demanded an audit of the
San Francisco Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they would want to do consulting after they
leave their jobs doesn't bother me,'' he said. ``What raises a red
flag for me is the idea that the two of them had a conflicted
relationship while they were public servants.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Noga, spokeswoman for the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing
Authority in Cleveland, where Davis and Freeman-McCown worked, said
she believed their contracts had allowed them to work as
consultants elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' contract with the San Francisco Housing Authority allows
him to work as a consultant, as long as the work does not conflict
with his responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The housing authority Freeman-McCown and Davis managed had been
named the most improved large city housing agency in the nation in
1994, and housing improvements made under Freeman-McCown there were
seen as a model of how to fix the problems of low-income housing.
The agency was touted for its innovative health programs for
residents, improved management systems and spruced-up housing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Freeman-McCown is under investigation by the FBI and a
grand jury in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman-McCown had already been placed on unpaid leave by
Cleveland's housing board in May, after the board learned that more
than $100,000 intended for housing the poor had gone to make
mortgage payments on her townhouse in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hinton, HUD's secretary for public affairs, said
Freeman-McCown's suspension would last until the investigations
were completed and any problems were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking this action to ensure the wise and efficient
expenditure of public funds,'' she said. ``Secretary (of HUD
Andrew) Cuomo's top priority has been to ensure the funds targeted
for low-income people get to low-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman-McCown's lawyer, Thomas Wilson, declined to comment on
the federal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported this month that
Freeman-McCown and Davis had moved more than $1 million in federal
money into an obscure fund and then allegedly used the money to
give bonuses and pay perks to themselves and other housing
authority employees. Freeman-McCown earned $403,000 in 1997, while
Davis made $368,000 during 1995, his highest-paying year, the Plain
Dealer reported.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said that all bonuses and incentives paid to him and
other staff members at the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority
were authorized by the agency's board of commissioners and
reflected ``a very small percentage of the benefit received by the
CMHA.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he had no comment on HUD's action against
Freeman-McCown, but said he believed his work with the Cleveland
housing agency was exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has no effect on my role in San Francisco as a public
servant,'' said Davis, adding that he did not believe the ongoing
FBI and grand jury investigations touched on his work at all. ``HUD
has not approached me with any questions about Cleveland.''

HEROIC ADVENTURES IN A SUMMER KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   Roger Welsch, the author of ``Diggin' in and Piggin' Out''
(HarperCollins, 1997), does the ``Postcards From Nebraska'' reports
on television for ``CBS Sunday Morning.''  
 (bl)  
 By ROGER WELSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, I brought my family to rural Nebraska and built a
farmstead from scratch. We bought an abandoned house for $350 and
moved it onto the land, but some things we had to build: a machine
shed, a garage and _ a summer kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The reason our little building in the backyard is called a
summer kitchen is that it's the perfect place to make tomato sauce
and at the same time to enjoy the rattle of cottonwood leaves while
dozing in a hammock. But the real reason I cook out there is that
my wife, Linda, won't let me cook indoors. Shortly after we built
our home, through some perfectly reasonable and logical events, I
somehow got fish guts on the ceiling of her new kitchen. It
happens.
</P>
<P>
   She colorfully called them to my attention the next day,
summarizing her commentary with how she would never again repaint a
kitchen because my extra-special barbecue sauce ate the paint off
the cupboards. And cooking utensils that look for all the world
like gardening tools do not belong in a civilized kitchen. And one
cleans fish outside.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to reason with her, suggesting that while it might be
hard for her to understand how fish guts get on a ceiling, it was
no less baffling to me how one would NOTICE fish guts on a ceiling.
I didn't even start explaining how the guys up at the town tavern
think my barbecue sauce is transcendental or that cast-iron pots
are wonderfully efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line was that my days in the house kitchen were over.
</P>
<P>
   Until not very long ago, a summer kitchen was a presumed adjunct
of just about any home. It was a small, one-room building that
stood behind the house, furnished only with a stove and chimney, a
table and some generous-size pots, pans, ladles and stirring
paddles.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional summer kitchen was the arena for heroic culinary
adventures rarely taken on today: canning hundreds of pounds of
peaches, assembling a threshers' dinner, butchering a hog and
rendering the lard or curing four hams and two slabs of bacon, with
room left over for stuffing sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was that a summer kitchen avoided filling a house
with heat and steamy, messy, smelly cooking; that if there should
be a fire from the wood-, coal- or cob-stoked stove, you might lose
the summer kitchen but not the house, and finally, that it was more
convenient to carry water and fuel (let alone hogs) to the summer
kitchen than into the house.
</P>
<P>
   These days I understand that Martha Stewart has a summer kitchen
at her house in Westport, Conn., and I imagine she has it equipped
with a Cuisinart, a fish steamer and a mortar for making pesto. For
most people, a summer kitchen may hold only the barbecue grill,
bags of charcoal and a supply of aprons saying ``A Man's Place Is
at the Grill.''
</P>
<P>
   The design for mine is modest, with decidedly random dimensions:
10 by 12 feet. It has a tile floor, a table, a stove, wood bins, a
cupboard and shelving. There is no need for electricity, and the
spigot at the house is close enough for water. After all, the
fancier it gets, the less it is a real summer kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of cooking in a separate building are obvious:
</P>
<P>
   1. Wood smoke. Wood smoke becomes part of the charm of cooking _
if you have a summer kitchen. I like the smell of wood smoke. I
like the taste of wood smoke. In my summer kitchen, I have the
smell and taste of wood smoke.
</P>
<P>
   2. Critters. See what happens when you try to store a couple
hundred pounds of hickory, mesquite and apple wood, corncobs and
charcoal briquettes in your household kitchen. Some nitpicker (I
won't mention names) is bound to say something about the dirt and
insects that come in along with such supplies, believe me. Not in
my summer kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   3. Capacity. My Great Depression mentality demands making
quantities of food as if preparing for a Russian winter. While my
indoor kitchen cupboards let me buy no more than two boxes of
Wheaties at a time, my outdoor kitchen has room for me to cook up
50 pounds of ribs at a time, 5 gallons of beans, 30 hams. Sometimes
all at once. And when I'm done, I can hose out the summer kitchen
with a rented power washer. Try that in the indoor kitchen. Which
brings us to . . .
</P>
<P>
   4. Mess. Cooking and eating are as close as I come to a contact
sport. I go at cooking and eating the way some guys approach the
martial arts. I know there is barbecue sauce on at least one of the
windows of my summer kitchen and a few still festering spots of
marinade baked onto the stove. There may even be fish guts on the
ceiling, but I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cooking odors. In the house, the aftereffects of cooking a
fish dinner seem to linger for days, eventually fading a week later
in the farthest reaches of the guest room. In my summer kitchen,
the aura of a garlic pie is moved somewhere beyond the county line
in at most a couple of hours, depending on the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   In my summer kitchen, I cook things even I wouldn't attempt in
the house. For example, I like lutefisk. You're not likely to see
that in print again: ``I like lutefisk.'' It's not the kind of
thing most people admit.
</P>
<P>
   Lutefisk is a Norwegian delicacy _ cod cured in lye (yes, lye),
then dried, stored until it is geological, or at least
archaeological, and then boiled down to a gelatinous, fishy slime
eaten with potatoes and butter. Believe it or not, it is even
better than it sounds. Problem is, lutefisk when cooking lets off a
certain tang.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never cooked lutefisk but have cooked kidneys, imagine
cooking fish kidneys. I don't cook lutefisk in the summer kitchen
unless the family is safely and well removed _ sort of like
Londoners sending children to Wales during the Blitz. In fact, a
lot like Londoners sending children to Wales during the Blitz.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is safely upwind, I fire up the stove in the
summer kitchen, cook up a mess and take it up to my pal Eric, who
runs the town tavern. I once made the mistake of bringing some
leftover lutefisk back home from the tavern, thinking my dogs might
enjoy it. They looked at it, circled it, smelled it _ and then
rolled in it, a remarkably candid culinary critique, even for black
Labs, who are noted for their candor. A summer kitchen lets people
like me cook things like lutefisk.
</P>
<P>
   I do not intend to provide ammunition for the gender wars by
suggesting a summer kitchen is a man thing. Nor would I for a
moment suggest that men have no business in a house kitchen (even
though Linda says that just about every time she looks into my
summer kitchen).
</P>
<P>
   But I can tell you this: my summer kitchen is the source of
comfort and joy for me and has resulted in some darned tasty food
over the years. No matter what the dogs think.

SEINFELD LIVE IS A BRILLIANT RERUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (OMAHA, Neb.) _ His short tour of the Midwest is a dress
rehearsal for a cable TV show he'll call ``I'm Telling You for the
Last Time,'' but a better title would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've
Heard This One.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian
Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on his old standup routine,
preparing for a finale in his hometown, New York City, that will be
aired live as an HBO special on Aug. 9. ``After that,'' he has
promised, ``I won't use that material ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, in the lovely and historic Orpheum Theater
(downtown Omaha's version of the Midland Theatre), Seinfeld
delivered a 75-minute medley of his greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, which seats about 2,800 people, was nearly full for
the second of four shows at the Orpheum last weekend. The Omaha
World-Herald , however, reported Friday that the event's promoter,
Contemporary Productions, had given away an average of 500 tickets
per show, mostly to local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cited the $60.50 ticket price as the reason for
slightly sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price, the familiar routines and a few rough spots
(his transitions need sanding and polishing), most of the crowd
reacted as if each joke had been baked fresh that day. Maybe, like
most ``Seinfeld'' fans, they're accustomed to laughing at reruns.
There were plenty of those:
</P>
<P>
   - On why men don't like to write checks: ``To men, a check is
like a note from your mother. A check says, `Sorry, I don't have
any money with me right now, but if you contact these people,
they'll give you the amount of money I wish I had.' ''
</P>
<P>
   - On bathrooms in airplanes: ``There's a slot for used razor
blades. What I want to know is, who is shaving on the airplane? And
shaving so much that they're using up razor blades. Is the Wolfman
on the plane?''
</P>
<P>
   - On the rubber divider at the grocery checkout: ``We use the
rubber divider because we don't want someone else's items
fraternizing with our own. The rubber divider is the universal
signal for `Back off!' ''
</P>
<P>
   - On the high price of candy at movie theaters: ``That's why
they put it in a jewelry case. You feel like you're buying a
diamond: `Excuse me, I'd like to see something in a Milk Dud.' And
then they bring you one Milk Dud on a black velvet pillow ...''
</P>
<P>
   - On pain relievers: ``Everything is `extra-strength' now. You
can't even get `strength' anymore; `strength' is off the market.
But for some people, extra-strength isn't enough. They need
`maximum strength,' which is like telling the drug companies,
`Figure out how much will kill me, pull back a little and give me
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   - On skydiving: ``What exactly is the helmet for? Let me tell
you, if you're skydiving and your parachute doesn't open, your
helmet is wearing you for protection.''
</P>
<P>
   - On dating: ``A date is a job interview that lasts all night.
The only difference: There's no chance you'll end up naked at the
end of a job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the evening, Seinfeld delivered some newer (or
lesser-known) material _ and more evidence of his comic brilliance.
Like few other comedians (a younger George Carlin comes to mind),
Seinfeld examines the enduring quirks and oddball habits that
afflict so many of us in the Western world. `Seinfeld' was more
about everything _ about so many of our common behavioral tics _
than about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as he talked about men and how ``in their own minds
they live lives of super heroes,'' he sketched this observation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of you have seen this: a guy driving down the street with
a mattress or box spring tied to the top of his car, and he's got
his arm out the window and he's holding on to the mattress _ with
one arm. Here's what this guy is thinking: If a big gust of wind
were to catch the mattress and lift it, breaking the rope, he'll be
able to hold the mattress to the roof _ with one arm _ and prevent
it from flying off the car. `It's OK; I got it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For his encore, Seinfeld spent several minutes taking questions
and a few gifts from his audience: ``Will you do movies?'' ``I
don't think so. You watch a bad movie, it only costs you two hours.
You do a bad movie, it costs you two years.''
</P>
<P>
   When a woman presented a bouquet of flowers to him, he said,
``Thank you very much. But you know what most men think (when) they
get flowers from a woman? `Oh, great. Now I gotta take care of
these.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He ended the show by following his own advice (to his TV buddy
George): Leave on a high note. After someone from the back of the
balcony bellowed, ``Hello, Jerry,'' Seinfeld let rip with a
``Hello, Newman'' that brought most of the house screaming to its
feet.

JAM MAKING AS THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ When life gets tough, the tough make jam.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have foreseen that the age-old practice of making jams
and jellies, an art that appeared to be dying on the vine, would
become fashionable again.
</P>
<P>
   But now, instead of a form of sustenance, it would take the form
of spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's Blue Jelly: Lost Love and Lessons of Canning
(Hyperion, $16.95) was my first inkling of what was to come.
Written by former Rolling Stone writer Debby Bull, I was lulled
into a trance by the cadence and rhythm of the writing as the main
character sought to mend a broken heart after a nasty breakup with
her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Her therapy?
</P>
<P>
   Making jellies and jams.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes, written in a narrative format, might tempt the
noncook to skip over them, just to get back to the next chance
encounter with the wacky Dr. Ruths of the world who offer advice to
lovelorn. But such wreckless action would take some of the
mesmerizing power away from this tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canning may sound like a strange path out of the dark woods of
despair, but all other ways, from Prozac to suicide, are really
hard on your body,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Why was I surprised when I went to buy Blue Jelly at the
bookstore that it was shelved in the self-help section?
</P>
<P>
   This summer's cookbook crop has yielded yet another
introspective look at the solace one woman finds in jam making.
</P>
<P>
   Well Preserved: A Jam-Making Hymnal (Fireside, $11) by Joan
Hassol is an account of how she uses jam to ``center'' her grief
after the death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relationship to jam, my soul, music and the world in which
I live. When I make jam, I slow down, my actions become more
rhythmical, my thinking clear,'' she writes. ``The repetitive
motions of washing, stirring, pouring, and labeling allow me the
space to think about my life _ what it means to be starting over
and how I can embrace this stage of my life with vitality and
joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, there are recipes, but they are intertwined with the
seasonal ebb and flow of fruit and the labors of life.
</P>
<P>
   Even if droves of brokenhearted souls don't rush into the
kitchen to sterilize jars or strive to learn the nuances of pectin,
I am convinced there is a small, but important trend crystallizing
here.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I now have hard evidence that jam therapy may work for
men who have loved and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that more men are participating in home canning
in part because they enjoy the process,'' according to a recent
press release by Alltrista, makers of home canning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The company goes on to note that one quarter of today's home
canners are younger men.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? A home canning set may just be good for the soul.

UPN, WB RECAST FAMILIAR FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PASADENA, Calif.) _ Whether you're running a big TV network or
a small one, the rule this fall seems to be the same: Familiarity
breeds content.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever accused the Big Three networks of excessive
originality, and certainly no one is doing so this year. NBC is
spinning new sitcoms that are based largely on its old sitcoms, CBS
and ABC are doing the same in the drama department, and all three
networks are cloning their newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising, however, is that even the No. 5 and No. 6
networks, WB and UPN, have fallen into the same pattern as their
more-established rivals. They are taking their current hits,
crafting careful approximations of them and then hoping viewers
will show up for these ``new'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of the WB, which seven months ago launched a new
drama called ``Dawson's Creek'' by Kevin Williamson, the creator of
``Scream.'' Praised as fresh and intriguing, the show gathered
months of advance buzz from TV critics and landed like a comet on
Tuesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Although low-rated in the overall Nielsens, ``Dawson's Creek''
and the WB's other two verifiable hits _ ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' and ``7th Heaven'' _ performed very well among the
network's target audience of viewers ages 12 to 34. These three
shows helped WB this spring to overtake UPN in the ratings for the
first time since the two networks launched in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This fall the WB is introducing more shows that will remind
viewers of their existing favorites. ``Felicity'' applies the
``Dawson's Creek'' template of young lust and heartfelt talks to a
college setting. It stars Keri Russell, a future heartthrob who has
not actually attended college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed'' merges ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' with ``Sabrina
the Teenage Witch.'' Shannen Doherty leads three sisters who
discover they have magical powers, and just as Buffy's powers draw
her into conflict with vampires, these three seem destined to do
weekly battle with warlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the WB's two comedy additions, one previously aired on NBC
(``For Your Love'') and ``The Army Show,'' which stars Dave Higgins
of ``Ellen,'' is an obvious attempt to update ``The Phil Silvers
Show'' for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Over at UPN, where a management shuffle and affiliate problems
have led many to question whether the network will survive this
season, the new fall lineup has a heavy sci-fi skew. Not
surprisingly, so does UPN's highest-rated show, ``Star Trek:
Voyager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercy Point'' features a dedicated medical staff caring for ER
patients _ including the occasional space alien _ on a hospital
spaceship. ``Seven Days'' combines the adventure of time travel
with contemporary events. Jonathan LaPaglia (``New York
Undercover'') plays a top-secret government agent who is
transported back one week in time to avert disasters and terrorist
attacks. UPN's Thursday-night movie is also expected to be
dominated by sci-fi features.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new sitcoms, ``Guys Like Us'' is organized around a
precocious child, ``DiResta'' around a stand-up comedian. Nothing
new there. The true wild card on the UPN schedule is ``The Secret
Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a contemporary political satire
disguised as a historical comedy about Abraham Lincoln's butler.
</P>
<P>
   One WB offering, ``Hyperion Bay,'' is geared more toward
20-somethings and could lift the network out of its reliance on
teen angst. Its creator, Joseph Dougherty, was a writer on
``thirtysomething'' and is a two-time Emmy winner.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of brotherhood and its potentially tragic
nature. Nerdy, withdrawn Dennis (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who played
Zack on ``Saved by the Bell'') left town after high school and got
rich in the computer industry. His older and more popular sibling,
Nick (Dylan Neal, last seen on ``Dawson's Creek''), wasn't so
lucky. Now, in a high-school reunion fantasy gone mad, Dennis has
convinced his boss to construct a new facility, which Dennis will
run, in economically bereft Hyperion Bay,.
</P>
<P>
   As with every WB drama, there's a love triangle here _ but the
person in the middle isn't a girl, it's the brothers' father.
Played by Raymond J. Barry, who also had father roles in ``Dead Man
Walking'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Dad is frugal with
his affections, and his two sons are still competing for them. When
Dennis returns to town, Dad fires up the grill and throws a party.
Nick deeply resents the breaking of taboo. It's the parable of the
prodigal son all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty had been noodling with the idea of writing a TV series
on the relationship between brothers when the WB approached him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them what I wanted in the show: no cops, no lawyers, no
doctors, no detectives,'' Dougherty said in an interview. ``At that
point, they either validate your parking or they're interested.''
</P>
<P>
   WB was interested and for good reason: ``Hyperion Bay,'' showing
at 8 p.m. Mondays, is a nearly ideal alternative to the sitcoms on
NBC and CBS, football on ABC and female-oriented ``Ally McBeal'' on
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In their fall season previews for the press held last weekend,
executives of UPN and WB differed sharply in their views of the
future of broadcasting _ specifically, their own futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough ad revenue to support the production of
seven nights a week for six broadcast networks,'' said Jamie
Kellner, CEO of the WB network. ``Even when we were in sixth place,
I said there wasn't room for six.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN's Dean Valentine, who suffered the indignity earlier this
year of having UPN thrown off affiliate stations in several
markets, including Kansas City, begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute WB or NBC or us doesn't have a hit show is the
minute that somebody's not going to be watching,'' Valentine told
critics Sunday. ``And the minute that you do have one, whether
you're coming on through the Internet or through digital (cable) or
through CBS, whatever, people will be watching you and paying for
the privilege of doing it.''

SNEAK-A-PEEK REVIEWS WON'T BECOME A TREND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Star-Telegram published a review of ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' which had its first Fort Worth performance
the previous evening in Bass performance hall.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, you say? News event happens, newspaper prints
story.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the ``Phantom'' review is significant, because the
performance reviewed was not the one the producers wanted reviewed.
The ``Phantom'' national tour and Casa Manana, the local presenter,
stipulated that no reviewer was to see the show before Friday
evening. That would allow the cast to have one dress rehearsal and
three performances under its collective belt before anyone with a
note pad and an attitude viewed this edition of composer Andrew
Lloyd Webber's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   (They needn't have worried; the review was a five-star rave.)
</P>
<P>
   What was our hurry? Were we sharpshooting, hoping the show's
vaunted chandelier would fail to crash on cue or that the Phantom
would trip over his cape? No, the Star-Telegram decided that
``Phantom'' is a sufficiently big deal
</P>
<P>
   _ a phenomenon, actually _ that its Fort Worth arrival should be
reported (and, yes, critiqued) immediately.
</P>
<P>
   This was an expensive decision. No press tickets were issued for
Wednesday's show, and none was available for purchase through
normal channels. The newspaper bought my ticket through a broker.
For the cost of that one aisle seat, we could have bought season
tickets for two at most theaters in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the audience Wednesday or Thursday last week might not
have known they were attending a preview. They saw a polished and
fully realized show, and they paid almost as much for their tickets
as Friday theatergoers did. A news release for the Fort Worth
``Phantom'' run states that ``performances begin Wednesday, July
22'' and that ``the press opening night is Friday, July 24.''
Tickets for the first three performances _ or ``previews,'' if you
like _ ranged from $25 to $65, compared with $27 to $67 for
subsequent shows. Not a major bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Is the instant review a trend? Is there to be a new breed of
outlaw reviewers who sneak into rehearsals? Will sports writers now
write game stories based on scrimmages?
</P>
<P>
   Calm down. Although we note that a production is technically
fair game for criticism if tickets are being sold, we support the
preview concept. Previews help actors sharpen their timing _
particularly in comedies, when pausing for laughter is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fully a play until it's in front of an audience,''
said Diane Anglim, executive director of Stage West in Fort Worth.
``A production needs that interaction of the audience and the
actors. It gives the director a chance to tweak and change.
Something might work in rehearsal that doesn't work with an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   However:
</P>
<P>
   ``A preview is not a rehearsal,'' Anglim is quick to clarify.
``At preview, our plays are always ready. They're at performance
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Eastman, artistic director of Jubilee Theatre in downtown
Fort Worth, said he prefers to keep the reviewing press away from a
new production until the third preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show needs to be worked in front of an audience to get its
sea legs,'' Eastman said. ``We give the cast notes after every
preview. And I can understand why a touring show like `Phantom of
the Opera' would not want to be reviewed at the first show in a new
city. The production needs to understand the space. Any number of
little things can go wrong in that first performance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons to have previews. Ticket prices usually
are lower, giving budget-minded theatergoers a break. Circle
Theatre in downtown Fort Worth, for example, charges $12 to $16 for
regular performances and $8 for first Wednesday previews. Jubilee
Theatre charges $5 on preview weekend and $10-$16 thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Discount previews also are excellent marketing devices. If you
score a ticket for half price, you're already in a good mood.
Unless you really hate the show, you tend to talk it up.
</P>
<P>
   (This is not the case on Broadway _ where preview audiences
usually pay full price. Because of that, advertisements must state
clearly that a Broadway show is in preview.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the preview strategy backfires. One local reviewer
attended the fourth performance of a new production at a Fort Worth
playhouse. It was a disappointing experience, and the review
reflected that.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the lead actor was ill that night _ missing
lines and disrupting the timing of other cast members. ``If only
the reviewer had come to an earlier show,'' the producer moaned.

REMAKE COULD BE EVEN BETTER THAN ORIGINAL `PARENT TRAP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Parent Trap,'' a romantic comedy, opens Wednesday and is
rated PG. Running time is 2 hours 4 minutes. Three out of four
stars.
</P>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ So is the remake of ``The Parent Trap''_ which
originally starred Hayley Mills as identical twins who switch
identities in a kooky plan to reunite their divorced parents _
anywhere near as good as the film that became an instant family
favorite in 1961?
</P>
<P>
   Hold on to your autographed 8-by-10 glossies, Mills fans. The
new ``Parent Trap'' may be even better than the movie you hold dear
to your childhood.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly shouldn't disappoint kids and parents looking for
high jinks, romance and most of all a good time together at the
movies. Such cross-generational appeal alone is a rarity in
live-action family films these days.
</P>
<P>
   While the new version wisely stays faithful to the plot and even
much of the dialogue of the original, it also has more laughs and
heartwarming moments than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Nancy Meyers (who co-wrote the screenplay
adaptation with partner Charles Shyer, just as they did Disney's
``Father of the Bride'' remakes) never falters in bringing an
overall gentle touch to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a kinder ``Parent Trap,'' retooled for the
sensitivities of '90s viewers who might find it just a tad
appalling that a divorcing husband and wife would dare to separate
twins shortly after birth. On top of that _ and here's the really
disturbing part _ they never 'fess up to either kid that the other
exists until years later after the two offspring stumble on each
other at a summer camp and discover their strange family secret.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to soften the blow is made in the new introduction,
which shows Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson (ably handling the
Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara roles) taking part in a whirlwind
romance, wedding and honeymoon aboard the QE2 cruise ship. The
inference is that, after quickly souring on marriage, the two are
too immature and foolish to come up with a better solution for
raising their infant children.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once you're over that psychological hurdle, ``The Parent
Trap'' easily lures you into its slickly told fantasy of two crafty
11-year-old girls who just want to get their parents back together.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's successful working Mom is more independent and
self-satisfied than O'Hara's stay-at-home variety in the first
film. And Quaid's Dad is more even-keeled than Keith's crabby man
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in the original, trouble looms when a beautiful and
despicable gold digger (Meredith Black) wants to marry Dad.
Valuable comedy relief is provided by Simon Kunz as Annie's
emotional butler and Lisa Ann Walter as Hallie's intuitive nanny,
who help the kids make their dream come true _ but they have to act
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, where the audience sees two kids there is only one.
Red-headed and freckle-faced newcomer Lindsay Lohan, with the aid
of superb digital effects, is delightfully convincing as the
down-to-earth Hallie, raised by her vineyard-owning father in
California; and the high-toned Annie, raised by her wedding-gown
designer mother in London.
</P>
<P>
   When the girls switch places to see their missing parents for
the first time and find out why they split up, Lindsay's expressive
eyes and lingering hugs say all that needs to be said about the
value of a child knowing and growing up with both parents. Lindsay,
an American, also has her two different accents down _ something
that the British Mills, despite her pluck, couldn't quite master in
the original.

NEGOTIATOR IS A MAZE WHEN IT COMES TO STORY LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator,'' a drama, opens Wednesday and is rated R for
violence and language. Running time is 2 hours 15 minutes. Two out
of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The makers of ``The Negotiator'' deserve some credit
for trying to stretch the fairly narrow parameters of the action
genre. Here's a film in which palaver tries to be as important as
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that director F. Gary Gray (``Set It
Off'') is still making an action movie. Every time the talk starts
to get interesting, he feels compelled to deliver a violent
sequence, lest the audience get restless.
</P>
<P>
   James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox's screenplay centers on Danny Roman
(Samuel L. Jackson), a hostage negotiator for the Chicago Police
Department. Danny is alarmed when his partner confides that fellow
officers have been ripping off a police benevolent fund. Before his
partner can spill the details of this corruption, though, he's
killed.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence points to Danny as both the killer and the
embezzler who made off with $2 million of his buddies' money.
Looking at certain conviction, the hostage negotiator does
something drastic: He takes hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Danny commandeers the police department's internal affairs
office atop a riverfront office building. Among his hostages are
his chief accuser, an internal affairs bigwig (the late J.T.
Walsh); the man's secretary (Siobhan Fallon); a longtime cop pal
(Ron Rifkin); and a petty crook and police informant (Paul
Giamatti) in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``Die Hard'' setup with police tactical teams and snipers
trying to break into Danny's high-rise fortress. Meanwhile Danny
uses the telephone to play mind games with the cops in the command
center, trying to determine which among them are the real villains.
</P>
<P>
   And he demands that he deal only with another hostage
negotiator, Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), whose impartiality he is
relying on. Chris will be Danny's eyes and ears in ferreting out
the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, like two chess masters who can foresee and counter
each other's efforts several moves in advance, the negotiators do a
verbal dance of jabs and feints.
</P>
<P>
   If this brief description sounds a tad confusing, be assured
that the film is knottier still. Indeed even the most observant
viewer is likely to get lost along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of Jackson and Spacey, both terrific
performers, ``The Negotiator'' isn't an actor's movie by any
stretch. Virtually all the characters are underdeveloped, the
narrative smacks of contrivance, and a lot of the details _ like
the behavior of the crowd that gathers outside the building for an
all-night vigil _ seem patently bogus.
</P>
<P>
   What the film has going for it is a fairly well-developed
atmosphere of suspense. Our hero appears to be in an inescapable
box. How will he ever get out?
</P>
<P>
   Director Gray, who is only 28, knows a lot more about cameras
and editing than he does about human nature or the way the world
really operates. But give him time.
</P>

WORKING HARD AT PLAYING ARCHITECT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When not working at the computer, I spend my time fantasizing
about renovations to the house my husband and I bought nearly four
years ago. Recently, for example, I began to fret over the mud
room. Knocking down one teensy wall to expose a staircase would
open up that whole portion of the house. It seemed so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't visualize it,'' my husband said. He had found me
in the mud room, waving a metal tape measure spastically in the
air. But then, I couldn't envision his fantasy home-improvement
plan: Replace the living room sofa with two stereo speakers, each
only slightly smaller than the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe software could save our marriage. After all, the best
programs behave like magic wands. Wave a word processing program at
raw text and, voila! Misspellings disappear. Tap the family budget
gently with a spreadsheet program, and impulse purchases evaporate.
I wonder if there is any problem that software won't eventually be
able to solve.
</P>
<P>
   The program that excited me this time was Sierra's Home
Architect, part of the Sierra Complete Home package. Earlier
generations of home-architect programs forced users to draw many
tedious lines to create a layout. Home Architect, on the other
hand, comes with preformed room icons. Within seconds of naming one
``mud room,'' I would be able to reshape it just by dragging and
clicking on its outline.
</P>
<P>
   But the feature of Home Architect that seemed most promising was
the ``three-dimensional view.'' After I had created a scale layout
of the first floor, my husband and I would be able to ``walk''
through the rooms by dragging the mouse. (I visualized him saying:
``You were so right, as usual. Why didn't I just listen to you?'')
</P>
<P>
   I consulted the 143-page user's manual and saw that I first had
to fit the room icons together to create the layout, then add
appropriately sized windows and doorways. Now, wait a minute.
Unless I was missing something here, I would have to spend hours
walking around my real-life house, measuring and jotting down
dimensions, before using the nifty virtual 3-D view the software
promised. Could this be right?
</P>
<P>
   I called Sierra for help. I tried not to sound too lazy, and the
company's spokesman, Chad Thompson, did not disappoint. Not only
did he assure me that the program was perfect for someone with a
relatively simple project _ ``a lot of folks use it for purposes of
changing around real minor stuff, whether it's just their furniture
or slightly moving a window over a few feet'' _ but he also gave me
a tip. Concentrate on the dimensions only in the area I wanted to
remodel. I could gloss over the rest for now.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Thompson's advice, I guessed at the sizes of most of the
rooms. I used horizontal and vertical rulers on the screen's
margins to size them. After an hour or so, the floor plan began to
look like my house. The only problem was persuading the program to
replicate faithfully the twists and turns of the proposed mud room.
After an hour, I settled for a shape resembling a Z with a wart
hanging off the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Next: doors and doorways. Who knew we had so many? Not to
mention windows _ I counted 31 on the first floor. And those little
window icons were willful, attaching themselves to the wrong walls.
Eventually, I mastered the technique of dragging them around
corners.
</P>
<P>
   By then, I had been working for more than three hours and still
needed to add a staircase. Clicking among suggested styles, I found
a staircase that resembled mine and dragged it over to the mud
room. I lost track of time as I tried to figure out where to click
on the staircase to get it to rotate properly to fit into the
space.
</P>
<P>
   At last, I was ready for the three-dimensional walk-through. I
dragged the mouse a few inches and was accompanied by the sound of
footsteps. The experience was slightly claustrophobic, but I
managed to suppress mental images of the Minotaur in his maze.
Starting in the living room, I moved through the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   I called in my husband. ``Look, if we go down this hallway, we
will be at the foot of the staircase. And then if we turn, we will
walk into a ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall,'' he said. ``I didn't know you wanted another wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I didn't. That was no wall; that was the wart. In the
three-dimensional view, it had evolved into an impenetrable dead
end. Frantically, I returned to the two-dimensional view to remove
it. But it seemed to be shared _ how, I don't know _ by two rooms.
I tried to resize the mud room. A second wart grew. If I had only a
few more hours, I was sure I could figure this out. After a while,
my husband got bored and _ ominously _ went downstairs to flip
through a catalog of stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   That was when I realized that Home Architect was not for me. Oh,
I can easily envision instances when this program would be useful:
for designing a dream house from scratch instead of trying to
massage a maze of 50-year-old rooms into a layout. Or maybe for a
full-scale kitchen renovation, for which you might want to
rearrange appliances and cabinets and work islands in a dozen
different configurations before settling on the best. The kind of
person I would recommend this software to would be someone with far
more patience than I, someone who likes to tinker with models.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the problem wasn't Home Architect itself but the
expectations I had for the software. At $49.95, Home Architect
falls into a nether category of programs, neither toy nor tool. I
am not an architect, so what folly of hubris led me to believe that
mere software could somehow circumvent all the training real
architects must undertake? What would I have turned to next _ brain
surgery software to teach me to perform home lobotomies? If my
expectations seemed high, blame the best software for raising them.
</P>
<P>
   Not that my argument dissuaded my husband, whom I found at the
computer a few hours later, tinkering with the icons. He had placed
two refrigerators in the living room.

MARKETS AGGRAVATE VACATION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ My goal in life is to go on at least one vacation
without a stock market swoon savaging the Heaster Hoard. It did it
again last week.
</P>
<P>
   Things began promisingly enough. The first two days on the road
were record setters for the Dow Jones industrial average, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index. The thought
occurred that this time would be different.
</P>
<P>
   But, nooooo. Last week's opening session signaled that
hoard-hitting history was about to repeat itself and by the next
day it was obvious the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   His Gloominess, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
exacerbated things by persisting in his lugubrious presentation on
Capitol Hill. Of all the discouraging things Greenspan said, what
analysts considered most critical was what he didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was hoping for a hint that a Fed move to cut
short-term interest rates was in the cards to help stimulate what's
expected to be a sluggish economy during the rest of the year. No
flicker of hope was forthcoming from the Fed chairman, and the
market's disappointment translated into a meltdown for a budding
summer rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrials gave up 196 points Thursday for its third
worst sell-off of the year and the sixth-biggest point loss in
history. Meanwhile, the S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq also got hammered,
although not quite as badly as the Dow blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, the Dow's loss for the week was 4.3
percent, and the S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq composite were both down almost
4 percent. The Heaster Hoard? It's impossible to say precisely
because no effort was made to benchmark it before embarking on R&AMP;R.
Calculations using some Kentucky windage, however, lead to the
conclusion that the 401(k) package, which /{is/} the Heaster Hoard,
got hit about as hard as the major market indices.
</P>
<P>
   The thought occurs that a sure-fire way to make a big score in
the stock market is to short everything when the Heasters hit the
vacation trail.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey! Who's complaining? That's what buying into the
American Dream is all about, right? And my experience is probably
not much different from most average individual investors trying to
ensure a measure of future financial security.
</P>
<P>
   The question for everyone shepherding a modest nest egg now is
whether to trim sail in anticipation of a major correction, or hang
tight and wait for the inevitable rebound that repeatedly has
restored investors to health during the roaring bull market of the
past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbles from the experts, it's worth noting, are sounding more
and more cautionary. It's not just that corporate-earnings
disappointments are proliferating, but some market watchers are
wondering whether this is 1972 revisited. That was the time of the
so-called Nifty 50 _ companies that Wall Street viewed as
can't-lose investments.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter that occurred over the next two years devastated
such conventional wisdom and put stocks out of vogue as popular
investments for the better part of a decade and a half. The
economic fundamentals are much sounder now, but one similarity is
what worries the experts most: Stock valuations are crazy in the
context of what can reasonably be expected in terms of growth.
</P>
<P>
   This has been troubling Greenspan for a year and a half, and
it's finally gotten to the point of troubling Wall Street, too.
Then, as if things weren't bad enough, the Heasters went on
vacation.

 &HT;    BLACK POPULATION RISES TO 12.8 PERCENT OF NATION
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ African-Americans' share of the U.S. population has
risen to 12.8 percent, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The black population, which totaled 34.2 million as of March
1997, rose from 12.3 of the total population since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In that period, the black population increased in the South, the
Northeast and the Midwest, and declined in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gain was in the South, where the percentage of black
residents increased from 18.5 percent to 20.1 percent. The only
region where the black percentage decreased was the West, where it
went from 5.4 percent to 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last year, there were about 8.5 million black families. Less
than half, 46 percent, were headed by married couples.

SAFEGAURDS PROTECT DRAWING POWERBALL NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (WEST DES MOINES, Iowa) _ The Powerball balls are prone to
turning yellow over time.
</P>
<P>
   But they're kept beautifully unpredictable. Any ball is as
likely as the next to fall to the bottom of a rotating drum, roll
down a tube and transform a tramp into a Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test them four times before each drawing,'' said Sue
Dooley, drawing manager for the Multi-State Lottery Association
that runs Powerball. ``Believe me, we check everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's biggest-ever jackpot will turn on a system of
double-checks and safeguards glitzed up in a small TV studio to
make the random selection of a handful of numbers seem almost sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pace will wear one of his two black tuxedos and stand
between a pair blinking $65,000 machines that will drop the winning
balls into slots. But other than looking handsome and calling out
the numbers in a low, clear voice, he hasn't a thing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Off-camera, Dooley will use a remote control to run one of the
machines while moonlighting Des Moines city detective Brad Wells
will work the other.
</P>
<P>
   They will only push their buttons, however, after Dooley,
auditor Kimberly Hembry and security consultant Wells spend another
evening scripted like numerous Wednesday and Saturday nights
before.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts to keep the fix out of lottery fortune take place
in a bland building of glass and white concrete just off the
junction of Interstates 35 and 80 in an upscale suburb of Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Knox it is not. No guards. No steel bars. Just a small
parking lot and a little landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we keep money in here,'' said Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Just super balls. When not dancing about on Saturday and
Wednesday nights _ they have a $250 million date tonight _ these
hard rubber balls sit in plastic briefcases locked up in, of
course, a vault.
</P>
<P>
   The key to one padlock on the vault _ actually a plywood room
with a garage-style door in the studio _ spends most of the week in
the trunk of an auditor's car. The key to a second padlock jangles
on Dooley's key chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right there with the rest of my life,'' said Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   The keys open the way to four sets of white and four sets of red
balls, four 6-foot ball-tumbling machines and a few volumes of
paperwork that only an accountant could love.
</P>
<P>
   Each ball bears a single number printed sixteen times. Squeeze
one and it feels like a slightly larger version of what children
play jacks with. They are 2 inches in diameter and weigh from
79.126 to 80.936 grams each (checked once a year at the state
transportation department in Ames, Iowa).
</P>
<P>
   Both balls and machines are picked randomly each night _ Dooley
has Wells pick numbered cards from her hand while Hembry takes note
of the selections _ and are tested to make sure there's no tendency
of one number to show up more than others.
</P>
<P>
   The trio confess to no superstitions. It's a casual affair,
usually conducted in T-shirts and jeans, or shorts and softball
uniforms in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   A small camera crew watches, and sometimes family members come
along for kicks. Last summer two regular players passing through
Des Moines for the Iowa State Fair asked to come and watch. No
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Dooley said, it will be the crew and a few reporters
and TV crews drawn in by the behemoth bonus. Wells sometimes
carries a gun to drawings, but he wouldn't say whether he'll be
packing tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their time will be consumed with paperwork performed at
a small round table, filling out forms and making telephone calls
to confirm numbers with lottery officials in Washington, D.C.,
Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, West
Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ratings should be high.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a gambling pot grown so gargantuan. Last year's
Christmas lottery ``El Gordo'' drawing, or the fat one, in Spain
held a $270 million purse, but its grand prize was merely $2
million. Powerball produced a $195 million winner in May that was
the biggest then.
</P>
<P>
   In Powerball, players choose five white numbered balls from a
pool of 49 and a red Powerball from a pool of 42 numbers. A ticket
costs $1.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times out of 10, the winner lets a computer pick the
numbers. So, are you wrong to string together your family's
birthdays with your golf handicap? No. Three in 10 people pick
their own numbers, and three in 10 winners hand-pick their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Word on whether anyone bought a winning ticket will come from
the member lottery states about midnight and confirmed officially
between 3 and 4 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically speaking, the pot should stop growing tonight
because somewhere between 85 to 90 percent of the 80 million number
combinations will be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people play when these jackpots build up like this,''
said Charles Clotfelter, a professor of public policy at Duke
University and the author of a recent book on gambling. ``There's
no better chance of winning _ that's still outrageously remote _
but it brings people out of the woodwork.''

BOOK TALK: `PRIVATE RYAN' REVIVES A GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Norman Mailer's ``Naked and the Dead,'' arguably the greatest
combat novel ever written by an American, the reader engages with
Lt. Robert Hearn through hundreds of pages, getting to know all his
real and psychological attributes before coming to this sentence:
``A half-hour later, Hearn was killed by a machine-gun bullet which
passed through his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stephen Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' arguably the
best combat movie ever made by an American, there is the same
brutal, sudden, absurd death _ but in this case concentrated
carnage _ that is, the chaos and reality of combat. Can a novel, no
matter how magnificent, ever have the visceral impact of a greatly
made movie? Will novelists try after this movie's popularity?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is very likely not, but in
``The Naked and the Dead'' and in James Jones' ``Thin Red Line,''
both novels of the war in the Pacific, there are roundelays of the
horrific on the killing ground.
</P>
<P>
   From Jones' book: ``His other hand, which was inside the
stretcher, was submerged to the wrist in an astonishing amount of
drying, almost jellylike blood which all but filled the cavity made
by his buttocks on the canvas.'' The soldier who observed this was
reduced to blubbering.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it's too early to tell whether novelists and would-be
novelists will get back to the graphic slaughter of war, but many
in book publishing believe they will, since the movie will
introduce a whole new generation to the spilled-guts school of war
storytelling. Indeed, there's already a slight indication that book
buyers might be interested again in World War II as it really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Soldiers'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), Stephen E. Ambrose's
nonfiction about the men who fought that war, will be back on the
New York Times best-seller list at No. 15 on Aug. 9. Ambrose was on
the roster as a consultant on the Spielberg movie, and his book was
previously on the list on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Mailer and Jones novels, along with Irwin Shaw's ``Young
Lions,'' were the three defining American combat novels to emerge
from World War II, and actually were nearly the last novels about
war (with the exception of a few Civil War and Vietnam novels) to
focus on human beings and the blood they spilled. Although the
combat genre goes back to ``The Iliad,'' in American literature
perhaps only Stephen Crane's ``Red Badge of Courage'' and some of
Ambrose Bierce's short stories approach those three in the
unquestioned truth of combat. Mostly in the 1980s and '90s, their
novels were followed by the surge of what can be called military
novels, which aren't usually about combat, in which technology and
deadly hardware are the real heroes, not men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, realism has different meanings for every writer. In The
New York Times Book Review on May 9, 1948, the reviewer wrote of
Mailer's novel that the vignettes of war depicted in it ``are a
triumph of realism, but without the compassion which gives final
authority in the realm of human conduct.'' Which was precisely a
point of both the novel and the Spielberg movie. On the piece of
land being contested, compassion can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview the other day Mailer recalled his war:
</P>
<P>
   ``Superrealism. I was in a war in which we never suffered huge
losses in combat like in Europe. I saw a hundred dead Japanese for
every dead American. Fatigue, heat, the oppressiveness of the heat.
We went out on long patrols to see where the enemy might be
located, walked 215 miles in heavy mud, a prodigious physical
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   And this wasn't the war he wanted to fight or write about. He
wanted to fight and write Private Ryan's war. (He hasn't seen the
movie yet, but will.) ``One of the ironies of being a writer is
that I always wanted to be in the first wave that went ashore in
France. And there I was in Fort Bragg on D-day and therefore I
couldn't write the great novel about Europe. I knew we were going
to the Pacific, and I was going to be stuck writing about what I
thought of as a minor war. I never realized I could have died on
that beach in Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   But looking through his retrospectivescope, Mailer said that
``hoards of people'' read his novel of the ``minor'' war, and those
of Jones and Shaw, adding: ``That's important because if hoards of
people read it, the American consciousness is altered. The Second
World War was a watershed. Everything is of it, before it or after
it. It is a point of reference. It's still my point of reference.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``the most powerful way to show death in a novel is
to dispose of a character in a single sentence.'' Hence, Hearn's
death. ``I stole the device from E.M. Forster's `The Longest
Journey.' There was this character, Gerald, as I recall, and I
turned the page from Chapter 2 to 3, and Gerald was killed. It gave
me an enormous shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Shock and reality. The historian, Ambrose, said of the unit in
``Saving Private Ryan': ``I tried to describe what I heard from
Company A in the 116th Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division. The
ramps went down, and 90 percent dead in a minute. That sounds
impossible. I remember crying when I wrote it, just bawling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no possible way I can do in a book what the camera
can,'' Ambrose said. ``A novelist like Mailer or Tolstoy can do it
better than a historian'' and ``it's powerful but not like seeing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's movie has been out there only six days, and
ever-quick book publishers have seen the opportunity and are
already trying to seize it. One executive said he was at a meeting
when someone wondered aloud whether the movie's popularity might
not ``provide a commercial opportunity'' for a gory Civil War
novel.
</P>
<P>
   And over at Doubleday they are popping about like jumping beans
over the dumb luck of having Steven Pressfield's ``Gates of Fire''
ready for publication in November.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is about the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. when
300 warriors of Sparta held back an overwhelming number of
rampaging soldiers from the Persian Empire for six days before
being wiped out. Now that was bloody. So much so that Doubleday's
advance publicity claims Gen. George Patton would have carried this
novel with him while attending to World War II.

ELEPHANT BECOME LONG-DISTANCE PAPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ The Kansas City, Mo., and Indianapolis zoos
are making history by making a baby elephant _ via long distance.
</P>
<P>
   The zoos announced Tuesday they have succeeded in impregnating a
female African elephant in Indianapolis with semen collected from a
male in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that an African elephant has been
artificially impregnated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be one of the most significant conservation steps for
African elephants in this century,'' said Kansas City Zoo Director
Mark Wourms.
</P>
<P>
   The American Zoo and Aquarium Association, which accredits zoos
and oversees species survival plans, also is excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fabulous thing,'' said association spokeswoman Jane
Ballentine. ``It's a huge leap.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the Kansas City Zoo has collected semen regularly
from Dale, a 20-year-old bull. The semen is express-shipped to
Indianapolis, where zookeepers have implanted it in ovulating cows.
</P>
<P>
   An ultrasound on Friday confirmed a 9-week-old fetus within
Kubwa, a 22-year-old virgin cow. Gestation for elephants takes 22
months so it is very early, but officials say the fetus appeared
healthy. The calf will remain with its mother in Indianapolis when
born.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 12 bull African elephants in accredited zoos in
North America, and Kansas City has two of them. Kansas City was the
first zoo in the world to manually collect semen from an African
bull, using a technique developed in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The program is managed by curator Bruce Clark, veterinarian Kirk
Suedmeyer and animal area supervisor Theresa Schawang. Much of the
funding comes from Friends of the Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Mo., has been working
with Asian elephants and last month announced the first successful
artificial insemination of that species. Veterinarian Dennis
Schmitt of that zoo has been working with both Kansas City and
Indianapolis on this project.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian elephant, now about 26 weeks into her pregnancy, had a
calf before. Schmitt said the African elephant pregnancy is
important for demonstrating artificial insemination can work in a
virgin animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the cows are in zoos that don't have bulls,'' Schmitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 600,000 African elephants left in the wild. The
current rate of poaching for ivory could wipe them out in just a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant births in zoos have been rare and not enough to sustain
a genetically viable captive population. Without any change, there
may be no captive females capable of breeding within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of moving elephants around to maximize breeding
opportunities are costly. Artificial insemination will allow
conservationists more flexibility in managing the gene pool _ both
in zoos and in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could theoretically go into the field and artificially
inseminate elephants,'' said Wourms. ``That means small populations
can suddenly become viable populations through long-term
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City also is working with the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha,
Neb., to develop ways to freeze elephant semen so genetic material
can be preserved indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kansas City Zoo, where a $71 million renovation earlier
this decade included state-of-the-art elephant facilities, the
successful insemination is a validation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of the largest contributions we have made to
worldwide conservation,'' said spokeswoman Denise Rendina. ``It is
a huge step forward and something our staff should be very proud
of.''

`THE MAN WHO WOULD BE CHIEF': A GHANAIAN-AMERICAN CALLED TO LEAD
HIS TRIBE

<P>
   Can an American human-resources executive and basketball fan
transform himself into a tribal chieftain in Ghana? Such is the
decision facing Sule Issifu, who after 25 years in the United
States is summoned back on the death of his father to the family
village of Nalerigu. His relatives, an extended clan, are demanding
that he keep power over the 250,000-member Mamprusi tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the Issifus (husband, wife and two daughters) are
Bill Kurtis and his ``New Explorers'' crew. While the camera
provides a travelogue of women with pots on their heads and dancers
in ceremonial garb, of long walks for water and an old slave fort,
Kurtis works at building suspense: ``A wrong decision would haunt
him for the rest of his life.'' ``They are two worlds far apart.''
All right, we get the point.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can sympathize with the Issifus, faced with a future
in what Kurtis calls ``the simple life of the Middle Ages'': no
electricity but plenty of illiteracy; no sewers and not many paved
roads; five or six wives to a man and no evident means of support.
</P>
<P>
   Issifu is determined to resist such allurements, but pressure
from the Ghanaian side of the family is strong. The program doesn't
throw much light on the hours of closed-door arguments _ ``a roller
coaster of emotions,'' Kurtis assures us _ except for an
observation by Issifu that none of his 18 brothers ``is capable,''
and all appear to be counting on him for some sort of livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings are held with the elders in ceremonial dress, and there
are horsemen pretending to be warriors; Kurtis changes his safari
suit for a colorful local smock.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, I'm afraid, is a touch anticlimactic. Issifu
agrees to be the chief, but avoids the shock of a return to the
Middle Ages by deciding to rule his chiefdom from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   How will he manage that? He says he will employ his
human-resources training to help his people shape up. Reassured?
Well, the new leader evidences at least one qualification for
leadership these days; he talks, like politicians around the world,
about bringing his people into the 21st century.

   Beneath the buttoned-down image of the television anchor beats a
little boy's heart. Lucky Peter Jennings, tieless Thursday night in
Hagerstown, Md., not only looks inside the Amvets, a team with a
chance to make it into the Little League World Series, but gets to
play sports announcer for the district championship: ``They go
ahead once more, nine to eight. With Mike Vaverchak at bat again
and runners on second and third, National has a chance to blow the
game wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can begrudge Jennings his outing, but what begins as a
tough look into Little League tensions, particularly between
fathers and sons, turns all soft with puffery about ``an American
rite of passage.'' At its best, when Jennings is at work as a
reporter, the program explores the values behind the cliches.
</P>
<P>
   He finds childish parents, driven coaches, unmannerly managers
and youngsters who are learning that winning is everything. The
program is a revelation as long as it keeps its eye on the people
and off the ball.

TOUGHER STANDARDS SET ON REPORTING HAZARDOUS LEVELS OF GRAIN DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Federal warehouse inspectors are examining grain
elevators a lot closer in the wake of the June 8 DeBruce Grain
explosion in Wichita, Kan., that killed six workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached late last month, federal warehouse
inspectors with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service
Agency now must immediately report potentially dangerous
accumulations of grain dust to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, which can order cleanups and levy fines for
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Two elevators in Minnesota and South Dakota already have been
targets for special OSHA inspections under the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   Farm Service Agency inspectors' findings of unsatisfactory
conditions, including hazardous situations involving grain dust,
previously were handled internally with elevator operators.
</P>
<P>
   Since late 1996, excessive dust was observed twice at DeBruce's
Wichita facility and was noted in reports by agency inspectors. If
such a federal agreement had been in place earlier, those findings
would have been forwarded to OSHA for corrective action and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mosteller of Wichita, whose son Scott was burned on 27
percent of his body and may lose some use of his hands, said the
crackdown in reporting might prevent future explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But Mosteller, who operates a farm and garden store in Wichita,
added, ``Grain elevators are not a new business. There have been
many deaths over the years. It's a shame families have suffered
because these problems weren't solved before now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they have to wait?''
</P>
<P>
   The June 8 explosion ripped through the DeBruce Grain elevator _
one of the largest in the world _ killing six workers and injuring
six others. Flammable, airborne grain dust is strongly suspected as
the cause of the explosion, although no agency has made that a
formal finding yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Service Agency's 58 U.S. inspectors are in Kansas City,
Mo., this week for scheduled annual training sessions, including
newly added lessons in how to apply the new interagency reporting
rule on grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki J. Hicks, a Farm Service Agency deputy administrator, said
Tuesday that it was difficult to determine when grain dust, which
is always present, reaches unsafe levels.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for North Kansas City, Mo.-based DeBruce said
Tuesday that the company had no comment on the new reporting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Farm Service Agency inspectors routinely visit grain elevators
and other agricultural facilities, but their authority extends only
to reviewing management and financial practices to protect grain
quality and the interests of grain owners.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors' written findings include observations of other
conditions that could affect the value of the stored grain,
including sanitary and safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive dust conditions at the DeBruce facility were noted by
Farm Service Agency inspectors in November 1996 and again last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Under previous procedures, those findings routinely were
forwarded to elevator owners for voluntary corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, Farm Service Agency officials said DeBruce
executives responded satisfactorily with pledges of better
housekeeping practices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new arrangement, any reports of unsafe grain-dust
conditions must be forwarded immediately by Farm Service Agency
officials to the appropriate regional OSHA office.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're not waiting for the paperwork,'' Hicks said.
Inspectors are instructed to telephone a supervisor, who then will
forward the information to OSHA the same day.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA then is to handle the information as a formal complaint,
triggering a round of special inspections and follow-up monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBruce explosion also was expected to be a focus of
long-scheduled hearings in Chicago and Washington this week to
review OSHA's 10-year-old safety rules on grain warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Such hearings are required each decade by federal law to weed
out outdated rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Carmichael, OSHA assistant regional administrator in
Kansas City, said his agency's warehouse rules allowed accumulation
of no more than one-eighth of an inch of grain dust on internal
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne dust is the cause of most explosions, he said. An
initial explosion disturbs layered dust, sending it airborne, where
it explodes in a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You minimize the possibilities (of danger) if you keep the
accumulated dust levels low,'' Carmichael said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Farm Service Agency inspectors examined 3,580
warehouses subject to federal oversight under the U.S. Warehouse
Act and the rules of the Commodity Credit Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly twice that number of elevators are under state
regulation, Hicks said. The Kansas Department of Agriculture last
month also pledged greater cooperation with federal and state
safety offices in investigating worrisome grain-dust situations.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks on Tuesday praised Kansas for its initiative. ``We
certainly encourage other states to follow Kansas' lead,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a former congressman
from Kansas, pledged last month during a visit to the DeBruce site
to institute the reforms on reporting grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Howard Goin, the last victim to be found in the
wreckage, isn't convinced that tougher reporting and more
inspections will make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goin, 43, has worked at the DeBruce site for 24 years. He
was not at work the day of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``OSHA can investigate to their heart's content,'' he said of
the new rules. ``But I don't personally believe that the dust was
that excessive (that day.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my dad in there. I'm not trying to stick up for the
company or anything. It was just one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the explosion happened, (the elevator) was as clean as it
had been in a long time. It was just an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elevators are that way.''

THE SHAPE OF FRUIT IN THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There, prominently displayed in the produce
section of a Westport grocery store, was a peach that looked like
it had been sat upon. Flat. Squashed. Majorly compressed.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently it had been done on purpose, because there were
hundreds, if not thousands, exactly like it in the same big bin.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it's known as a Saturn peach _ or a doughnut peach,
depending on what produce circles you travel in. It's in its second
season in wide distribution and probably available at a produce
department near you.
</P>
<P>
   After you get a good look at it, check out the price: 89 cents
apiece at the Mill Street Sun Fresh market, compared with perhaps
30 cents for the more rotund, and much larger, variety.
</P>
<P>
   And according to Ed Cox, the store's produce manager, ``We don't
brag about the quality of it. They don't have much flavor. They
just taste watery.''
</P>
<P>
   So why buy it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Variety,'' he said. ``People like it because it's something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are constantly tinkering with what we eat, but change
is a hit-and-miss proposition, to be sure. Take fruit, for example.
Breeders both private and government-sponsored are always crossing
one fruit with another, or different strains of the same, trying to
improve on nature, or on the latest human-made hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   Seedless watermelons, peaches with white flesh and fall-bearing
raspberries have been a few of the results. Plumcots could be
coming soon. Craig Ledbetter, a research geneticist for the federal
Agricultural Research Service in Fresno, Calif., is one of the
breeders who's been marrying apricots and plums for years in search
of a fruit that combines the best of both.
</P>
<P>
   Plums have a nice thick texture, he explained, and apricots are
appealing for their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could combine the plum's flesh density with the
apricot's aromatics, you'd have something pretty good,'' he said.
``That is my objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few offspring have been produced, ranging from ``things
that are very plumlike to things that are very much like
apricots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one hurdle yet to be scaled before plumcots are likely
to produced on a large enough scale to show up in grocery stores,
Ledbetter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although some of these are very beautiful and very delicious,
unless we have a selection that is able to make a grower some
money, the grower won't be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the plants so far developed simply don't produce enough
fruit, so ``it's just a novelty fruit,'' Ledbetter said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next couple of years a new variety of apricot known as
Robada should be in store produce bins, Ledbetter said. Its special
distinction: It develops its flavor a bit earlier than other
apricots, so that even if picked green, it will have some flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit-breeding has several goals, which are not always mutually
compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about any type of fruit crop, you want to
increase the season of fruit maturity, so there's a longer season
to pick the fruit,'' Ledbetter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second global objective would be resistance to diseases.
Another objective is improving fruit quality, getting higher levels
of sugar, lower levels of acids, more aromatics. The ratio of sugar
is what we perceive as tasting good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people prefer a high proportion of sugar relative to acid,
he said, with one marked exception: Asians, for the most part,
prefer fruit without acid.
</P>
<P>
   Catering to that market has recently become a mission of
fruit-breeders, Ledbetter said, and several acid-free varieties
have been developed.
</P>
<P>
   Some breeding efforts are aimed at cosmetic factors, he said,
such as fruit color.
</P>
<P>
   ``White flesh is becoming popular. It's marketing opportunities,
giving consumers choices.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a panoply of goals, however, breeders cannot always
take aim at all of them simultaneously. In fact, breeding for one
trait _ say, durability during shipping and handling _ often
detracts from another, say, taste and texture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nectarines that have little spots or freckles that
some people deem unacceptable. Breeders are saying, `We can't have
that.' Yet, it's pretty well-known that when nectarines have those
spots, they have very high eating quality,'' Ledbetter said.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, taste and texture lose out to appearance,
shelf-life and the ability to withstand the rigors of shipping.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Ledbetter said, ``I don't like buying fruit in
the store. Most of it's garbage. I work in a fruit-breeding
station. I get it here.''

   CALIFORNIA -- RIGGS. (Possible.) Congress is expected to vote on
an amendment by Frank Riggs, R-Napa, that would deny federal
housing funds to San Francisco unless it repeals a law that forces
companies doing business with the city to provide domestic
partnership benefits. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- BUDGET. When given the choice between tax breaks and
increased spending, 90 percent of people who participated in a
recent study said they would choose door number three -- paying
back the debt. And more than three-fourths of the participants
would include an individual savings account as part of any Social
Security reform measure. The study, by the non-profit Committee for
a Responsible Federal Budget, gave 850 people in five cities --
including Denver -- the chance to spend a day working through some
of the decisions legislators face in creating the federal budget.
Zaret

   CONNECTICUT -- HMO. Saying neither the Democratic nor the
Republican health care reform bills have enough support to pass the
Senate, a coalition of senators, including Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, today introduced a bill they consider a ``centrist''
approach to creating a slate of patient protections. Maggi

   MAINE -- WASTE. The House Wednesday approved a deal that would
allow Maine and Vermont to dump their low-level nuclear waste from
places like the now-closed Maine Yankee in a poor Hispanic town in
west Texas. In a 305-117 vote, the House approved the compact
without any of the troublesome amendments that had been previously

 By M. R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Zagol, a World War II paratrooper who survived D-Day, the
``Bridge too Far'' at Arnhem, and, as if that wasn't enough, the
siege of Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge, has seen ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' He's fine. Got bored after the gory part, but
stayed because ``my grandson wanted to see the end of the movie.''
That may be a normal reaction for men who survived the reality
behind the myth of ``Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories and reviews on ``Private Ryan'' have raised concerns
about the opening 20 minutes of the film with scenes so violent and
so accurately evocative of the landings at Omaha Beach in Normandy
on June 6, 1944, and suggested that veterans will attend the film
at their peril. Some veterans will be disturbed: The post-traumatic
syndrome counselors at the Veterans Administration are gearing up
for an increase in the number of vets needing some help in the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of those who are truly disturbed by the film will be
veterans of D-Day. Those who have lived this long (the youngest are
over 70) are the men least troubled by memories of carnage. All the
talk about those poor veterans who may go to the movie and be
brought to tears is, well, talk. A few may crack but most will not.
It was that way in the war, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parks, a former Boston school official, spent D-Day on Red
Beach, one of the messier parts of Omaha Beach where the carnage
imagined and re-created in ``Private Ryan'' really happened. Parks
is looking forward to seeing the film later this week and doesn't
expect that the violence will bother him at all. He's been there:
``You have to understand, this was our first combat, we were
unprepared for the noise of the gunfire, the men screaming for
medical aid, all those dead bodies. But it won't bother me now. You
see, you fall into a groove in your psyche after a while, you
accept that it's war, that people are gonna die, you may die, so
you do your job, take your objectives, but with caution. You don't
lose that. You're still in that groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagol, a 101st division paratrooper, remembers the beach in
Normandy vividly. His outfit, after the jump, regrouped at the edge
of Omaha Beach. ``Did the violence in the movie bother me? Yeah, it
upset me,'' Zagol allowed. ``I remember the bodies on the beach,
but you know, I was wounded a few days later and sent back to the
beach to be evacuated, and the Germans got some planes over us and
strafed the hell out of the beach; I slept right through it. I
don't think the movie's going to bother anyone who was there.
You've seen so much, how can it really bother you any more?''
</P>
<P>
   Zagol went to the movie because his grandson wanted to see it.
``Actually,'' he recalled, ``after the first 20 minutes were over,
the real part, I wanted to go home. ... I mean, it just wasn't
realistic. They were running around throwing hand grenades into
buildings, they weren't staying behind the tanks when they moved
up. It wasn't the war I fought in.'' As for the movie's basic
premise, that a whole platoon of soldiers would be sent into
disputed territory to find a single soldier and bring him out,
Zagol couldn't think of a better comment than a very audible
snicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell,'' Zagol asked, ``how many vets are going to see it,
anyhow? I go to reunions now, and you don't see anyone you know. I
was young then, the officers, the sergeants, they were older,
they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Parks, who farms in Southeastern Massachusetts, wasn't
planning to see ``Private Ryan,'' but he got a call from a talk
show host who was planning a call-in about the film. ``I thought I
ought to go,'' Parks related, ``so I'd know what I was talking
about if he does have the show.'' As a film critic, Parks is
generous. ``It was one of the better ones,'' he said, ``at least
not that John Wayne stuff, that Rambo stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part to watch, the worst,'' Parks continued, ``was
the beginning of the movie. My wife was funny, she watched it
through her fingers, and she was really worried about me, she
wondered if it wouldn't bother me that night.'' His experience
parallels that of Paul Parks and Zagol, that everyone has to find
that groove to survive: ``The worst of the invasion was right at
the start. You knew everyone, we'd trained together for years, you
knew the dead. Later on in the war, they were just serial numbers.
You get used to it.'' Ed Parks's war ended at the Battle of the
Bulge. Captured, he spent the rest of the war in Stalag 4B, south
of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   And he had the same reaction, if milder, as Zagol to the movie
after the realistic violence of the invasion turned into the
psychological docudrama of sending a platoon of Army Rangers into
harm's way to save a single soldier. ``The uniforms,'' he began,
``were realistic. But the middle part was, well, pretty good. I
mean, you never saw anyone dig a foxhole. My God, the first thing
you did when you stopped was dig. Movement brought artillery fire,
guaranteed, so when you stop, you dig. `Dig or die,' that's we
said. Another thing, if you wanted to make it realistic: No one
ever sat down and ate anything. You stopped, you ate. People
bitched about the Army canned rations, but you ate. And you dug.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parks, although eager to see the movie, is already prepared
not to like, or believe, part of it. ``Everyone tells me it _ the
war footage _ is actual, realistic. The thing they're telling me
that really bothers me is that the movie makes us out to be so
disorganized on the beach. How do you think we got off the beach?
It was the platoon sergeants _ most of the lieutenants got it right
away, they were obvious targets _ and the sergeants are who gets
you up and moving. Now,'' he summed up, ``if there had been
disorganization at that level, the sergeants' level....''
</P>
<P>
   Terence Keane, a psychologist at the Boston Veterans Hospital,
where he directs the National Center for Post-Traumatic Syndrome,
is not surprised that the veterans of D-Day are taking the movie in
relatively well-tempered stride. ``For one thing,'' he explained,
``the veterans that you can still find, still get ahold of, are the
lucky ones. The people who were most severely affected by the war,
well, they die earlier, you can imagine the causes, alcoholism,
heart disease, accidents. The healthier ones, that's who's talking
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane also offered some insight into why veterans and
non-veterans might overlook, or only mildly object to, the film's
banal dialogue and unbelievable story line. ``Beginning the film
with that terrible and accurate footage of death and destruction is
what we call a `prime manipulation.' It's something we've studied,
used, and it affects the way people respond in all ways,
emotionally, behaviorally, cognitively. What Spielberg may have
done is primed them to deal with very serious issues, and then
given them a bad film.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Keane expects that this film, like others before it, will
trigger reactions in veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress
syndrome. ``We can expect something like a 20 percent increase in
our workload, numbers of clients seeking help, over the next few
weeks. This has happened with every very popular, very violent,
film since `The Deer Hunter,' back in 1978. That's the film that
made us aware of the problem. `Platoon' was another one, so was
`Born on the Fourth of July.'''
</P>
<P>
   While films might kick up visits to the VA, they don't hold a
candle to true life. ``The Gulf War,'' Keane recalled, ``we saw a
greater than doubling of patients. That's reality for you.''

 &HT;    HEALTH GAP WIDENS BETWEEN RICHER, POORER
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans' health seems to be getting better, but
low-income families or those less educated aren't benefiting as
much, according to a government report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services found record high
life expectancy, with a narrowing gap between whites and blacks;
record low infant mortality rates, and declining death rates for
heart disease, cancer, AIDS and firearm-related casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The life expectancy for all Americans reached 76.1 years, with
males born now expected to live 73.1 years and women 79.1 years.
The long-standing gap between blacks and whites has narrowed to
about six and a half years, or 76.8 years for whites and 70.2 years
for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1996, the leading cause of death, heart disease,
decreased 12 percent from 1052 to 134 per 100,000 people. Deaths
from cancer, the second leading cause, declined 5 percent, from 135
to 128 per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1996, deaths from HIV infection, which causes AIDS,
dropped about 30 percent, from 73 to 51 per 100,000 adults aged 25
to 44. It declined from the first to the third leading cause of
death for people in this age group after accidents and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm-related deaths dropped about 20 percent from 14.6 to
12.9 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is improving in America along many fronts, and our
challenge is to share that progress as widely as possible,'' said
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in issuing the
annual report, titled ``Health, United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This comprehensive report shows the progress we're making, but
it also documents the strong relationship between socioeconomic
status and health in the United States for every race and ethnic
group studied.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found those with low incomes or less education have
more health risk factors _ such as a sedentary life style and
cigarette smoking _ were not as likely to have health insurance or
receive preventive care, and were more likely to report unmeet
health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   The report found:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cigarette smoking declined among adults 25 and older between
the years 1974 and 1995, but the decline was greater for more
educated adults. In 1995, roughly one out of four adults with less
than a high school education smoked, compared to one out of seven
who completed college.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low birth weight and infant death rates were higher among
children of less-educated mothers than more-educated mothers.
Mothers that did not finish high school were about 50 percent more
likely to have low-birth weight children than college-educated
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Young children in low-income families had greater exposure to
environmental lead and elevated blood-lead levels.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Children in low-income families were more likely to be without
a regular source of health care than children in higher-income
families. Roughly 12 percent of children in families with incomes
below the federal poverty level did not have a regular source of
health care compared to 4 percent of children in families with
incomes at least twice the poverty level.

 By SERGIO R. BUSTOS 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ Everybody in Costa Rica seems to know the
road to the new location of U.S. technology giant Intel. Of course,
it's hard to miss the massive construction site of a company that
is the world's biggest computer chip maker. A company that
surprisingly chose Costa Rica to locate its latest assembly and
test plant. A company that expects to employ up to 3,500 people and
invest US$500 million by the end of 2002. These days, conversations
about Costa Rica's investment and business climate begin and end
with the same subject: Intel. No doubt, Costa Rica is proud that
Intel, a global US$20 billion dollar company, chose to place its
millions in this Central American nation of 3.5 million people.
 &HT;    To understand the magnitude of Intel's multi-million dollar
investment, consider the following:
 &HT;    The cost alone of constructing the four Intel plants represents
six times the amount the country typically receives annually in
foreign direct investment (FDI). Between 1990 and 1996, FDI
averaged $272 million per year.
 &HT;    Exports from the Intel plants are expected to double the value
of Costa Rica's current $3 billion in exports by the year 2000.
 &HT;    This year alone, the expected $700 million worth of Intel
computer chips to be produced for export will overtake coffee ($544
million) and bananas ($391 million) as the nation's top exports.
 &HT;    The $500 million Intel investment is the single largest
investment ever made in Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Intel's Corporate Vice President Mike Splinter says the company
chose Costa Rica over Brazil, Chile and Mexico because of its
``excellent educational system.''
 &HT;    An independent report detailing Costa Rica's successful effort
in attracting Intel also cited the country's appeal to foreign
investors because of its political stability, a corruption-free
government, its commitment to economic openness and its small size.
 &HT;    ``Intel's decision to invest in Costa Rica serves as a rich
example of how a small country with no domestic market can still
lure a world class, high technology firm,'' says Debora Spar, a
Harvard University Business School professor, who wrote the report
for the Foreign Investment Advisory Service, which is jointly run
by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.
 &HT;    Indeed, Costa Rica's size and central location in the middle of
the hemisphere make it an ideal country for all kinds of foreign
investors, including those not tied to the high-tech sector.
Fast-food franchises, car rental companies, video rental outlets,
hotels, designer clothing boutiques and stores selling computer
products opened in recent years have all met with financial
success.
 &HT;    Costa Rica is Central America's top consumer of paper and
paperboard products, while agricultural chemicals are also in high
demand because the agro-industry still represents nearly 20 percent
of the country's GDP. Automobiles, telecommunications equipment and
computer peripherals are also among the sectors with the best
prospects, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
 &HT;    The banking sector remains dominated by state-owned banks, but
there is continued talk about privatizating the Banco International
de Costa Rica (BICSA), which was first recommended for a sell-off
in 1995.
 &HT;    The tourism sector bounced back last year following a
disappointing 1996 when the number of tourists dropped for the
first time in a decade. Last year, the number of tourists rose
nearly 4 percent to 811,490.
 &HT;    Although U.S. companies make up nearly 70 percent of all foreign
investors, European and Asian companies are showing growing
interest. For example, Germany-based Veba AG, through its
subsidiary, Wyle Electronics, is building a manufacturing plant
this year and expects to export US$7.5 million worth of
semiconductors.
 &HT;    Among Asian companies, the Taiwanese are most active. The
state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar), is investing in the
development of Costa Rican orchids for export. A huge greenhouse
facility will be completed at the end of this year and is expected
to produce more than 700,000 pots of orchids for export to Europe
and the United States, say Taiwanese officials.
 &HT;    The most notable Taiwanese company is computer giant Acer, which
opened its state-of-the-art customer service calling center in
1995. Today, the company employs 420 people and expects to hire at
least 100 more people in the next few years, says Flora Solera,
Acer's site director.
 &HT;    ``We looked at several countries _ the Philippines, Panama,
India _ but we chose Costa Rica,'' says Acer America Corp. Vice
President Max Hung, who says the strong education system, the large
number of bilingual (English/Spanish) Costa Ricans, the low cost of
communications and the high ``computer-literacy'' rate made the
country an overwhelming choice as a place to do business. He
cautions, however, that Costa Rica's pool of high-tech graduates is
growing smaller because of the country's very success in attracting
high-tech industry.
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest single carrot Costa Rica dangles in front of
foreign investors is the free trade zones. Most newly arrived
foreign companies are locating their offices or plants in the
highly promoted Free Zones, which are comparable to industrial
parks found in the United States and elsewhere.
 &HT;    The parks offer a variety of tax exemptions for companies that
want to use Costa Rica as a base for exporting. Domestic sales of
manufactured products are not allowed. The first Free Zone opened
in 1982, drawing mostly textile companies. Today, there are nine
such parks, most located near San Jose. Nearly half of all Costa
Rican exports come from the free zones, while companies in the
zones last year imported an estimated $500 million in raw
materials. ``The free trade zone legislation has resulted in one of
the better export processing zone systems in the developing
world,'' says a World Bank study.
 &HT;    Despite the interest of foreign companies willing to invest, the
Costa Rican economy is straining under serious financial problems.
Newly elected President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, who took office in
May, promised during his campaign to tackle those problems by
cutting spending and pushing for the privatization of state-owned
companies.
 &HT;    At the top of the list of worries for the new Rodriguez
administration is the internal debt. Currently, the country owes a
whopping $4.1 billion, which represents 40 percent of GDP. Other
sources of concern include GDP growth, which last year registered a
disappointing 2.5 percent, well below the robust regional average
of 5.3 percent. It also had a trade deficit last year of $1.1
billion, according to Costa Rica's Central Bank. The trade deficit
through the first three months of this year is an estimated $184
million.
 &HT;    The consensus among analysts is that Rodriguez is a president
with a pro-business agenda and that he will bring government
spending under control.
 &HT;    ``The new administration has requested members of past
governments known for being market-oriented to form part of the new
cabinet,'' says U.S.-based BancBoston Securities analyst Rodrigo
Diaz. The appointment of former Commerce Minister Roberto Rojas as
Minister of External Relations ``symbolizes Costa Rica's clear
desire to attract international capital and investment,'' Diaz
says.
 &HT;    Another positive appointment is new Central Bank President
Eduardo Lizano, a respected economist. He will likely pursue a
policy of fiscal restraint and will push to privatize several
state-owned companies. Lizano served on a task force of economists
charged with resolving Costa Rica's growing internal debt. Its
recommendations included selling state-owned companies such as the
National Insurance Institute and the National Liquor Factory and
parts of its telecommunications monopoly.
 &HT;    Lizano is ``relatively optimistic'' that the country's economy
will grow, but he says it depends on the government's move to get
its financial house in order. ``With (former) President (Jose
Maria) Figueres, there was lots of talk of privatization, but
little was done.''
 &HT;    Costa Rica must reduce the cost of its high electricity rates,
fix its deteriorated roads and highways, and assure that customs
procedures are more efficient at its ports and airport so as to
attract foreign investors, he says.
 &HT;    Because of the relatively small size of its population, Costa
Rica represents little more than a footnote on the marketing plans
of many multinational companies. To compensate and to get one step
ahead of any future Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement, the
Costa Rican government is leading the drive to form a regional
trading bloc with other Central American countries and the
Dominican Republic. The bloc would create a market of 41.5 million
people with a $112.7 billion GDP.
 &HT;    For now, fiscal worries are overshadowed by the euphoria over
the arrival of Intel. Visit any government office and you will find
a souvenir marking the arrival of Intel. In one office, an Intel
hardhat and a paperweight were on display.
 &HT;    Costa Ricans, both in government and the private sector, say
Intel's arrival will spur other high-tech companies to make Costa
Rica high-tech manufacturing hub.
 &HT;    ``Intel's decision to come to Costa Rica says many things about
our country, but, most importantly, it says that everything and
anything is possible here,'' says Enrique Egloff, CEO of the Costa
Rican Investment and Trade Development Board (CINDE). The private,
non-profit organization that contracts with the government to help
foreign investors in Costa Rica.
 &HT;    ``This is the tip of the iceberg because Intel marks the
beginning of a new era for us,'' says Jose Manuel Salazar, who was
trade minister under President Jose Maria Figueres (1994-98).
``There is now a new wave of interest, especially high-tech, in
Costa Rica.''
 &HT;    A new wave of interest, indeed, is taking hold. U.S.-based
Photocircuits Corp., a circuit board manufacturer, invested $8
million this year and hired 400 workers to staff a new
24,000-square-foot plant outside San Jose. Eventually, company
officials say, it plans to invest a total of more than $30 million
and employ more than 700 employees over the next three years.
 &HT;    Earlier this year, U.S.-based EMC Technology formed a Costa
Rican subsidiary called EMC Tecnologia S.A., investing up to $2
million with a new plant. The company builds electronic components
for satellite communications.
 &HT;    Much of the credit for drawing the interest of high-tech
companies to Costa Rica lies with the government. During the 1980s,
as wages rose, the government shifted from begging textile
companies to chasing after high-tech firms. The strategy paid off
with handsome dividends.
 &HT;    During the last five years, 25 high-tech companies have invested
in manufacturing plants in Costa Rica, according to CINDE. Among
them are such companies as DSC Communications, Panduit Corp.,
Merrimac Industries Inc., Q-Bit Corp., Sawtek Corp. and Reliability
Inc. (all U.S.-based). During the early 1980s, U.S.-based Motorola
and Costa Rica-based Bourns Trimpot Electronicas, S.A. started
manufacturing electronic components.
 &HT;    The high-tech fever is not limited to foreign companies.
Software development is also becoming big business in Costa Rica.
According to the Costa Rican-American Chamber of Commerce, the
industry has 140 companies that employ 4,000 people. By the end of
this year, the sector is expected to export as much as $45 million,
up from about $25 million last year. Next year the figure should
continue to grow _ to $60 million, the chamber estimates.
 &HT;    Despite euphoria over Intel and the ambitious hopes of creating
a high-tech paradise, Costa Rica still must overcome nagging
problems endemic to other Latin American countries. For example,
getting a telephone line can take up to a year through ICE, the
government telecom monopoly. Official figures show that as many as
40,000 customers are waiting for telephone service. And, although
the industry is taking off because of the Costa Rican higher
education system _ which is graduating about 2,000 computer systems
designers each year _ local software developers complain about a
lack of financing and credit.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, nearly every government official interviewed for
this story said Costa Rica would become ``Silicon Valley South.''
 &HT;    But Lizano, the Central Bank president, says such talk is
premature. ``It's a dream that's a long way off,'' he says.
 &HT;    At the makeshift offices of Intel, located in a suburb outside
San Jose, the lobby overflows with young Costa Ricans awaiting job
interviews. Past the security guards, Danilo Arias, the company's
corporate affairs director, keeps busy handling the steady number
of media inquiries from around the world. He says everyone wants to
hear the story of the Latin American Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    Arias doesn't want to disappoint anyone, but he knows his
country's limits. ``A country like Costa Rica cannot draw this kind
of industry without a major public investment. Education, social
services, infrastructure _ all need to be in place,'' he says. ``If
two more Intels showed up in Costa Rica, the airport would collapse
from all the cargo.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIDE BAR: Catching Multinationals
 &HT;    SAN JOSE, Cost Rica _ The Mexican state of Jalisco last year had
little doubt that U.S. chip maker Intel would choose it as the site
of its next multi-million dollar assembly and test plant. After
all, the Jalisco government had offered the huge multinational
corporation free land, cheap labor and cheap electricity rates. And
as for the mandatory union rules, the government assured the
company it could be granted an exception.
 &HT;    Intel officials refused the offer because they were ``wary of
the way business policy was formulated in Mexico,'' according to a
report put together by a team of researchers led by Harvard
Business School professor Debora Spar.
 &HT;    The researchers documented how a small Central American country
persuaded a major corporation to sink millions of dollars _ US$500
million by 2002 _ into its economy. The report was based on
interviews with Latin American government officials and exclusive
interviews with several key Intel officials involved in
negotiations.
 &HT;    The report, ``Attracting High Technology Investment, Intel's
Costa Rica Plant,'' was issued for a little known non-profit
organization called the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS),
which is jointly funded by the World Bank and the International
Finance Corporation.
 &HT;    But the report is more than just a portrait of one nation's
success in attracting a big company. It's the perfect textbook for
any Latin American government trying to figure out why a
multinational company chooses one country over another.
 &HT;    For example, Intel was turned off by Chile for a combination of
reasons, including the country's distant location, which made it a
transportation headache, and a perception that Chilean officials
seemed uninterested in high-tech companies. ``(President Eduardo)
Frei spent only two or three minutes with company officials after
being introduced to them,'' says FIAS researcher Damien Shiels.
``The company got the sense that Chile wasn't bending over
backwards for them at all.''
 &HT;    As for Brazil, one Intel company official close to the
site-selection process told Latin Trade that they visited Brazil
several times only to find themselves ``more confused'' after each
visit in trying to understand its laws related to business and
foreign investment. Intel officials were annoyed with Brazilian
government officials who issued a press release to announce that
Intel was interested in building a plant, accodring to Shiels. ``It
was unwanted pressure as far as Intel was concerned,'' he says.
 &HT;    For Intel, Mexico's deal was too good to be true, says Shiels.
``In Costa Rica, what you see is what you get in terms of the legal
side of business,'' he says. ``In Mexico, there is a certain degree
of negotiation attached to foreign investment ... For a
high-profile global company like Intel, it does not want to get
involved with side deals.''
 &HT;    Jalisco government officials were so shocked last year over
Costa Rica being selected that several Jalisco officials visited
Costa Rica this year to try to figure out what Costa Rica offered
that was so enticing to Intel.
 &HT;    ``Costa Rica did not ... grant (any) special favors, no side
deals or firm-specific concessions. But (it) did make major
adjustments _ at the airport, the schools, the free trade zones _
to accommodate Intel's needs,'' says Shiels. ``They had to, or
Intel almost certainly would have gone elsewhere.''

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ Everybody in Costa Rica seems to know the
road to the new location of U.S. technology giant Intel. Of course,
it's hard to miss the massive construction site of a company that
is the world's biggest computer chip maker. A company that
surprisingly chose Costa Rica to locate its latest assembly and
test plant. A company that expects to employ up to 3,500 people and
invest US$500 million by the end of 2002. These days, conversations
about Costa Rica's investment and business climate begin and end
with the same subject: Intel. No doubt, Costa Rica is proud that
Intel, a global US$20 billion dollar company, chose to place its
millions in this Central American nation of 3.5 million people.
 &HT;    To understand the magnitude of Intel's multi-million dollar
investment, consider the following:
 &HT;    The cost alone of constructing the four Intel plants represents
six times the amount the country typically receives annually in
foreign direct investment (FDI). Between 1990 and 1996, FDI
averaged $272 million per year.
 &HT;    Exports from the Intel plants are expected to double the value
of Costa Rica's current $3 billion in exports by the year 2000.
 &HT;    This year alone, the expected $700 million worth of Intel
computer chips to be produced for export will overtake coffee ($544
million) and bananas ($391 million) as the nation's top exports.
 &HT;    The $500 million Intel investment is the single largest
investment ever made in Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Intel's Corporate Vice President Mike Splinter says the company
chose Costa Rica over Brazil, Chile and Mexico because of its
``excellent educational system.''
 &HT;    An independent report detailing Costa Rica's successful effort
in attracting Intel also cited the country's appeal to foreign
investors because of its political stability, a corruption-free
government, its commitment to economic openness and its small size.
 &HT;    ``Intel's decision to invest in Costa Rica serves as a rich
example of how a small country with no domestic market can still
lure a world class, high technology firm,'' says Debora Spar, a
Harvard University Business School professor, who wrote the report
for the Foreign Investment Advisory Service, which is jointly run
by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.
 &HT;    Indeed, Costa Rica's size and central location in the middle of
the hemisphere make it an ideal country for all kinds of foreign
investors, including those not tied to the high-tech sector.
Fast-food franchises, car rental companies, video rental outlets,
hotels, designer clothing boutiques and stores selling computer
products opened in recent years have all met with financial
success.
 &HT;    Costa Rica is Central America's top consumer of paper and
paperboard products, while agricultural chemicals are also in high
demand because the agro-industry still represents nearly 20 percent
of the country's GDP. Automobiles, telecommunications equipment and
computer peripherals are also among the sectors with the best
prospects, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
 &HT;    The banking sector remains dominated by state-owned banks, but
there is continued talk about privatizating the Banco International
de Costa Rica (BICSA), which was first recommended for a sell-off
in 1995.
 &HT;    The tourism sector bounced back last year following a
disappointing 1996 when the number of tourists dropped for the
first time in a decade. Last year, the number of tourists rose
nearly 4 percent to 811,490.
 &HT;    Although U.S. companies make up nearly 70 percent of all foreign
investors, European and Asian companies are showing growing
interest. For example, Germany-based Veba AG, through its
subsidiary, Wyle Electronics, is building a manufacturing plant
this year and expects to export US$7.5 million worth of
semiconductors.
 &HT;    Among Asian companies, the Taiwanese are most active. The
state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar), is investing in the
development of Costa Rican orchids for export. A huge greenhouse
facility will be completed at the end of this year and is expected
to produce more than 700,000 pots of orchids for export to Europe
and the United States, say Taiwanese officials.
 &HT;    The most notable Taiwanese company is computer giant Acer, which
opened its state-of-the-art customer service calling center in
1995. Today, the company employs 420 people and expects to hire at
least 100 more people in the next few years, says Flora Solera,
Acer's site director.
 &HT;    ``We looked at several countries _ the Philippines, Panama,
India _ but we chose Costa Rica,'' says Acer America Corp. Vice
President Max Hung, who says the strong education system, the large
number of bilingual (English/Spanish) Costa Ricans, the low cost of
communications and the high ``computer-literacy'' rate made the
country an overwhelming choice as a place to do business. He
cautions, however, that Costa Rica's pool of high-tech graduates is
growing smaller because of the country's very success in attracting
high-tech industry.
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest single carrot Costa Rica dangles in front of
foreign investors is the free trade zones. Most newly arrived
foreign companies are locating their offices or plants in the
highly promoted Free Zones, which are comparable to industrial
parks found in the United States and elsewhere.
 &HT;    The parks offer a variety of tax exemptions for companies that
want to use Costa Rica as a base for exporting. Domestic sales of
manufactured products are not allowed. The first Free Zone opened
in 1982, drawing mostly textile companies. Today, there are nine
such parks, most located near San Jose. Nearly half of all Costa
Rican exports come from the free zones, while companies in the
zones last year imported an estimated $500 million in raw
materials. ``The free trade zone legislation has resulted in one of
the better export processing zone systems in the developing
world,'' says a World Bank study.
 &HT;    Despite the interest of foreign companies willing to invest, the
Costa Rican economy is straining under serious financial problems.
Newly elected President Miguel Angel Rodriguez, who took office in
May, promised during his campaign to tackle those problems by
cutting spending and pushing for the privatization of state-owned
companies.
 &HT;    At the top of the list of worries for the new Rodriguez
administration is the internal debt. Currently, the country owes a
whopping $4.1 billion, which represents 40 percent of GDP. Other
sources of concern include GDP growth, which last year registered a
disappointing 2.5 percent, well below the robust regional average
of 5.3 percent. It also had a trade deficit last year of $1.1
billion, according to Costa Rica's Central Bank. The trade deficit
through the first three months of this year is an estimated $184
million.
 &HT;    The consensus among analysts is that Rodriguez is a president
with a pro-business agenda and that he will bring government
spending under control.
 &HT;    ``The new administration has requested members of past
governments known for being market-oriented to form part of the new
cabinet,'' says U.S.-based BancBoston Securities analyst Rodrigo
Diaz. The appointment of former Commerce Minister Roberto Rojas as
Minister of External Relations ``symbolizes Costa Rica's clear
desire to attract international capital and investment,'' Diaz
says.
 &HT;    Another positive appointment is new Central Bank President
Eduardo Lizano, a respected economist. He will likely pursue a
policy of fiscal restraint and will push to privatize several
state-owned companies. Lizano served on a task force of economists
charged with resolving Costa Rica's growing internal debt. Its
recommendations included selling state-owned companies such as the
National Insurance Institute and the National Liquor Factory and
parts of its telecommunications monopoly.
 &HT;    Lizano is ``relatively optimistic'' that the country's economy
will grow, but he says it depends on the government's move to get
its financial house in order. ``With (former) President (Jose
Maria) Figueres, there was lots of talk of privatization, but
little was done.''
 &HT;    Costa Rica must reduce the cost of its high electricity rates,
fix its deteriorated roads and highways, and assure that customs
procedures are more efficient at its ports and airport so as to
attract foreign investors, he says.
 &HT;    Because of the relatively small size of its population, Costa
Rica represents little more than a footnote on the marketing plans
of many multinational companies. To compensate and to get one step
ahead of any future Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement, the
Costa Rican government is leading the drive to form a regional
trading bloc with other Central American countries and the
Dominican Republic. The bloc would create a market of 41.5 million
people with a $112.7 billion GDP.
 &HT;    For now, fiscal worries are overshadowed by the euphoria over
the arrival of Intel. Visit any government office and you will find
a souvenir marking the arrival of Intel. In one office, an Intel
hardhat and a paperweight were on display.
 &HT;    Costa Ricans, both in government and the private sector, say
Intel's arrival will spur other high-tech companies to make Costa
Rica high-tech manufacturing hub.
 &HT;    ``Intel's decision to come to Costa Rica says many things about
our country, but, most importantly, it says that everything and
anything is possible here,'' says Enrique Egloff, CEO of the Costa
Rican Investment and Trade Development Board (CINDE). The private,
non-profit organization that contracts with the government to help
foreign investors in Costa Rica.
 &HT;    ``This is the tip of the iceberg because Intel marks the
beginning of a new era for us,'' says Jose Manuel Salazar, who was
trade minister under President Jose Maria Figueres (1994-98).
``There is now a new wave of interest, especially high-tech, in
Costa Rica.''
 &HT;    A new wave of interest, indeed, is taking hold. U.S.-based
Photocircuits Corp., a circuit board manufacturer, invested $8
million this year and hired 400 workers to staff a new
24,000-square-foot plant outside San Jose. Eventually, company
officials say, it plans to invest a total of more than $30 million
and employ more than 700 employees over the next three years.
 &HT;    Earlier this year, U.S.-based EMC Technology formed a Costa
Rican subsidiary called EMC Tecnologia S.A., investing up to $2
million with a new plant. The company builds electronic components
for satellite communications.
 &HT;    Much of the credit for drawing the interest of high-tech
companies to Costa Rica lies with the government. During the 1980s,
as wages rose, the government shifted from begging textile
companies to chasing after high-tech firms. The strategy paid off
with handsome dividends.
 &HT;    During the last five years, 25 high-tech companies have invested
in manufacturing plants in Costa Rica, according to CINDE. Among
them are such companies as DSC Communications, Panduit Corp.,
Merrimac Industries Inc., Q-Bit Corp., Sawtek Corp. and Reliability
Inc. (all U.S.-based). During the early 1980s, U.S.-based Motorola
and Costa Rica-based Bourns Trimpot Electronicas, S.A. started
manufacturing electronic components.
 &HT;    The high-tech fever is not limited to foreign companies.
Software development is also becoming big business in Costa Rica.
According to the Costa Rican-American Chamber of Commerce, the
industry has 140 companies that employ 4,000 people. By the end of
this year, the sector is expected to export as much as $45 million,
up from about $25 million last year. Next year the figure should
continue to grow _ to $60 million, the chamber estimates.
 &HT;    Despite euphoria over Intel and the ambitious hopes of creating
a high-tech paradise, Costa Rica still must overcome nagging
problems endemic to other Latin American countries. For example,
getting a telephone line can take up to a year through ICE, the
government telecom monopoly. Official figures show that as many as
40,000 customers are waiting for telephone service. And, although
the industry is taking off because of the Costa Rican higher
education system _ which is graduating about 2,000 computer systems
designers each year _ local software developers complain about a
lack of financing and credit.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, nearly every government official interviewed for
this story said Costa Rica would become ``Silicon Valley South.''
 &HT;    But Lizano, the Central Bank president, says such talk is
premature. ``It's a dream that's a long way off,'' he says.
 &HT;    At the makeshift offices of Intel, located in a suburb outside
San Jose, the lobby overflows with young Costa Ricans awaiting job
interviews. Past the security guards, Danilo Arias, the company's
corporate affairs director, keeps busy handling the steady number
of media inquiries from around the world. He says everyone wants to
hear the story of the Latin American Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    Arias doesn't want to disappoint anyone, but he knows his
country's limits. ``A country like Costa Rica cannot draw this kind
of industry without a major public investment. Education, social
services, infrastructure _ all need to be in place,'' he says. ``If
two more Intels showed up in Costa Rica, the airport would collapse
from all the cargo.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIDE BAR: Catching Multinationals
 &HT;    SAN JOSE, Cost Rica _ The Mexican state of Jalisco last year had
little doubt that U.S. chip maker Intel would choose it as the site
of its next multi-million dollar assembly and test plant. After
all, the Jalisco government had offered the huge multinational
corporation free land, cheap labor and cheap electricity rates. And
as for the mandatory union rules, the government assured the
company it could be granted an exception.
 &HT;    Intel officials refused the offer because they were ``wary of
the way business policy was formulated in Mexico,'' according to a
report put together by a team of researchers led by Harvard
Business School professor Debora Spar.
 &HT;    The researchers documented how a small Central American country
persuaded a major corporation to sink millions of dollars _ US$500
million by 2002 _ into its economy. The report was based on
interviews with Latin American government officials and exclusive
interviews with several key Intel officials involved in
negotiations.
 &HT;    The report, ``Attracting High Technology Investment, Intel's
Costa Rica Plant,'' was issued for a little known non-profit
organization called the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS),
which is jointly funded by the World Bank and the International
Finance Corporation.
 &HT;    But the report is more than just a portrait of one nation's
success in attracting a big company. It's the perfect textbook for
any Latin American government trying to figure out why a
multinational company chooses one country over another.
 &HT;    For example, Intel was turned off by Chile for a combination of
reasons, including the country's distant location, which made it a
transportation headache, and a perception that Chilean officials
seemed uninterested in high-tech companies. ``(President Eduardo)
Frei spent only two or three minutes with company officials after
being introduced to them,'' says FIAS researcher Damien Shiels.
``The company got the sense that Chile wasn't bending over
backwards for them at all.''
 &HT;    As for Brazil, one Intel company official close to the
site-selection process told Latin Trade that they visited Brazil
several times only to find themselves ``more confused'' after each
visit in trying to understand its laws related to business and
foreign investment. Intel officials were annoyed with Brazilian
government officials who issued a press release to announce that
Intel was interested in building a plant, accodring to Shiels. ``It
was unwanted pressure as far as Intel was concerned,'' he says.
 &HT;    For Intel, Mexico's deal was too good to be true, says Shiels.
``In Costa Rica, what you see is what you get in terms of the legal
side of business,'' he says. ``In Mexico, there is a certain degree
of negotiation attached to foreign investment ... For a
high-profile global company like Intel, it does not want to get
involved with side deals.''
 &HT;    Jalisco government officials were so shocked last year over
Costa Rica being selected that several Jalisco officials visited

 &HT;    ``Costa Rica did not ... grant (any) special favors, no side
deals or firm-specific concessions. But (it) did make major
adjustments _ at the airport, the schools, the free trade zones _
to accommodate Intel's needs,'' says Shiels. ``They had to, or
Intel almost certainly would have gone elsewhere.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ Todo el mundo en Costa Rica parece
conocer el camino hacia la nueva sede del gigante tecnologico
norteamericano Intel. Desde luego, no es facil que se le escape a
uno el enorme sitio de construccion de una planta del mayor
fabricante de microprocesadores del mundo. Una compania que
sorpresivamente eligio a Costa Rica para ubicar su mas reciente
planta de prueba y ensamblaje. Una compania que espera tener hasta
3.500 empleados e invertir US$500 millones en Costa Rica para fines
del 2002.
 &HT;    En estos dias, las conversaciones sobre el clima de la inversion
y los negocios en Costa Rica empiezan y terminan con el mismo tema:
Intel. Indudablemente, Costa Rica esta orgullosa de que Intel, una
empresa global con un valor de US$20.000 millones, decidiera
invertir en este pais centroamericano de 3,5 millones de
habitantes.
 &HT;    Para entender la magnitud de la inversion multimillonaria de
Intel, veamos los siguientes datos:
 &HT;    Solo el costo de construir las cuatro plantas de Intel
representa seis veces la cantidad que el pais suele recibir
anualmente en inversion extranjera directa. Entre 1990 y 1996, esa
inversion promedio US$272 millones al ano.
 &HT;    Se espera que las ventas al extranjero de las plantas de Intel
dupliquen a US$3.000 la cifra actual de exportaciones
costarricenses para el ano 2000.
 &HT;    Se espera que en 1998 el valor de los chips que Intel exporte
desde Costa Rica (US$700 millones) superara al cafe (US$544
millones) y a los bananos (US$391 millones). Los microprocesadores
seran el principal producto de exportacion.
 &HT;    La inversion de US$500 millones de Intel es la mayor inversion
individual en la historia de Costa Rica.
 &HT;    Mike Splinter, vicepresidente de Intel, dice que la empresa
prefirio a Costa Rica que a Brasil, Chile y Mexico por su
``excelente sistema de educacion.''
 &HT;    Un informe independiente que detalla el exitoso esfuerzo de
Costa Rica para atraer a Intel tambien menciona el atractivo que
tiene el pais para los inversionistas extranjeros por su
estabilidad politica, su gobierno libre de corrupcion, su
compromiso con la apertura economica y su extension pequena.
 &HT;    ``La decision de Intel de invertir en Costa Rica es un buen
ejemplo de la forma en que un pais pequeno, sin un mercado interno,
puede atraer a una firma mundial de alta tecnologia,'' dice Debora
Spar, profesora de la Facultad de Comercio de la Universidad de
Harvard, que redacto el informe para el Servicio de Asesoramiento
de Inversion Extranjera, dirigido conjuntamente por el Banco
Mundial y la Corporacion Internacional de Finanzas.
 &HT;    Sin duda, el tamano de Costa Rica y su ubicacion en el centro
del hemisferio lo hacen el pais ideal para toda clase de
inversionistas extranjeros, incluidos los que no estan vinculados
al sector de la alta tecnologia. Franquicias de restaurantes de
servicio rapido, companias de alquiler de autos, tiendas de
alquiler de videos, hoteles, boutiques y tiendas de productos de
computacion que han abierto en los ultimos anos han tenido un exito
financiero. Costa Rica es el mayor consumidor centroamericano de
productos de papel y carton, y los productos quimicos para la
agricultura tambien tienen una gran demanda debido a que la
agroindustria aun representa casi el 20 por ciento del PIB. Los
automoviles, los equipos de telecomunicaciones y los equipos
perifericos para computadoras tambien estan entre los sectores con
mejores perspectivas, segun el Departamento de Comercio de Estados
Unidos.
 &HT;    El sector bancario sigue dominado por bancos estatales, pero se
habla continuamente de privatizar el Banco Internacional de Costa
Rica (BICSA), cuya venta se recomendo por primera vez en 1995.
 &HT;    El sector turistico se recupero el ano pasado, tras un
decepcionante 1996 en que el numero de visitantes descendio por
primera vez en una decada. El ano pasado, la cantidad de turistas
crecio casi el 4 por ciento, a 811.490.
 &HT;    Aunque las empresas estadounidenses representan casi el 70 por
ciento de todos los inversionistas extranjeros, las companias
europeas y asiaticas muestran cada vez mas interes. Por ejemplo,
Veba AG, de Alemania, construye una fabrica a traves de su
subsidiaria Wyle Electronics, y espera exportar semiconductores por
valor de US$7,5 millones.
 &HT;    Entre las empresas asiaticas, las taiwanesas son las mas
activas. La estatal Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) invierte en el
cultivo de orquideas costarricenses para la exportacion. A fines de
este ano se terminara de construir un enorme invernadero que se
calcula producira mas de 700.000 tiestos de orquideas para exportar
a Europa y Estados Unidos, dicen funcionarios taiwaneses.
 &HT;    La compania taiwanesa mas destacada es Acer, el coloso de las
computadoras, que abrio su avanzado centro telefonico de servicio
al cliente en 1995. Hoy, la empresa tiene 420 empleados y espera
contratar por lo menos a 100 mas en los proximos anos, dice Flora
Solera, directora del local de Acer.
 &HT;    ``Estudiamos varios paises (Filipinas, Panama, la India) pero
nos decidimos por Costa Rica,'' dice Max Hung, vicepresidente de
Acer America Corp., quien afirma que el vigoroso sistema de
educacion, la gran cantidad de costarricenses que hablan ingles, el
bajo costo de las comunicaciones y el alto indice de conocimientos
de computacion hicieron que el pais fuera elegido por mayoria
abrumadora para abrir el negocio. No obstante, advierte que la
cantidad de graduados en carreras de alta tecnologia en Costa Rica
disminuye proporcionalmente debido al gran exito del pais en captar
a empresas del sector.
 &HT;    Quiza el mayor atractivo de Costa Rica para los inversionistas
extranjeros sean las zonas francas. Las companias foraneas que han
llegado mas recientemente ubican sus oficinas o plantas en las
zonas francas, que reciben una gran promocion y que pueden
compararse con los parques industriales de Estados Unidos y otros
paises.
 &HT;    Estas instalaciones ofrecen diversas exenciones fiscales a las
empresas que desean usar a Costa Rica como base exportadora. No se
permite la venta interna de productos manufacturados. La primera
zona franca comenzo a operar en 1982, en lo fundamental con
empresas textiles. Actualmente hay nueve zonas francas, la mayoria
ubicadas cerca de San Jose. Casi la mitad de todas las
exportaciones de Costa Rica proviene de esas zonas francas,
mientras las empresas ubicadas en las zonas importaron el ano
pasado un estimado de US$500 millones en materias primas. ``La ley
de las zonas francas ha dado lugar a uno de los mejores sistemas de
zonas de procesamiento de exportaciones en el mundo en
desarrollo,'' afirma un estudio del Banco Mundial.
 &HT;    A pesar del interes de las companias extranjeras dispuestas a
invertir, la economia costarricense sufre graves problemas
financieros. El recien electo presidente Miguel Angel Rodriguez,
que ocupo el cargo en mayo, prometio durante su campana resolver
todos esos problemas mediante la reduccion de los gastos y el
impulso a la privatizacion de las empresas estatales.
 &HT;    A la cabeza de la lista de preocupaciones del nuevo gobierno
esta la deuda interna. El pais debe US$4.100 millones, equivalente
al 40 por ciento del PIB. Otras causas de inquietud son el bajo
crecimiento del PIB, que el ano pasado tuvo un decepcionate 2,5 por
ciento, muy por debajo del robusto promedio regional del 5,3 por
ciento. El ano pasado tambien tuvo un deficit comercial de US$1.100
millones, segun el Banco Central de Costa Rica. El deficit
comercial en los primeros tres meses de este ano se calcula en
US$184 millones.
 &HT;    Los analistas coinciden en que Rodriguez es un presidente a
favor de los negocios y que lograra controlar los gastos del
gobierno.
 &HT;    ``El nuevo gobierno ha solicitado a los miembros de gobiernos
anteriores conocidos por su orientacion hacia las politicas de
libre mercado que formen parte del nuevo gabinete,'' dice Rodrigo
Diaz, analista de BancBoston Securities, de Estados Unidos. El
nombramiento de Roberto Rojas, ex ministro de Comercio, como
ministro de Relaciones Exteriores ``simboliza el claro deseo de
Costa Rica de atraer el capital y la inversion internacional,''
dice Diaz.
 &HT;    Otro nombramiento positivo es el del nuevo presidente del Banco
Central, Eduardo Lizano, un respetado economista. Lizano
probablemente seguira un rumbo de restriccion fiscal y procurara la
privatizacion de varias empresas estatales. Lizano formo parte de
un equipo especial de economistas encargados de resolver el
problema de la creciente deuda interna de Costa Rica. Entre sus
recomendaciones estuvo la venta de empresas estatales como el
Instituto Nacional de Seguros y la Fabrica Nacional de Licores, y
partes del monopolio de las telecomunicaciones.
 &HT;    Lizano cree con ``relativo optimismo'' que la economia del pais
crecera, pero senala que depende de los pasos del gobierno para
poner la casa en orden. ``Con el (ex) presidente (Jose Maria)
Figueres se hablo mucho de la privatizacion, pero se hizo poco.''
 &HT;    Costa Rica debe reducir el costo de sus altas tarifas
electricas, reparar sus deteriorados caminos y carreteras y
garantizar que los tramites aduanales en sus puertos y aeropuertos
sean mas eficientes con el fin de atraer a los inversionistas
extranjeros, afirma Lizano.
 &HT;    Debido a que su poblacion es relativamente pequena, Costa Rica
representa poco mas que una nota al pie en los planes de mercadeo
de muchas multinacionales. Para compensar esa situacion y dar un
paso mas hacia cualquier futuro acuerdo del Area de Libre Comercio
de las Americas, el gobierno adelanta una campana para formar un
bloque comercial regional con otros paises centroamericanos y la
Republica Dominicana. El bloque crearia un mercado de 41,5 millones
de personas con un PIB de US$112.700 millones.
 &HT;    Por ahora, las preocupaciones fiscales estan opacadas por la
euforia causada por la llegada de Intel. Visite cualquier oficina
de gobierno y encontrara un souvenir por la llegada de la empresa.
En una oficina se exhibian un casco y un pisapapeles de Intel.
 &HT;    Los costarricenses, tanto en el gobierno como en el sector
privado, dicen que el arribo de Intel animara a otras empresas a
convertir a Costa Rica en un centro de fabricacion de alta
tecnologia.
 &HT;    ``La decision de Intel de venir a Costa Rica habla bien de
nuestro pais, pero, lo que es mas importante, senala que aqui todo
es posible,'' comenta Enrique Egloff, presidente ejecutivo de la
Coalicion Costarricense de Iniciativas de Desarrollo (CINDE), la
organizacion privada sin fines de lucro que trabaja con el gobierno
para ayudar a los inversionistas extranjeros en Costa Rica.
 &HT;    ``Esta es la punta del iceberg porque Intel marca el principio
de una nueva era para nosotros,'' dice Jose Manuel Salazar, que fue
ministro de Comercio en el gobierno de Jose Maria Figueres
(1994-98). ``Ahora hay una nueva oleada de interes, especialmente
de la alta tecnologia, en Costa Rica.''
 &HT;    Hay una nueva oleada de interes, sin duda. Photocircuits Corp.,
un fabricante estadounidense de tableros de circuitos electronicos,
invirtio US$8 millones este ano y contrato a 400 personas para una
planta de 2.230 metros cuadrados en las afueras de San Jose. A la
larga, dicen ejecutivos de la compania, planea invertir un total de
mas de US$30 millones y emplear mas de 700 personas en los tres
anos proximos.
 &HT;    A principios de este ano, EMC Technology, de Estados Unidos,
creo una subsidiaria costarricense llamada EMC Tecnologia S.A. e
invirtio US$2 millones en una nueva planta. La compania fabrica
componentes electronicos para comunicaciones satelitales.
 &HT;    El gobierno es responsable en gran medida de captar el interes
de las empresas de alta tecnologia. En los anos 80, al crecer los
salarios, el gobierno dejo de buscar a las empresas textiles para
perseguir a las de alta tecnologia. La estrategia dio grandes
dividendos.
 &HT;    En los ultimos cinco anos, 25 empresas de alta tecnologia han
invertido en fabricas en Costa Rica, segun la CINDE. Entre ellas
hay companias como DSC Communications, Panduit Corp., Merrimac
Industries Inc., Q-Bit Corp., Sawtek Corp. y Reliability Inc.
(todas de Estados Unidos). A principios de los 80, Motorola, de EU,
y Bourns Trimpot Electronicas S.A., de Costa Rica, empezaron a
fabricar componentes electronicos.
 &HT;    La fiebre de la alta tecnologia no se limita a las empresas
extranjeras. La fabricacion de software tambien se convierte en un
gran negocio en Costa Rica. Segun la Camara de Comercio
Costarricense-Americana, el sector tiene 140 companias con 4.000
empleados. Para fines de este ano, el sector espera exportar hasta
US$45 millones, muy por encima de los US$25 millones del ano
pasado. La cifra debe crecer a US$60 millones el ano siguiente,
calcula la Camara.
 &HT;    A pesar de la euforia por Intel y las ambiciosas esperanzas de
crear un paraiso de alta tecnologia, Costa Rica aun debe superar
molestos problemas endemicos en otros paises latinoamericanos. Por
ejemplo, conseguir una linea telefonica puede tomar hasta un ano a
traves del ICE, el monopolio estatal de las telecomunicaciones. Las
cifras oficiales indican que hay 40.000 personas esperando por el
servicio telefonico. Y aunque el sector crece gracias al sistema de
educacion superior de Costa Rica (que gradua unos 2.000
programadores de sistemas al ano) los fabricantes locales de
software se quejan de la falta de financiamiento y credito.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, practicamente todos los funcionarios de gobierno
entrevistados para este reportaje dijeron que Costa Rica se
convertiria en el ``Silicon Valley del sur.''
 &HT;    Pero Lizano, el presidente del Banco Central, piensa que esas
afirmaciones son prematuras. ``Es un sueno muy lejano,'' apunta.
 &HT;    En las oficinas provisionales de Intel, situadas en un suburbio
de San Jose, el vestibulo se llena de jovenes costarricenses
citados para una entrevista de empleo. Detras de los guardias de
seguridad, Danilo Arias, el director de relaciones empresariales de
la compania, trabaja sin cesar con los cuestionarios de prensa que
le envian desde distintos lugares del planeta. Dice que todo el
mundo quiere enterarse de la historia del Silicon Valley
latinoamericano.
 &HT;    Arias no quiere decepcionar a nadie, pero conoce las
limitaciones de su pais. ``Un pais como Costa Rica no puede atraer
esta clase de industria sin una gran inversion publica. La
educacion, los servicios sociales, la infraestructura, todo tiene
que estar en su lugar,'' senala. ``Si se aparecieran ds Intel mas
en Costa Rica, el aeropuerto se desplomaria bajo el peso de la
carga.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ARTICULO ADJUNTO
 &HT;    A LA CAZA DE MULTINACIONALES
 &HT;    SAN JOSE _ En el estado mexicano de Jalisco habia pocas dudas el
ano pasado de que Intel, el fabricante norteamericano de
microprocesadores, lo escogeria como sede de su proxima planta
multimillonaria de prueba y ensamblaje. A fin de cuentas, el
gobierno de Jalisco habia ofrecido a la enorme multinacional
terrenos gratis, mano de obra barata y bajas tarifas electricas. Y
en cuanto a las regulaciones sindicales de cumplimiento
obligatorio, el gobierno aseguro a la compania que haria una
excepcion.
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de Intel rechazaron la oferta porque estaban
``preocupados por la forma en que se formulaba la politica
comercial en Mexico,'' segun un informe redactado por un equipo de
investigadores y dirigido por la profesora Debora Spar, de la
Facultad de Comercio de Harvard.
 &HT;    Los investigadores documentaron como un pequeno pais
centroamericano convencio a una gran empresa a invertir millones de
dolares (US$500 millones para el ano 2002) en su economia. El
informe se baso en entrevistas con funcionarios de gobierno
latinoamericanos y en entrevistas exclusivas con altos ejecutivos
de Intel que participaron en las negociaciones.
 &HT;    El informe, titulado ``Attracting High Technology Investment,
Intel's Costa Rica Plant'' (``Captacion de inversion en alta
tecnologia; la planta de Intel en Costa Rica''), lo emitio una
organizacion sin fines de lucro poco conocida, llamada Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (Servicio de Asesoramiento de Inversion
Extranjera, FIAS), costeada por el Banco Mundial y por la
Corporacion Internacional de Finanzas.
 &HT;    Pero el informe es mas que el retrato del exito de un pais en
atraer a una gran empresa. Es el manual perfecto para cualquier
gobierno latinoamericano que trate de entender por que una
multinacional escoge a un pais y rechaza a otro.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, Intel no eligio a Chile por una variedad de
razones, entre ellas la lejania del pais, que dificultaba el
transporte, y la percepcion de que los funcionarios chilenos no
parecen muy interesados en companias de alta tecnologia. ``(El
presidente Eduardo) Frei solo paso dos o tres minutos con
ejecutivos de la compania despues que se los presentaron,'' dice
Damien Shiels, investigador de FIAS. ``La compania se llevo la
impresion de que Chile no estaba haciendo todo lo posible por
captarlos.''
 &HT;    En cuanto a Brasil, un ejecutivo de Intel cercano al proceso de
seleccion de la sede dijo a Latin Trade que visitaron Brasil varias
veces solo para estar ``mas confusos'' despues de cada visita con
respecto a las leyes relacionadas con el negocio y la inversion
extranjera. Los ejecutivos de Intel estaban molestos con
funcionarios del gobierno brasileno que divulgaron un comunicado de
prensa anunciando que Intel estaba interesada en construir una
planta, segun Shiels. ``Fue una presion que Intel no deseaba,''
dice.
 &HT;    Para Intel, el acuerdo con Mexico era demasiado bueno para ser
verdad, comenta Shiels. ``En Costa Rica, el aspecto juridico del
negocio es muy transparente,'' dice. ``En Mexico, hay cierto grado
de negociacion vinculado a la inversion foranea ... Una compania
global de la talla de Intel no quiere verse mezclada en acuerdos al
margen.''
 &HT;    Los funcionarios gubernamentales de Jalisco quedaron tan
impresionados el ano pasado con la seleccion de Costa Rica que
varios visitaron el pais centroamericano este ano para averiguar
que habia ofrecido Costa Rica para ganarse a Intel.
 &HT;    ``Costa Rica no concedio ningun favor especial, acuerdo al
margen o concesion especifica. Pero si hizo grandes ajustes, en el
aeropuerto, las escuelas, las zonas francas, en respuesta a las
necesidades de Intel,'' dice Shiels. ``Y tenian que hacerlo, porque
si no es casi seguro que Intel se habria ido a otra parte.''

Republica Dominicana. El bloque crearia un mercado de 41,5 millones
de personas con un PIB de US$112.700 millones.
 &HT;    Por ahora, las preocupaciones fiscales estan opacadas por la
euforia causada por la llegada de Intel. Visite cualquier oficina
de gobierno y encontrara un souvenir por la llegada de la empresa.
En una oficina se exhibian un casco y un pisapapeles de Intel.
 &HT;    Los costarricenses, tanto en el gobierno como en el sector
privado, dicen que el arribo de Intel animara a otras empresas a
convertir a Costa Rica en un centro de fabricacion de alta
tecnologia.
 &HT;    ``La decision de Intel de venir a Costa Rica habla bien de
nuestro pais, pero, lo que es mas importante, senala que aqui todo
es posible,'' comenta Enrique Egloff, presidente ejecutivo de la
Coalicion Costarricense de Iniciativas de Desarrollo (CINDE), la
organizacion privada sin fines de lucro que trabaja con el gobierno
para ayudar a los inversionistas extranjeros en Costa Rica.
 &HT;    ``Esta es la punta del iceberg porque Intel marca el principio
de una nueva era para nosotros,'' dice Jose Manuel Salazar, que fue
ministro de Comercio en el gobierno de Jose Maria Figueres
(1994-98). ``Ahora hay una nueva oleada de interes, especialmente
de la alta tecnologia, en Costa Rica.''
 &HT;    Hay una nueva oleada de interes, sin duda. Photocircuits Corp.,
un fabricante estadounidense de tableros de circuitos electronicos,
invirtio US$8 millones este ano y contrato a 400 personas para una
planta de 2.230 metros cuadrados en las afueras de San Jose. A la
larga, dicen ejecutivos de la compania, planea invertir un total de
mas de US$30 millones y emplear mas de 700 personas en los tres
anos proximos.
 &HT;    A principios de este ano, EMC Technology, de Estados Unidos,
creo una subsidiaria costarricense llamada EMC Tecnologia S.A. e
invirtio US$2 millones en una nueva planta. La compania fabrica
componentes electronicos para comunicaciones satelitales.
 &HT;    El gobierno es responsable en gran medida de captar el interes
de las empresas de alta tecnologia. En los anos 80, al crecer los
salarios, el gobierno dejo de buscar a las empresas textiles para
perseguir a las de alta tecnologia. La estrategia dio grandes
dividendos.
 &HT;    En los ultimos cinco anos, 25 empresas de alta tecnologia han
invertido en fabricas en Costa Rica, segun la CINDE. Entre ellas
hay companias como DSC Communications, Panduit Corp., Merrimac
Industries Inc., Q-Bit Corp., Sawtek Corp. y Reliability Inc.
(todas de Estados Unidos). A principios de los 80, Motorola, de EU,
y Bourns Trimpot Electronicas S.A., de Costa Rica, empezaron a
fabricar componentes electronicos.
 &HT;    La fiebre de la alta tecnologia no se limita a las empresas
extranjeras. La fabricacion de software tambien se convierte en un
gran negocio en Costa Rica. Segun la Camara de Comercio
Costarricense-Americana, el sector tiene 140 companias con 4.000
empleados. Para fines de este ano, el sector espera exportar hasta
US$45 millones, muy por encima de los US$25 millones del ano
pasado. La cifra debe crecer a US$60 millones el ano siguiente,
calcula la Camara.
 &HT;    A pesar de la euforia por Intel y las ambiciosas esperanzas de
crear un paraiso de alta tecnologia, Costa Rica aun debe superar
molestos problemas endemicos en otros paises latinoamericanos. Por
ejemplo, conseguir una linea telefonica puede tomar hasta un ano a
traves del ICE, el monopolio estatal de las telecomunicaciones. Las
cifras oficiales indican que hay 40.000 personas esperando por el
servicio telefonico. Y aunque el sector crece gracias al sistema de
educacion superior de Costa Rica (que gradua unos 2.000
programadores de sistemas al ano) los fabricantes locales de
software se quejan de la falta de financiamiento y credito.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, practicamente todos los funcionarios de gobierno
entrevistados para este reportaje dijeron que Costa Rica se
convertiria en el ``Silicon Valley del sur.''
 &HT;    Pero Lizano, el presidente del Banco Central, piensa que esas
afirmaciones son prematuras. ``Es un sueno muy lejano,'' apunta.
 &HT;    En las oficinas provisionales de Intel, situadas en un suburbio
de San Jose, el vestibulo se llena de jovenes costarricenses
citados para una entrevista de empleo. Detras de los guardias de
seguridad, Danilo Arias, el director de relaciones empresariales de
la compania, trabaja sin cesar con los cuestionarios de prensa que
le envian desde distintos lugares del planeta. Dice que todo el
mundo quiere enterarse de la historia del Silicon Valley
latinoamericano.
 &HT;    Arias no quiere decepcionar a nadie, pero conoce las
limitaciones de su pais. ``Un pais como Costa Rica no puede atraer
esta clase de industria sin una gran inversion publica. La
educacion, los servicios sociales, la infraestructura, todo tiene
que estar en su lugar,'' senala. ``Si se aparecieran ds Intel mas
en Costa Rica, el aeropuerto se desplomaria bajo el peso de la
carga.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ARTICULO ADJUNTO
 &HT;    A LA CAZA DE MULTINACIONALES
 &HT;    SAN JOSE _ En el estado mexicano de Jalisco habia pocas dudas el
ano pasado de que Intel, el fabricante norteamericano de
microprocesadores, lo escogeria como sede de su proxima planta
multimillonaria de prueba y ensamblaje. A fin de cuentas, el
gobierno de Jalisco habia ofrecido a la enorme multinacional
terrenos gratis, mano de obra barata y bajas tarifas electricas. Y
en cuanto a las regulaciones sindicales de cumplimiento
obligatorio, el gobierno aseguro a la compania que haria una
excepcion.
 &HT;    Los ejecutivos de Intel rechazaron la oferta porque estaban
``preocupados por la forma en que se formulaba la politica
comercial en Mexico,'' segun un informe redactado por un equipo de
investigadores y dirigido por la profesora Debora Spar, de la
Facultad de Comercio de Harvard.
 &HT;    Los investigadores documentaron como un pequeno pais
centroamericano convencio a una gran empresa a invertir millones de
dolares (US$500 millones para el ano 2002) en su economia. El
informe se baso en entrevistas con funcionarios de gobierno
latinoamericanos y en entrevistas exclusivas con altos ejecutivos
de Intel que participaron en las negociaciones.
 &HT;    El informe, titulado ``Attracting High Technology Investment,
Intel's Costa Rica Plant'' (``Captacion de inversion en alta
tecnologia; la planta de Intel en Costa Rica''), lo emitio una
organizacion sin fines de lucro poco conocida, llamada Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (Servicio de Asesoramiento de Inversion
Extranjera, FIAS), costeada por el Banco Mundial y por la
Corporacion Internacional de Finanzas.
 &HT;    Pero el informe es mas que el retrato del exito de un pais en
atraer a una gran empresa. Es el manual perfecto para cualquier
gobierno latinoamericano que trate de entender por que una
multinacional escoge a un pais y rechaza a otro.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, Intel no eligio a Chile por una variedad de
razones, entre ellas la lejania del pais, que dificultaba el
transporte, y la percepcion de que los funcionarios chilenos no
parecen muy interesados en companias de alta tecnologia. ``(El
presidente Eduardo) Frei solo paso dos o tres minutos con
ejecutivos de la compania despues que se los presentaron,'' dice
Damien Shiels, investigador de FIAS. ``La compania se llevo la
impresion de que Chile no estaba haciendo todo lo posible por
captarlos.''
 &HT;    En cuanto a Brasil, un ejecutivo de Intel cercano al proceso de
seleccion de la sede dijo a Latin Trade que visitaron Brasil varias
veces solo para estar ``mas confusos'' despues de cada visita con
respecto a las leyes relacionadas con el negocio y la inversion
extranjera. Los ejecutivos de Intel estaban molestos con
funcionarios del gobierno brasileno que divulgaron un comunicado de
prensa anunciando que Intel estaba interesada en construir una
planta, segun Shiels. ``Fue una presion que Intel no deseaba,''
dice.
 &HT;    Para Intel, el acuerdo con Mexico era demasiado bueno para ser
verdad, comenta Shiels. ``En Costa Rica, el aspecto juridico del
negocio es muy transparente,'' dice. ``En Mexico, hay cierto grado
de negociacion vinculado a la inversion foranea ... Una compania
global de la talla de Intel no quiere verse mezclada en acuerdos al
margen.''
 &HT;    Los funcionarios gubernamentales de Jalisco quedaron tan
impresionados el ano pasado con la seleccion de Costa Rica que
varios visitaron el pais centroamericano este ano para averiguar
que habia ofrecido Costa Rica para ganarse a Intel.
 &HT;    ``Costa Rica no concedio ningun favor especial, acuerdo al
margen o concesion especifica. Pero si hizo grandes ajustes, en el
aeropuerto, las escuelas, las zonas francas, en respuesta a las
necesidades de Intel,'' dice Shiels. ``Y tenian que hacerlo, porque
si no es casi seguro que Intel se habria ido a otra parte.''

   CLINTON-LEWINSKY _ WASHINGTON _ Both publicly and behind the
scenes, the White House is working to counter a week of legal
setbacks for President Clinton. His legal team is weighing options
including appeals, a possible constitutional challenge and even
deposing independent counsel Kenneth Starr's own team. As always,
Clinton remains free to simply describe to the public the nature of
his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky, an option
aides say has not received much attention in the Oval Office.
(Deans, Cox News Service 900).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PRESS _ WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky's immunity deal has
sent a new tide of anonymously sourced stories into print and over
the air, but prominent journalists defended them Wednesday as the
only way to get information to the public. While the sources refuse
to be identifed, they are reliable, the journalists said. ``They're
not anonymous to us,'' said NBC-TV's Claire Shipman. (Dart, Cox

   NUCLEAR-WASTE _ WASHINGTON _ The House voted 305-117 on
Wednesday for a compromise bill to create the Sierra Blance
low-level nuclear waste dump in Texas near the Mexican border. The
measure now goes to the Senate, where opposition is expected
because a House-Senate conference committee deleted provisions that
would have limited the number of states that could send waste to
the dump and allowed local opponents to file ``environmental
justice'' lawsuits. (Abulhassan, Cox News Service).

   PUERTORICO-US _ MIAMI _ Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello heads to
Capitol Hill on Thursday to make one last-ditch push for passage of
a bill in the Senate that would allow Puerto Ricans to vote on
their island's future this year. The bill, which already passed the
House, would allow Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood,
independence, and commonwealth status. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott has said there isn't enough time left in the current session
to consider the issue. Still, many Republicans have seized the

passage. (Emling, Cox News Service).

hospitals nationwide. Conservative Catholics in Austin have sent

   STATESCHOOL-BUS _ AUSTIN _ Throughout this fireball summer,
nearly 40 people with mental retardation were forced to endure bus

and apartment complexes at Cameron and Broadmoor in Northeast
Austin. While ACLU and defense attorneys say such injunctions are
unconstitutional, state attorneys say they are an effective legal
tool helping police keep neighborhoods crime-free. If Flowers
approves this first one, lawyers say it is likely that the Travis
County district attorney's office, along with every other

FIXES ARE ELUSIVE FOR A SECURITY GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Texas, Calif.)   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A serious security flaw in recent versions of Microsoft Outlook
98, Outlook Express and Netscape Mail _ three of the four most
widely used Internet electronic mail programs _ is proving more
difficult to fix than initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers at Microsoft and Netscape were scrambling last night
to devise solutions to the flaw, which could allow rogue
programmers to damage or steal data from a user's computer by
sending a seemingly normal e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   After posting a software patch on its Web site Tuesday,
Microsoft programmers discovered that the proposed solution did not
fully fix the problem, leaving users vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is deeper and more complicated than was
reported,'' a Microsoft spokeswoman said. ``We hope to have a fix
by the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Microsoft would not post any fixes for the
Outlook 98 and Outlook Express programs until the company was sure
they were fully effective.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, Microsoft's own network crashed
Wednesday, preventing customers from gaining access to the Outlook
98 security information site. Microsoft has posted information
about the problem with Outlook Express at
www.microsoft.com/ie/security.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there have been no reports of attacks using the method,
which was discovered last month by security researchers in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail attacks have been possible for years in a slightly
different form, in which rogue programs are sent as attachments to
e-mail. When the recipient opens the attached program, it does its
dirty work. For this reason, users are routinely advised never to
open an e-mail attachment from a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   The new attack also involves attachments but has a nasty twist:
in some cases it can trick the computer into launching the rogue
code when the e-mail program retrieves the mail, without requiring
the user to open the attachment.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw exploits the inability of the affected e-mail programs
to read very long file names. If the attached file has a name
longer than the program can handle in its memory buffer _ longer,
for example, because it contains a string of computer instructions
_ the buffer overflows and causes the e-mail program to crash. The
computer is then tricked into running the rogue code.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw does not exist in the e-mail programs used by America
Online, which has more than 12 million subscribers, or in Eudora, a
popular e-mail program. Both America Online and Eudora have
protections already built in.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, meanwhile, was working to fix a similar problem with
Netscape Mail versions 4.05 and 4.5b1. Netscape said it would
incorporate a solution in the next version of Netscape Mail,
scheduled to be available for downloading on Aug. 7. Netscape has
posted information about the problem at www.netscape.com/ &QL; 
products/security/resources/notes.html.

   Another computer virus did not cause the sky to fall this week,
despite warnings to the contrary. On July 26, the CIH virus was
supposed to affect computers running Windows 95 and 98, stopping
some machines, keeping others from starting and wiping out files on
yet others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had zero reports, nada, naught,'' said Alex Haddox,
director of the Symantec Anti-Virus Research Center, which had
posted a warning on its Web site though it had said the likelihood
of a problem was slight.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which first showed up in the Far East, contaminates
32-bit executable files (the files with a ``.exe'' extension).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some program that is popular in the Far East got uploaded to a
popular site and that got a few first-generation infections, and
there were some second-generation infections, but the virus just
died,'' said David Chess of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center
in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. ``People just don't share executables.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Watson antivirus research team remained vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever went broke overestimating a virus,'' Chess said. &QL;

   IBM's Big Blue computer shocked the chess world last year by
beating the human world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a series of
games. Emboldened, other game-playing computers are now challenging
human experts in backgammon, bridge, Scrabble, Go and poker.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence this week
in Madison, Wis., computer programs are having mixed results
against the humans, said Dr. Gerald Tesauro, a researcher at IBM's
Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Tesauro's neural network program, TD Gammon, running on a
400-megahertz Pentium II computer, lost Tuesday morning's
backgammon competition to the World Cup champion, Malcolm Davis of
Dallas. But it won the afternoon session, and going into
Wednesday's matches, it trailed by 15 points after about 60 games.
</P>
<P>
   After six games in the Scrabble competition, a program called
Maven, created by Brian Sheppard of the Hasbro toy company, was
dead-even with the human champion, Adam Logan, the top player in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scrabble players will appreciate the high scores:
</P>
<P>
   Game 1: Logan 389, Maven 280
</P>
<P>
   Game 2: Maven 474, Logan 351
</P>
<P>
   Game 3: Logan 377, Maven 359
</P>
<P>
   Game 4: Logan 380, Maven 365
</P>
<P>
   Game 5: Maven 377, Logan 329
</P>
<P>
   Game 6: Maven 473, Logan 419
</P>
<P>
   The bridge program, GIB, lost narrowly to the human champions.
The Go competition had not yet begun, but the humans were heavily
favored. As for the poker program, Tesauro said he was looking
around the conference for a computer than could smoke cigars. &QL;

from Dartmouth College, which placed the computer on its
recommended list for incoming students.

   Dartmouth started recommending that new students have a computer
in 1984, and made it a requirement in the fall of 1991. The college
is primarily a Macintosh environment, with about 9,000 of the more
than 10,000 users already on Macs.

   The battleground between sultry air over the South and cooler
conditions farther north will remain active Thursday with clusters
of showers and thunderstorms from the central Plains to the
Carolinas. Heavy rain from these storms will result in localized
flooding, especially in the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio
valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, rising currents of moist air will induce tall
cumulus clouds to form from the Gulf Coast to northern Florida. A
few of these clouds will produce heavy showers and thunderstorms,
particularly during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Partly sunny skies will cover the Northeast as weak high
pressure builds over the region. Sunshine will be most plentiful
early in the day with more clouds expected in the afternoon.
Farther west, clouds will spread from southern Minnesota to the
southern Great Lakes as a jet stream disturbance arrives overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, air ascending the sloping terrain of the high Plains
will bring moist air westward to the Front Range, setting the stage
for heavy thunderstorms in eastern sections of Colorado and
Wyoming. Winds shifting direction and increasing with altitude will
prompt a few of these storms to rotate. These spinning storms,
called supercells, are capable of producing tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, onshore breezes will continue to temper the heat in
western sections of the Northwest. Spotty strong thunderstorms will
erupt along the leading edge of cooler air over the interior
Northwest. Elsewhere, lingering moisture will combine with vigorous
daytime heating to cause scattered afternoon thunderstorms over
much of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE NAME GAME
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm Alex was born east of the Lesser Antilles late on
Tuesday. Although the list of names for tropical storms and
hurricanes in the Atlantic is recycled every six years, 1998 marks
the first time the name Alex has been used. After Hurricane Andrew
decimated parts of Florida and Louisiana in 1992, the name was
retired, as is typical whenever a powerful hurricane makes
landfall. Alex was then chosen to replace Andrew. Interestingly,
Andrew was the replacement name for Hurricane Allen, which, in
1980, became one of the strongest storms to ever roam the Atlantic
Ocean. &QL;

`FOR YOUR OWN GOOD': ANTI-SMOKING ZEAL IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR
FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most efficient way to read Jacob Sullum's finely reasoned
attack, ``For Your Own Good: The Anti-Smoking Crusade and the
Tyranny of Public Health,'' is to start at the end. There you'll
find an appendix listing Sullum's most salient points, which are
summarized as what he calls ``10 myths of the anti-smoking
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   These range from ``1. The tobacco companies hid the truth about
the hazards and addictiveness of cigarettes from the American
public,'' to ``3. People smoke because of advertising,'' to ``5.
Secondhand smoke poses a grave threat to bystanders,'' to ``10.
Once people have started smoking, nicotine addiction prevents them
from stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Then if you turn to the beginning of Sullum's final chapter, you
find in an epigraph quoting H.L. Mencken's ``Prejudices'' the
following sentences, which amount to the crux of ``For Your Own
Good'': ``The true aim of medicine is not to make men virtuous; it
is to safeguard and rescue them from the consequences of their
vices. The physician does not preach repentance; he offers
absolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the list of so-called myths and the Mencken quotation
succinctly summarize the basic argument of Sullum's book. This is
that in their zeal to stamp out the use of tobacco in the United
States, anti-smokers have imposed an ideal of public health that
not only excludes disease or infirmity but also includes ``complete
physical, mental and social well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   To support this crusade, Sullum argues, they have made the
claims he characterizes as myths, which because of their
speciousness add up to the message ``You shouldn't smoke because
it's bad for you.'' He concludes, ``A government empowered to
maximize health is a totalitarian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reason for starting at the end of ``For Your Own Good''
is not that its author is in any way evasive in the earlier part of
his book. A senior editor at Reason magazine and a syndicated
columnist, Sullum is meticulously logical, and his conclusions are
implicit in everything he argues. The trouble is that he's so
careful to be fair and balanced that you sometimes lose track of
exactly what he's driving at.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he emphasizes at length how harmful cigarettes are
to one's health, listing lung cancer, coronary occlusion and the
many other diseases that are almost certainly caused by smoking.
Only in this context does he make the point that as far as the cost
of smoking imposed on society is concerned, ``smokers consume less
health care in old age than nonsmokers because they tend to die
earlier.'' He adds, ``They also spend less time in nursing homes
and take less money out of Social Security and pension funds.'' For
instance, he examines so meticulously the various studies on the
effects of advertising on smokers of various ages that you lose
sight of his point that, as he eventually puts it, ``there is
remarkably little evidence that advertising plays an important role
in getting people to smoke, as opposed to getting them to smoke a
particular brand.'' (Strangely, in comparing the influences of
various cartoon characters used in advertising, he wholly neglects
to consider the sexual reference apparent in the physiognomy of Joe
Camel and its influence as a potentially subliminal persuader.)
</P>
<P>
   And in his examination of secondhand smoke, he seems to stress
so emphatically how irritating to nonsmokers it can be that you are
taken aback by his conclusion that because its actual harmfulness
has actually not been proven, the government ought not to ban
smoking in public places. ``By stepping in and imposing the same
smoking policy on everyone,'' Sullum writes, ``the government
destroys diversity _ the potential to satisfy a wide variety of
tastes and preferences, not just the majority's.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while his logic may seem sound from point to point, the
overall impact of his argument leaves something out. Contrary to
his insistence that all smokers take up the habit fully aware of
its consequences to their health, I myself and the people I knew
started smoking as teen-agers in the early 1950s because the
culture sent us a message that the benefits outweighed the risks.
The worst we heard was the folk wisdom that smoking might stunt
your growth. But to offset that, as Sullum is the first to admit,
everything in the culture of the 1940s and '50s, from movies to
entertainers to the words of popular songs, reassured us that
smoking would in various ways improve our lives. Cigarette smoke
was quite literally everywhere in the air we breathed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later I quit because my doctor handed me an
electrocardiogram with evidence of damage that cigarettes were very
likely causing. To do so was relatively easy. What had changed?
Sullum says nothing really; people have always known that
cigarettes are harmful, and they have always chosen to smoke
despite this knowledge. The only difference was the totalitarian
zeal of the nonsmoking majority to impose its will on the smoking
minority.
</P>
<P>
   But I was aided by the negative message about smoking that the
culture was now sending. I was happy to be able to quit, and I
appreciate going into public places and not having to breathe other
people's smoke, whether it is harmful or not. To me things are
better now than they were when I smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean I'm in favor of prohibition, as Sullum implies
must be the view of anyone who favors the present state of things?
Absolutely not; his case against a total ban, whether applied to
liquor, drugs or tobacco, is convincing. So maybe there are
harmless degrees of the zealotry that he considers inevitably
totalitarian. Maybe the totalitarianism he is worried about is like
his characterization of the smoking habit itself: a little of it
won't hurt you; only when it exceeds a certain limit does it begin
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is to Sullum's considerable credit that he has made us
even think about totalitarianism in this most unlikely context. By
the end he has made at least plausible his attack on what he calls
the ``collectivist'' public health movement. As he concludes: ``Of
all the risk factors for disease and injury, it seems, freedom is
the most pernicious. And you thought it was smoking.''

 &HT;    USE OF ANONYMOUS SOURCES NECESSARY, JOURNALISTS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With newspaper headlines and network newscasts
blaring that Monica Lewinsky is ready to testify that she and
President Clinton engaged in a cover-up of their sexual affair, a
White House spokesman warned journalists Wednesday to take what
they hear ``with a grain of salt till you know what the facts
are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you don't know what the facts are,'' press secretary Mike
McCurry cautioned the White House press corps. ``You don't know
factually anything about what she's going to testify other than
what you've been told by anonymous sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the story broke six months ago, anonymous sources have
fueled the coverage of the alleged sexual relationship between the
president and a young White House intern and independent counsel
Ken Starr's investigation of whether there was a subsequent illegal
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   This week's developments are no different, as virtually all news
organizations quoted anonymous sources _ such as ``lawyers familiar
with her account'' _ in reporting what Lewinsky will tell a federal
grand jury under an immunity deal with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents said they are comfortable with the credibility of
informed people who won't talk if publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not anonymous sources to us,'' said Claire Shipman,
White House correspondent for NBC News. ``We know very well'' who
these people are, what their motivations are for talking and what
their past veracity has been, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us likes to use anonymous sources, but
that's the reality of working in Washington,'' said Shipman. ``It's
an unfortunate fact of this investigation that nobody wants to go
on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel queasy or uneasy at all'' about not identifying
sources, said Scott Pelley, the CBS News White House correspondent.
``I know who the sources are. I know we have multiple sources. ...
I know our reporting has been very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jonathan Wolman, Washington bureau chief for the
Associated Press, conceded to some misgivings about the reliance of
unnamed sources on such an important _ and potentially historic _
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are reluctant to use them,'' said Wolman, whose
bureau cited ``legal sources'' in its Lewinsky report. ``Our
preference by a mile is to quote and identify our sources of
information by name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it would be better to use sources who are on the
record'' publicly, agreed Len Downie, executive editor of the
Washington Post. ``But it's easy to understand why people supplying
us with information'' don't want to be identified. ``I'm satisfied
that our sources are excellent'' on the Lewinsky story, he said.
``I know who they are,'' Downie said, adding that he usually does
know the sources on stories of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance on anonymous sources is ``just the way life works'' in
Washington journalism, said ABC News White House Correspondent Sam
Donaldson. ``We can't get the information that the public wants and
needs without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, news organizations decree that they won't use
unnamed sources, but inevitably they change because they get beat
on too many stories, said Donaldson. ``In the theoretical world,
everything is on the record. But we're talking about the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN White House correspondent Wolf Blitzer said, ``You have to
make a judgment call. Are your viewers better off getting
information, attributed to anonymous sources, or better off being
kept in the dark?''
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents have a stake in insuring that their anonymous
sources are truthful, said Blitzer. The reporter's credibility is
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect science. Most reporters have been burned
from time to time by an anonymous source,'' he said. ``But that
source winds up burning himself'' because he loses his media
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers are pretty skeptical'' about anonymous sources, he
conceded. `` All of us in the national news media hope to build up
a reservoir of trust with viewers or readers. I'd like to think
that when viewers of CNN see me personally, they believe'' a news
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public makes a choice on which news organizations to
trust,'' said Pelley of CBS. ``You have to have a bond of trust
with the audience that, 'We can't tell you who the sources are but
that we trust these sources'.''

   However, Jonathan Wolman, Washington bureau chief for the
Associated Press, conceded to some misgivings about the reliance of
unnamed sources on such an important _ and potentially historic _
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly are reluctant to use them,'' said Wolman, whose
bureau cited ``legal sources'' in its Lewinsky report. ``Our
preference by a mile is to quote and identify our sources of
information by name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it would be better to use sources who are on the
record'' publicly, agreed Len Downie, executive editor of the
Washington Post. ``But it's easy to understand why people supplying
us with information'' don't want to be identified. ``I'm satisfied
that our sources are excellent'' on the Lewinsky story, he said.
``I know who they are,'' Downie said, adding that he usually does
know the sources on stories of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance on anonymous sources is ``just the way life works'' in
Washington journalism, said ABC News White House Correspondent Sam
Donaldson. ``We can't get the information that the public wants and
needs without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, news organizations decree that they won't use
unnamed sources, but inevitably they change because they get beat
on too many stories, said Donaldson. ``In the theoretical world,
everything is on the record. But we're talking about the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN White House correspondent Wolf Blitzer said, ``You have to
make a judgment call. Are your viewers better off getting
information, attributed to anonymous sources, or better off being
kept in the dark?''
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents have a stake in insuring that their anonymous
sources are truthful, said Blitzer. The reporter's credibility is
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect science. Most reporters have been burned
from time to time by an anonymous source,'' he said. ``But that
source winds up burning himself'' because he loses his media
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers are pretty skeptical'' about anonymous sources, he
conceded. `` All of us in the national news media hope to build up
a reservoir of trust with viewers or readers. I'd like to think
that when viewers of CNN see me personally, they believe'' a news
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public makes a choice on which news organizations to
trust,'' said Pelley of CBS. ``You have to have a bond of trust
with the audience that, 'We can't tell you who the sources are but
that we trust these sources'.''

THE BIG HIT THAT WASN'T: SMASHING PUMPKINS TAKES STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Smashing Pumpkins performed at the
Universal Amphitheater here on July 1, Billy Corgan, the band's
bald singer and guitarist, made a strange comment. He called the
group's latest record, ``Adore'' (Virgin), ``the most misunderstood
album since `Gish.''' (Gish was the band's first record, released
in 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   Coming from the mouth of the leader of one of the biggest
alternative-rock bands of the decade, the singer of lines like
``I'm forever broken,'' the sentiment may not have been a huge
surprise. But behind it was the frustration not just of an artist
who feels his work has been misjudged, but of a man who feels the
music world _ his world _ has willfully turned its back on him as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the record came out and didn't explode right off the
block, all those people that had been proven wrong by the band
commercially in the past went, `Oh well, another one down the
tubes,''' Corgan said, speaking from the set of a video shoot here.
(``Adore'' entered the Billboard charts at No. 2 but has sold much
more slowly than the band's previous album, ``Mellon Collie and the
Infinite Sadness.'')
</P>
<P>
   It sold 499,000 copies in its first six weeks compared with
839,000 for the double disc ``Mellon Collie.'' In the meantime
reviews have ranged from scathing to respectful. Radio play of the
first single has been modest and some snide people in the industry
are calling the album ``A Bore'' instead of ``Adore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all candor, I've been really surprised how quick the world
turns on you,'' he continued. ``It's staggering. I can't get into
the specific politics, but all I can tell you is that the moment
that your stuff doesn't keep rolling, the wind blows cold real
fast. I'm not just talking about the media, I'm talking about the
inner workings of my world.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectation _ a dangerous word _ before ``Adore'' was
released was that it would be the mythical great rock album.
Critics and fans alike have been impatiently waiting for the great
rock album, the new record that would make rock-and-roll matter
again, would make it exciting again: the next ``Wall'' or ``Sgt.
Pepper,'' or the next ``Nevermind the Bollocks'' (the Sex Pistols)
or ``Nevermind'' (Nirvana). (Notice that these latter titles are
denials as opposed to affirmations like ``Adore.'')
</P>
<P>
   Why do we even need a great rock-and-roll album, a success
commercially, critically and viscerally? We didn't a few years ago.
But now rock _ at least the music on the radio and the charts _ is
on the whole boring again.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Smashing Pumpkins did not make the great
rock-and-roll album. But take heart, ``Adore,'' a diverse record
that replaces the band's big guitar-driven sound with more subtle
electronics and ballads, was never intended to be the great
rock-and-roll album.
</P>
<P>
   The band's previous album, the ambitious two-CD ``Mellon Collie
and the Infinite Sadness,'' was the band's shot at immortality.
With alternative-rock past its creative summit but at its peak of
mass acceptance, the timing was right.
</P>
<P>
   Corgan put everything he had into what he felt would be his
crowning moment, if not the crowning moment of rock in the '90s. It
resulted in a great rock-and-roll album (not the great one, but we
didn't need that then because rock was doing fine), which generated
five singles still being played on the radio and helped the
Smashing Pumpkins replace Pearl Jam as the biggest rock band in the
world at that moment. The challenge of ``Adore'' was: what do you
do after the party?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of person who can close my eyes and pretend
like it's still '93,'' Corgan said of the year the band broke into
the mainstream. ``It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of what he feels is alternative rock's failed potential
to define and motivate a generation the way '60s rock did, he
continued: ``It's all such a wash. This sounds very dreamy and
hypothetical, but if Kurt Cobain had lived and continued to make
great albums as he would have, and if Alice in Chains and
Soundgarden were still making music, there would have been a little
more of an us-vs.-them situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that artistically we all could have been in a stronger
position, and certainly could have had a little bit more say about
how things were going. But now there's no us, and there's just all
them. So you look out into the sea and you go, `Now what?'''
</P>
<P>
   For Corgan, the answer is to return to his roots. ``I do feel
like I came from Alternative World,'' he said. ``And I needed to go
back to what I understand as my alternative world. If that's the
music of the Cure and New Order, that's fine. But I've gone back
and started again, and if that means rebuilding then it means
rebuilding. Not every team wins the pennant every year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The band's original plan for ``Adore'' was to release the record
and then, instead of committing to the usual two years of touring
and promoting the record around the world, return to the studio in
September and record a new record. Corgan said he was sticking to
the plan and already had another album planned out, but he had not
imagined that the rules of the game would be so inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a grace period here,'' he said. ``I thought
we could coast a little, and I think we've been reminded that there
will be no coasting. It's just not like that right now. I can't try
to make another album with everyone thinking I got buried on the
last one. So I'm going to prove everybody wrong before I go on. Or
at least feel I proved them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Burnstein, a manager of the Smashing Pumpkins, said he had
had many discussions with Corgan about the record's failure to live
up to their commercial expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's really happy about going through this right
now, and truthfully neither am I,'' Burnstein said. ``He wants
people to have more of an open mind about the album. I said to him,
listen, if you were David Bowie or Queen or Bob Dylan, over the
years you've had a lot of misinterpretation too. But the record has
often been set straight in terms of rock history 20 years later,
though it hasn't helped at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what has made the experience even harder for Corgan is
that in the period when the band is receiving much less attention,
it is engaging in one of its nobler pursuits. It is donating the
money from each concert on its current tour to a youth-oriented
charity _ not just the profits, but the entire face value of each
ticket (except for shows in a few cities, where a concert hall
rental fee is being paid).
</P>
<P>
   Corgan said this would insure that each charity organization
receives at least $100,000. Revenue from the band's performances
Saturday and Sunday nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York
City will go to Hale House in Harlem, which takes care of abandoned
and neglected children. By tour's end, Burnstein estimates, the
band will have paid $1.5 million in concert production and travel
expenses out of its own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The band's previous tour was remembered for something much
different. Before a performance in New York City two years ago, a
touring keyboardist with the group, Jonathan Melvoin, lethally
overdosed and the band's drummer, Jimmy Chamberlin, was arrested
for drug possession. He was kicked out of the band afterward, which
is one reason the sound has changed on its new record. It
incorporates a variety of drummers and drum machines in 16
uncharacteristically life-affirming songs and meditations on love.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person asked me, `Wasn't this album all about death and
your mother?''' said Corgan, whose mother died last year. ``I said,
`No, this album is about somebody who decided rather then live in a
hole to climb out of the hole.'''
</P>
<P>
   Corgan feels confident ``Adore'' is an album ahead of its time,
as he felt ``Gish'' was. But a lack of positive reinforcement can
play havoc with self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kicked us in the head,'' Corgan said of the response to the
album. ``There's that sick thing where you feel like you can reach
for that one last brass ring, but you've got to realize that you're
not of that DNA and there are some people that are. And do you
really want it anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   And what is that brass ring? ``We've had huge, huge alternative
songs: we've made it onto the greatest hits of the grunge era,'' he
said. ``But if you look at us in a completely crass, objective way,
the one thing we have not achieved is we have not had Top 10 songs.
We've reached that fork in the road where you're either going to go
in that direction or you're going to continue to build as a band
like U2 and REM did.''
</P>
<P>
   Of fame, Corgan said that ``the only thing I fear is that it is
like a missile or a satellite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it slows down too much, you start to fall out of orbit,''
he said. ``I don't want to really exist falling out of orbit. I
either want to burn out or be a cult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I either want to be one of the biggest rock stars in the world
or I'd rather be Alex Chilton,'' he said of the iconoclastic former
singer in the influential and obscure power-pop group Big Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in the middle at all,'' Corgan added.
``Give me glory or give me a packed club with people who appreciate
the nuances.'' &QL;

 &HT;    BR5-49's shtick sliding into stale lines
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not a fan of BR5-49? How terribly unhip. At least that's what
the Nashville hype machine would have you think. In its two years
since being signed to a major label, the campy Nashville band has
toured with Bob Dylan, schmoozed with Conan O'Brien and been
featured on MTV. It's probably because these guys are masters at
imaging _ from the cheeky name (taken from a running Junior Samples
gag on TV's ``Hee Haw'') to the throwback string ties to the
plastic-deer yard art on the album cover.
</P>
<P>
   But, on this new album, the posturing is coming at the expense
of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Stray Cats or Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, BR5-49 has plopped
down in a musical era _ in this case, 1950s big-twang,
cigarettes-and-ashtrays country _ which it excavates like an
obsessed college kid in a vintage clothing store. In the past, it's
worked. The band's first two releases were fresh and fun, if a bit
raw. The production is much tighter here, but the joke is wearing
thin. Gary Bennett's twangy lead vocals are so exaggerated that
it's like listening to 14 tracks of Gomer Pyle saying ``Shazam!''
Most of the cuts are swing-based (is this the new marketing
direction?) rather than barroom, making the album extremely
repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. BR5-49 has proven that it can pull off the retro sound
with style. But peel away the packaging and promotion, and this CD
is more like an aging lava lamp _ the novelty is starting to wear
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Backyard Beat Show''
</P>
<P>
   BR5-49. Arista. 14 tracks
</P>

   The verdict: Cartoonish country falls short of this band's
potential.

 &HT;    Oddball formula carries over to Zippers' latest
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accidental geniuses of counterprogramming, the members of the
Chapel Hill, N.C., outfit Squirrel Nut Zippers went over big time
on modern-rock radio by being the exception to the rule. The rule
was, and still is, a half-hearted shotgun marriage of Nirvana 'n'
Hootie that goes down as smoothly at the Gap as at the local
college beer barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell,'' the Zippers' breakthrough novelty hit, worked
precisely because it wasn't like that or anything else. And, though
the band's Dixieland-meets-Cab-Calloway revival was gosh-awful
quaint, it was close enough in retro spirit to the nostalgic
lounge/swing movement to charm any card-carrying member of the
Martini Nation. Shaken or stirred, these Tar Heels were a sleeper
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The band's sophomore album, ``Perennial Favorites,'' is a
cheerfully oddball affair that won't catch any newly won fans
off-guard. Champagne visions of Lawrence Welk and Billie Holiday
bubble through a dozen new tunes, which evoke the antic spirit of
old cartoon soundtracks, the bluster of polka and the brassy tones
of a dime-store Duke Ellington. The lighthearted humor (``The Suits
Are Picking Up the Bill,'' ``Fat Cat Keeps Getting Fatter'') that
makes the music so effortlessly likable also renders it bland,
however, which makes me wonder why the Zippers didn't tinker more
with their formula. The effort's made: For a few seconds, here and
there, the band indulges a music-box dementia that sounds like, oh,
Stephen Foster hijacked by a gamelan orchestra, or Bartok enjoying
a healthy pinch of Red Man. Yo, Beck: Are you up for a remix?
</P>

   Audio reviews: the word on the latest sounds
</P>
<P>
   By Richard L. Eldredge, Doug Hamilton, Al Levine, Sonia Murray,
and Nick Tatec. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   -- POP
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria!''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Estefan. Epic/Sony.16 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   With ``Gloria!,'' Cuban-born Gloria Estefan temporarily leaves
her trademark sappy adult contemporary ballads to Sony sister
Celine Dion. ``Gloria!'' successfully merges Estefan's high-energy
urges with today's top dance mix masters. The result is a nonstop
dance workout as all the Latin-flavored tracks segue into one
another. The first single, ``Heaven's What I Feel,'' has already
made a big club dent in its remixed form, so look for the Wyclef
Jean-penned and remixed ``Don't Release Me,'' also featuring a rap
from Jean, to follow. ``Gloria!'' also represents the first
successful attempt to satisfy both the singer's U.S. and Cuban fan
bases. Four of the album's best tracks come in both English and
Spanish versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dopamine''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Froom. Atlantic. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of producing and arranging, Mitchell Froom steps
out from behind the mixing board to make an album of extraordinary
wit and originality. Cross MTV's ``Liquid Television'' with David
Lynch and you get a feel for this West Coast keyboard whiz's weird
cinematic style. A handful of famous friends, including wife
Suzanne Vega, lend their vocals to this collaborative enterprise,
but in Froom's hands they leave familiar territory behind. Vega's
vocals on the club-friendly title track are menacing and seductive.
Sheryl Crow's piercing ``Monkey Mind'' has a sci-fi appeal. And Ron
Sexsmith's ``Overcast'' is surrealistic Gershwin. ``Dopamine''
covers a ton of musical territory in just 30 minutes. Some of it is
chilling, most of it is quirky and all of it is delightful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers'' soundtrack
</P>
<P>
   Various artists.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks Records. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   As aggressive as rap tends to be, pairing it with similarly
powered rock 'n' roll was a virtual no-brainer. The smarts came in
on the ``Small Soldiers'' soundtrack when the creators asked
hip-hop artists Bone Thugs-N-Harmony to match their lulling rhymes
with Flea's muscular guitar on their dynamic re-creation of Edwin
Starr's ``War.'' Rapper-producer Wyclef Jean tag-teaming with the
late Freddie Mercury on Queen's ``Another One Bites the Dust'' is
another heavyweight champ. And that's it. Instead of continuing a
concept that really works, this ebbs into a remix project that

   ``Under the Radar''
</P>
<P>
   Little Feat. CMC International Records. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Of course Little Feat will never be the same without Lowell
George. When the fitfully brilliant writer of such 1970s radio
classics as ``Willin''' died in 1979, he took with him the
critic's-darling status his band had enjoyed. Since the surviving
members regrouped in 1988, Little Feat has become a technically
solid, crowd-pleasingly slick blues/R&AMP;B act. The latest album
boasts more lively jams and adventurous asides than you'd expect
from an act nearly 30 years old. Too bad about the cliched lyrics.
The group's vivid history should inspire more than hackneyed
platitudes such as the title track's ``I'd walk on fire to get back
to you.''

<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   On her second album, Mindy McCready underscores the themes that
marked her debut: female independence and orneriness. But the act
is getting a little old. She scored with ``10,000 Angels'' and
``Guys Do It All the Time,'' and her new lyrics have the same
message. On ``What If I Do,'' she asks, ``What if I do, will he
love me more; what if I don't, will he walk out the door?'' And
then there's ``This is me, take or leave it; my own girl, you
better believe it.'' By the time she coos seductively in ``Only a
Whisper,'' we're tired of the tease.

 &HT;    Levert sings from heart_ of aches and breaks
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald Levert has made a career out of beautifully singing what
some men struggle to say. Instead of an unimaginative come-on, he
coyly asks the object of his affection to ``School Me.'' When his
peers were speaking of relationships as an unnecessary evil,
Levert, in his big, palpable baritone, proclaimed, ``I'd give
anything and everything to fall in love.''
</P>
<P>
   But, obviously, love is a struggle. And instead of a well-penned
metaphor or a primary focus on the hearts and flowers of romance,
Levert's third album is mostly heartbreak and frustration laid
surprisingly bare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing hurts like a woman with dreams that don't involve
you,'' he says on ``What About Me.'' That's clear, because the
conviction Levert once used to describe pleasant matters of the
heart is now applied to songs of infidelity (``Thinkin' Bout It'')
and breakups (``Taking Everything'').
</P>
<P>
   At times, his focus on pain and his frequent use of cliches is
almost distancing, but Levert's storytelling ability lures you in,
particularly on ``That's the Way I Feel About You,'' a duet with
his peer in ache, Mary J. Blige. Next thing you know, tears are
dropping in your ear again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love &AMP; Consequences''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Levert. Eastwest.
</P>
<P>
   13 tracks
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: If this really is Gerald Levert's much-rumored
adieu ... whew.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Giamatti homes in on a pithy parallel well worth noting
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a posthumous collection of essays titled ``A Great and
Glorious Game'' (Algonquin, $14.95), the late A. Bartlett Giamatti,
Renaissance scholar, one-time president of Yale University,
one-time commissioner of major-league baseball, wrote that the game
he loved was, above all else, a metaphor for going home. And not
just about arriving, but ``how hard it is to get there and how
driven is our need. It tells us how good home is. Its wisdom says
you can go home again but that you cannot stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Giamatti, as many know, was the game's hymnist, given to
mythopoetic musings far removed from the coarse calculations of Jim
Leyland, the monstrous swings of Mark McGwire, the blithe spirit of
Andruw Jones. There have always been poets in the press box, but
Giamatti discerned in the game's slow progress through nine innings
intimations of something Homeric.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to be sure, ground that has been plowed and replowed to
the point of exhaustion. Yet it's worth asking why the national
pastime should give the idea of home so central a place. Football
has its end zone, sacred ground to be struggled and striven for,
defended like Stalingrad one minute, laid siege to the next. But
``end zone'' strikes no chords. It conjures up the battlefield, not
the place we speak of habitually, even if we must search our hearts
to find it.
</P>
<P>
   An American concept
</P>
<P>
   ``The word home,'' Reynolds Price wrote some years back, ``is an
obsession of the American language, not the English. In four years
of living in England, I never heard an Englishman use the word
hometown,for instance.'' And modern French, Spanish and Italian,
though they have words meaning ``house'' and others suggesting
``hearth,'' apparently have none equivalent to the word Americans
find need for many times a day: homemade, homemaker, home breaker,
homecoming, home free, homebound, homeless, homesick ... home.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same notion that Witold Rybczynski developed at
greater length in his book ``Home: A Short History of an Idea.''
Rybczynski, an architect-turned-social historian, didn't draw upon
the baseball diamond for evidentiary support, but his book could
have been a brief against the sterility of the steel-and-beam
structures built in the '60s _ stadiums that Turner Field and
Camden Yards are reactions against.
</P>
<P>
   Where Giamatti's was a metaphorical (and perhaps metaphysical)
view, Rybczynski's was an apologia for simple human comfort
(``During the six years of my architectural education, the subject
of comfort was mentioned only once.'').
</P>
<P>
   People have been living in houses for eons, but they've been at
home for a comparatively short time. When Europe was emerging from
the Middle Ages, a middle-class household accommodated not just an
immediate family but also a gaggle of servants, apprentices,
friends and proteges, everyone eating, cooking and sleeping
together like vagabonds. Not until the 16th century did dwellings
acquire anything resembling furniture: a bed, stiff-backed chairs,
a cushion or two, a rude table for eating. It would be still
another century, in the Netherlands, before separate rooms were set
aside for meals and sleeping, but at least people had begun to live
in houses and not simply camp in them.
</P>
<P>
   A yearning for domesticity
</P>
<P>
   In time, the French would produce overstuffed furniture, built
with comfort consciously in mind. And the English, in the Georgian
period, would carry developments further with interior designs that
continue to influence modern living. But for humble domesticity we
thank the broom-whisking Dutch, who, as Rybczynski wrote, ``brought
together the meanings of house and of household, of dwelling and of
refuge, of ownership and affection. ... You could walk out of the
house, but always returned home.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the idea of home was born, corollary notions of convenience
and efficiency, leisure and ease took shape also. Yet, true as all
this is, most of us understand by ``home'' something more than
day-to-day comfort. We understand something of what Reynolds Price
described. In the United States, a person may have several homes in
a lifetime _ stops along the way to somewhere else, each invested
with the emotions (not to mention toil and sweat) that yearn for
permanence.
</P>
<P>
   Home, in so mobile a society as ours, thus means many things,
from place of birth to wherever we're hanging our hat at the
moment. But if it means anything, it means a bulwark against
rootlessness. And once we are uprooted, it becomes another place we
left behind, the cold ground in which our past remains. There's
comfort even in that, but only when secured by the warm hard earth
of home underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   When it is not, as Giamatti wrote in ``A Great and Glorious
Game,'' ``the journey must always start once more, the bat an oar
over our shoulder, until there is an end to all journeying.'' Until
we've reached home, one day for good.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Camp meeting a tradition worth keeping
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost camp meeting time in Georgia. Those crops that the
heat and drought haven't burned up are, in the poetic phrase, laid
by. It's almost time to put the chairs in the wagon, hitch the milk
cow to the tailgate and head for Old Salem or New Hope or blessed
Shiloh campground.
</P>
<P>
   But until camp meeting starts, there are decoration days at
small churches all over the state. I have been to a few, and I can
report that the time spent decorating old graves and remembering
the departed is only a part of it. There's food and singing and
reunioning to sustain body and spirit for another year.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Monroe ``Buddy'' Stamps, who calls himself my banker
emeritus (he left Roswell(Ga.)'s Citizens and Southern Bank, where
he was manager, soon after we moved out there), had the advantage
of growing up where camp meeting and decoration day were major
summertime events.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``My grandmother had been a dyed-in-the-wool
foot-washing, hard-shell Baptist in her younger days, so my mother
and dad would make the annual pilgrimage to the old home place each
summer, somewhere around Bowdon Junction in west Georgia, so that
Mama could visit with her old friends. It was a joyous occasion
beginning early on the appointed Sunday morning and lasting until
sunset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families would begin arriving early, some in trucks, a good
many in one- or two-horse wagons with kitchen chairs set in the
beds, and all loaded with baskets and boxes of food, some of which
had been in preparation all week long. Enough fried chicken,
country ham, fried pies and cakes to feed the whole 7th Cavalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old country church was situated in a beautiful grove of
hardwood trees, and soon the entire grove would be crowded with
wagons, trucks, cars, mules, dogs and people, all dressed in their
Sunday best, as the men set up tables and the womenfolk sorted out
the food. The small fry ran in and out, playing tag and other games
and occasionally snatching a fried pie left momentarily
unguarded.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``Inside the little church could be heard the
sweet sound of `fa-so-la' singing, replaced periodically by real
down-home, pulpit-pounding preaching. At some point, the
foot-washing would take place. This went on much of the day, with
people moving in and out of the church at will, and outside would
be heard the cries of recognition as friends found each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunioning isn't remembered so happily as the food,
according to Mr. Stamps. Every small child was ``fair game to every
lady on the grounds,'' he reported. They were scooped up,
``enveloped in a pair of strong motherly arms, clutched to a soft,
billowy bosom, and hugged near to asphyxiation amid the acrid fumes
of `Evening in Paris' dusting powder.''
</P>
<P>
   When the preacher announces that it's dinner time (lunch is
unknown in the country), ``the feeding frenzy begins among the
trees,'' Buddy tells us. ``Children are fed and admonished, July
flies abound, hound dogs beg and receive chicken bones. ... Teenage
girls and boys shyly find each other amidst giggles and flaming
cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The after-dinner preaching and singing end as the sun begins to
go down. ``It's all over. Collection is collected, benediction is
given, final goodbyes said, and everyone promises to meet again
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   It strikes me as a country fete worth preserving, better by far
than television and maybe even the Sunday papers.

 &HT;    `Dark City' a hellish haven for intrepid sci-fi fans
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dark City'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   This mesmerizing sci-fi labyrinth from the makers of ``The
Crow'' unfolds with the creepy (il)logic of a nightmare. Rufus
Sewell plays an amnesiac who wakes ups in a bathtub with a dead
woman nearby. He doesn't know who he is, or for that matter where
he is.
</P>
<P>
   This city is a sunless place of neo-noir detectives (William
Hurt, for one) and voluptuous retro girls, personified by Jennifer
Connelly as the woman Sewell thinks may be his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there are these creepy bald aliens in black trench coats
with the power to put all the city's humans (except Sewell) into a
trance and morph the entire skyline into a new shape.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing science fiction, pulp mysteries and existential dilemmas
into one attractive package, ``Dark City'' is that rare movie that
makes you believe in a different world. It deserves to become a
cult classic. One drawback: Kiefer Sutherland almost kills the
flick with his freak-show performance as a toady of the evil ETs.

 &HT;    Delving into Hayley Mills: There's much more than `Parent Trap'
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood toys with remaking ``Casablanca'' and we don't even
blink. Another ``It's a Wonderful Life''? Hey, what would be
wonderful-er?
</P>
<P>
   But remake ``The Parent Trap''? Now they've gone too far. The
classic 1961 comedy, about identical twins scheming to reunite
their divorced parents, made millions for Walt Disney's film
company and turned 15-year-old star Hayley Mills into a household
name, household name. (She played both parts.)
</P>
<P>
   While her six Disney movies were hugely popular, their success
boomeranged on Mills in a way. At 20, she did a nude scene in ``The
Family Way,'' and some fans had trouble reconciling it with her
innocent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Family Way'' is among our recommended Mills movies on
video:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Tiger Bay'' (1959)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A hyper-imaginative girl witnesses a murder and
befriends the killer. No one believes her, and the situation
spirals out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: John Mills, Horst Buchholz.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley, yeah! Originally the part called for a boy. But while
visiting distinguished actor John Mills, the filmmakers were taken
with his 12-year-old daughter Hayley, and a rewrite quickly
followed.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Pollyanna'' (1960)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: An orphan moves in with her aunt, who's rich,
cold and living in a town where almost nobody gets along. But the
relentlessly cheerful little girl with the curls soon changes all
that.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: Jane Wyman (post-Ronald Reagan, pre-``Falcon
Crest''), Karl Malden, Agnes (``Bewitched'') Moorehead.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley , yeah! Mills' special Academy Award for an outstanding
juvenile performance was presented by _ speaking of relentlessly
cheerful girls with curls _ Shirley Temple.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Whistle Down the Wind'' (1961)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Three emotionally needy British children find a
mysterious man hiding in their barn and believe he's Jesus Christ.
Children come from miles around to meet him and to keep his
presence a secret from doubting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: Alan Bates, Bernard Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley, yeah! This black-and-white movie was based on a novel
written by Mary Hayley Bell, Hayley's mother. Sir Andrew Lloyd
Webber's musical version recently opened in London.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Chalk Garden'' (1964)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A troubled teenager living in her grandmother's
seaside mansion spends her days setting fires and getting five
governesses fired. When a mysterious No. 6 arrives, a fierce battle
of wills ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: Deborah Kerr, John Mills, Edith Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley, yeah! Earlier, Kerr had won an Oscar nomination for
``The King and I.'' Last year, Hayley Mills toured American
theaters in the same role Kerr played.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Trouble With Angels'' (1966)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Comic misadventures of a group of fun-loving
girls at a convent boarding school. They don't really want to be
there, so there's no chance that any of them will decide to become
nuns _ is there?
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: Rosalind Russell, Gypsy Rose Lee (!), Jim Hutton,
June Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley, yeah! This spawned a sequel, ``Where Angels Go ...
Trouble Follows'' (1968). Mills wasn't in it, maybe because she
didn't want to co-star with Stella Stevens, Arthur Godfrey and
Milton Berle.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Family Way'' (1966)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: Young newlyweds' problems, from impotence
(before Viagra) to _ worse _ moving in with the in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: Hywel Bennett, John Mills (him again!), Marjorie
Rhodes, Murray Head.
</P>
<P>
   Who did the music: The score was written by the ``cute'' Beatle
himself, Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley, yeah! Mills ended up marrying the film's 53-year-old
director, Roy Boulting, in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Endless Night'' (1971)
</P>
<P>
   What it's about: A chauffeur marries a rich American girl, and
they move into their dream house. It's based on an Agatha Christie
mystery, so guess how the dream turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Who's in it: George Sanders, Hywel Bennett, Britt Ekland, Peter
Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   Hayley, yeah! In the movie, once again she's married to her
``Family Way'' spouse, Bennett. Don't these two ever learn?

 &HT;    Mini views: Short reviews of new video releases
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``The Gingerbread Man'' (R) _ Yes, it has Robert Altman's
distinctive jazzy touch, and good performances from Kenneth
Branagh, Robert Downey Jr. and even Daryl Hannah. And it captures
the weighty, moist mood of Savannah 10 times better than Clint
Eastwood's awful ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' But
all these pluses can't overrule one major minus: The John
Grisham-based screenplay (cocky lawyer falls for femme fatale)
plays out like a subpar TV movie from the 1970s. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Live Flesh'' (R) _ Spanish director Pedro Almodovar isn't
having the same day-glo fun he used to have in movies like ``Women
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.'' In fact, this adaptation of
a novel by mystery writer Ruth Rendell plays it relatively
straight, though the colorful art direction still flirts with camp,
and the director's fascination with sex remains. But here it
results in serious consequences. The enjoyable, melodramatic love
quadrangle includes Javier Bardem, Francesca Neri and Angela
Molina. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Hard Rain'' (R) _ All wet. Christian Slater plays a guard
whose armored car is ambushed by bad guys (led by Morgan Freeman)
in a flooded small town. The result is an endless progression of
shootouts, chases and big waves of water. It's an action film
written so by-the-numbers that it radiates pure contempt for the
audience. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   -- ``A Brother's Kiss'' (R) _ This gritty New York drama, which
didn't get an Atlanta theatrical release, stars Nick Chinlund and
Michael Raynor as brothers who survive a rough upbringing by their
alcoholic mother (Cathy Moriarty) but grow apart as adults. Raynor
becomes a cop, Chinlund a junkie. With a cast that includes Rosie
Perez, John Leguizamo and Marisa Tomei, the movie's dead-end tale
is sometimes too familiar. But first-time director Seth Svi
Rosenfeld and the actors bring conviction to the drama. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Little Men'' (PG) _ This adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's
novel takes place at an enlightened school for boys run by Jo
(Mariel Hemingway) and her professor husband (Chris Sarandon).
Respectful, handsomely done and a bit dull, this Canadian
production has that Sunday school-lesson sheen. Grade: C

 &HT;    Reaching a destination is not nearly as important as the
journey, memoirs reveal
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A memoir recaptures place as much as the past. The geography _
psychological and physical _ that the writer travels is often a
major character in a life story.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lopez, visiting Antarctica in ``About This Life: Journeys
on the Threshold of Memory,'' describes the importance of locale:
``Over the years, one comes to measure a place ... not just for ...
the sublime pleasures it offers, but for what it teaches. The way
in which it alters our perception of the human.'' The writer of a
memoir, perhaps more necessarily than a novel's protagonist, comes
to a new understanding. Self is remade, often in the course of
writing.
</P>
<P>
   A memoir is frequently an odyssey, with motion specific or
implied in titles. So important is motion that its absence is
noteworthy. ``Still Me,'' the title of the best-selling memoir by
the suddenly paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve, has double meaning.
Though he can no longer sail or ride horses or feed himself, his
essence forges on in an internal odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   If place, as Lopez holds, alters our perception of the human, a
memoir chronicles the human alteration of perception. In the life
stories reviewed here, writers come to terms with parents and home.
As Natasha Tarpley notes in her family tale, ``Girl in the
Mirror'': ``You're constantly negotiating between where you come
from and where you think you're going.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Slow Motion: A True Story.'' By Dani Shapiro. Random House.
$23. 245 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing slow-motion about Dani Shapiro's memoir is the
title. A few paragraphs in, most readers will be so caught up in
this tale of a prodigal daughter that the pages will practically
flip themselves. Shapiro grew up in an Orthodox Jewish home in New
Jersey, but by age 23 she had ``strayed far from that home,''
dropping out of Sarah Lawrence College to become the pampered,
alcoholic mistress of Lenny, a wealthy New York lawyer. Her life
evolves into ``a series of random events that have no logical
connection.'' New York City is less the locus of her existence than
the terminus for a jet-set life.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call divides her life into before and after: Her parents
have been gravely injured in a car crash back home. As she watches
her brain-damaged father fade and her broken mother struggle to
walk, Shapiro wants to recover her old self but doesn't know how.
Hebraic prayers echo in her head, but cocaine and vodka are too
tempting, and she lives at Lenny's beck and call. His life is built
on lies, and the gradual revelation of his character, petal by
petal like an artichoke, is magisterial.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of Shapiro's characters resists caricature a la
``Portnoy's Complaint.'' This memoir, like Kathryn Harrison's ``The
Kiss'' (minus the incest), comes to terms with a sexual past, and
was written after the author married and turned to writing. But
``Slow Motion'' is notable in that religion and culture _ home _ so
patently form the desire and basis for reformation. Though
Shapiro's conversion is not religious, her confession, like St.
Augustine's, is a magnificent testament to victory over nothingness
and going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Skating to Antarctica: A Journey to the End of the World.''
By Jenny Diski. Ecco. $23.95. 250 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Writing, too, is Jenny Diski's salvation in this icily titled
memoir about coming to terms with a British childhood. ``The will
to live was not strong in my family,'' she writes. Her father was a
suicidal con man who deserts wife and daughter and dies. Her mother
at first dotes on Diski with skating lessons. ``My mother dreamed
of making me into an ice princess,'' like Sonja Henie, Diski
writes. ``What she got ... was an ice maiden.'' An instance of
sexual abuse by her mother instigates Diski's suicide attempt and
hospitalization. Helped by a foster family, she painfully
reconstructs her life, though she battles lifelong depression.
Diski marries, has a daughter, Chloe, and writes novels. She does
not see her mother for 30 years, has no idea whether she's alive
and doesn't care. Chloe, nearly an adult, decides to find her
grandmother. This angers and frightens Diski, who craves oblivion
in her entirely white bedroom, which she wants to extend ``beyond
reason.'' She decides to visit Antarctica, which represents ``a
place of absolute peace and quiet.'' As she prepares to sail toward
her geographical goal, much like Ahab searching for the white
whale, she also delves into her past, looking not for her mother
but for herself. Aboard a ship of fools and sages in the Antarctic,
she discovers that reaching the destination is not nearly so
important as the journey. Chloe, on her own odyssey, uncovers the
fate of Diski's mother. Diski's triumph over her unloving parents
lies in the book's dedication: ``For Chloe without whom.'' The
circle of hatred is broken.

<P>
   -- ``Rebuilding the Indian.'' By Fred Haefele. Riverhead.
$24.95. 210 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Even readers who don't give a dang about motorcycles will enjoy
this tale in Montana, a home of the Unabomber and the Freemen.
Muses Haefele, ``When you live in a state with 800,000 people, how
often do you hear the CNN anchor say, `Elsewhere in Montana today
...'?'' Haefele, who came of age in the 1960s, has not been notably
successful except as an arborist and in his 16-year relationship
with Caroline. His first marriage long ago went kaput, he
communicates with his grown daughter but not his messed-up son, no
one will buy his novel and his teaching job at Stanford University
dried up. Then he comes into $5,000 and decides to rebuild an
Indian, a motorcycle that went out of production in 1953. A couple
of days after he buys the basket case, Caroline finds out she's
pregnant. As the child grows within her, the Indian grows in
Haefele's garage. So does his Gold Card balance. And so does his
circle of friends, to include Bootsy, Magoo and Bummy. But
especially there's Chaz, a sort of Parts Father for motorcycle
rebuilders, with a troubled marriage and finances. Haefele would
like to get him out of his life, but they share a commitment to
Indian rebuilding and the same antidepressant. Baby Phoebe arrives
long before the Indian is ready to ride to a big meet. But much,
much more is rebuilt than a motorcycle in this rich, all-American
memoir that is as off the beaten track as Missoula.

<P>
   -- ``Tea That Burns: A Family Memoir of Chinatown.'' By Bruce
Edward Hall. Free Press. $25. 308 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Though the opening pages may recall Maxine Hong Kingston's
``Woman Warrior,'' Bruce Edward Hall's voice soon overcomes any
echoes. This re-imagined family history tells the interwoven story
of the Hor family, Manhattan's Chinatown and the Chinese in
America. Hall's great-grandfather emigrated from China in 1873,
leaving behind two wives to set up an American family on Mott
Street. Hor Poa kept his hairstyle and his connections to home, but
he also was influential in Chinatown politics. Over the decades,
the family becomes Americanized. Hall's grandfather, a bookie who
enjoys Tea That Burns (bootleg Scotch), marries a Chinese woman and
lives most of his life on Mott Street. But Hall's father weds a
Caucasian from Oklahoma, changes the family name to Hall and moves
to the suburbs. Bruce, ``a Connecticut boy ... who could eat with
chopsticks,'' feels like an insider/outsider when he attends family
celebrations in Chinatown. Yet he is powerfully attracted to the
locale, where ``I could almost smell the beginning of time,'' and
he yearns to be a tourist to the past. Hall re-creates the past so
admirably that readers will mourn a culture's diminution.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Girl in the Mirror: Three Generations of Black Women in
Motion.'' By Natasha Tarpley. Beacon. $22. 181 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley's memoir about her grandmother, her mother and herself
gloriously challenges the boundaries of the genre, using novel
techniques, poetry and even a newspaper obituary to tell the
generational tale. In the 1940s, Tarpley's grandmother Anna leaves
Alabama to join her husband in Chicago, after some fine
conversations with emptiness. Tarpley's mother, Marlene, moves from
Chicago to Boston after her husband dies, and Tarpley travels with
her mother to visit Africa in one of the book's ironic highlights.
Home, a safe place, is what Tarpley seeks. Though the memoir is in
three sections, one for each woman, it is often not chronological.
It is, however, a puzzle well worth putting together. Tarpley tells
her grandmother the reason she's writing the book: ``I'm looking at
glimpses of your life and Mom's life to see how they overlap with
and impact my own. How the past informs the present.'' If Tarpley
is more successful in rendering her mother's and grandmother's
lives than her own, it may be because the present can be more
elusive than the past. But this book reinvents memoir, infusing it
with a heartbeat you can hear and feel.

 &HT;    Long-cooking labor of love says you care
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOTR USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henrietta Stanley Dull's recipe for Brunswick stew was anything
but dull. In her 1928 book, ``Southern Cooking,'' the longtime food
editor of The Atlanta Journal began her stew with directions that
seem closer to pioneer times than ours:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thoroughly clean pig's head and feet. From the head remove the
teeth and gums, upper and lower. Place head, feet, liver and heart
into boiling water and cook slowly until meat falls from the bones
and will come to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   At least she didn't throw in eye of newt.
</P>
<P>
   We quote Mrs. Dull because, while the following recipes are
time-consuming, at least they aren't gruesome. Making stew, burgoo
or hash isn't easy. As Ray McLees, a hash man in Tryon, N.C., says:
``To go to this much trouble, you want to be making it for a good
cause, or at least for people you know _ preferably blood kin.''
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Brunswick Stew
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 3 quarts Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20 minutes, plus 3-6 hours
</P>
<P>
   This is a domesticated version of the stew my family has been
making since the 1800s. For a small batch, you can use a crockpot
and not have to worry about stirring. If you want to multiply the
recipe and make a larger batch, you'll have to use a pot and, as my
father says, ``Stir, stir, stir!''
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2pounds chicken pieces (weight includes skin and bones)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds lean ground beef (round or sirloin)
</P>
<P>
   3/4pound ground pork
</P>
<P>
   1can (28 ounces) whole tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1can (14 3/4 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   creamed corn
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup ketchup
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons ( 1/2 stick)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4teaspoon red pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt (or to taste)
</P>
<P>
   Remove skin and excess fat from chicken pieces. Place in a pot
and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer
until meat falls off bones, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain broth. After
the chicken has cooled, pick the meat from the bones, shredding
into small pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, cook the beef and pork together, stirring
often and breaking into fine pieces, until the meat is just gray.
Drain excess fat. Add chicken to beef and pork.
</P>
<P>
   Put meat mixture into a large pot or crockpot. Add the tomatoes,
corn, ketchup, vinegar, butter, black pepper, red pepper and salt.
Mix well. Cook over low heat for 3 hours, stirring from the bottom
of the pot often. (Or, if using a crockpot, cook for 5 to 6 hours
at a low setting.) Taste after an hour or so to fine-tune
seasonings.

<P>
   Virginia Brunswick Stew
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 1 1/4 gallons Preparation time: about 45 minutes
Cooking time: 2 1/2-3 hours
</P>
<P>
   The stew of Brunswick County, Va., is different from Georgia's
in that it usually contains more vegetables and fewer meats _
chicken, but rarely pork. John D. Clary, a businessman in the
county seat of Lawrenceville, cooks this often at community
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   2 3/4pounds boneless chicken
</P>
<P>
   3ounces fatback, ground
</P>
<P>
   2pounds potatoes,
</P>
<P>
   peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4pounds onions (about 4 medium), diced
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   128-ounce can crushed tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   5cups small butter beans, frozen or canned
</P>
<P>
   3cups shoe peg corn, frozen or canned, drained
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons ( 1/2 stick)
</P>
<P>
   butter
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Sugar to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   In a large stockpot, cover chicken and fatback with water, about
1/2 gallon. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat until chicken
starts to fall apart, about an hour. Add potatoes and onions,
pepper to taste, and boil until potatoes are soft. Add tomatoes and
more pepper and simmer 10 minutes. Add butter beans, bring back to
a boil and cook until they're soft, about 20 minutes. Add corn and
simmer another 30 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in butter until
it melts. Season to taste with pepper, salt and sugar.

<P>
   Moonlite Burgoo
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 1 1/2 gallons Preparation time: 30-40 minutes
Cooking time: about 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Burgoo is to Kentucky what Brunswick stew is to Georgia _ the
communal dish that used to grease the skids at political barbecues
and now shows up at church picnics and the like. The burgoo capital
has to be Owensboro, an Ohio River city that specializes in mutton
barbecue. Owensboro's numerous Catholic parishes stage enormous
fund-raising dinners; at St. Pius X's gathering in June, they
cooked 7,000 pounds of barbecue and 700 gallons of burgoo. Most
burgoo cooks in Owensboro use a recipe similar to this one from the
Moonlite Bar-B-Q Inn, the city's best-known barbecue restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   2pounds lamb shoulder
</P>

<P>
   1cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2pounds potatoes,
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   2 1/2cups corn,
</P>
<P>
   canned or frozen
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons ketchup
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups tomato puree

</P>
<P>
   1/4cup Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   (or more to taste)
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan or kettle, cook lamb in water to cover until
tender, about 2 hours. Discard broth and bones. Chop meat fine and
set aside. Meanwhile, in large stockpot, cook chicken in 1 gallon
of water until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken and set
aside. Add cabbage, onion, potatoes, corn, ketchup and an
additional 1/2 gallon of water to the chicken broth. Bring to a
boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook until
potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, chop chicken
meat, discarding bones and skin. When potatoes are tender, add
chicken, lamb, tomato puree, lemon, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce,
salt, pepper and cayenne. Return to a boil. Reduce heat to
medium-low and simmer 2 hours or more, stirring occasionally from
the bottom as it thickens.
</P>
<P>
   Burgoo is often served with bread, but crackers or corn bread
are also good.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Our tester used lamb shoulder, which is more readily
available than mutton. Some cooks add dried or frozen lima beans,
tomatoes and a little boiled shredded beef or wild game.

<P>
   Carolina Barbecue Hash
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 quarts Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 6
hours
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick stew is found from Virginia to Georgia with one big
exception: South Carolina. The equivalent there is hash. It appears
to be an adaptable concept. A few years ago, I judged a barbecue
contest with a hash category; the cooks brought everything from a
reddish gravy to a yellowish soup to something with diced apples in
it. The classic hash is a simple dish made from cooked-down pork or
beef leftovers. Dan Huntley, a columnist for The Charlotte Observer
and all-around foodie, gave us this version of a beef hash.
Properly cooked, it should have the consistency of baby food, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   5pounds beef (not counting the bone _ any cut)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds onions, diced
</P>
<P>
   1pound butter
</P>
<P>
   1to 2 tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Place the beef in a large pot, cover with water, bring to a boil
and simmer for 3 hours, replenishing water as needed. Turn off the
heat. Once the meat has cooled, tear it off the bone. Reserve
stock. Process meat and onions in a food processor. Return mixture
to the pot. Add butter, salt, pepper and reserved stock. Simmer for
3 hours, stirring often.

 &HT;    Stew wars: Brunswicks do battle
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the longest-running debates in Southern food concerns the
genesis of Brunswick stew.
</P>
<P>
   Virginians say it originated in 1828 on the banks of the
Nottoway River in Brunswick County when a slave named Jimmy
Matthews threw together some squirrel, onions and stale bread to
feed a hunting party. The Virginia Legislature endorsed the tale in
a 1988 proclamation, and markers went up around the county
declaring, ``Other states have made similar claims, but Virginia's
is the first.''
</P>
<P>
   The other states are North Carolina, which also has a Brunswick
County, and Georgia, where the city of Brunswick is no less attuned
than Virginia to the value of publicity. Brunswick, Ga., claims to
have created the stew in 1898 and displays the sacred birth caldron
at its visitors' center.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? Food historians give more credence to Virginia's
boast, although they point out that the dish probably descended
from camp stews that Indians and pioneers had improvised for years.
</P>
<P>
   But that's almost beside the point. When you've got a
good-natured public spat going, what's the sense in settling it?
Says John D. Clary, a prominent Brunswick County, Va., stewmaker:
``We're going to ride this thing for all it's worth.''

 &HT;    Georgia teen gets royal treatment as magazine modeling finalist
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right now, there's not a cloud in the sky for future
meteorologist Sheena Lutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old from Acworth, Ga. spent five days in New York
last month as one of eight national finalists _ selected from
20,000 entries nationwide _ in the Seventeen magazine and Chanel
New Model of the Year Contest.
</P>
<P>
   While her friends back home shopped at area malls, Sheena
modeled a pricey Chanel outfit, had a makeover at the trendy
Frederic Fekkai salon and ate pasta at the Fashion Cafe in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady experience for the green-eyed blonde, who saw the
contest advertised in the March issue of Seventeen and sent in two
pictures. In May, she learned she was a semifinalist. ``I was
ecstatic,'' recalls Sheena. ``I screamed and cried at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When looking at pictures, we look for diversity and
uniqueness,'' says Jennifer Shapiro of Seventeen. ``We also look
for self-confidence, which came through loud and clear in Sheena's
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Sheena and the seven other finalists must wait until the end
of this month to find out who snagged the top prize _ an appearance
on the November cover of Seventeen. Other winning perks: a five-day
trip to Paris, including tickets to a Chanel fashion show, and a
$1,000 shopping spree. Runners-up will appear as models in the
issue. And all eight will be featured in segments of
``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena is an old hand when it comes to entering magazine model
contests. She was a recent semifinalist in the YM model contest but
has not yet heard if she placed in a Teen magazine competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheena just began testing with us and so far, so good,'' says
Cathleen Gehling of Elite Models Atlanta. ``She has lots of energy,
moves well in front of the camera and has a classic look _ with an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena has a good feeling who will win the top prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I have a pretty good shot,'' says the teenager,
who likes to wear jean shorts, tank tops and metallic gray nail
polish when hanging out. ``Everyone who saw my pictures said I had
potential, and I felt comfortable during interviews with model
agency representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheena is certainly a winner in the eyes of her parents, Cindy
and Mark Lutes, and her 5-year-old sister, Calee. ``Sheena has
already won over 20,000 other girls. It (the contest) was an
eye-opening experience for her and a great opportunity, but I would
prefer for her to finish school,'' says her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Whether she becomes the cover girl or not, Sheena wants to
continue modeling. She hopes to be in front of the camera for 10
years, become famous and make lots of money. Then she plans to turn
her eyes toward predicting the weather _ which can prove almost as
fickle as a modeling career.

 &HT;    Television mores have been replaced by a new rule: Forget the
rules.
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   Comedian George Carlin's old trademark routine is ``The Seven
Dirty Words You Can't Say on TV,'' a classic bit from the '70s that
has him rattling off a string of unprintable obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, bizarro comic Bobcat
</P>
<P>
   Goldthwait is hosting a new game show on the cable network FX
that includes one of Carlin's once-forbidden phrases in its title.
And, no, we still can't print it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite chronic complaints about the lack of ``family-friendly''
programs and the adoption of a content ratings system intended to
alert viewers to potentially offensive material, Taboo TV is upon
us.
</P>
<P>
   From the profanity-laced 'toons on Comedy Central's ``South
Park'' to the syndicated slugfests on ``Jerry Springer,'' the
rigidly enforced television mores many adults grew up with have
been replaced by a new rule: Forget the rules.
</P>
<P>
   As the fall season approaches, the broadcast and cable
television schedule is liberally sprinkled with pedophilia, drug
use, hard-core violence, foul language, nudity and other topics
viewers rarely discussed 20 years ago, much less watched on the
family television set.
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of safe havens for viewers who prefer
shows that are more like a warm glass of milk than a shot of
battery acid. Later this month, PaxNET (touted as a wholesome
alternative with reruns of old shows) and Fox's revamped Family
Channel will join Nickelodeon, TV Land and the Trinity Broadcasting
Network in programming shows exclusively for small children, teens
and impressionable grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, television is no place for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A is ``Lolita,'' a film version of Vladimir Nabakov's
novel about a tortured love affair between a middle-aged college
professor and a young girl (she's 12 in the book, 14 in the movie).
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Jeremy Irons stars as the lovesick Humbert Humbert
pathetically obsessed with teenager Dominique Swain in the title
role.
</P>
<P>
   Completed two years ago, the movie was orphaned by its studio
and barred from U.S. theatrical release because the subject matter
was considered too risque for moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but tonight's debut of ``Lolita'' on the premium channel
Showtime is shaping up as the first, and splashiest movie event of
the fledgling TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Lolita'' contains no sexually explicit scenes, Irons
and Swain share several onscreen encounters that are disturbing
even by the more relaxed standards of cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Is Showtime programming chief Jerry Offsay nervous about getting
calls from cultural conservatives or protests from outraged
parents' groups? Hardly. At the recent television critics
convention in Pasadena, Calif., Offsay said viewers seem less
uptight about what's considered appropriate fare for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some radio stations gave out my office phone number as a joke
thinking I would get flooded with calls,'' Offsay said. ``I got
just one call from a concerned person who said they were praying
for me. I'm sure there will be some people who will be unhappy, but
we invite people who want to criticize (`Lolita') to see the film
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Showtime executives don't discuss Nielsen ratings,
Offsay expects the lusty ``Lolita'' to be one of the most watched
and talked about movies on the network this season, and with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which fancies itself the gold standard of pay cable
networks, is known for high-quality movies and high-minded programs
that consistently win industry awards and critical acclaim. A quick
look at its Nielsen ratings reveals that HBO viewers are fond of
documentaries, especially when they're about sex.
</P>
<P>
   The top-rated show on HBO for the period ending in June was the
documentary series ``Real Sex 19,'' followed by ``Real Sex 20.'' A
documentary about prostitution, ``Pimps Up, Ho's Down,'' was a
not-so-distant third, beating out more expensive, heavily promoted
original movies such as the Emmy-nominated ``A Bright Shining
Lie.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO's highest-rated series is ``Sex in the City,'' about a New
York newspaper columnist who covers the mating habits of horny
yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why so many of the network's highest-rated shows have
sex in their titles, HBO chairman Jeff Bewkes answered, ````Real
Sex'' has been a real draw for years. I guess that's what people
want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're not just seeing Taboo TV on pay cable. Even on
commercial television, which relies on skittish advertisers for
revenue, subjects that were considered scandalous just a year ago
are being greeted with ho-hum acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ABC sitcom star Ellen DeGeneres' decision to reveal her
homosexuality on national television created a media frenzy and a
brief ratings spike before the show was canceled, as she put it,
for being ``too gay.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, ``Ellen'' might not have been gay enough. NBC is
introducing ``Will and Grace,'' a sitcom about a male-female
friendship that raises the stakes with suggestive banter and
multiple gay characters.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to this exchange on the phone between good-looking gay
lawyer Will and gorgeous, straight, best friend Grace during the
pilot episode:
</P>
<P>
   Grace (while lying in bed with her boyfriend): ``Are you
jealous?''
</P>
<P>
   Will (while watching the NBC drama ``ER''): ``Honey, I don't
need your man, I got George Clooney.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace: ``Sorry, baby, he doesn't bat for your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Will: ``Well, he hasn't seen me pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are still no openly gay lead characters on CBS, the
network's new cop drama, ``Martial Law,'' has plenty of openly
violent ones. The show features a kung-fu-fighting detective
transplanted from China who might have a higher butt-kicking
quotient than ``Walker: Texas Ranger,'' the network's other
Saturday night punch-happy do-gooder.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Dana McClintock insists the network is not pushing
the limits of good taste to keep pace with edgier entertainment on
cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of cable channels are narrowcasting and going after a
certain niche of the audience,'' McClintock said. ``We are trying
to reach a broader section of viewers. We are _ and will always be
_ broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokeswoman Susan Sewell said her network hasn't been
influenced by cable or the content ratings that some feared were a
veiled attempt at censorship by politicians and television watchdog
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the same standards we have always used when it comes
to making the fall schedule, which is basically `Is it a good
program?''' Sewell said. ``Our goal is always to put the best shows
on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   At TNT, taboos die hard, or most of them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the network refused to broadcast Anjelica Huston's
``Bastard Out of Carolina,'' a television movie that showed brutal
scenes of child sexual abuse. The movie was later picked up on
Showtime, where it won an Emmy. Still, Terri Tingle, vice president
of standards and practices for TNT, has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing unusual about `Bastard' was that it was a very
public decision, but there are very many times when we look at a
show and say, `This is not for us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tingle admits the network has been having second thoughts about
professional wrestling shows such as ``Monday Nitro,'' which are
among the most violent, and popular shows on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think everybody understands that wrestling is not a sport;
it's a drama more like a soap opera, with characters and continuing
stories,'' Tingle said. ``But we are looking into the question
right now about whether it's too violent. There's been a lot of
publicity about wrestling, and we wouldn't be responsive if we
weren't listening to what was being said.''
</P>
<P>
   But TNT's rude-and-crude wrestlers are no match for the
profanity-spewing third-graders on ``South Park,'' a show
ostensibly for adults (it's rated TV-MA) that has attracted a huge
following of viewers under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The show features wrestling matches between Jesus Christ and
Santa Claus, the ritualistic killing of a main character in every
episode, and more swear words than comedian Carlin ever bothered to
count.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's also one of the show's most beloved characters, Mr.
Hanky. He's a talking feces.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central President Doug Herzog faced a group of television
critics recently who wondered if the cable network's biggest hit
has ever been censored.
</P>
<P>
   ``What doesn't get on the air?'' Herzog said. ``You don't want
to know.''

 &HT;    The kinship of stew: In a world of change, an ancient art is
passed on to another generation
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time my father made Brunswick stew for 100 of his new
neighbors, a woman took a suspicious peek into the pot and asked,
``What kind of animals have you got in there?''
</P>
<P>
   I wish a raccoon face had surfaced just then, if only to see how
high she could jump. Being a gentleman, Daddy didn't crack any
jokes about road kill or missing pets. He patiently explained that
while people used to put squirrel in their stew, he sticks to meats
you don't personally have to stalk and kill, such as chicken, pork
and beef.
</P>
<P>
   But I can understand why the woman was leery. Brunswick stew
belongs to the Mystery Food branch of American cookery. No one can
absolutely pinpoint the origins of stew or bog or muddle or chili
con carne or any of the other one-pot wonders that dot the
country's culinary topography. They all seem to have been born over
some distant campfire in the days when people ate what they could
lay their hands on. They all seem to be cooked in big black pots by
men (almost always men) who approach their task with a shaman's
sense of ritual. The cooks are none too specific about what they
put in there, either; at my family reunion, the stew men talk about
``frog eyes,'' their inscrutable term for bits of soot that drift
from the fire into the kettle and have to be fished out.
</P>
<P>
   The South has more than its share of these single-pot folk
foods. Many of them play sidekick to barbecue. In Kentucky, there's
burgoo, a tangy stew that often contains barbecued mutton and is as
much a part of the culture as horse racing. (In fact, a
thoroughbred named Burgoo King once won the Kentucky Derby.) In
South Carolina, there's barbecue hash, a gloppy pork or beef paste
made from all sorts of offal and usually served over rice. In
Virginia, there's a version of Brunswick stew that's different from
what you find in the Deep South, having no pork but only chicken
and vegetables. Virginians, not noted for their humility, claim to
have invented Brunswick stew, but folks in Brunswick, Ga., beg to
differ.
</P>
<P>
   Since men are doing the cooking, it follows that all of these
dishes are endlessly debated. Which vegetables are appropriate? Is
it burgoo if there's no sheep in the pot? Does hash have to contain
organ meat?
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Woodward, a filmmaker in McLean, Va., asked these
existential questions as he traveled the South taping reunions and
community get-togethers for a documentary on Brunswick stew. ``It's
a beautiful art they're practicing, and they get so passionate
about it,'' he says. ``There's almost a priesthood of stewmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Virginia, it literally was a priesthood. Woodward
found that many of the early stew men were Methodist ministers who
took their pots along with their Bibles when they were assigned new
parishes. Stew money has paid for many a choir robe.
</P>
<P>
   There are no clergymen perched in my family tree, but I do
descend from a long line
</P>
<P>
   of stewmakers. For a century, my kinsmen in North Georgia have
been feeding the multitudes from black pots. My great-grandfather
is said to have originated our recipe, which is trotted out every
summer for members of our extended family at a reunion in Bartow
County. His son, Robert Auchmutey, was a farmer who cooked stew and
barbecue at gatherings throughout the Etowah River Valley. In 1954,
after The Saturday Evening Post included him in a spread on
Southern barbecues, he was invited by a community club near Chicago
to lay on a Dixie feast in Illinois. He and some buddies drove up
with their 30-gallon cast-iron pots _ the Chicagoans had only zinc
washtubs _ and gave them a taste of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that was the highlight of his life,'' says my
father, his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation carried on the tradition in more citified
surroundings. My Uncle Earl, a career Air Force officer in Warner
Robins, was so renowned for his stew that when he died his church
sent out a memorial flier with a drawing of him in a chef's hat
stirring a pot. He once made a videotape about stew-
</P>
<P>
   making that had three cups of wisecracking for every cup of
instruction. All the uncles and aunts and cousins watched it not
long after his death, laughing and sniffling and getting awfully
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Now my father is the only oneamong us who practices the old art.
He's made stew for years, usually in the winter, giving all the
kids Tupperware pints of it to take home and freeze. I've eaten his
stew for so long that it didn't occur to me until recently that I
had never cooked it myself. I am almost 43. My father is pushing
78. It was time to learn. He just happened to be cooking a batch
for the Fourth of July dinner at his seniors' apartment complex in
Decatur. ``I'll see you at 7 sharp Saturday morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived around 7:15, my mother was still in bed and my
father had been up more than two hours. Three pots were working on
the stove, boiling chicken and cooking down ground pork and beef.
The counter was crowded with cans of creamed corn and whole
tomatoes, the only vegetables he allows in the pot. It's almost a
commandment with him: Thou shalt have no onions, potatoes or butter
beans in thy stew.
</P>
<P>
   This fundamentalism is typical of North Georgia stews _ they
don't use many vegetables at Harold's Barbecue, for instance _ but
I've always wondered why we observe this custom when Southern food
authorities from James Villas to Craig Claiborne play fast and
loose with the veggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, why don't we use more vegetables?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked back his baseball cap and thought a minute, then came
back with an unassailable answer. ``Because your great-grandfather
didn't, your grandfather didn't, and I don't.'' He didn't have to
spell out what was expected of me.
</P>
<P>
   When the meat was ready, we loaded the pots into his truck and
hauled them to the activities center. It looks pretty much like a
rec hall at any other suburban apartment complex _ a far cry from
the antebellum schoolhouse in the country where the stew men at our
family reunion set up a tripod caldron on oak embers under the
trees. We were using stainless steel pots on an electric range in
an air-conditioned kitchen. Except for a little smoke flavor,
though, the taste wasn't much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy used to come home from making stew with that smoky smell
all over him,'' my father reminisced, ``and Rags, our old bulldog,
almost ate him up. I can still see that dog's nose twitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the chicken had cooled, we started the most time-consuming
part of the process: picking the chicken from the bones. One of the
secrets to stew is not letting it get too homogenized; you're
supposed to see shreds of chicken and kernels of corn in the
finished stuff. It took us almost an hour to clean the birds; then
we threw everything together into a 10-gallon pot and started
stirring and seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll show you what I'm doing, but I'm the only one who gets to
season,'' Daddy said. ``I remember my father was making some stew
for a fund-raiser one time _ I think a church had been damaged by a
tornado _ and he'd been stirring the pot all day. He went home to
change clothes, and when he came back, some SOB had reseasoned the
stew. Dumped a box of red pepper in it. I thought Daddy was going
to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's wrong with this world,'' agreed Dutch Bucher, a
military retiree who had been setting up chairs in the dining hall
and was now in the kitchen paying his respects to the cooks. He
shook his head sadly. ``Some people have no respect for other human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the morning and into the afternoon, we took
turns stirring with a 2-by-1 piece of hardwood. The stew turned
from soft brown to a muddy red that resembled a clay road after a
downpour. Everytime my father left the kitchen, he'd return
barking, ``Don't fall asleep. Stir! We don't want that corn
sticking.''
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of toil and tasting and seasoning, we finally
had it the proper flavor and consistency. We turned off the heat
and covered the pot.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, as I dipped the stew into bowls and hustled it out
to the serving line, an elderly woman stopped me with a question.
``Do you eat this with a fork or a spoon, or do you just pour it
over the barbecue?'' she wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   I thought she was joking at first, but she wasn't. The poor
thing didn't know any better; she was from the far side of the stew
line _ New Jersey, I believe. So I thought of my ancestors, and the
circle of stewmaking that would not go unbroken, and I took the
opportunity to baptize her in the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never had Brunswick stew?'' I said, balancing a bowl on
her plate. ``Well, let me tell you about it. It's something of a
specialty in my family ...''

 &HT;    Pistol-packing author's dreams are just as grisly as her
thrillers
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 2: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charleston, S.C. -- On the afternoon of her book signing here,
Patricia Cornwell is unusually nervous for an author with 10 best
sellers under her Armani belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wonder if anybody's going to show up,'' she says as
the black stretch limousine navigates the streets of Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Or if the wrong person will show up.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell's fame _ and the grisly crimes she writes about in her
novels featuring medical examiner Kay Scarpetta _ has left her so
cautious that she travels with at least two bodyguards and hires
armed, off-duty police officers for book signings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have the books for the security guys?'' she asks. A
female staffer nods and shows her a stack of Cornwell's latest
Scarpetta thriller, ``Point of Origin'' (Putnam, $25.95), No. 1
this week on The New York Times Best Seller list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' Cornwell says, checking the time on her expensive gold
Breitling pilot's watch. She is wearing no makeup, a simple white
gold necklace and a pinkie ring designed from an ancient seal that
reads, ``Don't tell.'' She smiles and ignores the warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm paranoid, but that's the way it is out there.
In New York the other night at a signing, a guy showed up with a
knife on his belt. He was told to get rid of the knife or leave, so
he left. Maybe it was nothing, but look at what happened to
celebrities like John Lennon and Monica Seles.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the two stalkers in Richmond, not to mention
Eugene Bennett, the FBI agent who accused Cornwell of breaking up
his marriage after she had an affair with his wife _ also an FBI
agent. Days after a bizarre incident in which Bennett attempted to
ambush and kill his wife at a Manassas, Va., church in the summer
of 1996, his rented car was found parked in Richmond, Cornwell's
hometown. The author is convinced that he was there to hurt her.
(Bennett was convicted of attempted murder and is serving a 23-year
prison term.)
</P>
<P>
   All the details of the 1992 lesbian affair and its repercussions
were discussed in numerous articles last year, including a lengthy
piece in Vanity Fair that described Cornwell as a control-obsessed
woman with anorexia, drinking problems and a bipolar disorder who
jettisons longtime friends in the wake of her success.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell admits that she was ``devastated'' by the Vanity Fair
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would try to sneak out of my house and get the newspaper
without my neighbors staring out the window and saying something
awful. But you know what? People don't really care. They only care
if you don't write another good book.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently she is right. Inside Books-A-Million in Charleston,
more than 300 Cornwell fans stood in a line that snaked around the
store. Many carried multiple copies of her novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her personal life is her business. It has no bearing on the
books,'' says Leslie Stall, 27, a forensic scientist for Charleston
County. ``I really like the technical aspects of her writing
because that's the kind of things I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Bridges, 51, a nurse who drove more than 400 miles from
Thomasville, Ga., just to get Cornwell's autograph, remains an
unabashed fan. ``I love her books,'' Bridges says. ``As for what
she does in her personal life, I think everybody is entitled to
find happiness where they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the autograph table, Cornwell patiently poses for
pictures with fans and graciously accepts a Beanie Baby from a
6-year-old girl. The roped-off area behind her is off-limits,
however, and lingering admirers are ushered away quickly once their
books are signed.
</P>
<P>
   When the last customer leaves three hours later, Cornwell stands
up, flexes her writing hand, slips into a navy Armani jacket and
heads for the limo. Lean and petite with blond-streaked hair,
Cornwell, 42, is a real-life model for Kay Scarpetta, the
brilliant, always-in-control medical examiner who has tracked
serial killers and psychopaths through nine novels.
</P>
<P>
   Both she and Scarpetta are fighters, Cornwell says, and both are
armed and dangerous. The fictional Scarpetta totes a Glock 9 mm;
Cornwell is never far from her .357 Colt Python, .380 Walther
semiautomatic or .38 Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sit around cowering,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell has been obsessed with the dark side of life since
1979, when she began work as a police reporter for The Charlotte
Observer. Two years later, determined to become a novelist, she
took a job as a computer analyst in the Richmond morgue and wrote
three books about a male detective. After all were rejected,
Cornwell's agent suggested that she write about her experiences in
the medical examiner's office. The result was ``Postmortem,'' her
first Kay Scarpetta novel, which netted her a $6,000 advance and
launched a career that earned her more than $17 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Author Frye Gaillard, who worked with Cornwell at the Observer,
isn't surprised by her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had an incredible drive, and she was very focused,'' says
Gaillard, 51. ``She worked hard at what she did. To me, that's been
the key to her success as a mystery writer.''
</P>
<P>
   She also was well-liked and always willing to help, Gaillard
says. He recalled an incident in which Cornwell overheard him
complaining about not being able to get in touch with evangelist
Billy Graham for an article.
</P>
<P>
   ``This intern who I had never had contact with said, `Would you
like me to call him for you?' When I asked her if she knew him, she
picked up the phone and dialed the number from memory. I heard her
say, `Ruth? This is Patsy. Is Billy there?'''

<P>
   Gaillard later learned that Cornwell's relationship with the
Grahams began in 1965, when her mother _ divorced, desperate and
nearly broke _ left her and her two brothers with the Grahams in
Montreat, N.C. The Grahams placed the children with Christian
missionaries who had just returned from Africa, but over the years
they offered emotional and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working my way through Davidson College as a
waitress, Ruth would send me letters with a $100 check in them. She
was like a mother to me,'' Cornwell says. That relationship was
broken when Cornwell wrote an authorized biography of Ruth Graham
in 1981. Through a misunderstanding, Cornwell says, the two did not
speak to each other for eight years. ``It was just a tempest in a
teapot,'' the novelist says. ``We joke about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   As her fame grew, other friendships suffered. Dot Jackson, a
former columnist for the Observer, was Cornwell's best friend for
years. The friendship ended soon after Jackson's son committed
suicide by hanging himself. According to last year's Vanity Fair
article, Cornwell flew in to see Jackson and, in the midst of her
grief, began grilling her about details of her son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things that appeared in print were taken out of
context,'' says Jackson, 66, who lives in upstate South Carolina.
``She was very interested in his cause of death, but I saw this as
just an example of how intense she is. Nothing distracts her from
her pursuit of gruesome details. I wasn't angry with her about it.
That's just the way Patsy is.''
</P>
<P>
   What destroyed the friendship, Jackson says, was a dispute over
a screenplay treatment that Jackson had written at Cornwell's
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on, she wanted me to relinquish any claim to the
screenplay. She said I was an employee at the time, and this was
work for hire. I had been her oldest friend, and for her to treat
me like an employee was intolerable. I still love her dearly, but
she's a master manipulator. She has to be in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell wasn't always that way, says Jackson, who remembers her
as fun-loving and spontaneous when she worked at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was precious before she became famous. What was ironic is
that when she was a cop reporter, she was very anti-corpse. She
didn't want to be around dead people. And she was terrified of
lesbians. A lesbian cop followed her home one night and scared her
to death.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Jackson explain why her former friend ended up
working in a morgue and having a lesbian affair?
</P>
<P>
   ``As Stephen King says, very often we are drawn to the very
things that frighten us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell has a different version of the breakup of the
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day I don't know why she turned against me. I went to
see her after her son's death and spent several days with her, and
she wanted to talk about the pathology report. Then later she told
the press that I wanted to learn more about hanging for my next
book. I loved her like a mother. You think that didn't hurt me,
really badly, to have somebody think that I would go visit somebody
in grief like that, and I only did it for information?''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell shakes her head and sighs. Jealousy is the only
explanation, she says. Friends hate you for your success.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends, maybe, but not new ones. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
has only praise for Cornwell. ``She's a heckuva nice person,'' says
Hatch, who admits he had never heard of the author before they met
at a California hotel a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the hotel gym to exercise, and there was this young
woman on the Stairmaster next to me. `I know you from somewhere,'
she said, and I introduced myself. She said, `I'm Patricia Cornwell
and I'm a novelist.' I said I wasn't aware of her books. She was
surprised, but the next day she gave me three of her novels and I
loved them.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely pair struck up a friendship later when Cornwell
popped into Hatch's office to lobby for an upgrading of the FBI's
police academy in Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that what she was saying was absolutely true, that
she had really done her research,'' Hatch says, ``so I went to bat
for the facility. After that, we became good friends. She's a very
strong personality, and when she wants to get into a subject, she
really gets involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell acknowledges that almost everything she does is related
to her writing. Obsessed with learning about technical details
firsthand, she often spends months in research. For ``Point of
Origin,'' a novel about a fatal fire at a thoroughbred horse farm,
she investigated dozens of arson cases with ATF agents in
Philadelphia and Washington and learned to fly a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show readers what can be done with fire and how it
can be used to disguise a homicide,'' Cornwell says. ``In this
case, what Scarpetta has to figure out is not that it was used to
disguise a homicide, but that the killer is disguising what he does
to the body. And what he does is horrific.''
</P>
<P>
   So horrific, in fact, that Cornwell's nightmares have become
even more disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have nice dreams,'' she says. ``Now my dreams are so
bad I don't even want to remember them. Usually I don't, and I'm
thankful for that, because they're always, always awful. Because
I've seen what some of these murders look like, my dreams are
always anatomically correct ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmares started shortly after Cornwell began working in
the Richmond morgue in 1981. ``I was separated from my husband and
living alone,'' she says. ``And there was a series of women being
killed _ a neurosurgeon, a bookkeeper, a lawyer _ women who were
not in high-risk crime areas. These were terrifying, but then I saw
other things that had happened to women who ended up in the morgue.
The one thing they had in common was that they all thought it
couldn't happen to them. That's when I went out and bought my first
revolver.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases that she saw were the basis for ``Postmortem,'' her
chilling first novel about the rapes and murders of Richmond women.
The book introduced Scarpetta as a no-nonsense medical examiner who
uncovers the maniac's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers were enthusiastic about the first few Scarpetta
novels, but more recently they have been less kind. Entertainment
Weekly's Mark Harris, who gave ``Point of Origin'' a lukewarm
review, bemoaned the ``overworked and predictable'' plot.
Scarpetta, he wrote, ``who was initially compelling, well-rounded
and keenly intelligent, seems depressed and adrift, all charred
corpses and no play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell dismisses the bad reviews as more examples of jealousy.
``When you've had really big success, critics are just looking for
a chance to blast you out of the water. I think my characters are
colorful, and I think my fans agree. They wouldn't keep buying my
books if they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She just as quickly discounts criticism of the gory details she
includes. In ``Point of Origin,'' for example, Scarpetta boils the
remains of a young woman in a 40-quart pot to complete an autopsy.
In other books, Cornwell meticulously describes what serial killers
did to their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that Scarpetta sees are not pretty,'' Cornwell
says. ``If you're going to tell people about death and violence,
don't make it pretty. It's real and you've got to face it. The
reason I feel my books are helpful is that they come from the
perspective of a very humane woman who fights the good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cornwell is giving Scarpetta a rest while she
finishes ``Southern Cross,'' her sequel to ``Hornet's Nest,'' a
tale of crimefighters, reporters and rednecks in Charlotte that was
published last year to savage reviews. Cornwell says the reviewers
didn't understand what she was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize that an author can have two
different voices. I have a very, very dark, brooding, melancholy
side that is like Scarpetta's. But I was a cartoonist for my
college paper, and I also have a `Far Side' sense of humor. I knew
it would be hard for people to accept that the same person wrote
both of these books.''
</P>
<P>
   To research ``Southern Cross,'' which is set in Richmond,
Cornwell worked with the ATF on its bombing range, blowing up cars
and analyzing explosives. ``It's amazing how many pennies and
quarters you can find in old cars they get from junkyards. They're
always finding coins under the seats of these blown-up vehicles.
It's this type of minutiae that give reality to my fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell doesn't expect ``Southern Cross'' to win her many
friends in Richmond, but she says she is already persona non grata
in some circles because she's a descendant of Harriet Beecher
Stowe, author of the 1852 novel ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' In a way,
Cornwell sees herself as the same type of crusader as her famous
ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harriet Beecher Stowe was fighting an abuse of power, and I'm
fighting an abuse of power, too,'' she says. ``But there's a
different war going on. It's a kind of slavery we have, with the
violence in America. When you think about the way we have to live
with alarm systems, or the fear we feel in a parking lot or at an
ATM machine, that's a kind of enslavement. For a country that
values freedom, it's unconscionable.''

 &HT;    Hair show to be more than just a big tease
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It's always a heady experience. A time when weaves,
locs and straw set dos mingle gracefully among China bangs, French
twists and basic bobs.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, if there's a do that can be done, it will show up at
the Bronner Bros. Mid-Summer International Hair Show _ right down
to Janet Jackson's red-hot curls.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday at the Georgia World Congress Center and
running through Tuesday, stylists from around the world, including
Africa and the Netherlands, will learn about hairstyling and
business techniques and new hair care products.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight is sure to be Monday night's ``Hair Battle
Royale '98,'' where 12 stylists (including three from Atlanta:
Felisha Gatlin, TEE White, and Maurice Beaman) will compete for
$10,000 cash or a 1998 Jeep Cherokee. Their challenge: in 10
minutes create the most out-of-this-world statement in hair since _
well, the last time these hair-raisers came to town.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronner Bros. hair show, now in its 51st year, expects
75,000 to 100,000 attendees, making it one of Atlanta's top five
conventions, according to Brandy O'Quinn, spokeswoman for the
Atlanta Convention and Visitor's Bureau. The show could pump more
than $50 million into the city's economy, O'Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   For stylist Gatlin, 27, of Unique Styles in College Park, Ga.,
the show will be a nerve-racking experience. She's got her sights
set on taking home the prize money. Her plans are to buy a pair of
black Gucci boots and invest the rest. She plans to do futuristic
styles for the year 2010 during the competition.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Drug that increases bone density may help osteoporosis sufferers
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who have osteoporosis because they take steroid
medications for other illnesses might benefit from a drug that
increases bone density.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 million American women and men take steroids for such
diseases as asthma and arthritis, but the medication can cause bone
thinning.
</P>
<P>
   A study in today's New England Journal of Medicine says the drug
alendronate, marketed as Fosamax by Merck &AMP; Co., may help prevent
and treat steroid-induced osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Women and men taking medications with steroids increased their
bone density when they took alendronate in combination with calcium
and vitamin D, said lead researcher Kenneth Saag, assistant
professor of internal medicine at the University of Iowa. Calcium
and vitamin D are currently recommended for preventing and treating
steroid-induced osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women have already used alendronate to prevent fractures
and post-menopausal women have already been treated with
alendronate for osteoporosis, but alendronate may be the only
FDA-approved drug that can help those with steroid-induced
osteoporosis, Saag said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important message is that this is a common, but
under-recognized problem, and we now have a proven, effective
therapy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which involved nearly 500 women and men who were
given an oral dose of alendronate or an inactive placebo, should
especially help post-menopausal women who are also taking steroid
treatments. Because of the combination of estrogen deficiency and
the effect steroid medications have on their bones, these women are
among those at the highest risk for steroid-induced osteoporosis.

 &HT;    HOUSE STANDS BY TO CONSIDER IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wary about upcoming elections, the man who would
lead impeachment proceedings against President Clinton said
Wednesday his staff is ready and waiting for whatever independent
counsel Kenneth Starr may send their way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he had no idea when a report from Starr might
arrive or whether he would convene his committee for immediate
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a tight document, with points A, B, C, that's one
thing,'' Hyde said. ``But if it's War and Peace. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hyde said, ``We're ready for any eventuality.''
With Clinton agreeing Wednesday to testify Aug. 17, it is unlikely
any report from Starr would reach the House before it returns from
its summer vacation after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, only about a month will remain in Congress's work
schedule before lawmakers head home to campaign for the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The deals reached by Starr with Clinton's attorneys and lawyers
for Monica Lewinsky for the former White House intern's testimony
about her alleged sexual relationship with the president have
started a new round of speculation on Capitol Hill about the
prospects for an eventual move against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said that Congress is having too much trouble
passing the spending bills that provide money for government
operations beginning Oct. 1 to consider Starr's report before
adjourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This already crowds out discussion of important issues,'' said
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., also a member of Hyde's panel, who said
he thinks it's already too late for Judiciary Committee hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said the House should not hold a
post-election session on the report, but rather wait for the new
Congress to begin in January. ``It seems to me a lame-duck Congress
shouldn't deal with this issue,'' Fazio said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and other Republicans were not willing to forgo
hearings either just before or after the election. Conceding that
the timing of a report by Starr, if indeed he sends one, is
``awkward'' because of the election, Hyde said, ``I'm loathe to let
political considerations interfere with the orderly process of our
responsibilities. On the other hand, there are problems of timing,
like the need for members to campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he would have his critics whatever he
decides. ``That's the problem. Whatever you do, you're accused of
political motives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two former prosecutors on Hyde's committee, Republicans Bob Barr
of Georgia and James Rogan of California, said the House should be
ready to act whenever Starr sends a report of his findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to make time for it,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rogan: ``A prosecutor files his case when he's damned good
and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   To get ready for the possibility of impeachment hearings, Hyde
recently added eight people, led by a veteran Chicago lawyer, to
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, who repeatedly cautioned that discussion of a
report from Starr is speculative, said he would be working with
Speaker Newt Gingrich to determine if and when to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich had no comment on the report of Clinton's agreement
to testify, and his aides referred all questions about a report
from Starr to Hyde.

CONCEDING THE GRIM PAST, GERMANY INVITES JEWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Half a century after the world learned the
full horror of Hitler's campaign to extinguish Jews, few countries
have worked harder than Germany to atone for past evil.
</P>
<P>
   Nazi concentration camps like Dachau and Bergen-Belsen have been
preserved as museums and draw tens of thousands of visitors every
year. Every major city has its memorials and museum exhibits, from
``The Topography of Terror'' at the Berlin Museum to the Frankfurt
Jewish Museum's immense model of the city's old Jewish ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of historic synagogues have been meticulously
reconstructed from rubble, though most are devoid of actual
worshipers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is something jarring about the new brochure
from the German National Tourist Board: ``Germany for the Jewish
Traveler,'' a 40-page pamphlet written in full recognition that
many Jews still recoil at the mere mention of this country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The brochure's stated purpose is to attract foreign Jews,
particularly Americans, to explore their historical and cultural
roots in Germany. The authors took pains to review the horrors of
the Third Reich. The first paragraph of the introduction notes that
the ``vastness, ruthlessness and near success of the Nazis' stated
goal of annihilating the Jews of Europe was, and remains,
unparalleled in human history.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It then describes a full catalogue of sites that speak to both
the accomplishments of German Jews and the genocide waged against
them. It also points out that Germany is one of the few European
countries where the Jewish population is now increasing. That is
because the country has accepted thousands of immigrants from
Central Europe and Russia under a policy that offers citizenship to
people with documented German ancestry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vast majority of German tourist sites of
Jewish interest resonate with tragedy and death. For all the
efforts to unearth and reconstruct the Jewish heritage in Germany _
and there are many such efforts _ there aren't many Jews left in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 400,000 who lived here before Hitler took power in 1933,
all but a few either escaped or were killed or deported. Jews now
account for about 75,000 of the 80 million people who live in
Germany. That may be part of the reason that American Jews avoid
the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Jewish tourism to Germany,'' said Ignatz Bubis,
president of the Central Council of Jewish Communities in Germany,
who wrote a message of welcome in the new pamphlet. ``It doesn't
exist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five decades Germany's federal and local
governments have spent countless millions to resurrect or at least
honor the Jewish culture that evolved here for many centuries. The
re-establishment of Berlin next year as Germany's capital has added
fresh energy to the old efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the massive reconstruction of what used to be East
Berlin involves Jewish historical sites, such as the immense
Oranienburger Strasse synagogue, beautifully restored and reopened
in 1995 as the Centrum Judaicum museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is also trying to build a massive new
Holocaust memorial near the old Berlin Wall, though that effort
remains tangled in political disputes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most other big cities in Germany have sites commemorating
Jewish history. Frankfurt's Jewish Museum, housed in a palace that
once belonged to the Rothschild family, contains artifacts that
date back to the 12th century. The highlight is a huge model of
Frankfurt's old Jewish ghetto, complete with streets and 194
buildings built at one-fiftieth scale.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new museum has been opened on the site of the old
Jewish ghetto, which burned down in 1711. There archeologists have
unearthed the foundations of five houses and two ritual bathhouses.
Among other things, the museum exhibitions depict everyday life of
Jews in Frankfurt during the past 300 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are an amazing number of museums and museum
exhibits devoted to Jewish history. Berlin alone boasts the Centrum
Judaicum and the Martin-Gropius-Bau, part of the Berlin Museum, and
a separate Berlin Jewish Museum is under construction. Museums in
Cologne, Dusseldorf, Braunschweig and other cities maintain
exhibitions on Judaica as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Worms, which was a center of Jewish scholarship in the Middle
Ages, the city has carefully preserved the houses and cobblestone
street of the medieval Jewish alley. Trier, which in ancient times
was a central administrative city in the Roman empire, has also
preserved its Jewish alley, as well as the home of one of Germany's
most prominent Jews, Karl Marx. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bubis said he welcomes the effort to attract Jewish tourists.
Beyond the established attractions, he said, Germany offers rich
opportunities for people to explore their roots in the towns of
their ancestors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But will Germany's new overture persuade many Jewish travelers?
``I rather doubt it,'' Bubis said.

BILL WOULD ALLOW SUITS AGAINST HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Senate expected to delay consideration of
a managed-care bill until September, a bipartisan group of senators
proposed Wednesday a compromise measure that would allow patients
to sue health plans for monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, offered the
alternative to the leading Democratic and Republican versions of
legislation that would impose national rights and benefits for
people using managed-care health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unacceptable for a debate on managed-care reform to be
stymied by the gridlock of politics as usual. What is needed now is
the politics of the possible,'' Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was unclear whether Senate majority leader Trent Lott
would allow a vote on his compromise measure, and it was becoming
increasingly clear Wednesday that the Senate would not have time to
take up any managed-care bill before its month-long summer recess
that begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The House narrowly passed a health-care bill on Friday that
would cap awards from lawsuits against physicians and insurance
companies at $250,000 for non-economic and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   With Senate action likely postponed until September,
election-year pressures may make the compromise more attractive to
some lawmakers, its sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, we want to solve a problem,'' said Senator Max
Baucus, Democrat of Montana. ``We are not here to score political
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, ``If
there is to be legislation, it has to come from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called centrist bill, backed by Chafee, Baucus, Specter,
and Senators Bob Graham of Florida and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, both Democrats, is closer to the Democratic proposal
than the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist and Democrat bills would cover all 161 million
privately insured individuals. The Republican bill would apply to
the 48 million enrollees in self-funded plans. The centrist and
Democrat bills would also allow access to specialists and guarantee
continuity of care with the same doctor, access to prescription
drugs, and direct access to obstetrician-gynecologists and
pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist bill proposes a significant alternative on the
issue of lawsuits. The Democratic bill would allow patients to sue
in state courts and seek damages for non-economic damages, that is,
awards for pain and suffering from an injury, as well as economic
damages that typically cover job loss and actual medical costs. The
Chafee bill would limit lawsuits to federal court and would not
allow non-monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would allow consumers to purchase medical
savings accounts, an IRA-type account to pay for medical costs, and
allow 100 percent deductability of health care costs for the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist bill would also give the Departments of Health and
Human Services and Labor the right to levy harsh penalties on
managed-care plans that fail to abide by the law.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy called the Chafee bill ``a welcome new
sign'' and a ``major improvement'' over the Senate Republican plan.
``But it lacks many of the most important protections'' in the
Democrat bill, said Kennedy, one of the co-sponsors. Kennedy said
the Democrat bill includes minimal hospital stays for breast cancer
patients who undergo mastectomies and need reconstructive surgery,
protection for whistle-blowers in the health-care community, and
the ability to file medical malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Later Kennedy held his own news conference to criticize the GOP
health bill as inadequate for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican bill should have a warning label: Dangerous to
Your Health,'' said Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat
who backs the Democratic bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate moderates said their bill was the only
legislation that could pass Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see happening in the next few weeks is a train wreck,''
said Graham. Lieberman said, ``If our colleagues want to do
something this year, here it is.''

INDEPENDENT RYKODISC TO BE SOLD TO ISLANDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rykodisc, a feisty independent record label that rose to fame
through catalog sales of Frank Zappa, Elvis Costello, and David
Bowie albums, is expected to be sold within a week to Islandlife, a
New York company owned by music mogul Chris Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   Islandlife is Blackwell's re-entry into the music business,
after leaving Island Records, where he reigned for 20 years and
signed such mega-stars as U2 and Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Rykodisc is expected to top $30 million. ``It's
the right thing at the right time,'' said Rykodisc co-owner Don
Rose. ``With all the merging going on, we needed a broader reach,
and this way we will have more muscle behind us. Chris is also a
real music lover and we feel it's a great fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old Rykodisc issues 100 records a year. It employs
70 people in Salem, Mass. and 130 worldwide, with offices in
Philadelphia and London. It's a privately held company known for
its spiffy catalog reissues, but which also has put out new music
by Kristin Hersh, Morphine, Bob Mould, Jeffrey Gaines, and Medeski,
Martin &AMP; Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Ryko, as it's commonly known, also owns a number of smaller
labels that are attached to the Islandlife deal. They include
Hannibal (with Cubanismo!, Kate &AMP; Anna McGarrigle, and the catalogs
of Sandy Denny, Fairport Convention, and Nick Drake); Slo River
(with the Future Bible Heroes, Charlie Chesterman, and Josh Rouse);
Tradition (an historic label with the catalogs of Odetta, Woody
Guthrie, Ledbelly, and Louis Armstrong); newly launched imprints
Candescence (a new age label) and Rykolatina.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell was unavailable for comment and a spokesman said he
preferred to delay talking until the deal was officially closed.
His Islandlife company also just started a record label called Palm
Pictures, which recently issued its first two albums: Baaba Maal's
``Nomad Soul'' and Ernest Ranglin's ``In Search of the Lost
Riddim.'' Both are world-music releases and will be marketed by
Rykodisc under the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent sale of Rykodisc is not expected to result in major
operational changes, Rose says. ``We'll still be who we are and do
it from where we do it. I'm not expecting anything dramatic to
happen in the transition. For me, I'll go from ownership control to
something else, but I think it will be a good something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rykodisc grossed more than $70 million last year
through its labels and publishing, Rose conceded that the record
business has become a tougher business in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record business has been flat. It's gotten to be more
expensive to get the same result,'' he says. ``This new merger is
going to allow me to focus on making records again rather than on
capital structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose and the Philadelphia-based Arthur Mann are the current
co-owners of Rykodisc. They were introduced to Blackwell by
producer Joe Boyd, who came on the Rykodisc board when the label
acquired Hannibal Records in 1991. Boyd had produced albums by
Fairport Convention, Sandy Denny, and Nick Drake when all of those
artists were on Blackwell's Island Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetically, we share a lot with Chris,'' says Rose. ``In
fact, when we get together, we always listen to music. Chris is a
totally uncynical individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Rykodisc has shunned outside ownership before, but the Blackwell
offer was just too attractive to pass up, Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell also owns considerable hotel and resort properties in
the Caribbean and on Miami's South Beach, where he has spearheaded
the art deco revival. One of his South Beach hotels, the Marlin, is
where Boston band Aerosmith did pre-production for its last album,
``Nine Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell has also started a video company, a music publishing
company, and is seeking to get into films. Rykodisc is expected to
market any soundtracks that evolve from the film business, Rose
said.

TOUR RACERS PROTEST DRUG-TESTING POLICY

<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX LES BAINS, France _ The most famous bicycle race became the
most infamous one Wednesday when the 133 riders in the Tour de
France tore off their numbers and merely rolled slowly along the
149-kilometer course, refusing to race. In addition, three teams
got off their bikes and piled into their team cars in protest of
the drug controversy that has surrounded the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   After the bike ride _ it could hardly be called a race _ Tour
director Jean-Marie LeBlanc announced that the stage will be
negated and that racing will resume Thursday, minus the riders who
dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   But a sour taste remained, both among the fans who jeered the
slow-moving riders and the riders themselves, who are still
spurning the press.
</P>
<P>
   The ride on the Tour's final day in the Alps was not filled with
chases and attacks, but rather with stops and starts. Just a
half-hour after leaving Albertville, the pack stopped as the riders
tore the numbers off their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't race in this climate of permanent suspicion where we
are taken for criminals,'' Laurent Jalabert said on France Info
radio. Jalabert apparently led the protest, and he and his
German-based ONCE team stopped riding entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ride, 1996 Tour winner Bjarne Riis slowed to talk
with LeBlanc, and other riders talked to journalists on
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Former champion Stephen Roche, speaking on the Eurosport
network, said, ``Some riders were in tears. They were saying, `I'm
only doing my job. Please leave me alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although one team was ousted from the Tour last week after the
team masseur was allegedly caught with drugs in his car, no rider
has been accused of, or tested postive for, drug use. But the
riders have become increasingly annoyed over the drug controversy
that has overshadowed the race, and this was the second time they
threatened to end the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the riders put down their bikes and staged a sitdown
strike that delayed the start of a race for two hours. Then came
Wednesday's action, when at times it looked doubtful that the race
would make it to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a World Series being played with both teams getting so
angry at the officiating and the ensuing media coverage that by the
fifth game, all the players walk off the field.
</P>
<P>
   That's what in effect is happening in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week, 2,400-mile race around France, which attracts
the most elite cyclists in the world every summer, has been
unraveling to the point of all but negating this year's results.
Even if the race does reach its scheduled conclusion in Paris
Sunday, it's been so decimated that even the finishers will have
glaring asterisks next to their names.
</P>
<P>
   The drug story began even before the Tour did, when Festina team
trainer Willy Voet was arrested by customs officials and charged
with carrying drugs in his car July 8. The Tour began under a cloud
three days later, and at the end of the first week, the Festina
team was banned. The riders are accused of using the hormone EPO, a
drug that can be used to increase red blood cells and enhance
endurance. Five of the team's nine riders have confessed to taking
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Festina rider Christophe Moreau had been charged with steroid
use three weeks before the Tour, but since it was under appeal, he
was allowed to start the race. He finished fifth in a time trial,
but it was a moot point after his team was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, four members of the Dutch TVM team were taken
by police to a hospital, where they were required to give blood and
hair samples. The riders returned to their hotel at midnight and
Wednesday morning started the stage with the other riders. In
addition, the police Tuesday seized suspect medication in a van
driven by officials of the French Bigmat team.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the arrests and allegations has led to evidence of
drug use on the Tour, prompting riders to question the emphasis on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Tour, riders voiced anger that the press, often
camped out at team hotels, ignored the racing action and focused
instead on the drug controversy. ``The riders are disgusted. Nobody
is interested in the sport side of the race,'' Jalabert said at
last week's sitdown strike.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the riders directed their anger not at the media
but at the police.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, when word spread through the pack of the treatment
of the four TVM riders who were tested the night before, the riders
decided to go into low gear. The riders on ONCE, led by Jalabert,
were the first to get off their bikes and get into the team cars;
three hours later, the Spanish-based Banesto team did the same. The
three remaining riders on the Italian Risso-Scotti team quit, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the ride finally ended 2 1/2 hours after its scheduled
arrival here, the four TVM riders rode to the front and raised
their hands in victory as the pack behind them applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that the drug controversy and ensuing
protests have put a damper on the racing action. The richest and
most prestigious bike race, held since 1903, has come to be seen
not just by the French but by the world as an extravaganza and
intense show of power.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks Wednesday's action means the end of the Tour,
Johnny Weltz, general manager of the US Postal Service team, ``At
the moment, I realy don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand it's a difficult situation, but we are here to
race and we want to go to Paris. The only thing to do is to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't commented because honestly, it doesn't affect me,''
said American Bobby Julich before Wednesday's race when asked about
the drug scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But it does now. After all, if Julich, now in second place, does
reach the podium in Paris, both he and the fans will most likely
remember the Tour for its drug controversy rather than his stellar
ride.

SENATE APPEARS DEADLOCKED ON PATIENTS' RIGHTS LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.D., R.I., Fla., Pa.)  (th) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican and Democratic leaders deadlocked
on patients' rights legislation Wednesday, all but guaranteeing the
Senate will not debate the contentious, but politically popular
issue until September, if then.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, Senate Republican and Democratic leaders, whose
proposals differ greatly in scope and detail, have been unable to
agree on how many amendments could be offered when a Republican
bill is taken up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to allow three amendments on each side, arguing
that there is not enough time for limitless debate. Democrats want
to offer as many as 20, saying the issue warrants a full-fledged
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement, Republicans will not bring the bill up for
debate. The House narrowly approved a Republican patients' rights
bill on Friday, leaving it up to the Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
   Each party's Senate leader blamed the other for delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't take up the health care reform legislation dealing
with HMOs it will be because the Democrats would not agree to take
it up,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``It's
their fault. I want the record to be clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., disagreed. ``What are they afraid
of?'' he asked. ``Why not have a good debate. What's stopping them
from giving us the full opportunity to debate this issue as we are
each of the appropriations' bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the stalemate, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and four
other senators unveiled their own compromise patients' protections
bill Wednesday. Chafee said the partisan logjam over the two main
bills is jeopardizing the prospects for legislation this year,
despite its grass-roots appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, as I said before, that each side will press
forward with their legislation and that neither side will have the
votes to enact legislation,'' said Chafee, who co-sponsored the
compromise bill with Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. ``Here's a bill that
contains what we believe is the best of both plans, and if we want
to get something done this year, here it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats adamantly disagree on the issue of a
patient's right to sue, among other things in the two bills. While
the Democrat's bill would permit patients to sue a managed care
company in state court for the denial of benefits, something most
consumers cannot do, Republicans prefer to allow an outside review
panel to handle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Chafee-Graham plan tries to breach the gap, although it
skews more towards the Democrats' approach. It would allow
consumers to sue their managed care companies for lost wages and
other economic damages, and not for emotional or punitive damages,
as the Democrats' bill would permit.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who supports Chafee's bill, said that
the Republican leadership's bill ``provides no incentive at all''
for managed care company's to respond to patient concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure we go far enough,'' he said, referring to
the lawsuit measure in the compromise bill. ``We have a system of
400 years of experience where liability is based on fault.'' &QL;

INDEPENDENT RYKODISC TO BE SOLD TO ISLANDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rykodisc, a feisty independent record label that rose to fame
through catalog sales of Frank Zappa, Elvis Costello, and David
Bowie albums, is expected to be sold within a week to Islandlife, a
New York company owned by music mogul Chris Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   Islandlife is Blackwell's re-entry into the music business,
after leaving Island Records, where he reigned for 20 years and
signed such mega-stars as U2 and Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Rykodisc is expected to top $30 million. ``It's
the right thing at the right time,'' said Rykodisc co-owner Don
Rose. ``With all the merging going on, we needed a broader reach,
and this way we will have more muscle behind us. Chris is also a
real music lover and we feel it's a great fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old Rykodisc issues 100 records a year. It employs
70 people in Salem, Mass. and 130 worldwide, with offices in
Philadelphia and London. It's a privately held company known for
its spiffy catalog reissues, but which also has put out new music
by Kristin Hersh, Morphine, Bob Mould, Jeffrey Gaines, and Medeski,
Martin &AMP; Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Ryko, as it's commonly known, also owns a number of smaller
labels that are attached to the Islandlife deal. They include
Hannibal (with Cubanismo!, Kate &AMP; Anna McGarrigle, and the catalogs
of Sandy Denny, Fairport Convention, and Nick Drake); Slo River
(with the Future Bible Heroes, Charlie Chesterman, and Josh Rouse);
Tradition (an historic label with the catalogs of Odetta, Woody
Guthrie, Ledbelly, and Louis Armstrong); newly launched imprints
Candescence (a new age label) and Rykolatina.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell was unavailable for comment and a spokesman said he
preferred to delay talking until the deal was officially closed.
His Islandlife company also just started a record label called Palm
Pictures, which recently issued its first two albums: Baaba Maal's
``Nomad Soul'' and Ernest Ranglin's ``In Search of the Lost
Riddim.'' Both are world-music releases and will be marketed by
Rykodisc under the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent sale of Rykodisc is not expected to result in major
operational changes, Rose says. ``We'll still be who we are and do
it from where we do it. I'm not expecting anything dramatic to
happen in the transition. For me, I'll go from ownership control to
something else, but I think it will be a good something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rykodisc grossed more than $70 million last year
through its labels and publishing, Rose conceded that the record
business has become a tougher business in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record business has been flat. It's gotten to be more
expensive to get the same result,'' he says. ``This new merger is
going to allow me to focus on making records again rather than on
capital structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose and the Philadelphia-based Arthur Mann are the current
co-owners of Rykodisc. They were introduced to Blackwell by
producer Joe Boyd, who came on the Rykodisc board when the label
acquired Hannibal Records in 1991. Boyd had produced albums by
Fairport Convention, Sandy Denny, and Nick Drake when all of those
artists were on Blackwell's Island Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetically, we share a lot with Chris,'' says Rose. ``In
fact, when we get together, we always listen to music. Chris is a
totally uncynical individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Rykodisc has shunned outside ownership before, but the Blackwell
offer was just too attractive to pass up, Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell also owns considerable hotel and resort properties in
the Caribbean and on Miami's South Beach, where he has spearheaded
the art deco revival. One of his South Beach hotels, the Marlin, is
where Boston band Aerosmith did pre-production for its last album,
``Nine Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell has also started a video company, a music publishing
company, and is seeking to get into films. Rykodisc is expected to
market any soundtracks that evolve from the film business, Rose
said.

ECONOMIC SCENE: REGULATORS BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With anti-tax Republicans in charge of Congress and a New
Democrat eager to distance himself from his party's welfare-state
excesses in the White House, big government is on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. While much of the New Deal heritage _ the
safety net, progressive taxation, market regulation _ has been
rolled back, Washington has more and more to say about health,
safety and environmental issues. And the cost of that regulation,
as my grandmother never said, isn't chopped liver. At the last
reckoning by the Office of Management and Budget, private outlays
to comply with social regulation topped $200 billion, and they are
rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   This is not necessarily bad, as people who have breathed the air
in Denver lately or taken a swim in Lake Erie can attest. But ask
an economist who follows regulatory issues, and you will hear that
federal regulation is a hodgepodge of the smart and the perverse,
the elegantly precise and the miserably flat-footed, the
extraordinarily cost-effective and the grotesquely wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the new Joint Center for Regulatory Studies fits
in. The center, sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and
the Brookings Institution, will act as a nonpartisan watchdog,
assessing big-ticket initiatives and producing an annual report on
the effect of regulation. ``The real purpose is to keep the
regulators _ and the legislators who regulate the regulators _ on
their toes,'' said Robert Hahn, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been struggling with questions of how much social
regulation is enough since the early 1970s, when the government's
role in health, safety and the environment began to mushroom.
Presidents Nixon and Ford made modest attempts to coordinate
executive agency rule-making and to review proposed rules.
President Carter established two permanent oversight groups within
the executive branch to formalize the process.
</P>
<P>
   But as the effect of social regulation grew in the years of
Presidents Reagan and Bush, oversight took on a more partisan cast.
And though the adversarial atmospherics have largely cleared since
the election of President Clinton, regulatory review remains a game
that only insiders play. ``The only comments regulators generally
get are self-interested comments,'' said Robert Litan, co-director
of the joint center.
</P>
<P>
   A decidedly mixed bag has resulted. At one end of the spectrum,
the rules phasing out lead additives from gasoline are widely
viewed as a model of efficiency, flexibility and solid science. At
the other, inconceivably expensive Superfund rules require the
government to make every toxic waste site as clean as it was before
human beings populated the planet. Meanwhile, bipartisan efforts to
anchor rule-making in good economics and good science _ for
example, a measure sponsored last year by Sens. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., and Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. _ have gotten nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between those who fear the quiet accretion of social
regulation and those who see regulatory change as a plot to roll
back a quarter-century of progress won't be easily resolved. But
the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution are
trying to narrow these differences by opening the regulatory
process to the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congressional Budget Office routinely analyzes budgets,
and think tanks routinely second-guess them,'' Litan said. ``But
we'll be the first to look systematically at federal regulation,
which now costs consumers more than total discretionary government
spending costs the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint center, which just opened solely on the strength of
foundation grants, says it will release in-depth analyses of a few
proposed big-ticket rules each year. It will also publish an annual
assessment of the costs and benefits of all federal regulation,
backstopping the once-over-lightly assessments by the Office of
Management and Budget, which have been required by law since 1997.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As important, the center will assess the effect of existing
regulation. At the moment, neither Congress nor the White House has
the stomach to evaluate hugely expensive rules that may have
outlived their usefulness but are still defended by entrenched
interests. Hahn cites the example of the corporate average fuel
economy standards for cars, which add billions of dollars to the
nation's transportation bill with questionable effect on energy use
or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes toward regulation expose the gulf between the way
economists and just about everyone else thinks. To economists,
rules are undesirable unless the benefits _ tangible and intangible
_ exceed the costs. Otherwise, there must be some other way to
organize the world that leaves everyone better off. But to many,
the cost-benefit analysis that forms the bedrock of regulatory
analysis is just a fancy way to rationalize self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   The joint center project probably won't change many minds. But
in Hahn's view, it is a promising place to start. ``We're not going
to have a real debate over regulatory reform until people have a
source of information they can really trust,'' he said.

SPANISH OFFICIALS SENTENCED FOR 1983 KIDNAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ A divided Supreme Court panel on Wednesday
sentenced two high-ranking officials in the 1980s government of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to 10 years in prison after finding
them and 10 lower-ranking officials guilty of kidnapping in a
shadowy struggle against Basque separatist terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   By 7 to 4, the court found the former Interior Minister Jose
Barrionuevo and his director of state security, Rafael Vera, guilty
of having a French furniture dealer, whom they mistook for a Basque
terrorist, kidnapped from his home across the border in France in
December 1983.
</P>
<P>
   With Julian Sancristobal, the former civil governor of Vizcaya
province, and some of the other defendants, Barrionuevo and Vera
were also found guilty of misappropriating government money to pay
thugs to carry out the crime. Sancristobal also received a 10-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in the seven-week trial was so keenly awaited that
various versions of it began leaking to Spanish newspapers last
week, and the conservative prime minister who defeated Gonzalez in
national elections two years ago, Jose Maria Aznar, said under
public pressure that he would not try to use the verdict to score
political points.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict rekindled a long-smoldering national debate about
whether Gonzalez, one of the fathers of Spanish democracy after the
long dictatorship of Francisco Franco, has been telling the truth
over the many years in which he has denied having any knowledge of
illegal actions against Basque terrorists. He denied it again last
month under oath during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Gonzalez, now talked about as a possible
candidate for the presidency of the European Union's Executive
Commission two years from now, hurried back to Spain from a
vacation in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target was Felipe Gonzalez and the Socialist Party,''
Vera, the security official, told a Spanish radio station, and he
said he would appeal to the Constitutional Court or the European
Court of Justice in Strasbourg, France, to clear his name. He and
Barrionuevo have denied approving the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven judges in the majority, in an opinion read by
Judge Joaquin Delgado Garcia, said Wednesday, ``It does not seem
credible to us that high officials in Vizcaya could act without the
knowledge and approval of the highest officials in the Interior
Ministry charged here.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Socialist Party said Gonzalez's camp was
heartened by the dissenting opinions, including one signed by the
panel's chief judge, Jose Jimenez Villarejo, that found the
prosecution case against the two top government officials not
proved.
</P>
<P>
   None of the defendants were present when the sentences were read
in court Wednesday afternoon, and lawyers said it was unlikely Vera
or Barrionuevo would face jail before September.
</P>
<P>
   The armed separatist struggle by the underground Basque group
ETA, whose initials in the Basque language stand for the words
``Basque Homeland and Liberty,'' continues, three decades after it
began. Spanish authorities say it has taken about 800 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his supporters charge that prosecutors now looking
into government actions in the 1980s are playing into the hands of
Aznar's conservatives. But at least 27 people are believed to have
died as a result of activities of the Anti-Terrorist Liberation
Groups, whose first publicly acknowledged action was kidnapping
Segundo Marey, the victim in the trial that ended Wednesday. And
prosecutors are investigating at least half a dozen other cases
that could lead to trials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the majority verdict on Wednesday said, Basque
terrorism was ``a political and social problem of the highest order
in the Basque country and all of Spain, singularly aggravated
because the French authorities were not collaborating with the
Spanish authorities, so that the south of France had become a
refuge for ETA members who carried out various crimes on our
territory and could later cross with impunity into France.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marey, 51 at the time, told the court that he was sitting at
home in Hendaye, France, watching Benny Hill on television at 8
p.m. on Dec. 4, 1983, when two burly kidnappers burst in and
dragged him out into the wintry night in his socks into a car. The
kidnappers were looking for Mikel Lujua, a suspected ETA terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to the mistake after the victim was bundled into Spain,
Vera contacted Spanish police and civilian officials in Bilbao by
telephone, the judges in the majority found. The police chief, one
of his top aides and Sancristobal then called in the top Socialist
official for the province for advice, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the verdict said, Sancristobal got approval from
Barrionuevo, the interior minister, to keep Marey prisoner to use
him as a bargaining chip to get the French authorities to release
four Spanish policemen who had been arrested after botching an
attempt to capture yet another Basque terrorist two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After the Spanish Red Cross received a note on Dec. 6
threatening Marey's death within 48 hours unless the demand was
met, the four Spanish policemen were released. Marey was held
blindfolded and lightly clad in a cold mountain hut, and by the
time he was freed on Dec. 14 he had lost more than 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In his pocket was a note the court said had been approved by
Sancristobal. ``You will have more news from GAL,'' it said,
referring to the initials for the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting opinion by Villarejo and Judge Gregoria Garcia
Ancos said, ``It is a secret to no one, in effect, that the case
was profusely used by some political parties to attack the
government of which Barrionuevo was a part, and has continued to be
used in the political confrontation after the elections that
brought a new government to power.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority on Wednesday did not find, however, that the
prosecutors had proved GAL was a terrorist armed group under
Spanish law ``in this concrete case,'' a key element in the
prosecution's attempt to show that the government of the day was
conducting a ``dirty war'' against the ETA.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of membership in an armed group as well as the
other crimes, Sancristobal, Vera and Barrionuevo could have
received jail sentences of up to 23 years, as the prosecution had
requested.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of the defendants convicted Wednesday were ordered to
share payment of a $200,000 indemnity to Marey, who still lives in
France.

CAMBODIA'S POST-ELECTION CAMPAIGN IS IN FULL SWING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By SETH MYDANS c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ One of the three main candidates climbed
a tree and shouted through a bullhorn. One threatened to amend the
constitution so that he could stay in office. One fell suddenly
silent and dropped from sight.
</P>
<P>
   The post-election campaign for power in Cambodia was in full
swing Wednesday, three days after the nationwide parliamentary
vote. A preliminary official announcement of results is not due
until the weekend, but the maneuvering and bargaining had already
begun.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the bullhorn, Sam Rainsy, who was expected to get
the fewest votes, held a news conference here to denounce the
election as rife with fraud, though few independent observers
supported that view. He demanded a new vote in several selected
areas as a sort of test of whether the nationwide count had been
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The man who currently holds power, Hun Sen, said he would simply
stay on if his opponents did not like the election result. If
necessary, he said, he would amend the constitution to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As the man who was expected to win the most votes, according to
early projections, he was in a position Wednesday to say: ``I wish
to call on all political parties to honor the determination of our
people. Winning or losing is normal as far as democracy is
concerned. No one wins all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The third candidate, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who had earlier
joined Sam Rainsy in threatening to boycott the new Parliament and
block the formation of a government, was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts expected him to agree to let his
royalist party, known as Funcinpec, become the junior partner in a
new government, after a suitable period of protest and bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   With none of the parties expected to win the two-thirds majority
of Parliament's 122 seats needed to form a government, two of the
parties would need to join to form a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hearing the opening salvos,'' a European diplomat said.
``The two sides are each telling the other they are needed and
can't be ignored. I suspect Hun Sen and his party will let it ride
out and then start working on individual Funcinpec members. The
coffers will be open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he and other analysts said, the Prince and his party
would not be able to resist their chance at sharing in the spoils
of power, which in Cambodia's corrupt system include wealth as well
as political position.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy, he said, would probably continue doing what he is
doing now, and what he has done for years: act as Cambodia's chief
gadfly and political spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   The list of dozens of complaints about election irregularities
that Sam Rainsy presented today to the National Election Commission
was longer than that of any of the foreign and domestic observer
groups that have flooded Cambodia in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country that is still recovering from decades of mass
killings and civil war, his complaints, compiled from various
polling stations, seemed only to emphasize the peacefulness of
Sunday's election:
</P>
<P>
   _``Overcrowded and disorderly. Staff cannot control normal
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Ballot box has no number on it.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Doorkeeper is delaying by asking unnecessary questions,
inspecting voters. Voters are complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Ballot papers are being torn off from the bottom instead of
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Chief of polling station went into the polling booth with a
voter, carrying a pen in his hand, and she came out and put a
ballot in the box. He said that she was deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Ballot box loosely closed, lid is so loose you can stick your
fingers in the sides.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Saw two cases of people who were allowed to dip their middle
finger instead of their index finger, although they had one (into
the bottle of indelible ink). One was a policeman who felt it would
be dirty when he picked up food to eat. The second was the wife of
Siem Reap's governor, Toan Chay.''

THEATER AS JUICE, DREAM AND CATTLE PROD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ROAR OF THE CROWD: This article is the first in an occasional
series describing cultural events through their audiences'
experiences.) 
(bl) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not likely that the theater of the future will
exactly mirror the antics of the crazed Argentine ectomorphs
whizzing around like window washers on amphetamines in the former
bank building between Toys ``R'' Us and Starbucks across from Union
Square.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there's a signal or two to be found in the soggy,
hyperactive scene that's evolving this summer around the show
``Villa Villa'' by the ensemble called De la Guarda.
</P>
<P>
   The show has no seats, no plot, no dialogue and a predominantly
young, casual clientele. It plays out like an acrobatic New Year's
Eve in a surreal, strobe-lit, rain forest mosh pit where the
performers race around the walls on ropes and pulleys and the
audience gets to dance, soak, bat around balloons, scramble for
baubles and in some cases fly along with the cast.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way it is becoming one of the most talked about
and puzzled over off-Broadway productions of the year, one that has
raised in a particularly fevered way one of the theater's enduring
obsessions: how to get a generation raised on MTV interested in
seeing live theater.
</P>
<P>
   The show's audience has been getting older as publicity and good
reviews have filtered out. But the core constituency that regularly
fills up the 499 spaces at what used to be Union Square Savings
Bank, and is now the Daryl Roth Theater, remains people in their
20s and early 30s, many of whom have heard about the show through
word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a dream, only more intense,'' said Feliz Skamser a
27-year-old art student who walked out into the night with a damp,
disheveled, wild-eyed look entirely appropriate for a production a
reviewer from The Guardian in London described as ``theater as good
as sex.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Guarda, of course, hardly invented nontraditional,
participatory theater, taken in different directions by the Living
Theater, La Fura dels Baus or Cirque de Soleil. And its production
is only one of a handful of shows like ``Rent,'' ``Stomp,'' ``Blue
Man Group,'' or ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' aimed
squarely at the Gen X and younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Villa Villa'' (it's pronounced VEE-shuh and roughly
translates as ``by the seat of your pants'') may be the most
extreme example of the appeal of a show that goes way beyond the
borders of conventional theater.
</P>
<P>
   John Arendt, who builds props and sets, and Sarah Murphy, a
graduate student in art education at New York University, both 23,
had seen the show once already and brought along their friend
Joseph Cahill, a 21-year-old who had just graduated from Alfred
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come out of this totally alive, totally awake, thrown off
balance,'' said Arendt. ``There are enough things that are like
sitting in front of a television and letting your brain vegetate.
This is a lot more refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal to the ``Friends'' and younger crowd is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it for the first time in Montreal, and I was so crazy I
couldn't sleep; it was everything I ever wanted to do,'' said David
Binder, a 30-year-old producer who brought De la Guarda to New York
along with Daryl Roth, who had produced ``Three Tall Women,'' and
Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum, two of the producers of
``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who've gone over the top, who love this show the
most passionately, are people who don't go to the theater very
often, who believe the theater has nothing for them,'' Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   Pichon Baldinu and Diqui James, the show's creators, said De la
Guarda was largely a reaction to the pessimistic theater and
audience apathy in Buenos Aires after the return to democratic
government in 1984. After coming up with productions meant to evoke
the apocalyptic chaos and fear that came in the wake of the
dictatorship, they came up with ``Villa Villa'' as a nonpolitical
way to jump-start audiences' emotions like an injection of
adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   But Baldinu said the show's cattle-prod intensity was also a
reaction to what he called the stale conventions of conventional
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 600 years, the theater has been based on the audience
believing things that no one really believes,'' he said. ``Now
young people don't buy into that anymore, so they find theater
boring. In Argentina no one goes to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're trying to break through all that and make a statement
that's so strong you have to pay attention. If you want a storm, we
make water and wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, flogging the dying beast of the theater has a long
history, and for now, with record Broadway box offices and
innovative productions like ``Rent,'' ``Cabaret'' or even ``The
Lion King,'' the beast seems pretty vital.
</P>
<P>
   And whether ``Villa Villa'' is theater or spectacle is open to
debate. California Burrito up the street bills itself as ``extreme
food,'' and its huge posters of ``Villa Villa''-ish mountain
climbers and surfers raise the issue of whether De la Guarda is
just ``extreme theater,'' more off-Broadway's answer to mountain
skateboarding than the theater's next big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though a flood of ``Villa Villas'' are unlikely to
replace ``Cats'' on Broadway or on the road, even theater series
outside New York are increasingly including at least one
nontraditional production, according to the League of American
Theaters and Producers.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Stephen Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan''
escalates the intensity level to almost unbearable levels in its
depiction of World War II, or ``Cabaret'' puts its audience in the
Kit Kat Klub, ``Villa Villa'' in a very different way hooks into a
broad-based desire for emotional juice and immediacy that clearly
goes beyond the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely edgier than Mary Martin in `Peter Pan,''' said
Bob Fox, of Oradell, N.J., who came with his wife, Anita, and gave
their ages as ``over 70 and under 80.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to a lot of plays, but Broadway is mostly revivals that
we saw the first time around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their only bow to age was the pair of white plastic earplugs
both brought along. ``We brought them when we saw the Rolling
Stones at Giants Stadium, too,'' Fox said. ``We were the oldest
ones, there, too. But then the Rolling Stones are almost as old as
we are.''

 &HT;    HOUSE APPROVES LOW-LEVEL NUCLEAR DUMP SITE IN TEXAS
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rejecting pleas to protect a poor West Texas town
from becoming the ``nation's dumping ground,'' the House approved a
bill Wednesday allowing the transfer of low-level radioactive waste
to a site near Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 305-117 to pass the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Compact, a compromise plan approved earlier this
month by a House-Senate conference committee. The measure now goes
to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas delegation voted 21-6 Wednesday to pass the compact.
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee had stripped amendments proposed by
Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,
including one that would restrict waste from states other than
Texas, Maine and Vermont. The amendment would have delayed the site
because the states would have had to re-ratify the compact.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated such compacts with the Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Policy Act in the 1980s, and has already approved nine
similar compacts involving 42 states, said Rep. Joe Barton,
R-Texas, author of the Texas compact bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other compact has been approved overwhelmingly by
Congress, without change,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was vehemently opposed by Doggett, who said that
Sierra Blanca _ an impoverished and largely Hispanic town _ has
been targeted not for its ``suitability, but its vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chosen because it was perceived that the people of
Sierra Blanca lack the political power to be able to do something
to protect their neighborhood,'' Doggett said on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we are in favor of protecting the people of Texas, or
we are in favor of extending that Texas hospitality a little too
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the House vote, Wellstone reiterated that he would use
``every parliamentary tool available'' to prevent the measure from
passing in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be satisfied until the Texas Compact includes
protections against environmental discrimination and keeps Sierra
Blanca from becoming a national repository for radioactive waste,''
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The dump, which Texas wants to build at a site 90 miles
southeast of El Paso, would house radioactive components from
dismantled nuclear power plants and industrial and medical waste.
The compact would allow Maine and Vermont to ship their waste to
West Texas in exchange for payments of $25 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The House last fall passed the compact with Doggett's amendment,
which limited waste from any other states besides Maine and Vermont
to enter Texas. Wellstone added Doggett's amendment to the Senate
version of the bill _ which passed last April _ but a conference
committee stripped out the amendment earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also removed an amendment that would have allowed
local residents to challenge the dump site if they felt they had
been discriminated against based on race, color, national origin or
income level.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Texas
Republicans, have supported the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor and the Texas legislature have made a decision,
and he's not going to vote to overturn it,'' said Larry Neal, a
spokesman for Gramm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins, who simultaneously became one of
20th-century ballet's greatest choreographers and a towering
innovator in Broadway musicals, died Wednesday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who also had a house in Bridgehampton, was in Manhattan
when he suffered a stroke Saturday, said Deborah Koolish of the New
York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined the City Ballet in 1948 and helped shape the
company's creative profile with daring and brio for half a century
through his often startling, always experimental choreography in
ballet's classical idiom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he enjoyed phenomenal success on Broadway.
From 1944 to 1964, Robbins' golden touch was evident in musicals as
disparate as ``On the Town,'' ``The King and I,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``West
Side Story'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his acclaim on Broadway, Robbins made it clear that his
first love was dance, and ballet in particular. He returned to the
commercial theater briefly in 1989 with ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' but even this hit was an anthology of dance sequences
from past shows.
</P>
<P>
   His association with the City Ballet began when George
Balanchine, the company's artistic director, invited him to join at
the troupe's founding. Balanchine named Robbins associate artistic
director in 1949. After Balanchine's death in 1983, he and Peter
Martins served jointly until 1990 as the company's artistic
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance is about relationships,'' Robbins said. Attached to this
credo, he imbued his ballets, no matter how plotless, with human
insights and emotions that had a universal resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he was a very American choreographer who knew how to
distill the spirit of his time. But unlike others who created
ballets with pioneers and cowboys, Robbins did not indulge in
``Americana.'' He was not concerned with the myth of America but
with its reality.
</P>
<P>
   This genius for capturing the essence of an age was the Robbins
signature. It could be sensationally overt in a landmark Robbins
musical like ``West Side Story,'' with its indelible images of
1950s gang rumbles. But the same gift was even more vividly
expressed in any Robbins ballet, beginning with ``Fancy Free,'' an
evergreen masterpiece about three sailors on the town during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater,
Robbins created ``Fancy Free'' in 1944 as his first ballet. The
score was by a fellow unknown, Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, the choreographer said that he was more
interested in a world ``where things are not named,'' and his
exploration of ballet's classical idiom became more abstract and
profound. Nonetheless, he never lost sight of the pulse of his
times. In the epic ballets he created to music by Chopin and Bach,
he extended technical virtuosity and the art of partnering but also
defined contemporary encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation was a favorite Robbins theme, restated in works as
different as ``The Cage,'' an early masterpiece; ``Moves,'' a
ballet without music; the impressionistic ``Ives, Songs,'' and
cool, classical essays like ``Glass Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' artistic voice was distinctly his own, dazzling in its
originality. Remarkably, and unlike other choreographers, he never
seemed to repeat himself, especially in his 66 ballets. The same
was true to a lesser degree in the 15 Broadway musicals he
choreographed and occasionally directed (he was also production
supervisor for ``Funny Girl''). Shows from ``West Side Story'' to
``Peter Pan'' made Robbins' name familiar to hundreds of thousands
in the 1950s and '60s, and yet all differed in tone and style.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' inventiveness, in both ballet and musicals, stemmed in
large part from his willingness to mix disparate theatrical
elements. In 1945, while still in Ballet Theater, he wrote that his
vision of classical ballet encompassed a ``combination with other
theater forms in order to experiment and achieve a wider horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, he introduced conventions from ballet and
vernacular dance styles. A Robbins show was a model of integration,
driven especially by the idea that dancing, like words and music,
could carry the story forward. Descended from the innovators of
18th-century ballet d'action, Robbins never saw dance as just a
divertissement.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, his works for ballet companies were usually
essays in dramatized emotion, as seen in ``Afternoon of a Faun''
and ``The Cage,'' two provocative studies of male-female relations
that became Robbins classics. Even his 1969 Chopin masterwork,
``Dances at a Gathering,'' was, for all its plotlessness, a study
of a community.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical appeal of Robbins' ballets was quickly recognized
by Balanchine, and Robbins was as responsible as Balanchine in
establishing the City Ballet's reputation after 1948. The crucial
role that he played in the City Ballet's initial success was
recalled in 1988 by Todd Bolender, a former choreographer and
principal dancer in the company: ``Jerry was a great incentive for
Balanchine, contributing an American dance creativity in his
ballets that was of great importance to our early 1950's tours,
especially in Europe, where the Robbins ballets had an explosive
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure was, in fact, anathema to Robbins. Often abrasive in his
demands on both Broadway and in ballet, he ruthlessly drove his
collaborators, including actors and dancers, to extend themselves
beyond their own expectations.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional person who was known as something of a prankster in
his early career, Robbins, trim and white-bearded as time went by,
eventually acquired a solemn, patriarchal air. But anyone who knew
Robbins knew him as the ultimate perfectionist; he cast himself
aptly as a whip-cracking ringmaster in ``Circus Polka,'' a witty
piece he created for the City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival in 1972.
Here as well, he declared that his primary allegiance was to
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   After 1964, show business had ceased to interest him as a
serious endeavor. Rightly, he sensed that whatever his success on
Broadway, his eventual reputation would rest on his enduring
ballets. It was this output that made him the first major
American-born classical choreographer and a member of the
20th-century ballet pantheon that included Balanchine, Sir
Frederick Ashton, Michel Fokine and Antony Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins was born to Harry and Lena Rabinowitz on Oct. 11,
1918, in New York City. Robbins and his parents legally changed the
family name in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Success came early to Robbins. At the age of 3, he played the
piano in a public children's concert. Rabinowitz operated a
delicatessen, and with his wife, offered Jerome and his older
sister, Sonya, a breadth of cultural opportunities. ``I grew up in
the Jewish tradition that children must get all the culture
possible,'' Robbins said in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   When his father went into corset manufacturing in Union City,
N.J., the family moved to nearby Weehawken, where Robbins graduated
from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1935. Although he entered New
York University, planning to major in chemistry, he left in a year
because of a slump in his father's business.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Robbins had also taken lessons with his
sister's modern-dance teachers, Gluck Sandor and Felicia Sorel, who
directed the Dance Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor, whom Robbins later called his ``guru,'' attracted
considerable attention with his experimental productions. These
included ``Petrouchka,'' with Constructivist costumes by Vincente
Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor also worked with theatrical companies, and it was in
``The Brothers Ashkenazi,'' a 1937 Yiddish Art Theater production,
that Robbins made his professional debut with a two-word walk-on
role.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tenets crucial to Robbins' future success might be
traced to the influence of the Dance Center. Sandor impressed him
most, he said, by ``an imagination that evolved a different style
for every production.'' The Robbins gift for establishing immediate
audience contact stemmed from these early years. ``We dancers were
taught to perform with the concentration of actors,'' the
choreographer said, explaining that this meant ``the centering of
everything to pull the viewers into the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance, not ballet, was dominant in the 1930s, and no
American ballet troupes independent of opera houses managed to
survive. But Sandor told his student: ``Study ballet. It's going to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins immersed himself in ballet classes with Ella Daganova.
He also studied Spanish dancing with Helene Veola, oriental dance
with Nimura, interpretive dancing with his sister and Alyce Bentley
and choreography with Bessie Schoenberg at the New Dance League.
Many of the classes were subsidized by the New Deal's Works
Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Fancy Free'' was his first work for a ballet company,
Robbins had started choreographing while performing in summer shows
at Lake Tamiment, a Poconos resort in Bushkill, Pa., that served as
an incubator for rising talent like Danny Kaye and Imogene Coca.
The dancers there ranged from members of Martha Graham's company
like Dorothy Bird and Anita Alvarez to Balanchine disciples like
Ruthanna Boris. ``Jerry was considered to be a modern dancer at
that time, although he was deeply committed to ballet,'' Miss Bird
recalled in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' choreography at Tamiment included a duet for himself
and Miss Alvarez set to ``Strange Fruit,'' Billie Holiday's
recording of Lewis Allen's song about lynchings. Named after the
song, the work displayed the political commitment then common in
modern dance. Like-minded Robbins pieces, later seen in New York,
were ``Incident in Harlem'' and ``Death of a Loyalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also created a dance version of ``Our Town'' that was
incorporated into ``The Straw Hat Revue,'' which Max Leibman,
Tamiment's entertainment director, and the Shubert Organization
brought to New York in 1939. The show introduced Kaye to Broadway
and was in fact Robbins' Broadway choreographic debut although he
received no credit.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Robbins danced in the chorus of four musicals.
Some, including ``Keep Off the Grass'' in 1939, were choreographed
by Balanchine, then bereft of a ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined Ballet Theater only in its second season in
1940-41. Although not primarily remembered today as a dancer, he
left an impact on many who saw him perform at Ballet Theater and in
his own and Balanchine's works at the City Ballet. In any event,
his dancing career was overshadowed by his sensational success as a
choreographer. Robbins retired from dancing in 1952, although he
later appeared in cameo roles at the City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   While at Ballet Theater and in his early years on Broadway,
Robbins was also politically active. When called before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities in May 1953, the choreographer
said he had belonged to the American Communist Party's Theatrical
Transient Group between 1943 and 1947. Many in the arts never
forgave Robbins for naming eight colleagues as members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Velde, R-Ill., chairman of the committee, praised
Robbins for his testimony, which the choreographer justified on the
grounds that he had made ``a great mistake in joining the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his testimony, Robbins had already choreographed
hits like ``On the Town,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and ``The King and
I.'' His Broadway career was at stake: had he not cooperated with
the panel, he risked being blacklisted in the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for the Soviet Union was nonetheless common when that
country and the United States were allies in World War II. A more
universal statement about that period came from Robbins in ``Fancy
Free.'' A shrewd, warm and idiomatic picture of young people in
1944, ``Fancy Free'' offered something new in ballet: ``The
revelation of democratic human relationships,'' as George Amberg
wrote in his book, ``Ballet in America'' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   The same writer saw Robbins' next and equally enduring ballet,
``Interplay'' (1945) as proof ``that the contemporary American
style is not determined by the nature of the subject but by the
character of the execution.'' In The New York Times, John Martin
wrote that the work's ``eight dancers perform in an idiom and a
style that have meaning for them.'' The idea that Robbins ballets
offered a collective self-portrait of an entire American generation
was shared by the choreographer himself through the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the success of ``Fancy Free'' catapulted
Robbins into a second, parallel, career on Broadway. Oliver Smith,
the ballet's designer, urged Robbins and Leonard Bernstein to
expand the sailors-on-leave theme into a musical comedy. With a
book by two unknown writers, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and the
authority of a veteran director, George Abbott, the collaborators
had a hit on their hands. The musical, called ``On the Town,''
opened on Dec. 28, 1944, and struck a responsive chord in a
war-weary audience that identified with its urban comedy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dance became a major component of any Robbins musical. In 1945,
he choreographed ``Billion Dollar Baby,'' also directed by Abbott,
while ``High Button Shoes'' (1947) confirmed his ingenuity for
period stylization. The Roseland Ballroom honored Robbins and
Martha Graham simultaneously with an award, she for ``bringing art
to the masses'' and he for being ``tops in Terpsichore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Ma _ I'm Dancing'' (1948), with a book by Robbins and
directed by him and Abbott, was a takeoff on a touring ballet
company. The typical Robbins comic timing was illustrated by a
Pullman car scene in which sleepwalkers tumbled in and out of
berths. In quick succession, Robbins choreographed ``Miss Liberty''
(1949), ``Call Me Madam'' (1950), ``The King and I'' (1951) and
``Two's Company'' (1952).
</P>
<P>
   Although not the first to treat serious subjects in musical
comedy, Robbins impressed Broadway with ``The Small House of Uncle
Thomas,'' his unconventional antislavery ballet in ``The King and
I.'' The sequence borrowed from Asian dance idioms. La Meri, an
American modern dancer, had earlier retold ``Swan Lake'' in the
same way, but ``The Small House'' looked fresh, not derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' integrated vision of musicals became more pronounced in
shows when he took over the role of director as well as
choreographer. He was co-director of ``The Pajama Game'' (1954)
with Abbott; he adapted, directed and choreographed ``Peter Pan,''
starring Mary Martin (1954), and he directed ``Bells Are Ringing''
(1956).
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he directed and choreographed ``Gypsy,'' and in 1964,
he served as production supervisor of ``Funny Girl.'' But the two
most successful musicals of his career were those he conceived,
directed and choreographed: ``West Side Story,'' an updated version
of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in 1957, and ``Fiddler on the Roof,''
inspired by Sholom Aleichem's stories, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also acted as show doctor, patching up five productions.
He choreographed Aaron Copland's ``Tender Land'' for the New York
City Opera (1954) and directed two nonmusical productions: Arthur
Kopit's ``Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm
Feelin' So Sad,'' and Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage and her
Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his acclaim in show business (which included five
Donaldson Awards, four Tonys, two Oscars for the 1961 film version
of ``West Side Story'' and an Emmy for a televised version of
``Peter Pan''), Robbins remained primarily devoted to ballet.
</P>
<P>
   His later works were more classical but in 1946, he typically
caused a stir with ``Facsimile,'' the first of his ballets about
contemporary neuroses. The cast consisted of Robbins and two Ballet
Theater stars, Nora Kaye and John Kriza. The ballet's love triangle
came to an end with Ms. Kaye's cry of ``Stop!'' Looking back in
1990, Robbins said, ``It was sort of a transitional piece, and it
came out of a situation in my own life when I was involved with two
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaye, in fact, told The New York Times in 1951 that she
planned to marry Robbins on April 16 of that year. The engagement
was broken and Robbins, who was very private about his life, never
married. He is survived by his sister, Sonya Cullinen of
Wilmington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins had cast Miss Kaye in ``The Cage,'' an allegory about
man-eating female insects that commented at best on the eternal
battle of the sexes and at worst suggested that women instinctively
hate men. For all its sensational aura, it became one of the
classics Robbins choreographed in his first decade at the City
Ballet. In 1953, ``Afternoon of a Faun'' stunned audiences by its
mix of sensuousness and simplicity. An updated gloss on Nijinsky's
1913 ballet to the same Debussy score, the work epitomized the
Robbins genius for discovering the rightness of every movement.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Robbins was shuttling between Broadway and
ballet. In 1958, he took a step that led to an informal leave from
the City Ballet. For the first Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, that summer, he directed an ad hoc group of dancers that
became Ballets: U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Although short-lived, this Robbins troupe had a huge success in
Europe and embodied a specifically American spirit in ballets like
``Moves'' and ``N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz.'' The group disbanded in
1961 but reassembled for a White House dinner in 1962 given by
President John F. Kennedy for the Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Robbins returned to Ballet Theater to choreograph his
version of a peasant wedding in ``Les Noces.'' Just as
surprisingly, he then embarked on three years of quiet
experimentation in a project that he called the American Theater
Laboratory. His unrealized aim, he said later, was to create
theater pieces in the way that he composed ballets.
</P>
<P>
   On some level, the experience reopened the floodgates of his
creativity. Returning to the New York City Ballet in 1969, where
Balanchine named him ballet master, he astonished both the theater
and dance worlds with the invention that poured into ``Dances at a
Gathering.'' Subsequent major ballets included ``The Goldberg
Variations,'' an 85-minute exposition of the ballet lexicon, and
``Watermill,'' in which Edward Villella reclined onstage,
meditating on life and phases of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Balanchine, who had choreographed little between 1968
and 1972, was subject to increasing speculation that his creativity
had come to an end. That he then needed Robbins by his side was
obvious. Yet even after he recovered from this dry spell,
Balanchine continued to work with Robbins in a relationship of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before Balanchine died on April 1, 1983, the City
Ballet's board named Robbins and Peter Martins, a principal dancer
in the company, as artistic directors. After Lincoln Kirstein, the
company's co-founder, resigned in September 1989, Robbins announced
that he wished to work on other projects and would resign his own
post on Jan. 1, 1990. He continued to rehearse the company for its
``Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets'' and, in effect, left the
troupe in June of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after restaging his works for the Paris Opera Ballet,
Robbins choreographed a plotless Bach ballet, ``Two- and Three-Part
Inventions,'' in June 1994 for the School of American Ballet. It
was transferred in the fall to the City Ballet. Robbins explained
that he was returning from ``a break.'' A few months earlier, he
had created a solo to Bach for Mikhail Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the City Ballet acquired a hit in ``West Side
Story Suite,'' based on dances from his show, Robbins had a heart
valve replaced. But in 1997, he finished a major work for the
company, ``Brandenburg,'' to the Bach concertos. During rehearsals,
he had said, ``I feel I have one more big ballet in me.'' It was
his last new work.

<P>
   BOSTON _ In its first effort to make art from Africa, Oceania
and pre-Columbian America part of its permanent exhibit, the Museum
of Fine Arts here has stepped into the storm over the questionable
provenance of art, which is buffeting major museums and private
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials curtly rejected a request from Guatemala to
eventually return a 138-piece collection of Mayan art that is the
jewel of its pre-Columbian display. In a two-paragraph letter
written a month ago to a Guatemalan official, Malcolm Rogers,
director of the museum, said that its board of trustees ``found no
basis'' for Guatemala's ownership claim because the country could
not produce legal title to the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala, meanwhile, charges that the museum has refused to
produce documents that prove the collection was legally removed
from a region where the U.S. government has long recognized that
Mayan sites are endangered by looters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can no longer consider the M.F.A. to be an ethical art
institution,'' said Carlos Enrique Zea Flores, an archaeologist who
is Guatemala's vice minister for culture and sports. ``It's more
like a collector who buys and sells pieces looted from the Mayan
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the 128-year-old museum opened three permanent
galleries for art, artifacts and cultural objects from Africa,
Oceania and Latin America, which feature collections from two
longtime patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The African collection of about 150 pieces includes 13 pieces
that are on long-term loan from a museum overseer. The Malian
Embassy in Washington has asked the United States to help it
repatriate two of the African antiquities that are on loan. The
Malian government said the items were smuggled out of the country
probably after 1993 despite Malian laws prohibiting their
excavation or export and a U.S. law forbidding their import.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, the museum director, said that his institution is not
responsible for settling the dispute, because the artifacts are on
loan from a private collector, William Teel.
</P>
<P>
   The November Collection of Mayan works from Guatemala was
purchased for the museum by a trustee in 1987 who officially
donated it in 1988, the museum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we have legal title to it, we have the right and the
duty to display these works, which are extraordinary advocates for
their culture,'' Rogers said. Otherwise, he continued, they would
be closeted away in private collections.
</P>
<P>
   Zea Flores said the high-quality Mayan burial urns, gold
adornments and polychrome ceramics with hieroglyphics, all from El
Peten jungle, were stolen from Mayan sites and smuggled from the
country without the export permits that Guatemala has required
since 1947. This removal also violated a 1970 U.N. accord intended
to stem the looting of cultural property, Guatemalan officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the museum to show me their export permits; they
haven't,'' Zea Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the best way for museums, universities and private
collectors to support Mayan culture is to help the Guatemalan
government preserve what remains of its art and return what has
been looted.
</P>
<P>
   The items in the November Collection are ``part of our history,
our patrimony, and they were taken out illegally,'' Zea Flores
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers declined to comment on whether the museum had export
permits for the Mayan collection and refused to allow a reporter to
review the museum's documentation on the pieces. Instead, he said,
``We look to American law and what is appropriate in the U.S.,''
adding that he did not believe Guatemala had presented legal proof
that it owns the collection.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the museum has relied on the letter of U.S. law
and that Guatemala and Mali have relied on their own national laws.
Moreover, Guatemala and Mali apparently have international law on
their side. Further, the museum's critics say that international
museum and academic ethics in dealing with such artifacts seem to
be opposed to the museum's position. That custom supports the
contention that artifacts belong to the country of origin unless a
clear, traceable title proves otherwise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a further tangle. The November Collection, for
instance, may have entered the United States legally but have left
Guatemala illegally. That is because the United States did not sign
the U.N. accord until 1983, 13 years after its creation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, when the trustee Landon Clay bought the Mayan works for
the museum, the institution asked him to hire an attorney to assure
them that Clay would have a clear, legal title. On this point,
``the lawyer's opinion was conclusive,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   But last winter The Boston Globe reported that the attorney,
Weld Henshaw, a partner in the Boston law firm Choate Hall &AMP;
Stewart, was aware that Guatemalan law required export permits for
Mayan artifacts but that no permits were issued. More recently,
Henshaw declined to comment on the matter. Clay, a Boston
businessman who has given the museum $1.5 million in art and money,
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Shestack, the museum's director when the Mayan purchase was
made and now the deputy director of the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the museum bought the Mayan objects, it had an ethical
obligation to determine how they left Guatemala and, if they were
looted, to return them, said Martin Sullivan, director of the Heard
Museum in Phoenix and chairman of the President's Committee on
Cultural Property.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Leventhal, director of the Institute of Archaeology at
the University of California at Los Angeles, said, ``As the moral
face of our society, the museum in Boston cannot decline to state,
or to care, whether these objects were illegally exported.''
</P>
<P>
   The pillage of Mayan ruins in El Peten had become so alarming
that by April 1991 the U.S. Customs Service banned the import of
such artifacts into the United States. In 1993, Mali won a similar
ban. With the art market booming, looting continues in Latin
America, Southeast Asia and China, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Information Agency said such theft was a
$4.5-billion-a-year business globally and had become one of the top
law-enforcement problems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the M.F.A., we don't condone looting,'' Rogers said. ``We
hope the countries in question can resolve it.''

MESSIAEN'S `FRANCOIS' HAS STAYING POWER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Permanence, these days, comes electronic. Even in the world of
what was once ``classical'' music, the most a composer can expect
for a big work is a run of performances leading to a recording,
after which the score might as well be dropped in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions. In the 15 years since its premiere,
Olivier Messiaen's opera ``St. Francois d'Assise'' has, like a
classic of older times, gone on growing through repeated
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Its demands _ an orchestra of 120 (including 3 players on ondes
martenot, the 1930s electronic instrument that Messiaen's music has
preserved) and a choir of 150 _ mean that it will never be a
regular repertory item, but it has had two full-scale productions
and a good number of complete or partial performances in the
concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   For an emergent classic like this, recordings have the value not
only of making the music available but also of documenting its
performance history. The original production at the Paris Opera in
1983, conducted by Seiji Ozawa, was recorded on CD, as was a
concert version that was given in the Netherlands soon after, with
Kent Nagano in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now Orfeo presents the concert performance of four of the
opera's eight scenes that took place at the 1985 Salzburg Festival
(C 485 982 1; two CDs).
</P>
<P>
   This was a major event. It introduced the work to Salzburg,
where it was to have its second production, in 1992, a production
to be revived there this month.
</P>
<P>
   It also proved the viability of a concert made of selected
scenes, and led to a run of other such performances, often with the
same four scenes on the program. Such was the case three years
later in London, where Messiaen attended a performance on his 80th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   This mini-``St. Francois,'' just over two hours long, starts
with the scene in which Francis cures the Leper with an embrace and
is himself cured of the disgust that had kept him from full
sympathy with the suffering. Then comes a jump to the three final
scenes. Francis preaches to the birds, prays for and receives the
stigmata (the five wounds of Christ on the Cross), and dies in the
company of his brother monks, the Angel and all of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   But quite apart from the function this 1985 Salzburg performance
had in promoting the opera, it was evidently a great musical
occasion. You can hear it growing in intensity. The Vienna Radio
Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Lothar Zagrosek, seems at first to
be speaking a slightly foreign language: it has problems with
rhythm, accentuation and ensemble. But these rapidly fall away, and
the music starts to sound as it should, full of exuberance, color
and glory.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Angel and the Leper, whose roles are relatively
small, two kinds of creatures are depicted in the score: monks and
birds. Both sing as they are accustomed to sing in life: the monks
in chant and the birds in shrieks, calls and liquid songs. For the
most part, Messiaen alternates between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and his brothers sing their lines with warm harmonic
accompaniment from string or wind groups, then the whole
magnificent assembly of the orchestra is set free for the birds.
Fittingly for a portrait of a man who loved Creation, the opera
places Francis's drama _ which is, as Messiaen put it, ``the
progress of grace'' in his soul _ in a context of nature music,
brilliant, loud and agile.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time the birds are there to represent heaven on
earth: the perfection that human beings will have to wait to
achieve and that Francis is shown achieving. But Messiaen's birds
can also be sinister (the hooting owl at the start of the stigmata
scene), hieratic (the Pacific bird that each time announces the
arrival of the Angel) or weird (the New Caledonian bird songs on
ondes martenot in the bird sermon scene). Whatever the expressive
mode, the performances by the Vienna players, as soloists or in
small groups, soon become lustrous and exact.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful, too, are the contributions of the Austrian Radio
Chorus and the Arnold Schoenberg Choir. Messiaen uses his huge
chorus to sing as the voice of the unseen God, addressing Francis
in the scene where he receives the stigmata, or of the heavenly
host surrounding God in the final scene, where Francis dies and is
_ out of direct view on the stage _ reborn.
</P>
<P>
   But choral voices also appear without words to add to the
atmosphere of violence and unease in the scene where Francis
summons the spiritual strength to embrace the Leper. All through
this performance the choral singing is strong and vividly present.
</P>
<P>
   In the central role, Messiaen said he wanted the vigor of
Golaud, in Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' combined with the
``declamatory solemnity'' of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. Here he
has those qualities in abundance, for he has Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau.
</P>
<P>
   It is moving to hear Fischer-Dieskau, who retired four years
ago, take on, at an advanced point in his career, a big new part
outside his normal repertory. He rarely sounds strained; for the
most part he is robust and majestic, providing the sureness with
which Francis is to be seen taking his spiritual steps forward and
upward.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the bird sermon scene he mounts with strength
and total authority to the high note on ``Croix'' (``Cross''), a
gesture he repeats at the end of the scene, where the same sound is
contained in ``surcroit'' (``excess'').
</P>
<P>
   But with all the power and grandeur, and the vehemence almost on
the edge of anger, he can also be gentle when Francis has the
opportunity to reflect rather than declaim, and so to become, for a
moment, a human being as well as a saint.
</P>
<P>
   There is an example in the scene with the Leper, where, in
response to the latter's reproaches about his treatment by the
young Franciscan community, Francis comments, ``Poor brothers, they
do all they can,'' and Fischer-Dieskau inflects the line with a
wise sadness.
</P>
<P>
   He has some excellent supporters. Kenneth Riegel repeats his
blistered, expostulating but thoroughly musical performance of the
Leper from the first performance; Rachel Yakar is magically serene
as the Angel, and Sebastian Vittucci makes a special, beautiful
moment of Brother Bernard's prayer to Francis not to die.
</P>
<P>
   As the opera has it, he both dies and does not die. It is good
to have this performance in its own resurrection.

`MOSTLY MOZART': WELCOME RESPITE WITH HIGHS AND LOWS

   NEW YORK _ A city that regularly suffers the dog days of July
and August needs its palliatives. There is ice cream for the
palate, air-conditioning to placate the body and for the ear,
Mostly Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong festival returned to Lincoln Center for the 32nd
year on Tuesday night. Once again its programs are friendly, and
once again its concert halls will serve as refuges from the
streets. Mostly Mozart concerts are gratefully received by those
overloaded and overstimulated by the summer days of New York. In
the well-cooled climate of Avery Fisher Hall, with steamy urban
chaos held momentarily at bay, listeners on Tuesday could sit back
and let their spirits snooze for an hour or two.
</P>
<P>
   This opening event offered Richard Strauss and Mozart, with
Gerard Schwarz conducting the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra,
Andre Watts playing the piano and Angelika Kirchschlager of Austria
offering us her first-rate mezzo-soprano voice.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the festival's expected amenities this season come
some splashes of inventiveness, especially the start of a two-year
survey of Haydn's string quartets, to be played in hourlong
early-evening events. Haydn invented the quartet medium and was its
most successful practitioner (Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and
Bartok notwithstanding). The chance to hear these wondrous pieces
in concentrated and consecutive form is a considerable gift of the
festival to its public.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this summer, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment
and the Concerto Koln will speak for the early-music movement.
Gidon Kremer and his Kremerata Baltica will arrive to stir
otherwise calm waters, performing pieces by Arvo Part, Nino Rota,
Astor Piazzolla and 20th-century Russians. Vivaldi's ``Four
Seasons'' will be Kremer's antidote for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's concert was a long and laborious throat-clearing that
started badly and ended well. The excerpts from Strauss'
``Bourgeois Gentilhomme'' were ragged affairs, vaguely together and
clearly underrehearsed. The Strauss segment was rescued by Ms.
Kirchschlager, an articulate and committed singer in songs like
``Das Rosenband,'' ``Morgen'' and ``Muttertandelei.''
</P>
<P>
   The young mezzo was also strong in two examples of the operatic
Mozart: ``E giunge a questo segno'' from ``La Finta Giardiniera''
and ``Parto, ma tu ben mio'' from ``La Clemenza di Tito.'' Here was
the composer at the very beginning of his opera career and at the
very end. Tuesday's audience, if it was not terribly concerned
about such historical matters, clearly loved the singer's work.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was soloist in Mozart's E flat Concerto (K. 271), a big
work in every way and an anomaly in the composer's early and
otherwise genteel repertory. It was a comfortable glide of a
performance and disturbing for that reason. Careless passage work
hid behind a lovely blur of sound. Trills aimed for speed rather
than clarity. The finale became an out-of-breath footrace in which
the pianist was not always in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Possessed of so much inherent musicality, Watts chose to coast,
ignoring the weight of a mighty piece and relying on a creamy
legato to get by. It was distressing to observe that which once
promised so much musically operating in such a state of regression.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz and his players did have a parting gift for their
listeners: a performance of Mozart's ``Jupiter'' Symphony that
truly worked. The tempos of the first movement made space for
articulation. The yearning melodic lines of the Minuetto were
beautifully paced and very touching. The finale was a delight.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Diplomats tracking human rights abuses in
Kosovo say they have been unable to learn the fate of more than
20,000 civilians who fled on Tuesday from a Yugoslav government
counteroffensive against ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   As the government attacks continue and fears of rights
violations grow, foreign monitors and aid workers say their
movements are being restricted by Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western countries accused the
Yugoslav government of brutality against civilians in past
offensives, and after being threatened with military action by
NATO, Yugoslav officials agreed to protect civilians and to allow
foreign observers to monitor the Yugoslav military and police
forces.
</P>
<P>
   But with the foreign observer mission badly understaffed and
with access restricted, monitors have lost track of more than
20,000 refugees who fled Tuesday from Malisevo when the town came
under attack from government troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume they are in great difficulty,'' said a European
diplomat. ``They must be scattered in the countryside in many
places, but we don't know. There are many children and many elderly
among them. Who knows what condition they are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these fears, diplomats also said they saw the
possibility of negotiations between Yugoslavia and the ethnic
Albanians on autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the government forces began their largest offensive
against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo province, where ethnic
Albanians are about 90 percent of the population. In the last six
months an organization called the Kosovo Liberation Army has grown
from a small group of insurgents to a broadly based movement
demanding independence for the province.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees from Malisevo are among an unknown number of people
who are fleeing the fighting. ``One has to hold the government
responsible for creating these refugees,'' a senior Western
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other diplomats said they did not have enough information
to decide if government forces had been so brutal that NATO action
is needed. ``I don't want to say we haven't crossed the line and
then tomorrow morning find there are 1,000 people dead in a field
somewhere,'' the senior diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats said there is no exact test for recommending
NATO military action or further sanctions against Yugoslavia, which
now has only two republics, Serbia and Montenegro. Rather it is ``a
kind of consensus by all of us and our governments that would be
reached if events became too terrible to countenance,'' one
European said. ``But for the moment we are not learning what the
truth is about conditions in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign observers, diplomats and military experts, from the
United States, Russia and European countries, were turned back by
Yugoslav authorities in several combat areas Wednesday, they said.
Near one town they were barred from, Junik, they reported hearing
the sounds of heavy combat.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian political parties say 20 people were executed
Tuesday by Yugoslav forces in Junik. A senior Western diplomat said
Wednesday that he had raised that report with top Yugoslav
officials but had got no satisfactory answer.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and monitors said that in many areas where
they were permitted, villages had been shelled and many homes
burned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``From what we could see, it looked as if there was an attempt
to take territory and move the civilian population out,'' one
monitor said. ``It looks as if the Yugoslav Army is trying to keep
its own casualties low by laying back and using artillery and
tanks. That can be very hard on civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign journalists, traveling in a group organized by
government officials, visited Malisevo, which until the
counteroffensive had been a rebel stronghold. They reported it to
be deserted except for three families and an elderly man who said
he had stayed to care for his cows.
</P>
<P>
   In Malisevo and area villages there were an estimated 10,000 to
15,000 ethnic Albanians until last week, when about 20,000 refugees
arrived after government forces recaptured the city of Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. relief officials who were able to reach Malisevo last
Thursday described conditions as desperate. On Wednesday they said
that they did not know what had happened to the people there and
that access for relief workers in most of the province was blocked
either by fighting or by government authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said most refugees are probably in areas
controlled by the rebels and would not go back to Malisevo or
Orahovac even if the government offensive ended. ``I think the
Albanian public is terrorized by the security forces and not
prepared to return unless there is a new security situation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats also said they are close to arranging an alliance
of ethnic Albanian groups that could negotiate with the Yugoslav
government for some kind of autonomy for Kosovo. This may be
difficult because, while Western governments say they do not want
Kosovo to be independent, most ethnic Albanians say they will
accept nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats say the Albanian political leaders have agreed in
principle to form a negotiating team, though they have not decided
on the team's membership or who will lead it. The Kosovo Liberation
Army was officially invited to join the alliance only Wednesday,
but did not immediately respond, diplomats said.

HOUSE OKS CREATION OF NUCLEAR WASTE SITE IN WEST TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Maine, Vt.) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House gave its overwhelming approval Wednesday
to legislation authorizing the creation of a low-level nuclear
waste disposal site in west Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 305-117, members endorsed the claim by the states
of Maine, Texas and Vermont that the site would pose no health or
environmental risks to the community of Sierra Blanca, where
construction on the dump site could begin this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must vote on the final bill as well before sending it
on to President Clinton for his signature. But the tally there is
expected to mirror the House's show of support for the three-state
compact.
</P>
<P>
   The facility would be the final dumping ground for radioactive
materials from electricity generating plants, hospitals and medical
clinics in Maine, Texas and Vermont. But the site, to be built with
$25 million from each state, will also be allowed to accept
radioactive materials from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill argued that the site would never be
opened to other states looking to dispose of nuclear garbage. But,
at the request of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the House and Senate
versions were stripped of an amendment that would have prevented
the site from being used by other states.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the three states in the compact free to turn the
dump into a money-making venture by allowing wastes from other
states to be buried there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the people of west Texas deserve better treatment
by this House than they have received,'' said Texas Rep. Silvestre
Reyes, D-El Paso, an opponent of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San Antonio, another opponent, warned his
colleagues that approval of the site could damage U.S.-Mexican
relations. The Mexican government has complained that placing the
dump site at Sierra Blanca, just 15 miles from the Rio Grande,
could constitute a violation of treaties and border agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition from Mexico is understandable, Bonilla said. ``We
wouldn't want them dumping nuclear wastes within a few miles of the
border.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the controversial bill pitted Texan against
Texan, with six members of the state's congressional delegation
voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill drew strong support from the Houston- and Dallas-area
members, many of whom represent the interests of the state's huge
medical industry. The state has more than 3,500 hospitals, clinics
and medical research facilities, and most of the radioactive waste
generated by them would be buried in deep trenches at Sierra
Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas medical industry joined with utility companies in all
three states to lobby for the bill and against any amendments that
might derail it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, said she understood the
opposition from the mostly Hispanic Sierra Blanca residents, who
are concerned that the site, scheduled to open in 1999, could pose
a serious health and environmental risk to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we must put the waste somewhere,'' she said, contending
that it could not be left to pile up in heavily populated areas
like Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much safer to put it in a less-populated area ... If I
thought for a moment that it would endanger the lives of people, I
would not be standing here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure said that if Johnson and other
supporters weren't concerned about health risks, they should vote
to build disposal sites where most of the Texas radioactive waste
is generated _ in Houston and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are simply trying to do the right thing for the people of
Sierra Blanca,'' Bonilla said. ``The threat to the environment is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up the bill soon. But Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., has vowed to use ``every parliamentary tool
available'' to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone opposes the compact bill because amendments
prohibiting it from becoming a national dumping ground for
radioactive wastes were stripped out of the final version and
because it does not include ``civil rights'' legal protections for
local residents who might be harmed in some way by the location of
the site in Hudspeth County.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ ``Look, the human rights here in Nigeria are
terrible,'' Theodore Luttwak says, ``but the opportunities are just
fantastic. Tell me, where else in the world do you have so much
money?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Abuja, Nigeria's capital-under-construction, is
full of the whiff of oil money, and not just at the exclusive golf
course said to absorb 25 percent of the city's water supply just to
keep the greens smooth. Luttwak _ ``just call me Teddy'' _ is out
to get his share of the $10 billion that Nigeria earns each year
from oil.
</P>
<P>
   His logic is simple enough. The military officers who have ruled
Africa's most populous nation for two decades, and siphoned off a
good share of its oil revenue, are busy building vast mansions on
their Abuja real estate. They want gold-inlaid basins for their
bathrooms and Jacuzzi baths, sophisticated water purifiers and huge
quantities of Italian marble that Luttwak is busy importing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man from the national petroleum company just gave me
$100,000 only for the marble in his house,'' Luttwak said. ``My
company started three years ago, and I'm now the major importer of
Italian marble. This is Africa's land of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it is a surprise to find the older brother of Edward
Luttwak, a former defense policy adviser to the Reagan
administration and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, hustling imported marble in
Abuja, Nigeria. But then this place is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the National Human Rights Commission _
``created by presidential decree.'' It is just off Sani Abacha Way,
a prominent avenue named after the late dictator whose flouting of
human rights, including the wholesale imprisonment of journalists
and execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, turned Nigeria into an
international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Or, not far from Luttwak's premises, the Sani Abacha Foundation,
a palatial enterprise whose aim, its prospectus says, is ``to
immortalize the name, ideas and achievement of Gen. Sani Abacha in
relation to his efforts in promoting peace, unity, conflict
resolution and the universal brotherhood of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Abacha plundered Nigeria with single-minded zeal during his
nearly five years in power before his abrupt death, apparently from
a heart attack, in June.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Maryam, was recently stopped trying to leave the
country on a flight bound for Saudi Arabia with eight suitcases
full of cash. Western officials estimate that the late general may
have more than $3 billion stashed away in overseas bank accounts,
the sort of sum that Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire took decades to
accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   All this, for Teddy Luttwak, is no surprise. He deals every day
with ``the Nigerian factor'' _ the bribes needed to get anything
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha was tremendously corrupt, more than than any mafia you
can imagine,'' he said. ``The general took a share in every
contract, everybody, everything. He was a ruthless warrior. But the
fact is, you probably do need a soft-spoken dictator here.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Transylvania in 1939, Luttwak has a scar on his head
from the years of Nazi oppression. A postwar move to Italy brought
fortune and fame in the plastics industry, notably in the
production of plastic beach balls, but the good times ended when he
was kidnapped and held for ransom in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   While his brother Edward made his way in Israel and the United
States, Luttwak, an Italian citizen, eventually washed up on
Nigeria's shores, where he has been wheeling and dealing for two
decades. A day spent at his company Pated _ ``mirror polished
granites and marbles at very, very, very, very competitive prices''
_ is instructive in the ways of this country.
</P>
<P>
   As Luttwak, sweat glistening on his brow, blue eyes gleaming,
rushes around his premises looking for a driver to make a huge
marble delivery to the northern city of Kano, in walks Ahmud
Agberankhe. He is 34 and has a university degree in physics. He
works for Nigerian Radio for a monthly salary of about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Agberankhe's assignment for the day is to work on a jingle for
an advertisement for Pated, which is looking to hire salesmen to be
paid on commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s a graduate like me could have a car,'' Agberankhe
lamented as he played a proposed jingle focused on the ``very,
very, very, very competitive prices'' for Luttwak. ``But now it's
difficult to make ends meet. You have the knowledge, but there are
no openings. If you strive, you should be given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of downwardly mobile Nigerians like
Agberankhe whose chances of making it have evaporated as this
potentially rich country has succumbed to sweeping decay,
mismanagement and corruption on a scale so vast that it has made
people despair of a fair reward for a fair day's work. Per capita
income here is now a quarter of what it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why work for a pittance when you see a military man making $10
million a month because he has the power to award contracts?'' an
architect in Luttwak's office said. ``What's the motivation?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The architect was particularly unhappy because he had just spent
a substantial share of his monthly salary of about $400 on
black-market gasoline, often the only kind available in a country
that is one of the world's largest producers of oil and the
fifth-largest supplier to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Luttwak, 59, is used to bending the rules to get ahead in his
adopted land. He once spent several days in prison for refusing to
pay a bribe and has learned his lesson. He has a 28-year-old
Nigerian wife named Patience, who, formally speaking, is the owner
of the company. Under Nigerian law, majority ownership of
corporations must be in Nigerian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Handing out a Pated bill for about $100,000 to a messenger, he
let drop a few crumpled Nigerian naira notes. ``We are of course
aware of the `Nigerian factor,' and please tell your boss that we
are waiting for payment as soon as possible,'' Luttwak said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on in admiration, and mild dismay, was Marino D'Ermo, a
major Italian marble producer, visiting Nigeria to examine the
business possibilities. ``Teddy is fantastic,'' D'Ermo said, ``and
the potential in this town is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the town in question is supposed to be home to a
democratic government by May 1999, under commitments made this
month by Nigeria's military rulers. If so, the boom in
marble-bedecked mansions could evaporate, but Luttwak is not
alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, a northern, Muslim ruling caste controls the
country through the military and is unlikely to be budged.
Disciplined, God-fearing and determined, this caste, for Luttwak,
stands in contrast to what he sees as an impossibly unruly south.
He is unconvinced that change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he is wasting no time. ``There is no tomorrow at
this company!'' he shouts at a worker who has made the mistake of
saying something will be done tomorrow. ``Tomorrow does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   To a sign maker, Luttwak complains that his proposals are not
gargantuan enough. ``I want this corner of Abuja to be called Pated
Marbles Plaza,'' he said. ``Whatever goes up has to be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has huge reserves of marble and granite. But, as in the
oil industry, mismanagement has led the domestic industry to ruin.
State-owned factories are idle. So Nigeria imports marble and
granite, just as it imports petroleum. And disaster for the
majority translates into opportunity for a few.

BBC TO PROVIDE NEWS PROGRAMS TO PBS STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eager to get its 24-hour world news service onto U.S.
television, the British Broadcasting Corp. announced a three-year
contract yesterday with WLIW/Channel 21, a PBS station based on
Long Island, to provide three half-hour BBC World news programs,
live from London, every day to WLIW and about 25 other public
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   BBC Worldwide chief executive Rupert Gavin said at a news
conference in New York that the BBC had chosen WLIW because of the
station's interest in international news and because WLIW could
immediately offer access to a 26-station partnership covering about
30 percent of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, WLIW has carried an evening newscast from ITN,
another British network, but that contract ends Nov. 1, the day
WLIW will broadcast the BBC World programs. They are scheduled at 6
a.m., 7 p.m. and another time slot later in the evening to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   WLIW leads a group of 26 stations that are each the
second-licensed PBS station in a market, and together work to
acquire programming to distinguish themselves from the primary
stations. Having acquired the American rights to BBC World, WLIW
will receive a fee from other stations who carry the broadcasts,
according to WLIW president and general manager Terrel Cass, who
said he expected most of his 25 partners to buy the BBC programs,
replacing ITN.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither WLIW nor BBC World would disclose financial terms of
their contract.
</P>
<P>
   Although its radio news service is world-renowned, the BBC was
slow to get into the 24-hour television news business, and is
trying to catch up. It began BBC World, a television news channel
distributed outside Britain, in 1991 in Asia and the Middle East,
and has since expanded to Africa, Europe, India and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   It is available now in 53 million homes in 187 countries and
territories _ compared with the potential audience of CNN at 200
million homes in 210 countries and territories, including about 73
million in the United States).
</P>
<P>
   ``The North American market was such an obvious miss for us,''
Gavin said Wednesday, explaining that getting distribution in the
United States as quickly as possible ``is critical to our
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that BBC World had discussed an alliance with
WNET/Channel 13, the primary PBS station in the New York area, but
that WNET did not have ``an early opportunity'' to fit the news
programs into its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   WNET president and general manager William Baker confirmed that,
but also said he believed that the BBC news programs, while ``a
high-quality service for viewers,'' would not ``yield a large
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Cass said he believed there was an audience, among
``discriminating viewers'' who wanted to see news reported from a
global rather than just an American perspective. He said WLIW had
had positive responses from viewers to the ITN news programs. ``The
popularity of the BBC World Service on radio is well known,'' he
said, noting that National Public Radio carries some of its
programs in this country. ``But this will be the first time its
television service is available in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, BBC news programs also appear on the BBC's own
fledgling cable channel, BBC America, co-owned with the Discovery
networks, but that channel is available in 300,000 homes and is not
likely to get wide distribution for several more years.

ADVERTISING: CANADA EASES CURBS ON U.S. MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In Canada's latest attempt to balance free trade
against cultural protection, the government said Wednesday that it
would lift prohibitions against the Canadian editions of U.S.
magazines but would prevent Canadian advertisers from buying ads in
those magazines.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trade officials quickly rejected Canada's new approach.
``This new policy is the same old story,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky said Canada's new approach seemed to be just as
inconsistent with its international trade obligations as its
current practices, which the World Trade Organization has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky will send a team of U.S. officials to Canada next
week to review the magazine issue and the new advertising ban in
detail. Her spokesman, Jay Ziegler, said that if the team found
that the new measures discriminated against U.S. publishers, the
United States would not wait until the enabling legislation was
passed in the Canadian Parliament to challenge it.
</P>
<P>
   While Canadian magazine publishers energetically embraced the
government's actions, some Canadian advertisers strongly objected,
saying the measures amounted to ``affirmative action or
protectionism'' for the magazine industry and might even violate
Canada's constitution because they would deprive advertisers of
access to an important market.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials said they believed the advertising ban would
meet any constitutional test and would also satisfy World Trade
Organization standards. They said that limiting Canadian
advertising to Canadian magazines was necessary to protect the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow foreign publishers with publications that are
already paid for to strip away and skim away advertising dollars
that rip away at our capacities to tell our own stories,'' said
Sheila Copps, minister of the Canadian Heritage Department.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian magazine publishers have said they cannot compete with
Canadian editions of big U.S. magazines. They argue that if allowed
to produce Canadian editions, U.S. publishers would simply include
some mention of Canada and then, with their editorial costs already
covered, undercut domestic publishers with discount advertising
rates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. publishers deny that their rates would be substantially
lower than in comparable Canadian magazines. The only
general-interest U.S. magazine exempt from the prohibitions is
Time, part of the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. which has been
in Canada for 55 years. Donald Brown, president of Time in Canada,
said the price of advertising in the Canadian edition of Time was
about 9 percent more, on a cost-per-thousand circulation basis,
than in Maclean's, Canada's top news weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The circulation of Time's Canadian edition is 320,000. Maclean's
has a circulation of 512,000.
</P>
<P>
   The United States filed a formal complaint with the World Trade
Organization in 1996 challenging Canada's magazine protections.
While upholding Canada's right ``to take measures to protect its
cultural identity,'' the international trade group sided with the
United States last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Canada announced Wednesday that it would comply with the trade
group's decision by revoking several measures by Oct. 30. They
include an existing tariff that keeps the Canadian editions of U.S.
magazines _ sometimes called split runs _ from crossing the border.
Canada will also end an excise tax of 80 percent, imposed after
Sports Illustrated tried to avoid the split-run prohibition by
transmitting copy across the border via satellite and printing a
local edition in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization also rejected the way the government had
subsidized Canada Post _ the national post office _ in order to
lower the cost of subscriptions for Canadian magazines. Government
officials said Wednesday that the subsidy would now go directly to
the magazines and that all magazine publishers would pay the same
postal rates.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising ban, also scheduled to take effect Oct. 30,
requires an act of Parliament. Officials said U.S. publishers who
ignored the law could be fined the equivalent of $35,000 to
$165,000 in U.S. dollars for each violation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Copps, the heritage minister, said the new prohibition would
not restrict U.S. access to the Canadian magazine market, provided
U.S. publishers did not solicit Canadian advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not about competing for readers,'' Ms. Copps
said. ``The issue is about selling advertising services.''

WHEN THE CHARACTER CALLS, MINNIE DRIVER LISTENS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>

 Laura Winters writes frequently about the cultural scene here and
abroad.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Minnie Driver is equally at home telling an off-color
joke or spelling Aeschylus correctly on a crossword puzzle, as she
did recently in a rare moment of repose at a midtown Manhattan
hotel. The British actress, 27, who has made a career for herself
in the United States in hit movies like ``Big Night,'' ``Grosse
Pointe Blank'' and ``Good Will Hunting,'' displays a dizzying array
of attributes: she's intellectual and earthy, statuesque and
spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on a chair with her legs tucked under her, she looks
very much the rising star, with high-heeled lizard-print sandals on
her feet and with her unruly ringlets pinned up in a smooth twist.
But her frank personality penetrates any pose, whether it be
through her irrepressible laugh, which invites complicity, or her
sudden seriousness when she talks about the professional and
personal tumult of the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver's new film, ``The Governess,'' opened on Friday, but
she is still best known these days as Skylar, the Harvard
undergraduate from Britain who falls in love with the unlikely math
genius played by Matt Damon in ``Good Will Hunting.'' That
performance gained her a nomination for the best-supporting-actress
Oscar this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since her Academy Award nomination, Ms. Driver's profile has
grown beyond that of simply a supporting actress _ partly because
of the roles coming her way, partly because her off-screen
relationship with Damon, and its breakup, made her a popular
subject among gossip columnists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnie has the potential to be both a character actress and a
leading lady,'' said Barry Levinson, who directed her in the 1996
film ``Sleepers.'' ``She is very attractive, but she is also very
chameleonlike.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ms. Driver certainly has a knack for choosing roles
in films that will be successful. How does she pick them? ``I know
my emotional repertory well,'' she replied in her gravelly voice,
``and when I read something that has a resonance in that part of
me, I listen. I've never felt that I had to take a role in one of
those mediocre but hugely budgeted romantic comedies because I want
to wear beautiful dresses and have people think I'm pretty and that
I get the guy. I really believe in the characters I play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governess'' is a departure for Ms. Driver in that it is a
period drama, a British film (her first in several years) and, most
important, her largest role since 1995, when she made her
feature-film debut in ``Circle of Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new movie, she plays Rosina Da Silva, a young Jewish
woman in 1840 in London whose businessman father is suddenly
murdered. Needing to find a way to support her mother and sister,
Rosina hits on the idea of becoming a governess _ though to find
work she must hide the fact that she is Jewish. Hired by a wealthy
family in Scotland, she falls into a passionate affair with the man
of the house, Charles Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson), who is a
pioneering photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver was attracted to the movie, which was filmed last
summer in England and Scotland, because she felt it avoided the
cliches of British costume drama. ``I wanted to do a period drama,
but I didn't want it to be chocolate-boxy,'' she said. ``And sure
enough, along came this twisted tale of spiritual subterfuge and
blind eroticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for ``The Governess,'' Ms. Driver immersed herself in
Judaism, attending synagogue and listening to Sephardic music, and
became more familiar with photography, which becomes both Rosina's
career and her emotional lifeline. Beyond the specifics of the
character's coping with the constraints of 19th-century British
society, Ms. Driver believes there's a timelessness to Rosina's
inner conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fascinated by how much we, as women, have to subjugate and
hide ourselves in order to get on in the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver, who is in every scene of the film, shows a sort of
kaleidoscopic subtlety in expressing Rosina's tangled emotions.
This doesn't surprise the director, Sandra Goldbacher, whose
background is in documentary and short films and who is making her
feature-film debut with ``The Governess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnie is able to be vulnerable at the same time as being
strong,'' said Ms. Goldbacher. ``It's a very demanding role because
it's almost like she plays five separate people. Rosina has assumed
a different identity, but within that she behaves differently with
each of the household members.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver's versatility as an actress has made her
uncategorizable in a broader sense. Although she is part of a new
wave of British acting talent, which includes Rufus Sewell, Kate
Beckinsale and Rachel Weisz, Ms. Driver has up to this point chosen
to make her career mainly in the United States, where she has found
the most opportunities. ``I think I'm viewed as being a bit of a
traitor in Britain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people mistakenly think of her as American, because of her
ability to master almost any accent.
</P>
<P>
   She is frank, however, about the dearth of worthwhile leading
roles for young female stars in Hollywood. ``It's wonderful, with
`The Governess,' that it hasn't been about a studio saying, `O.K.,
honey, it's your turn now,' '' she said. ``To strike out and go:
`You know what, I can do this. I feel strong enough and well-versed
enough to take this woman on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver has recently bought a house in Hollywood and formed a
production company, appropriately named Two Drivers, with her
sister, Kate. ``The British tabloid press have Hollywood painted as
a place where they hand you some silicone implants as you go
through passport control,'' she said. ``But my life there is so
much more low-key than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she doesn't intend to be bound or defined by life in the
United States. ``I've always been pretty nomadic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This nomadic tendency is probably linked to Ms. Driver's
colorful upbringing. She has been called Minnie since she was a
baby, because Kate, who's just a bit older, couldn't pronounce
Amelia. They spent their early childhood in Barbados. Their father,
Ronnie Driver, is a financier; their mother, Gaynor Churchward, is
a former couture model who now runs a home furnishings and textile
design company in England.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, ``Minnie was an entertainer,'' said Kate Driver.
``We'd perform little commercials every day of our own devising.''
</P>
<P>
   When Minnie was 7, their parents divorced and the two girls went
with their mother to live in England, though they often returned to
Barbados to be with their father. At the age of 10, Minnie became a
boarding student at Bedales, the renowned school in Hampshire,
England, where she began to act in plays.

 NEW YORK: in plays.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Bedales, she went to the Webber Douglas Academy of
Dramatic Art in London, from which she graduated in 1990. In the
next few years she appeared in a number of television series and
BBC films, and she won the lead part in ``Circle of Friends,'' in
which Pat O'Connor directed her as a plain, overweight Irish girl
who captivates the local heartthrob (Chris O'Donnell).
</P>
<P>
   Restored to her usual svelte self, Ms. Driver became frustrated
with the opportunities she was finding in Britain. In 1995, a visit
to New York became an extended stay when she was cast in Stanley
Tucci and Campbell Scott's ``Big Night,'' as the long-suffering
fiancee of Tucci's character. Things started to percolate when
``Circle of Friends'' opened in the United States and was a
critical hit as well as grossing more than $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   On a lunch-hour break from filming ``Big Night,'' Ms. Driver
auditioned for ``Sleepers,'' a film about former reform-school boys
featuring Brad Pitt and Jason Patric _ and she got the part of the
only notable female character, the girl who loves them both.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to her quickness and sense of humor, Ms. Driver proved
herself equal to the task of playing, as Levinson puts it, ``the
girl who can hang with the guys and still hold her own center.''
</P>
<P>
   Her humor has come in handy in an assortment of other roles _
including the part of Debi, the high-school girlfriend of the hit
man played by John Cusack, in ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' (1997).
``During casting, we were writing down the dialogue she was coming
up with and putting it right into the script,'' recalled George
Armitage, the director of that film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver always has a lot to do with making the women she
plays more complex than they appear on paper. In her hands, Skylar,
the affluent Harvard undergraduate in ``Good Will Hunting,'' whom
she describes as ``definitely a bit of a device at first,'' became
a ribald and achingly appealing character.
</P>
<P>
   With the great success of ``Good Will Hunting'' _ it has grossed
more than $138 million in the United States since its release last
December _ Ms. Driver doesn't have to worry about what she calls
``supporting-role limbo.'' But she was also propelled into an
unwelcome spotlight because of her romance with Damon.
</P>
<P>
   She no longer wishes to speak specifically about that aspect of
her personal life, but she will talk generally about the experience
of being a newly hatched star who is suddenly thrust into the midst
of a news media hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press took a spin, chose an angle in the best tradition of
`Dynasty' and Dallas,' '' she said. ``The strangest fruit of fame
is that people can twist your honesty into what they think you are
trying to project. But how else is one meant to be? Do you become
so shut down that you say nothing, that you have no opinions?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the fact that she is now recognized on the street, and
that her sartorial choices are followed avidly by fashion pundits,
she said: ``It's been quite strange, but it seems to be part of the
deal. And people think my life has changed more than it actually
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver is now back in Britain making ``An Ideal Husband,'' a
film adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play which is being directed by
Oliver Parker and also stars Julianne Moore, Rupert Everett and
Cate Blanchett. ``I get to be frothy and vicious and
souffle-like,'' Ms. Driver said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The first Two Drivers film, a philosophical comedy called ``At
Sachem Farm,'' finished shooting in California in March. Directed
by John Huddles, it stars a British trio: Ms. Driver, Rufus Sewell
and Nigel Hawthorne. ``There is something about Minnie that makes
me think of Katharine Hepburn _ slightly imperious, with that
wonderful naughty smile,'' said Hawthorne, who plays an eccentric
uncle to Sewell's character in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Driver is supposed to start filming the next Two Drivers
project, a thriller called ``Slow Burn,'' this fall in the United
States. Meanwhile, she is considering roles in studio movies as
well. She tried the action genre with ``Hard Rain,'' a forgettable
disaster film that opened earlier this year, and she balks at the
proposition that large-budget films are somehow morally suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go where the really good parts are,'' she said. ``It
seems that more often than not in my career, they've been in the
independent world. But I'll never say, `I'll only do such and
such.' I read something the other day which speculated about me:
`What's going to happen next? Is she going to sell out?' But can't
you be as good in a $200 million movie as you would in a $2 million
movie?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer to that question may be, Ms. Driver will
continue to be guided by her insistence that she feel something
profound for the characters she plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, I turned something down, and they were all
screaming at me and saying, `It's a huge amount of money, this
really amazing director, incredible actors, what are you doing?' ''
she recalled. ``And I was saying: `That isn't the point. I honestly
don't think I will be very good in it. Anyone could do this, and
that isn't a good reason to do something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She paused for a moment. ``You should feel secretly, `Only I can
do this.'''

CAPITOL SUSPECT HAD MORE AMMUNITION IN TRUCK, FBI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mont., Calif., Va.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russell E. Weston Jr., charged with shooting two
Capitol policemen to death Friday, had additional ammunition for
his .38-caliber revolver in his truck as well as in his pocket,
according to affidavits unsealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits, filed by the FBI in U.S. District Court here
Saturday, supported warrants to allow searches of Weston's cabin in
Montana, his room at his parents' home in Illinois and his pick-up
truck, which was parked on Pennsylvania Avenue near the Capitol at
the time of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress on Wednesday, Republican party leaders and the
chairmen of several Senate and House committees agreed that a new
visitors' center should be built at the Capitol to improve the
building's security. But no decision was made about what the center
should contain, where it should be situated or how much it should
cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavits, federal agents said they believed that a
search of Weston's belongings in Montana and Illinois would turn up
letters and other material documenting Weston's fear of the federal
government. Weston, 41, has a long history of mental illness, his
parents have said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavits, Weston's parents told the
authorities that a letter to him from an unspecified federal agency
had been forwarded this month from his cabin in Rimini, Mont., to
their home in Valmeyer, Ill. The letter was a response to a letter
he had written ``concerning his belief that there were land mines
on his property that were placed there by the federal government,''
an affidavit stated.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, this affidavit continued, said Weston did not
believe the government's assurances that no such mines had been
placed and that he was probably frightened by the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of a visitors' center was discussed at a meeting in
the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``The House and
Senate want to move in tandem,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
chairman of the Rules Committee, which has jurisdiction over the
matter in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Congress has considered building a center to funnel
tourists into a central point before they enter the Capitol, but
there has never been agreement on cost or scope. In 1991, Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who was then the Republican whip and is now
speaker of the House, called a Democratic plan ``madness.''
</P>
<P>
   It called for a three-story underground center beneath the East
Front parking area. The most recent cost estimate was $121 million.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House
committee with jurisdiction, said that new plans might or might not
resemble the ones drawn in 1991.

KNESSET BACKS EARLY ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Reflecting its dissatisfaction with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the peace process, the Israeli
parliament voted Wednesday for a bill calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
   While largely symbolic at this point, the message was a reminder
to Netanyahu that his already thin political margin is diminishing.
The vote was significant as well for its timing, days before the
Knesset adjourns for a three-month recess, and just as Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators work to break the impasse in talks over
further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is symbolism intended to cast a dark cloud over Netanyahu's
government,'' said Daniel Ben-Simone, who covers politics for
Israel's leading daily, Haaretz. ``They are sending him a
warning.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary approval of the bill will have no immediate
effect on Netanyahu's government. Two more votes by the full
parliament are required for it to become law. But as Netanyahu
marks the midpoint of his four-year term in office, he confronts
increasing Israeli fears that the gains of the Oslo peace accords
are slipping away, as well as concern that rising unemployment and
a drop in economic growth presage hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration is mounting as well in the Palestinian- controlled
areas, where Palestinian leaders warn that they will not be able to
control outbreaks of violence if the impasse continues. Washington
is growing impatient, too, and is retreating from its role as an
active mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block has been the amount of land Israel will hand
over to the Palestinians. While the difference of a few percentage
points may sound minuscule, each percentage point represents more
than 20 square miles, the approximate size of Tel Aviv, Israel's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
   A US proposal calls for a further 13.1 percent turnover of West
Bank land to the Palestinians before the start of the final stage
of peace talks. The Palestinians accepted the US proposal, although
it is far short of the 30 percent withdrawal they had expected. The
Israelis have rejected it, arguing that they can accept no more
than a 10 percent withdrawal without sacrificing their security and
the protection of their water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiators have recently offered a ``10 plus 3'' plan
in which 3 percent of the land to be ceded would be a park under
Palestinian control which could not be developed by Israelis or
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the land issue is resolved, most analysts believe that
potentially irreconcilable differences between the two sides will
emerge in final talks on the status of Jerusalem and control of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
   With each setback, the original May 4, 1999 deadline of the
peace agreement looms larger. Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
has vowed to declare unilaterally a Palestinian state at that point
if no agreement has been reached. Such a declaration could lead to
another military conflict in the Middle East, many Israeli and
Palestinian experts believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli economy is beginning to fade along with hopes for
peace. Since Netanyahu took office, unemployment has risen over a
third from 6.5 in 1996 to 9.3 according to the most recent figures.
The rate of growth of the economy has declined some 300 percent
during the same period, from 4.5 percent two years ago to a
projected 1.0 to 1.5 for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and investors have hailed Netanyahu for his tight
fiscal policy and expansion of Israel's potent high tech sector.
And Netanyahu maintains that recovery is imminent. ``There is
simply a gap between the halting of the deficit and the beginning
of growth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also add that the rising unemployment can be
attributed to Israel's shift from a job-intensive industrial
economy to a high tech one which will employ fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   But if the economy continues its slide, it could pressure
legislators to push for new elections, currently scheduled in 2000.
And if this happens, Netanyahu and his rightist Likud Party would
be forced to face angry voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment is in drastic decline, growth is at a low point,
construction is in collapse, companies are in crisis, thousands of
businesses are closing monthly,'' said David Levy, who quit as
Netanyahu's foreign minister in January after accusing him of
failing to move on the peace process or do enough for working-class
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's departure from the fragile coalition government left
Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority of 61 votes in the 120-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the peace process move forward would certainly help the
economy. There is no question about that,'' said a Hebrew
University political science professor, Yehezkel Dror. ``There is a
groundswell of dissatisfaction with the government. It increases
the odds that the government could fall. But it is unclear by how
much.''
</P>
<P>
   The hawks of Netanyahu's government, like Cabinet minister Ariel
Sharon, have threatened to bolt his coalition if he cedes too much
land to the Palestinians. The more moderate members have vowed to
leave if he fails to seal a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remains trapped,'' said Gideon Doron, a political science
professor at Tel Aviv University. ``The walls are closing in on him
and eventually he will have no way out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu continues to confound the experts and Israeli
journalists who relentlessly predict his demise. On Monday, he
defeated the 61st attempt by the Labor Party opposition for a
recall vote aimed at toppling his administration.
</P>
<P>
   And many Israelis still support him. Yaacov Vanunu, 60, is a
Moroccan immigrant to Israel who voted for Netanyahu and now
struggles to get by on the meager salary of a parking lot guard.
``People blame Bibi for everything,'' he said, ``for unemployment
for failing peace policies. He's not guilty. He wants what is good
for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are as weary of the lack of progress in the peace
talks as they are frightened by the potential repercussions of
their failure. Liat Shpaizman, 18, who is about to begin her army
service, said that her friends took her Wednesday to the shopping
districts where two large terrorist bombs exploded last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed with the state of the peace process. I
didn't feel safe here today. The country is losing hope,'' she
said. ``We still have some hope, but something has to be done
really soon in order to save the country.''

DISABLED PEOPLE URGE SENATE TO LET THEM WORK AND RETAIN BENEFITS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Witnesses in wheelchairs urged Congress Wednesday
to pass a bill that would let disabled people take jobs without
losing federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   They backed a measure introduced by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt.,
and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., earlier this year that would allow the
disabled to make more money than the law currently permits and
still receive Medicare or Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the disabled cannot earn more than $500 a
month for more than nine non-consecutive months without losing the
aid they receive from Social Security. Once they lose that money,
they can continue to receive Medicare or Medicaid for up three
years, but after that they must pay a premium of about $300 a month
to keep the health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7.5 million persons on federal disability programs, fewer
than 37,500 are employed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Becker Kennedy of Los Angeles, who was paralyzed in a
diving accident, told the Senate subcommittee on social security
and family policy that she cannot work as a lecturer. The reason,
she said, is that the average $2,000 payment she receives per
speech would eventually makes her ineligible for Medicare, which
provides her with home health care as well as her electric
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (the Jeffords-Kennedy) bill we are trapped in a cycle
of poverty and shame,'' said Nancy Kennedy, who is no relation to
the Massachusetts senator. ``We are beached on the sidelines. If we
can figure out how to contribute productively without being paid,
we still feel handicapped. Cap in hand, trapped in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   She said if she would earn a decent living if she could afford
the health care coverage that she would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, the unsuccessful Republican nominee for
president in 1996, also testified. Dole, whose right arm was
severely damaged in World War II, said the government is sending
the wrong message to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``To access basic care, prescription drugs or personal
assistance services through Medicare or Medicaid, we say to
individuals with disabilities, `Stay home, don't work,''' Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, a subcommittee member, told his colleagues that
``without coverage, a person with a disability will be unable to
even leave the house.'' He added, ``Millions are trapped in a
system that forces underemployment of unemployment upon people who
want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Irish of Burlington, Vt., who is also wheelchair-bound,
said he cannot afford to work full-time because his salary would
make him ineligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to choose not to work although I can work, want to work,
but can't afford to work,'' he testified.

PARLIAMENT EXPRESSES DISPLEASURE WITH NETANYAHU 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a parting shot before a long summer recess, the
Israeli Parliament issued a sharp and potentially weighty new
protest Wednesday over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling
of Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which was boycotted by most of the members of
Netanyahu's governing coalition, set in motion a process that could
force the prime minister to face an early election.
</P>
<P>
   While that prospect remains distant, at least for now, the
passage of the measure, by a 60-6 margin, struck a clear blow to
Netanyahu's prestige, and it underlined the depth of
dissatisfaction at the lack of progress toward a further accord
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to members of the Labor-led opposition, four members
of his governing coalition sided against Netanyahu, including Dan
Meridor, who quit as finance minister last year.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, who had called the bill ``an empty ploy,''
remained dismissive Wednesday of the prospect that his government
might be brought down before its term ends in 2000. His government
still holds a 61-59 majority in the 120-member Parliament, and his
opponents have proved unable as recently as the beginning of this
week to garner the 61 votes necessary to topple the government in a
vote of no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu and his aides had clearly sought to defeat the
measure, and they had called for the boycott only late Tuesday
night after it became clear that they could not muster enough votes
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote marked only preliminary approval of the
measure, which would dissolve Parliament and force new elections.
In order to become law, it needs committee approval and three more
parliamentary votes _ procedures that could take weeks or months
and could not begin until Parliament returns from its summer
recess, which began Wednesday night and is expected to last for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval would require 61 votes, one vote more than the
measure received Wednesday. But even so, the former Labor Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday's vote would lead to ``the end
of the present government.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, when a renewal of talks between Israel and the
Palestinians gave rise to a flurry of hope, there has been little
indication that the two sides are any closer to resolving the
differences that have kept them at odds in the 16 months since
their negotiations broke down.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, an Israeli team led by Danny Naveh, a top aide
to Netanyahu, has met several times with a Palestinian team led by
Saeb Erekat, but neither side has reported progress.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has pledged to convene a special session of Parliament
to review and vote upon any accord reached during the summer
recess. But the stalemate has already prompted Netanyahu's
opponents and some within his own party, like Meridor, to despair
ever more vocally at what they have regard as his overly rigid
approach.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For now, the main focus of those complaints remains Netanyahu's
refusal to accept an American package, endorsed by the
Palestinians, that would include an Israeli withdrawal from another
13 percent of the West Bank. Members of the centrist Third Way have
already threatened to leave the government if Netanyahu fails to
reach a deal with the Palestinians on the handover of land, and
that stance was underscored Wednesday by three Third Way members,
who joined with Meridor in breaking with the prime minister in the
protest vote.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is also facing pressure from the opposite end of his
government spectrum, among more hawkish members who have threatened
to abandon him if he gives away too much land to the Palestinians.
That may make it difficult if not impossible for him to accede to
the moderates' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Netanyahu has proved adept at overcoming crises during
his 25 months in office, and even Wednesday, he was quick to seize
on an opportunity to turn attention away from his own controversial
stands. He devoted most of a speech to Parliament to remarks made
by a prominent Labor Party legislator, a former major general, Ori
Orr, that were seen as offensive by Sephardic Jews, those of North
African and Middle Eastern descent.
</P>
<P>
   Orr quickly apologized for his remarks, including a suggestion
that Jews of Moroccan origin did not have the curiosity to know
what was going on around them. But the remarks became the subject
of intense coverage on Israeli television and radio, and Netanyahu
made the most of the political moment, charging in his speech that
Labor Party governments had long shown a pattern of discriminating
against Sephardic Jews.

`TALKING POINTS' VITAL TO STARR'S CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though the source of Monica S. Lewinsky's
now-famous ``talking points'' became the focus of a heated dispute
Wednesday, the document could still be a key piece of evidence in
independent counsel Kennth W. Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a case noteworthy for its ``he said, she said''
element, the talking points document is one of the few pieces of
independent evidence that could show that a cover-up took place.
</P>
<P>
   The talking points have been considered a central focus of
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation into whether
President Clinton had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and urged
her to lie about it. Lewinsky gave the document to her one-time
friend Linda R. Tripp, who was instructed to say, ``I have never
observed the president behave inappropriately with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, some news organizations have quoted sources who
indicate that the talking points were written by someone within the
White House. Officials at the White House officials have denied
this.
</P>
<P>
   The story took a twist Wednesday, when some news organizations
quoted anonymous sources saying that Lewinsky told investigators
that no one at the White House had written the talking points.
Various reports said Lewinsky had written the points herself or
that she had help from Tripp or someone outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   If these reports are correct, it would hamper an attempt to show
the White house participated in a coverup. But whoever helped draft
the cocument, the talking points remain vital to Starr's case. They
could demonstrate Lewinsky's frame of mind around the time that she
swore in an affidavit early this year that she did not have sex
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky on Tuesday received a grant a immunity from Starr in
exchange for testimony that she did have an affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she produced this entirely on her own, it would still be
evidence that would corroborate Lewinsky's testimony today that she
concluded it was in her best interest to concoct a story in order
to protect the president, and she thought it was really important
that Linda Tripp not say anything harmful to the president,'' said
Benito Romano, a former US attorney in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp Wednesday said she had nothing to do with the talking
ooints and ``anyone who testifies under oath that I authored or was
involved in preparation of the talking points would in my view be
committing perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, after completing her last day of testimony before the
grand jury investigating the case, later appeared to imply that
Lewinsky was urging her to commit perjury with the talking points.
``Imagine how you would feel if someone you thought was a friend
urged you to commit a felony,'' Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who wrote the talking points, Tripp told reporters: ``I
wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report that no one at the White House participated
in writing the talking points has not been confirmed on the record.
Moreover, it remains unclear whether someone outside the White
House who is connected to Clinton helped write the talking points.
</P>
<P>
   All of this left White House spokesman Michael McCurry with his
own set of talking points. As reporters Wednesday asked McCurry
about reports that no one in the White House was involved in
writing the points, he chastised news organizations for reporting
earlier that a White House official had helped write them.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry told reporters in his office Wednesday: ``You said
sources in Starr's office and close to Linda Tripp say they believe
the instructions came from the White House, which is a fairly
damning statement which means for weeks and weeks we've been living
with what is now apparently something untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a press briefing, McCurry repeated his qualms about
the early reports and said the press should stop quoting anonymous
sources who give conflicting accounts about the talking points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another useful reminder to all of you to be very careful
and cautious as you report because, you now, we've had some pretty
serious allegations raised on national television.'' He added about
Lewinsky: ``You know, you don't know factually anything about what
she's going to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talking points, Tripp is instructed to recant her earlier
statements that she had seen another woman, Kathleen Willey, emerge
from the Oval Office after an alleged sexual encounter with
Clinton. Willey said earlier this year on CBS's ``60 Minutes'' that
Clinton made an unwanted advance.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is instructed to say in the talking points: ``Kathleen and
I were friends. ... She came to me after she allegedly came out of
the Oval Office and looked...very happy. I did not see her go in
and out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp Wednesday said it would defy logic for her to help write
the talking points. Her comments about perjury appeared to be aimed
at Lewinsky. While Lewinsky has received a broad grant of immunity,
that does not exempt her from being prosecuted if she lies to the
grand jury.

DNC PANEL MEMBERS PRAISE L.A.'S PRESENTATION
</HEADLINE>

(Moving in the ``a'' national news file and in the ``n'' California
news file.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles won high praise from Democratic
National Committee members Wednesday for its bid to host the party
convention in 2000 as their three-day tour closed with another hard
sell.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast at the Biltmore Hotel, where the 52 committee
members stayed for free, they were reminded of the city's
diversity, its union and labor peace and _ yet once again _
California's 54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was the best presentation we've seen by any city,
including my own,'' said Ben Jeffers, of New Orleans and who is
chairman of the Lousiana Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Walker of Detroit echoed Jeffers' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles certainly showed they are capable and have the
facilities,'' Walker said. ``It was a very impressive three days.
And the fact California has 54 electoral votes isn't lost on
anyone. It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly the message Los Angeles officials and the LA2000
committee wanted to get across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can stress it enough,'' said Bill Wardlaw,
one of LA2000's co-chairman who organized the three-day
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is competing with Denver, Philadelphia, Boston,
Minneapolis, New Orleans and Miami for the right to host the
convention, expected to bring in some $137 million to the city,
with an estimated 30,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate estimate on the cost of this week's
events, with most of the expenses _ air fare, hotel rooms and meals
_ covered by contributions from various firms.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trip, the delegates were wined, dined and feted
as if they were royalty: from the opening Olvera Street welcoming
ceremony to the reception hosted by actor Jimmy Smits at the Conga
Room on Tuesday night where he danced with nearly all the female
committee members.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration of the city's technical capabilities, the
committee members were shown a five-minute video _ complete with
musical scoring _ that recapped their stay, including pictures
taken at the Conga Room.
</P>
<P>
   George Kirkland, head of the Los Angeles Convention Center, also
reminded the committee members of the city's 93,000 hotel rooms _
and the fact that each of the major downtown hotels are unionized.
Democratic party events, by policy, can be held only in unionized
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Staples Center sports arena, he said the
Convention Center will provide some 1 million square feet of space
to accomodate the national media and all the state delegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other city that can offer the amount of space and
quality space that Los Angeles has,'' Kirkland said.

GANGSTER, AGENT DISAGREE ON MAFIA INDUCTION TIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last summer, mobster Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio shuffled
into court in prison garb and admitted that he was the one who told
the FBI where a secret Mafia induction would be held so agents
could record the blood oaths.
</P>
<P>
   His dramatic unmasking of himself as an informant was the first
chapter in a year-long saga that has exposed the FBI's often
dubious dealings in its war against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Mercurio was back in federal court in Boston, but in a
different courtroom, in a different case, the first sign that the
controversy uncorked last summer is spilling over to a second tier
of Mob prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   And he offered markedly different testimony than another key
witness, former FBI organized crime supervisor James A. Ring, as to
who in the FBI he told about the induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio was the lead witness called by defense attorney John H.
LaChance, who represents reputed Mafia capo regime Robert Carrozza.
Carrozza is challenging the legality of the first-ever recording
made possible by Mercurio's information: the October 1989 Mafia
induction ceremony in Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The recording underpins generations of Mob cases, including the
landmark 1995 case which has been dissected for months in another
federal courtroom before US District Judge Mark L. Wolf. Those
pretrial hearings, which are scheduled to resume next week, have
exposed the cozy, and potentially criminal, relationship between
FBI agents who ignored the criminal activity of Irish mobsters
James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi in
their quest to bring down their Italian rivals in the Mafia,
including reputed New England Mafia boss Francis P. ``Cadillac
Frank'' Salemme.
</P>
<P>
   The case before US District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton stems from
the April 1997 indictment of 15 mob associates allegedly involved
in a bloody, five-year struggle to topple Salemme, beginning with a
botched assassination attempt in June 1989 outside a Saugus pancake
house.
</P>
<P>
   While the hearings before Wolf also involve the legality of the
induction ceremony tape, the testimony there has been wide-ranging,
dictated, in large part, by Flemmi's claim that he was promised
immunity from prosecution in exchange for information he provided
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings that began Wednesday before Gorton are expected to
be much narrower, focusing solely on the legality of the induction
ceremony bugging.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing the parallel proceedings do share is the claim by
defense lawyers that the recording should not be used as evidence
because key information was withheld from the judge who authorized
the bugging. For one, the judge was not told that the FBI had a
top-level informant like Mercurio, who shuttled inductees to the
ceremony from drop-off points in Medford and Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the judge told that the FBI knew two days before the
ceremony where it would be held and when. Instead of seeking
permission to bug that location, prosecutors asked for a more
liberal ``roving bug'' which is only supposed to be sought when the
specific location to be bugged is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio, who has been offered a reduction in the nine-year
sentence he is serving in exchange for his testimony, said he and
several Mob associates drove by the house at 34 Guild Street in
Medford on Friday, Oct. 27, 1989, two days before the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day Mercurio said he phoned his FBI handler, John
Connolly, and gave him the time and location of the planned
ceremony. And later that night, Mercurio said he met with Connolly
and Ring in a room at the Sheraton Hotel in Boston to discuss the
upcoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercurio's version of events was contradicted by Ring, who
said Mercurio had phoned him, not Connolly, that afternoon. Ring
also testified that he had not met in person with Mercurio that
Friday. Ring, as he had testified earlier in the Wolf hearings,
said Connolly was not around in the week leading up to the
induction ceremony bugging.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio also denied what has become part of local lore: that he
had turned down the television set in the room where the ceremony
was held so FBI agents listening in could hear better.
</P>
<P>
   Ring testified that Mercurio phoned him several hours after the
induction ceremony and bragged that he had turned down the
television. Ring said Connolly said the same thing the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercurio testified that he told Connolly he hadn't lowered
the volume on the television, to which Connolly reportedly
retorted, ``That's okay, we'll give you credit for it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio also denied knowing that Jeremiah O'Sullivan, former
head of the organized crime strike force, had asked the US Parole
Commission in 1988 to end his parole early because of the help he
had given the FBI. Had he known about the request, ``I wouldn't
have allowed it,'' Mercurio said.

DISABLED PEOPLE URGE SENATE TO LET THEM WORK AND RETAIN BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Witnesses in wheelchairs urged Congress Wednesday
to pass a bill that would let disabled people take jobs without
losing federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   They backed a measure introduced by Sens. James Jeffords, R-Vt.,
and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., earlier this year that would allow the
disabled to make more money than the law currently permits and
still receive Medicare or Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, the disabled cannot earn more than $500 a
month for more than nine non-consecutive months without losing the
aid they receive from Social Security. Once they lose that money,
they can continue to receive Medicare or Medicaid for up three
years, but after that they must pay a premium of about $300 a month
to keep the health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7.5 million persons on federal disability programs, fewer
than 37,500 are employed.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Becker Kennedy of Los Angeles, who was paralyzed in a
diving accident, told the Senate subcommittee on social security
and family policy that she cannot work as a lecturer. The reason,
she said, is that the average $2,000 payment she receives per
speech would eventually makes her ineligible for Medicare, which
provides her with home health care as well as her electric
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (the Jeffords-Kennedy) bill we are trapped in a cycle
of poverty and shame,'' said Nancy Kennedy, who is no relation to
the Massachusetts senator. ``We are beached on the sidelines. If we
can figure out how to contribute productively without being paid,
we still feel handicapped. Cap in hand, trapped in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   She said if she would earn a decent living if she could afford
the health care coverage that she would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, the unsuccessful Republican nominee for
president in 1996, also testified. Dole, whose right arm was
severely damaged in World War II, said the government is sending
the wrong message to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``To access basic care, prescription drugs or personal
assistance services through Medicare or Medicaid, we say to
individuals with disabilities, `Stay home, don't work,''' Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, a subcommittee member, told his colleagues that
``without coverage, a person with a disability will be unable to
even leave the house.'' He added, ``Millions are trapped in a
system that forces underemployment of unemployment upon people who
want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Irish of Burlington, Vt., who is also wheelchair-bound,
said he cannot afford to work full-time because his salary would
make him ineligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to choose not to work although I can work, want to work,
but can't afford to work,'' he testified.

PARTISAN BICKERING DELAYS MANAGED HEALTH CARE REFORM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite promises by congressional Republicans to
move quickly on managed care reform, the hot button issue is not
likely to be resolved before this fall, a victim of partisan
squabbling and vacation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House narrowly passed a measure last week that
placed a number of restrictions on managed care plans, the Senate
has been slower to move on the matter. And with only a few days
remaining before they are scheduled to depart for August recess,
senators are predicting they will not act on the measure before
they return in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be a vote on it this week. That is clear,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who joined with several colleagues,
Republicans and Democrats, on Wednesday in offering a compromise
health care proposal they hope will break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican leadership has introduced legislation that
would give consumers access to both internal and external appeals
processes for decisions made by their HMOs. It would require some
managed care plans to provide easier access to gynecologists and
emergency room care.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said earlier this
week that Republicans wanted to move on the health care bill before
senators left for vacation. But Democrats have balked at placing
restrictions on the amendments that could be offered. Without such
limits it would be all but impossible to complete work on the bill
in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also suspect that Democrats do not want to vote on
the issue before the summer break, and instead hope to make it a
campaign issue when they are back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't seem to want to take up the health care package,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats say that the Republican plan does not go far
enough because it does not lift the prohibition on consumers suing
their HMOs if they belong to federally regulated health plans.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that many of the GOP mandates, including access
to gynecologists, would only apply to the minority of health plans
that states do not regulate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
have introduced legislation covering all health plans that permit
states to give consumers the right to sue their HMOs and gives them
access to a variety of specialists .
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan compromise measure, developed by Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., would cover more health plans
than the Senate GOP plan but would not give consumers as broad an
ability to recover damages against HMOs as the Democratic plan.
Consumers could go to federal court to recover economic damages _
but none for pain and suffering _ resulting from a decision by
their health providers.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee warned the Senate appeared to be headed for gridlock on
health care because neither Republicans nor Democrats had enough
votes to pass their respective plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans are confident that they have been
inoculated politically on the managed care issue after pushing
through a bill last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, that bill, which was approved 216-210 with the support
of only three Democrats, was attacked as inadequate because it does
not give consumers the right to sue their HMOs. Critics of the
House bill also say its appeals procedure is weak because it is
nonbinding, meaning consumers would have to go to federal court to
force HMOs to abide by any arbiter's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the House bill should be dead,'' said Connie Barron,
an official with the Texas Medical Association, which has joined
with its parent, the American Medical Association, in trying to
derail the Republican-sponsored managed care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barron said the doctors will use the August break to lobby Texas
lawmakers to oppose the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas doctors are afraid that the legislation will undermine
state reforms approved by the Texas Legislature in 1997, including
the right to sue HMOs and an appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   The Aetna Insurance Company is challenging in federal court in
Houston some of those changes approved by the Texas Legislature,
including the right to sue HMOs. The insurance company has argued
that the federal law bars states from interfering in employer
sponsored managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, acknowledged that the Texas
reforms, including the right to sue, appear to be working. So far
there have been no lawsuits involving HMOs, contrary to predictions
that the law would spur expensive and protracted legal action.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison said she was not prepared to back federal
legislation giving states the ability to open the courts to
lawsuits against HMOs. She said such lawsuits would ``increase
costs so much that it would deter coverage.''

Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA):
</P>
<P>
   DAY ONE (SUNDAY)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ENVIRONMENT _ COZUMEL, Mexico _ When huge cruise ships
belly up to a new concrete pier off this Caribbean island, it's a
bitter reminder to Dora Uribe of an opportunity lost. An
opportunity, she says, to use the North American Free Trade
Agreement to mount an eleventh-hour campaign to stop the pier and
save Paradise Reef _ a reef environmentalists had long argued would
be broken to pieces and eventually killed by the thrust of the
ships. In January 1996, Uribe and other Mexican environmentalists
were the first citizens to file a complaint with a special
commission established by NAFTA's environmental side agreement. The
Cozumel experience is one of the unhappy lessons learned by
environmentalists who have tried to use the NAFTA environmental
side agreement to ensure that laws in each country are followed,
not flouted or downgraded, as free trade spreads in Mexico, the
United States and Canada. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-NAFTA _ TIJUANA, Mexico _ Norberto Cordoba says he was
fired from Han Young, a Korean-owned auto parts factory, for a
simple reason: ``They told me I was a 'political man.''' The
49-year-old welder didn't take his dismissal lightly. Cordoba,
Mexican and American labor activists have taken this grievance and
a range of others alleging unfair treatment at the Han Young
export, or ``maquiladora'' factory, in Tijuana all the way to
Washington D.C. (Ferris, Cox News Service).

   JORDAN-HUSSEIN _ AMMAN, Jordan _ The soveriegn of this small
country for 45 years, King Hussein is the emblem of his nation and
its guarantor of stability and security. Even among those who feel
he has been dictatorial and let his country languish in an economic
recession, Jordainians breathed a sigh of relief to see him
apparently in control of his recently found lymphoma cancer. ``This
is not the time for the king to be sick, you know,'' said car parts
retalier George Naber, after watching the King on television
Tuesday nigh. ``The situation in this country is very bad. He is
the only one who can control everything.'' The King's illness calls
into question the future of a small country that plays a huge role
in protecting the stability of the Middle East. (Kaplow, Cox News

   COLOMBIA-US-$ADV02 _ MIAMI _ Conservative president-elect Andres
Pastrana takes office in Colombia on Friday, Aug. 7, bringing a
rare burst of optimism to this violent and dangerous South American
country. Already, Pastrana has initiated talks with leaders of two
rebel armies to end the hemisphere's longest-running civil war, in
which more than 35,000 people have been killed. And he's worked to
build better relations with the United States. Even the country's
right-wing death squads promised this week to stop attacking
civilians. But Pastrana, the charismatic former mayor of Bogota,
has his work cut out for him. Colombia is the cocaine capital of
the world and one of the most-violent places on earth. More people
are kidnapped for ransom, or because they work for foreign oil
companies, in Colombia than anywhere else. And previous government
have held peace talks with the rebels and achieved little. So, why
should Pastrana be any different? (Emling, Cox News Service).

facing this picturesque riverfront community where history is as
omnipresent as haze on the Potomac. ``You can't just run an ad in

   MORELAND _ Regina Moreland wanted 10 children, just like her
mother. She bore only two. But wanted more. So over the years, she
and husband, Phillip, filled their house with other kids _ foster,
adopted, a mentally retarded grandchild. Regina also opened her
arms to a passel of great nieces and nephews who visited the
Moreland home at 633 Homewood Ave. But in less than nine months,
four children have died while at the Moreland home _ three
grandchildren, and a great-niece, ages 3 and younger. Montgomery
County Coroner James H. Davis has ruled the deaths homicides by
aphyxiation and suffocation. A child in the Moreland household has
emerged as the main suspect _ a revelation that has split family
loyalties between those who want cooperation with police and those
who reject authorities' suspicions. (Lyles, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL _DAYTON, Ohio _The growing number of children accused of
serious crimes is confounding the juvenile justice system in Ohio
and elsewhere. A plan to overhaul Ohio laws governing young
offenders is being drafted and may be presented to the legislature
as early as September. But until new laws replace ones drafted in
the 1960s, Ohio's juvenile justice system is severely limited in
how it can handle young offenders, especially those under age 12
(Hundley, Dayton Daily News)

   SERIAL _ DAYTON, Ohio _ We talk to a former FBI profiler, who

   FLADEM _ Just when it should be gearing up to try to hang on to
the Governor's office in the November elections, Florida's
Democratic Party is in a shambles, victim of an eroding voter base
and a nasty racial controversy that has splintered its traditional
support among blacks. Last week the party's legislative leader
resigned and announced she won't run for reelection, leaving the
party rudderless. Tweaking the party in its misery has been State
Rep. Willie Logan, a black Miami Democrat who was to have been the
party's top legislative leader last year until he was deposed by
whites who said he wasn't raising enough money. (Williams, Atlanta

   THREATS _ WASHINGTON _ As U.S. military forces moved to prepare
for a possible attack on Iraq last February, President Clinton
received a top-secret briefing at the White House. For much of the
month, he learned, military computer systems around the country had
been penetrated. While the computer commandos eventually proved to
be a couple of California teenagers, the incident helped push
Clinton to announce a new national effort against not only
cyber-attacks but also ``nuclear, but also chemical or biological,
to use disease as a weapon of war.'' (Deans, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   THREATS-Q&AMP;A _ WASHINGTON _ A Q&AMP;A with Richard Clarke, the
``national coordinator'' recently appointed by President Clinton to
prepare the country for the possibility of new kinds of terror
attacks. (Deans, Cox News Service 1500).
</P>
<P>
   THREATS-COMPUTER _ WASHINGTON _ It starts with an unexplained
power blackout in a major southeastern city. As utility workers
struggle to restore service, telephone systems across the country
become paralyzed. Quickly, the problems spread to oil refineries,
banking and financial systems, communications networks and even the
military. This scenario, outlined in a recent report by the Rand
Corp. for the Defense Department, provides a chilling picture of
how the Information Age has left the United States vulnerable to a
``digital Pearl Harbor.'' (Glass, Cox News Service 1000).
</P>
<P>
   THREATS-GERM _ WASHINGTON _ In the spreading chaos that could
develop if terrorists deliberately started an epidemic of smallpox,
ebola or another deadly disease in America, the country's first
line of defense would be the doctors, nurses, hospital personnel
and public health workers who would care for victims and try to
figure out what was going on. Yet the Clinton administration, which
plans to spend about $1.3 billion next year to defend the country
against chemical or biological warfare attacks, would invest only
about 3 percent of that amount _ $42 million _ to reinforce an
underfunded and poorly equipped network of state and local health
departments. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 1050&AMP;add).
</P>
<P>
   THREATS-GERM-POX _ WASHINGTON _ The doctor who headed the World

   TECH-LOBBYING _ WASHINGTON _ Last fall, the high-tech industry
lost a legislative skirmish in its multi-year battle with the FBI
and U.S. spy agencies over who will control encryption of messages
on the Internet. Scared and enraged by a loss that threatened the
growth of their industry's profits, high-tech rivals stopped
dissing each other long enough to chip in more than $5 million to
form a lobbying coaltion called Americans for Computer Privacy and
convince a lot of their customers, suppliers and sympathizers to
sign up. Launched in March, the $5 million lobbying alliance of
more than 90 companies and 40 associations already has won some
early rounds in its fight against the FBI and U.S. spy agencies.
Who formed Americans for Computer Privacy, why, how they grew it,
how they run it, and what it does. (Mollison).

   LOGGING _ Slide Hollow is a place that time forgot, where
streams tumble pure and ancient trees stand tall. This enclave of
forest primeval in the Tennessee mountains is the poster child for
the fight for the last remaining unprotected areas of the South's
national forests. And nowhere in the National Forests is that more
important than in the Southern Appalachians, where more than 6
milion acres in six states comprise the largest block of public
land east of the Rockies. Slide Hollow is also a place where winds
of change are buffeting the Forest Service, slowly and reluctantly
evolving from a timber-cutting overlord to a group of men and women
more concerned about protecting these last vestiges of the nation's
natural heritage. Main story 40 to 50 inches. (Harmon, Atlanta

<P>
   w/LOGRAGE _ James Sullivan has spent the last 15 years hounding
the Forest Service in the northeast Georgia mountains. Profile on a

Forest Service-sanctioned timber cutting. Sullivan has documented a
disturbing trend of overharvesting in parts of the national forests

POLICE TACTICS ANGER RIDERS; TOUR IS IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AIX LES BAINS, France _ The Tour de France, already in turmoil
over investigations into the use of illegal performance-enhancing
drugs by cyclists, was stopped twice Wednesday by riders protesting
police methods, and for the first time in its 95-year history the
race faced a premature end.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Jean-Marie Leblanc, the race director, consulted with
government officials and promised some changes _ including
questioning in team hotels rather than police stations _ that the
riders called off their second sitdown.
</P>
<P>
   But they ripped the numbers off their jerseys, making the stage
unofficial, and then rode at a moderate speed without competition,
reaching the finish line nearly three hours late. Four teams quit
in protest, as did a handful of individual riders. There was no
assurance that the remaining 16 teams would agree to start the 18th
stage in the race on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the Tour has now unraveled is unprecedented.
The developments represent the biggest threat to the race's
continuation since the second race in 1904, when cheating by riders
_ including some who took the train _ almost forestalled a third
race the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Seven teams of the 21 originally in the race are now under
suspicion for use of illegal drugs. The riders are divided in their
response to the investigation and Tour officials spent Wednesday
trying to keep the race going until its scheduled end in Paris on
Sunday. They were successful in a strike last Friday, when the
riders refused to start the race to protest coverage by the news
media of the drug scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Wednesday's protest was a police raid on a hotel in
which four riders from the Dutch team TVM were taken to a hospital
Tuesday night and tested for drugs in their urine, blood and hair.
In March, a TVM car was seized by French police and found to
contain what have been described as huge quantities of illegal
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated us like criminals, like animals,'' said one of
the Dutch team's members, Jeroen Blijlevens. Referring to his
roommate, Bart Voskamp, Blijlevens said: ``They took Bart out of
the shower, made us sign some papers and took us away.''
</P>
<P>
   The riders were held more than four hours for the tests and then
released half an hour after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Word of their treatment did not reach the full 140-man pack
until it was rolling Wednesday morning in the 17th of 21 daily
stages, a 92-mile ride from Albertville in the Alps to Aix les
Bains. The riders also then learned that police planned to visit
the hotels of four more teams, Casino and La Francaise des Jeux,
both based in France, Polti, based in Italy, and ONCE, based in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Three officials of the France-based Festina team have already
been arrested and charged. Two officials of the TVM team are also
being held in a French jail. Another French team, Big Mat-Auber,
came under suspicion Tuesday when one of its vans was stopped by
police. Medication in the van was sent to a laboratory for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   As news of police treatment of the TVM riders filtered among the
riders Wednesday, they stopped for 25 minutes after completing
about 19 miles of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up,'' said Laurent Jalabert, the French national
champion, the world's top-ranked racer and a spokesman for the
riders. ``I can't continue under these conditions, being treated
like a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   He entered a team car, quitting the race, and was followed
shortly by the other ONCE riders.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Manolo Saiz, a Spaniard, said: ``We may never come to
race in France again. This may be the end of cycling. It's the
biggest crisis we've ever had and we're a family heading for
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc, the race director, pleaded with riders and coaches to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were as astonished as the riders about the way TVM was
treated,'' he said later on television. ``We are discussing with
the authorities how further investigation of the Tour de France
riders can be handled with the utmost dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   With that promise, the race resumed, but only for about seven
more miles. Since Jalabert was gone, Leblanc met with the riders'
new spokesman, Bjarne Riis, a Dane with Telekom and the winner of
the 1996 Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the riders can be assured that the investigation will be
held with a certain dignity, they will continue with the Tour de
France tomorrow,'' Riis said.
</P>
<P>
   The riders then resumed the journey at a speed about half their
usual 24 mph. At the feeding zone, the Banesto team and the Riso
Scotti team from Italy dropped out. So did individual riders,
including two TVM riders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the field of 134 riders was down to 116.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although representatives of teams with riders among the leaders
were not threatening further disruption, team officials and riders
were outspoken in their condemnation of police tactics. Police, who
are acting under the orders of an investigating magistrate in
Lille, far to the north, had no official spokesman and could not
present their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the riders' unhappiness,'' said Alain Bondue, a
former racer and now manager of the Cofidis team from France. ``You
have to let them do their job. The TVM riders left the hospital at
12:30 without eating and without being massaged. That's not right.
That the police want to investigate is logical but why not wait
till Monday, a day after the race ends?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Cofidis expected a visit from the police, he said,
``Who knows? They don't telephone ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were waiting at the hotels of ONCE, Polti and Casino when
the race finally pulled into Aix les Bains. The four TVM riders
remaining, including some of those taken to the hospital Tuesday
night, led the pack across the line and were applauded by a large
crowd of fans who had remained for that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the French police want to ruin their national race, they're
doing it,'' said Bobby Julich, an American from Glenwood Springs,
Colo., who rides for Cofidis. Julich is in second place behind
Marco Pantani, an Italian with Mercatone Uno.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been treated like human beings,'' Julich added.
``That's what we're protesting against. That's why the stage was
ruined today.''
</P>
<P>
   If the treatment continues, he said, ``It was the understanding
of the riders that it would have pretty dire consequences. That's
pretty much what everyone said.''
</P>
<P>
   Other riders, who preferred not to be named, said they had been
cool to the stoppages but felt they had to concur in the mass
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sort of came on after the start,'' said Kevin
Livingston, an American from Austin, Texas, who rides for Cofidis.
``We'll see what happens tonight and tomorrow. It's just another
time when you have to figure out what you want.'' &QL;

 &HT;    No one felt worse than me not being able to play'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   AJC: The first question is obvious: How are you? Are there any
lingering effects from your concussion?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: No. If I had a concussion bad enough where there were
any lingering effects, I wouldn't be playing. You would think
somebody would have enough of an intelligence level to know that. I
feel great, really good. If I can just stop getting my head bounced
off the turf, I'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Does the constant fuss about your injury situation irritate
you?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: Any question that gets repeated gets tiresome. I will
always talk. I won't go out of my way to do things for an
interview, but if it's set up and done right, I have no problem.
But I've never had problems with not talking. Once in a while, I
try to make the media's job harder. (Chandler smiles.)
</P>
<P>
   AJC: But you do recognize the reason for all the questions,
don't you? The team was 7-3 with you, 0-6 without you.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: I understand all that, but it just gets kind of
foolish after a while to keep so much attention on something like
that, when there's so many other things that are important. I took
every snap the second half of the season, and a lot of guys didn't
do that. It all depends on ... the spin you want to put on
something. No one felt worse than me not being able to play.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Your contract with the Falcons ends this year, and the
Falcons say they want to extend it. You say you want to extend it.
Any progress in that direction?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: I just leave that up to (agent) Frank Bauer. He's
handling the whole thing, and when he thinks there's something
worth looking at, he'll talk to me.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Have you given him any framework, like length of contract,
how much you want, a deadline for getting it done?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: No. I haven't even gotten to the point where I know
how long I'll play, although I know I'll play a long time.
Everybody wants stability, so you don't have to move around every
few years. I want what's fair. I can't tell you what that is, but
Frank knows the market. I'd like it done sooner. Once the season
starts, I'm not really going to be in the mood to hassle with it.
Even if it doesn't get done, though, I'm assuming something will
get done after the season.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Coach Dan Reeves and general manager Harold Richardson both
say they want to extend your contract, but they make it clear the
Falcons will want ``protection.'' That is to say they want a deal
laden with incentives tied to your health. Does this annoy you?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: The injury thing is always annoying. Steve Young has
had a lot of concussions. So has Troy Aikman. I've had more
touchdown passes than Troy Aikman the last (three) years (53 to
47), and he's missed some games because of concussions. But people
are kind of like, ``I don't want to mention that about Troy, but I
will about Chris.'' OK, he's won a few Super Bowls, and he's Troy
Aikman, so we can let all that (injury talk) slide. But if you're
not him, people don't care if you had a great season last year.
It's, ``What are you going to do this year?''
</P>
<P>
   AJC: You'll be throwing to some different receivers this year,
chief among them Tony Martin, who was acquired by trade to replace
the departed Bert Emanuel. What's your early read on Tony?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: You can just see in one-on-one drills, his technique
in running routes. He doesn't tip off things. He won't look back
early on a curl route. And you can just see his speed. He's got at
least the speed Bert has, with a little extra height (6-foot-1 to
Emanuel's 5-10). His ability to make big plays is evident, and it's
just a matter of me being able to get the ball to him.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: How are things better in camp this year?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler: I understand the offense better; we all understand
things better; we're more confident, more comfortable. Everything
goes pretty well, except when there's a rookie in (the offense).

 &HT;    Rude awakening: Falcons rookies realizing there's plenty to
learn
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta Falcons rookies see bigger and faster players
when they stare across the line in Suwanee this week. They expected
that. What's surprising is how the pro game is so much more mental
and technical.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them, including linebacker Keith Brooking, receiver
Jammi German and right tackle Ephraim Salaam, are learning faster
than the other draft picks and free agents. But even they struggle.
Sometimes badly.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking lined up with the first team during a goal-line defense
drill, and Salaam and Bob Hallen were working in backup roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's faster than college,'' said Salaam, a seventh-round draft
choice from San Diego State. He was talking about both team speed
and the learning curve. ``The faster you can assimilate
information, the better off you are,'' the 6-foot-7, 300-pound
Salaam said. ``We put in five or six new plays every night. We
can't go on instinct yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snap counts and other stuff _ that's all running through your
head. The more time you spend studying, the better you'll be. I
study from about 10 to 11:30 (p.m.), after meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, that's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys hold 10 times more than in college,'' Brooking said.
``When the refs were here, I was asking, `Is this a hold?' and `Is
that a hold?' And they were pretty much telling me they weren't
going to call it in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are kind of running together. Man, they're throwing a
lot at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons expect their class of nine draft choices and nine
undrafted free agents to contribute. They just don't know how much.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, Brooking and Hallen, who is working at guard and center,
appear to have the inside track on getting playing time. German, a
third-round pick, and punt returner/receiver Tim Dwight, a
fourth-round pick, may also make the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brooking) is working through a lot, but a guy that works that
hard is going to improve,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Jammi is a
natural. He does things you don't teach, as far as making
adjustments and feeling where people are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've probably put Tim in too many places (receiver, punt
returner, kick returner), but you can see the explosion. He really
uses his hands well, and he's a bigger target than he looks (5-8,
182), because he extends. Ephraim is very smart, has good foot
quickness and recovers extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Each rookie spends extra time on certain things, some off the
field. Salaam eats;coaches want him to add 10-15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   German is learning to get free at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work on shaking off the line, because they play a
lot of press coverage in the NFL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other draft choices _ fourth-round safety Omar Brown,
sixth-round cornerback Elijah Williams, seventh-round running back
Ken Oxendine and seventh-round defensive tackle Henry Slay _ have
more ground to make up.
</P>
<P>
   A few undrafted college players are making impressions,
including 6-6, 320-pound right tackle Jose Portilla of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose is a big guy that moves a lot better than his size,''
Reeves said. ``But third(-string) guys work mostly against other
third-group guys. A lot will depend on how they look against better
players.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 29 -- Dismissing a sabotage theory Wednesday,
federal investigators placed blame on the Sierra Chemical Co. for
two blasts that killed four workers and leveled its explosives
plant just east of Reno last January.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators told the Chemical Safety and Hazard
Investigation Board (CSB) that a combination of human error, poor
management and lax safety procedures most likely caused the Kean
Canyon Plant to blow up in the early morning of Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The plant made explosive boosters that are used in the mining
industry. Boosters provide the energy necessary to detonate less
sensitive blasting material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sierra provided over 100 pages of documents and wanted us to
consider a theory of sabotage,'' said Paul Hill, chairman of the
CSB. ``When our investigators looked at their report ... they were
unable to find any factual evidence to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Laxalt, attorney for Sierra Chemical, disputed the CSB's
findings and said he thinks investigators disregarded facts
gathered from their independent investigation. He said the CSB also
rebuffed requests many times for face-to-face meetings with company
representatives to discuss the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone to great efforts to offer our expert input to the
board and they were not interested,'' Laxalt said. ``They reached
their results ... and we feel they are inaccurate as far as the
cause of the blast.''
</P>
<P>
   After narrowing down four possible scenarios, the investigators
said the cause of the explosion was probably due to friction from a
mixing pot's blade that ignited volatile chemicals left overnight
in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility investigators would not rule out was that
chunks of the explosive materials were pinched between the mixer
blade and pot wall causing the detonation.
</P>
<P>
   Debris from the first blast, investigators said, most likely
penetrated an adjacent building that housed highly flammable
chemicals causing a second explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said many essential elements of process safety and
management were missing or deficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the evidence and testimony safety precautions were
not being taken,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also chastised the Department of Defense for
selling recycled explosives materials that sometimes contained
foreign objects and are dangerous to use.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators report is preliminary draft and the final
version is expected to be adopted within the next six weeks.
Although the CSB has no power to enforce any of its
recommendations, other state and federal agencies may use the
recommendations to aid their investigations.
</P>
<P>
   While not officially adopting the report, Hill described it as
``very thorough,'' and said he is comfortable with its conclusions
and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, which is fighting a $997,000 fine from the Nevada
Division of Industrial Relations because of 38 safety violations,
has submitted construction plans to local authorities and plans on
opening another explosive plant on the site, Laxalt said.

 &HT;    Pot plot: Pilot spots drug crop
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Somewhere, a drug dealer is fuming that the cops
didn't find Eric Robert Rudolph on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a pilot on his way home from the Rudolph manhunt
spotted the dealer's pot plants and called the law. The marijuana,
found growing in a vacant Cherokee County field, was worth
$323,000, according to narcotics agents who launched a manhunt of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State Patrol helicopter pilot was returning to Cobb
County Airport-McCollum Field in Kennesaw after spending most of
the day combing the North Carolina mountains for Rudolph, who is
the only named suspect in the deadly Jan. 29 bombing of a
Birmingham abortion clinic and is wanted for questioning in three
metro Atlanta bombings in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip W. Price, who commands Cherokee's Multi-Agency Narcotics
Squad, said the pilot had changed course after encountering rough
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Flying low over Ga. 92 and Wade Green Road, the pilot happened
to glance out the window. The field below was teeming with 294 dark
green marijuana plants.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators first thought about hiding near the field to try
to catch the grower, but decided that the low-flying chopper might
have tipped off the culprit, so they destroyed the crop. Price said
the landowners live elsewhere in metro Atlanta and probably did not
know about the plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month Cherokee authorities have seized marijuana
worth more than $1 million, Price said, including plants worth
about $900,000 in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, county police confiscated marijuana worth only about
$130,000. Price credits this year's increase to more tips and
flyovers by helicopters from a statewide anti-drug task force.

IOWA'S LAKE OKOBOJI PLENTIFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKOBOJI, Iowa _ Query Midwest anglers about their favorite
species. If they aren't targeting panfish or bass, or gambling on a
rare bite from big-game muskie or Northern pike, they are probably
after walleye _ the bread-and-butter fishery here.
</P>
<P>
   Walleye are the trout of the heartland, and the similarities
between the two fish are enough to attract Western trout lovers who
venture into region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fairly easy to find. If you've got rocks, you're
going to find walleye eventually,'' said Jeff Morrison, a
conservation officer for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
in recreation-crazed Dickinson County, home of the Great Lakes of
Iowa. ``You can catch them any time of day or night.''
</P>
<P>
   And, often, in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking my lingo; I'll take quick success and quantity
over quality anytime. I wanted lots of hookups, as I have come to
expect of the Eastern Sierra's bountiful trout lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Though not particularly fabled fighters, trout and walleye are
staples of stocked waters, and their human pursuers enjoy
much-ballyhooed season openers.
</P>
<P>
   But these fish have their differences. While trout are
cold-water dwellers, walleye are quite at home in the tepid
temperatures of Northern Iowa's natural lakes, where summer highs
can exceed 80 degrees. Trout fall into the salmon family. The
walleye is the largest member of the perch clan. And while the case
can be made that nothing surpasses the taste of trout, many
Midwesterners would argue that walleye are the caviar of freshwater
fare.
</P>
<P>
   To break this trout connoisseur into the world of walleye, two
knowledgeable Iowa anglers would serve as my initiators on the
Okoboji Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Casual but frequent fisherman Warren Vanden Brink of neighboring
Spirit Lake and guide Jim McDonnell from nearby Royal are polar
opposites in angling technique. Vanden Brink prefers still-fishing
with gear he's trusted for decades. McDonnell is a troller who
likes his tackle cutting-edge with all the bells and whistles. They
would show me vastly different bodies of water. It was just the way
I wanted _ an array of methods to land walleye on the one day I had
set aside to fish while visiting family in Iowa in the first week
of June.
</P>
<P>
   Vanden Brink would keep me busy in the a.m. dunking live minnows
on 6- and 8-pound line to the bottom of East Okoboji Lake in an old
Alumacraft that might never have seen a vacuum. He anchored in the
middle of the murky, runoff-fed waters and handed me an antiquated
closed-face spinning reel the likes of which I hadn't seen since
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have $500 or $600 worth of tackle but always catch my fish
on $3 or $4 worth of gear,'' said the 73-year-old former shipyard
welder and sewing-machine repairman who lost an arm in a hunting
accident nearly a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vanden Brink put us on the right spot and was surprised to find
such a windfall of strikes following a three-day cold snap that set
record lows around the Midwest and dumped 10 inches of snow onto
the Black Hills of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   We brought nine walleye to the boat in the first hour; the
initial two exceeded the legal size minimum of 14 inches. (The
limit is three keepers per rod. A mountable Iowa walleye is 8
pounds; the state record is 14{ pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I would inquire about the finer points of Vanden
Brink's angling routine, he would be pleasantly interrupted by a
strike. ``We got business here,'' he would spout.
</P>
<P>
   Walleye have dramatic, oversize eyes _ hence the name _ that are
impossibly opaque but help them feed at night, their preferred
supper time. But runoff-fed East Okoboji is murky and its depths
are dark enough to stimulate daytime foraging instincts.
</P>
<P>
   A split-shot pinched onto the line 12 to 18 inches above a size
No.6 hook keeps the bait on the bottom, and a sliding bobber with a
stopper above it indicates a strike. The simple set-up is deadly _
and much easier than trolling for Vanden Brink, whose fattest
walleye was 6{ pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one hand and it's easier for me to still-fish,'' he
said. ``I can handle it better. Driving a boat and setting the hook
is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He has everything on his boat placed just so and appears quite
systematic in his coveralls as he uses his knees to hold the fish
for dehooking and measuring. Shorts were released and the next
minnow was quickly pinned on the hook. As he attended a separate
suspended panfish line, the whole process began anew as I would
yell out, ``Warren, I don't see your bobber.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning action seldom slowed, as evidenced by our 28 walleye
hookups and three keepers in three and a half hours. Back ashore,
Vanden Brink again impressed me with his adeptness, filleting the
fish with the aid of a contraption composed of a clamp, chain and
barn-door hinge that would anchor the walleye to a cleaning board
and act as a second hand.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 I was trolling with McDonnell on adjoining West Okoboji
Lake aboard a flashy vessel befitting an ``ambassador'' to the
Berkley fishing line and tackle manufacturer headquartered in
Spirit Lake. When McDonnell isn't guiding his own customers 100
times a year, he is ferrying Berkley clients another 20 days.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a blue-water lake because of its spring sources, West
Okoboji is markedly clearer than its twin to the east and its
predators are accordingly much warier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lake has been a tough old brute,'' said McDonnell, 61,
who taught middle school for 35 years. ``Fishing is always good;
catching is a little iffy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell trolls to find the fish that are most active and least
heedful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also the most effective way to find some type of fish
biting when you have any type of extreme weather conditions, which
throws them offbeat a little bit,'' he said. ``Anytime you have a
cold front, it gives the fish the flu.''
</P>
<P>
   He prefers 10- and 14-pound line with sinkers that submerse both
live bait _ night crawlers and leeches _ and plastic worms on two-
and three-hook harness rigs. The hooks are set up behind in-line
spinner outfits: A rotating blade _ the flashing part of a spinning
lure _ is combined on 40 inches of leader with beads in varying
colors, sizes and quantity.
</P>
<P>
   The consummate fishing technician, McDonnell steadfastly altered
the troll speed, adjusted lengths on lines, changed weights,
experimented with color patterns, checked for weeds and made sure
the bait was swimming OK.
</P>
<P>
   As predicted, however, the west lake was slow. We hooked six in
four hours, mostly on ribbon leeches and plastic worms.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said something to the effect that if you can't catch
them where you think they are, you fish for them where you know
they are. Then he whisked us off to East Okoboji. There our luck
picked up dramatically; 10 walleye were nailed in less than an
hour, including the afternoon's only keeper on the lucky thirteenth
hookup.
</P>
<P>
   All tallied, three anglers caught 44 walleye and four keepers in
about 8 hours. Now I know why bumper stickers read, ``Paris ... New
York ... London ... Tokyo ... Okoboji.'' Must be walleye anglers. &QL;

JEROME ROBBINS, 79: LEGENDARY CHOREOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins, the legendary choreographer whose work straddled
the worlds of ballet and Broadway, died of the effects of a stroke
in his home in New York Wednesday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   A visionary known for his synthesis of popular culture and high
art, he brought his signature theatricality to classical ballet and
brought virtuoso movement to the Great White Way. Known to
balletomanes for his long association with the New York City
Ballet, he was best known as the quintessential choreographer of
the modern American musical. His 1957 collaboration with Leonard
Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim on ``West Side Story'' remains a
timeless landmark in theatrical history: His finger-snapping,
high-kicking choreography defined the essence of cool, and the
dances captured the rare combination of youthful abandon and
controlled emotion that unfolds in an urban conflict on a hot,
sweaty night.
</P>
<P>
   His prolific Broadway career began in 1945with the light musical
comedy ``On the Town'' and spanned several decades and included
many commercial hits. He created the landmark ballet ``The Small
House of Uncle Thomas'' in ``The King and I'' (1951); he directed
Mary Martin as she flew across the stage in ``Peter Pan'' (1954);
he brought the bump-and-grind to the Broadway stage in ``Gypsy''
(1959); and he captured life in a Russian village in the historic
production of ``Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964). A retrospective of
his work, ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' received popular and
critical acclaim in 1989, when it won the Tony Award for Best
Musical. He also won two Academy Awards for the 1960 movie version
of ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was capturing the hearts of theatrical
audiences, he maintained a long-standing relationship with the New
York City Ballet, which he joined in 1949 as associate artistic
director so he could work with ballet master George Balanchine; he
shared the title of balletmaster-in-chief with Peter Martins from
1983 to 1990, until Robbins resigned to pursue other interests,
which ranged from theater to film to opera. In May, the ballet paid
tribute to him at its spring gala, which included a performance of
his ballet ``Les Noces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome Robbins's death truly represents the end of an era and
leaves us in deepest grief,'' balletmaster-in-chief Martins said
Wednesday. ``He was the last of the titans in the world of dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of the titans was born Jerome Rabinowitz in New York,
the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants who had fled the pogroms of
Eastern Europe. He changed his name in the early '40s, after he had
begun his career as a dancer in musical comedy and then joined the
newly formed Ballet Theatre (now called the American Ballet
Theatre). His affinity for both ballet and Broadway sprouted early
on: His first ballet, the light-hearted, loose-limbed ``Fancy
Free,'' became ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   A taskmaster who drove himself as hard as he drove his dancers,
Robbins rarely gave interviews. He was known to be exacting both in
and out of the theater: When he did grant an interview, he would
pull out a tape recorder and record the session himself. ``I am
enormously demanding,'' he once said. ``I ask for a great deal, but
no more than I give myself.'' In one famous theatrical tale, after
a day of grueling rehearsals, the cast of ``West Side Story''
watched him back off the stage and fall into the orchestra pit
without warning him of his precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Robbins was mercurial, however, it was because he
possessed an uncompromising commitment to his art. Dancers, he
often said, ``have to be passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Pelzig, associate artist at Boston Ballet, was a young
dancer in the 1980 Broadway revival of ``West Side Story.'' ``He
could be prickly one moment and have the most amazing sense of
humor the next,'' Pelzig recalled. ``But you accepted the package
because he was such a great visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have pushed and prodded but he did it to instill that
vision in his dancers. Even though he underwent heart surgery two
years ago, he debuted his last ballet, the critically acclaimed
``Brandenburg,'' last year in New York. ``Robbins made you aware
that as a dancer, there is a context,'' Pelzig said. ``It's not
about feet pointing or the leg straightening: It's about being in a
time and a place and being in touch with your humanity. He was a
master at that.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of humanity extended from the high jinks of ``Gypsy''
and ``The Pajama Game'' to the heartbreak of ``West Side Story''
and ``Fiddler.'' Like the gang members in the unforgettable number
``Cool,'' Robbins was a passionate artist all the way, from his
first Broadway show to his last dying day.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins leaves a sister, Sonia Cuollines, a niece and nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway theaters will dim their lights Friday night just before
curtain as a tribute to Robbins.

ROAD RACING'S LATE BLOOMING SUPERSTAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For many competitive cyclists, athletic
aspirations come first. Strike while legs are young is the basic
philosophy; a business career begins after the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge road racer Pam Schuster pedaled a different path. She
took care of business first. The dividends have paid off with a
fresh outlook for a 37-year-old rider while other competitors have
grown tired of the sport or can no longer afford to put
professional careers on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got out of school at 25 with a pharmacist's degree, worked
five years full-time, and in that time period built up equity and
savings,'' said Pam's husband of 13 years, Peter, also 37. ``She's
already built an economic base, whereas some cyclists have to quit
to pursue a real job. She's already finished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring up age,'' he said. ``But she started racing late,
at 30, so she's not burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, many road racers remain competitive into their 40s. The
question beckons: How long can Schuster remain in the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm going to try to find out,'' she said recently
from her Mammoth Lakes condo during a break between races. ``But
into my 40s, because it won't be too long until I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   By her recent successes, there appears to be no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month she earned her first championship in the U.S.
Elite National Road Race in Cincinnati, all but assuring her a
second trip to the world championship in October in Holland. (She
finished in the pack at worlds in 1996; a broken hip _ her worst
racing injury, requiring three months of recovery _ kept her from
participating in '95.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she placed second in the inaugural women's World Cup
road race, staged on the 2000 Olympic course in Sydney, Australia.
It was her best international finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather said I won the first ever (women's World
Cup), and I tried,'' Schuster said. ``I was in a three-person
breakaway and I tried to break away from my breakaway. But I got
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   She enjoys a challenging mix of trade-team races (sponsors pay
riders to compete) and national-team races (riders have more
opportunities for international contests; U.S. Olympic team
prospects are selected from this circuit).
</P>
<P>
   A national team member this year, Schuster also made the squad
in '95 and '96. Twice she failed to qualify for the Olympic team _
in '92, because of inexperience, and '96, done in by a flat tire
and a crash.
</P>
<P>
   However, qualifying for the Sydney Summer Games appears
realistic, especially considering her World Cup finish.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take to be an Olympian?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of luck,'' Schuster said. ``I'll continue to work really
hard, as I have every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is off to Europe for the women's equivalent of
the Tour de France in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the complicated arena of team racing, Schuster is known as a
strong all-around rider. Her forte is climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her strength is twofold,'' said her husband, an
accountant for defense contractor Litton Industries in Woodland
Hills and a racer himself who enters more than 50 pro-am events a
year. ``Foremost is her mental toughness. And as far as terrain
goes, it's her ability to climb. Put the two together and you have
a very good racer.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on a race course's ascents, Schuster might or might
not get the call to lead her team. Earlier this month in a race in
Italy, she took 12th in a supporting role that netted a teammate a
second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Team bike racing is a chess game on wheels,'' said the
Greeley, Colo., native and University of Colorado graduate. Simply
stated, teams of four, six or eight riders look at a particular
race course and decide who is best suited to lead. The remainder
support her by attempting to get her into a position to pedal into
the breakaway pack.
</P>
<P>
   While at home, which isn't often during a racing season that
lasts from mid-January to mid-October, Schuster enjoys spending
time with her two lapdogs _ Goofy and Minnie. She also likes Alpine
and Nordic skiing and, in what her husband describes as a
``typecast role reversal,'' taking care of the household
maintenance _ from fixing broken pipes to rewiring the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``sacrifice'' and ``jealous'' are completely rejected
by Peter Schuster when he is asked about his supportive role to his
wife's cycling endeavor. ``It's a choice I'm happy to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Through her sport, Pam Schuster does contribute to the family
income, though not as much as she would as a pharmacist _ a
profession she plans to continue following her racing days.
</P>
<P>
   But based on past earnings and present winnings, ``income is not
an issue'' in her racing, said Peter Schuster, who moved from
Colorado to the San Fernando Valley with his wife in 1989. ``It
takes some pressure off. But sometimes she'll have a thought like,
`I'm riding my bike and Peter is working.' I don't look at it that
way. I enjoy my work, and I enjoy watching her ride and pursue her
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Early to work, late to race has made Pam a success.

weighing their options for continuing the pregnancy or terminating
it. However, the woman would still have to undergo an invasive test
_ chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis _ to know for certain
whether the fetus was affected.
</P>
<P>
   With current tests, screening for Down syndrome and other birth
defects is done at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation. If it is positive, an
amniocentesis is needed to make a diagnosis, and by the time those
results are available, it's often not until 21 or 22 weeks that an
abortion is performed, said Dr. Laird G. Jackson of Thomas
Jefferson University in Pennsylvania. This is uncomfortably close
to deadlines of 22 to 24 weeks after which most abortion providers
will not terminate a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, said Jackson, ``if properly applied will exceed
the present rate of detection in the second trimester (tests) and
will move it into the first trimester when people can be more
comfortable'' under less time pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The tests combine an ultrasound scan that requires intensive
training, and a set of blood tests that measure human chorionic
gonadotrophin (hCG) and pregancy-associated placental proteins
(PAPP-A), said Jackson, a professor of medicine, pediatrics and
gynecology.
</P>
<P>
   The ultrasound, developed in England, looks for an abnormal
swelling of tissues in the back of the neck of the fetus, which is
a strong indication of Down syndrome. But the difference is subtle,
and the test did not work well when tried by US ultrasound
specialists in a study several years ago, said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ultrasound in combination with the blood tests is
about to undergo a new study sponsored by the National Institutes
of Health, he said, with improved training of ultrasound operators.
Jackson spoke to reporters Wednesday at a briefing during an annual
genetics meeting held at Jackson Laboratory here.
</P>
<P>
   If validated, the combination of ultrasound and blood tests
``could make it possible for a woman to have a single appointment
at an obstetrical center, wait 20 minutes'' for outcomes of the
tests and know then and there whether she has a high risk of
carrying a fetus affected by Down syndrome, said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome is caused by a chromosome abnormality and results
in retardation and characteristic physical abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   If the tests were positive, the woman would be assigned an
estimated risk based on the findings and her age. She would still
have to undergo an invasive test, either chorionic villus sampling
(CVS) or amniocentesis, to make certain of the diagnosis, and doing
either test early in pregnancy carries some risk of fetal damage or
miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   George Knight, director of the prenatal diagnosis laboratory at
the Foundation for Blood Research in Scarborough, Maine, said that
CVS has become less available in recent years because of concern
over fetal damage, and therefore a woman getting the new test might
have to wait a significant amount of time or go elsewhere for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first-trimester test has a lot of appeal because it's
early,'' said Knight in a telephone interview, ``but the concern is
these other issues, such as having to have an invasive test'' that
may not be immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said that the blood tests for hCG and PAPP-A that go
along with the ultrasound are not yet widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that he and other obstetricians would like to see
the combination test closely studied for accuracy before it becomes
widespread. He said a study is being conducted by obstetricians at
New England Medical Center in Boston, but the investigator heading
the research could not be reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Screening tests currently used in the second trimester include a
blood test to measure a substance called alpha-fetoprotein in the
mother's circulation: an abnormally low level signals the
possibility of a fetus with Down syndrome.

ALL-AROUND STATEGY ESSENTIAL WHEN ENCOUNTERING BEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No North American land animal evokes primal fear
like the grizzly bear; those who have seen the recent flick ``The
Edge'' will agree.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for humans, encounters with the humpbacked bruin are
avoidable, according to ``Backcountry Bear Basics'' (The
Mountaineers, $10.95).
</P>
<P>
   Author Dave Smith, an Anchorage, Alaska, naturalist who has
lived in grizzly territory for nearly three decades, places the
blame for deaths and maulings by bears on humans; ignorance and
misinformation are the major contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith does not have any magic bullet. For example, carrying a
gun is hardly a safety guard since a near-perfect shot with a
large-caliber weapon is required to bring down a charging
!ital!Ursus horribilis!off!. That's common knowledge for hunters,
but the subtitle of this 110-page book is ``The Definitive Guide to
Avoiding Unpleasant Encounters,'' because most backpackers can't
afford the weighty luxury of a rifle. A wound from a handgun
usually only enrages the beast.
</P>
<P>
   Running from a grizzly is just as useless; it can move almost
twice as fast (35 mph) as the speediest human. Pepper spray can be
helpful in some situations provided the user can get to it in time,
but Smith advocates a comprehensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers should find out the bear situation before going into the
woods. Smith says specialty items, such as bear-resistant food
containers, resealable plastic and garbage bags are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Some advice seems like common sense, until you see tourists
actually approaching bears, feeding them and carelessly leaving
food around their campsites. Smith suggests taking only cold food
into bear country. Cook in the open and away from the campsite.
Camp away from streams, in a forest or in the open, but not where
the timber and meadows meet. Hanging food can help, at least to
deter ``novice'' bears.
</P>
<P>
   Some tips seem more difficult to follow. It would be tough to
stand ground when a griz approaches suddenly in a close-up
encounter. (You're supposed to hit the dirt and play dead _ hands
behind head _ if contact is imminent.) And good luck trying not to
yell out when under attack.
</P>
<P>
   In most case, Smith writes, it is better to stand and face the
grizzly, because it might oblige the creature to back off, as
grizzlies usually do in confrontations with others of their
species. Most charges are bluffs anyhow. Speaking softly (without
carrying a big stick) to the animal might also help ward off
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest dangers on the trail is surprising a bear.
The author recommends that trekkers clap while going around a bend
and say, ``Hey, bear,'' rather than tying bear bells to their
packs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has pieced together the only bear book anyone would ever
need. His advice is flawlessly logical. But who could summon a
calm, quiet voice to reassure a grizzly or resist screaming bloody
murder if the former isn't effective? I hope Smith's tactics work
the next time I'm in grizzly country. If not, he might be hearing
from my estate. Our rating: 3 1/2

   Norman Clyde is a legend in the annals of Sierra Nevada hiking
and climbing. He climbed Mount Whitney 50 times. In 1925 alone, he
undertook 48 high-country climbs _ half of them first ascents. When
he first fell in love with the mountains, ``free climbing'' was the
norm, with ropes seldom employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close Ups of the High Sierra,'' (Spotted Dog Press, $14.95),
edited by Wynne Benti, is a collection of Clyde's writings and
descriptions of many of his climbs. Most of the 169 pages, which
include forewords, are straightforward narratives of ascents. But
among them is an emotional account of one trip when his partner
didn't come back; a skiing partner died of a heart attack during a
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   It's really too bad Clyde, described as a ``vanishing
Victorian,'' didn't write more about himself and his adventures,
and not merely climbing tales. Not only was he a world-class
climber, he plucked injured, lost, stranded and _ too often _ dead
climbers and skiers from various locales during winters. He had a
nose for finding wrecked planes, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde initially turned to climbing after his wife died four
years into their marriage and spent much of the rest of his life in
the mountains. One foreword notes that he was principal of a high
school in Independence until he was fired for shooting warning
shots at youthful pranksters.
</P>
<P>
   This candid look at Sierra hiking should be engaging for the
casual reader, and Clyde's accounts of early ascents might be
especially fascinating to hard-core mountain climbers. Our rating:
2 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Dad takes a fishing trip with his 7-year-old daughter as he
attempts to get over his divorce and his father's death a year
earlier. A sentimental family story set in the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a perfect idea for a teary-eyed ``chick flick.''
As a book, well, it will not rival Clancy or Follett for thrills.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Faithful Travelers'' (Bantam Books; $22.95) is not a bad
read. Author James Dodson is a solid writer, and his anecdotes and
connecting facts are poignant if not always funny.
</P>
<P>
   The 279 pages meander and rarely seem to get anywhere in
particular, but the journey is fairly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Those with families will find ``Faithful Travelers'' more
interesting than others, and it has a decidedly Christian
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors as therapy rather than as proving grounds? Makes
sense. Our rating: 2 1/2

JEROME ROBBINS, 79: LEGENDARY CHOREOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins, the legendary choreographer whose work straddled
the worlds of ballet and Broadway, died of the effects of a stroke
in his home in New York Wednesday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   A visionary known for his synthesis of popular culture and high
art, he brought his signature theatricality to classical ballet and
brought virtuoso movement to the Great White Way. Known to
balletomanes for his long association with the New York City
Ballet, he was best known as the quintessential choreographer of
the modern American musical. His 1957 collaboration with Leonard
Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim on ``West Side Story'' remains a
timeless landmark in theatrical history: His finger-snapping,
high-kicking choreography defined the essence of cool, and the
dances captured the rare combination of youthful abandon and
controlled emotion that unfolds in an urban conflict on a hot,
sweaty night.
</P>
<P>
   His prolific Broadway career began in 1945with the light musical
comedy ``On the Town'' and spanned several decades and included
many commercial hits. He created the landmark ballet ``The Small
House of Uncle Thomas'' in ``The King and I'' (1951); he directed
Mary Martin as she flew across the stage in ``Peter Pan'' (1954);
he brought the bump-and-grind to the Broadway stage in ``Gypsy''
(1959); and he captured life in a Russian village in the historic
production of ``Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964). A retrospective of
his work, ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' received popular and
critical acclaim in 1989, when it won the Tony Award for Best
Musical. He also won two Academy Awards for the 1960 movie version
of ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was capturing the hearts of theatrical
audiences, he maintained a long-standing relationship with the New
York City Ballet, which he joined in 1949 as associate artistic
director so he could work with ballet master George Balanchine; he
shared the title of balletmaster-in-chief with Peter Martins from
1983 to 1990, until Robbins resigned to pursue other interests,
which ranged from theater to film to opera. In May, the ballet paid
tribute to him at its spring gala, which included a performance of
his ballet ``Les Noces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome Robbins's death truly represents the end of an era and
leaves us in deepest grief,'' balletmaster-in-chief Martins said
Wednesday. ``He was the last of the titans in the world of dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of the titans was born Jerome Rabinowitz in New York,
the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants who had fled the pogroms of
Eastern Europe. He changed his name in the early '40s, after he had
begun his career as a dancer in musical comedy and then joined the
newly formed Ballet Theatre (now called the American Ballet
Theatre). His affinity for both ballet and Broadway sprouted early
on: His first ballet, the light-hearted, loose-limbed ``Fancy
Free,'' became ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   A taskmaster who drove himself as hard as he drove his dancers,
Robbins rarely gave interviews. He was known to be exacting both in
and out of the theater: When he did grant an interview, he would
pull out a tape recorder and record the session himself. ``I am
enormously demanding,'' he once said. ``I ask for a great deal, but
no more than I give myself.'' In one famous theatrical tale, after
a day of grueling rehearsals, the cast of ``West Side Story''
watched him back off the stage and fall into the orchestra pit
without warning him of his precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Robbins was mercurial, however, it was because he
possessed an uncompromising commitment to his art. Dancers, he
often said, ``have to be passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Pelzig, associate artist at Boston Ballet, was a young
dancer in the 1980 Broadway revival of ``West Side Story.'' ``He
could be prickly one moment and have the most amazing sense of
humor the next,'' Pelzig recalled. ``But you accepted the package
because he was such a great visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have pushed and prodded but he did it to instill that
vision in his dancers. Even though he underwent heart surgery two
years ago, he debuted his last ballet, the critically acclaimed
``Brandenburg,'' last year in New York. ``Robbins made you aware
that as a dancer, there is a context,'' Pelzig said. ``It's not
about feet pointing or the leg straightening: It's about being in a
time and a place and being in touch with your humanity. He was a
master at that.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of humanity extended from the high jinks of ``Gypsy''
and ``The Pajama Game'' to the heartbreak of ``West Side Story''
and ``Fiddler.'' Like the gang members in the unforgettable number
``Cool,'' Robbins was a passionate artist all the way, from his
first Broadway show to his last dying day.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins leaves a sister, Sonia Cuollines, a niece and nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway theaters will dim their lights Friday night just before
curtain as a tribute to Robbins.

&HT;        PEOPLE WOULD USE SURPLUS TO PAY NATIONAL DEBT, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 29 -- The government is about the right size.
The budget surplus should be used to pay off the national debt.
Social Security should be reformed to include individual savings
accounts. And if taxes need to be raised, bump up sin taxes and
corporate income taxes first.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way average citizens would tackle the federal budget,
according to a report by the Committee for a Responisible Federal
Budget, a bipartisan Washington-based nonprofit research group.
</P>
<P>
   About 850 people in five cities, including Denver, took part in
the group's day-long budget exercises, working through some of the
decisions lawmakers face in making the $1.7 trillion federal
budget. The other cities were Norman, Okla., Long Beach, Calif.,
Cincinnati, Ohio, and Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The participants looked at the size of the federal government,
considered possible balanced-budget rules, examined Social Security
and Medicare reform, contemplated other programs such as defense
spending, and decided what to do with current taxes and the
expected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   They then broke into groups of eight to 10 to come up with
answers. Staff members from the congressional budget committees
helped them with questions that arised.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results:
</P>
<P>
   89 percent of the groups wanted to use the projected $63 billion
budget surplus to begin paying off the $5.5 trillion national debt,
while only 4 percent wanted to use the windfall to cut taxes.
Virtually none wanted to use it to increase spending.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to Social Security, which is expected to go
bankrupt by 2030, more than three-fourths of the groups wanted to
include some sort of individual savings account in the solution. 13
percent wanted to make gradual changes to the program, such as
raising the retirement age to 67 for people born after 1949 and
decreasing the cost-of-living adjustments. Only 1 percent wanted to
keep the current program.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the groups, 61 percent, wanted to maintain a
lean government in relation to the GDP, keeping the government at
19 percent of the GDP as mandated in the 1997 Balanced Budget
Agreement. A third of the groups would increase the federal
government slightly -- to 23 percent of the GDP -- in order to
anticipate the expected increase in demand for Medicaid and Social
Security when Baby Boomers retire. Few, though, would increase the
government more than that.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to taxes, the participants said they didn't want
them raised, but if they had to be raised they wanted alcohol and
tobacco taxes increased first. After that, they said they would
raise corporate income taxes, and Social Security payroll taxes
before hitting individual income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., and Diana Degette, D-Denver,
who took part in the Denver session in April, praised the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsible budget was a tremendous success in Denver
where local citizens contributed their time to help shape the
economic future of our country,'' said DeGette. Allard agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should take a very close look at the results of these
exercises,'' said Allard. ``Especially the section concerning what
Congress should be doing with the budget surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard, who introduced a bill in February that would set a
30-year payment schedule to repay the national debt, took the study
as validation for his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 90 percent of folks believe we need to start paying down
the debt, that is a strong message that Congress needs to start
doing something to put our fiscal house in order,'' Allard said.
``As I have said in the past, we do not have a budget surplus as
long as we have more than a $5.5 trillion debt.''

 &HT;    Thomas sharphy defends conservative views
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ In a highly personal address to the nation's
largest association of black judges and lawyers, Clarence Thomas,
the only black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, said Wednesday
his judicial views are influenced by his own reasoning and that
race should not be the basis for his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed head-on controversy surrounding his appearance at
the National Bar Association meeting and efforts by some members to
rescind his invitation because, they claim, he has hurt the cause
of civil rights with his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 850 in the main ballroom of the Peabody Hotel, and
300 more who watched a television feed in a nearby room, gave
polite responses throughout the 35-minute speech. Thomas at times
struck sharply at critics, drawing gasps from the crowd when he
wondered whether his detractors were ``illiterate or fraught with
malice.''
</P>
<P>
   A rumored walkout never materialized, although a handful of
protesters picketed at two separate locations outside. Thomas joked
about the controversy in his opening remarks _ ``I have heard all
the arguments and will take them under advisement'' _ but he ended
his speech with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me deeply, more deeply than any of you can imagine,
to be perceived by so many members of my race as doing them harm,''
Thomas said. ``All the sacrifices, all the long hours of
preparation were to help, not to hurt. But what hurts more, much
more, is the amount of time and attention spent on manufactured
controversies and media sideshows when so many problems cry out for
constructive attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia native, appointed to the nation's highest court in
1991 by President George Bush, harked back to the assassination of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis 30 years ago as a
turning point in his life that caused him to leave seminary and
abandon his calling as a Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, this cataclysmic event ripped me from the moorings
of my grandparents, my youth and my faith,'' Thomas said. ``It was
this event that shattered my faith in my religion and my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas recalled that a fellow seminarian had ``hoped the SOB
died'' after King was shot. Gone was the life Thomas had dreamed
about during summers on the farm in Georgia or on the oil truck
with his grandfather. Thomas said his dream ``expired as Dr. King
expired.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address to the NBA, formed 73 years ago because the
American Bar Association did not allow black members, Thomas kept
returning to the theme of oppression, a history he told the group
he shared with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a man, a black man, an American. My history is not unlike
that of many blacks in the Deep South,'' said Thomas, 50. ``And in
many ways it is not that much different from that of many other
Americans. It goes without saying that I understand the comforts
and security of racial solidarity. ... Only those who have not been
set upon by hatred and repelled by rejection fail to understand its
attraction. As I have suggested, I have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   On a picket line outside the hotel, one protester wore a
sandwich board bearing the legend, ``Uncle Thomas an Insult to
Thurgood Marshall and Dr. King.'' James Stewart, an appeals court
judge in Louisiana, said many in the NBA see Thomas' votes against
affirmative action as a ``wasted opportunity.'' Stewart said Thomas
has a ``duty to follow the views put forth by Thurgood Marshall,''
the first black member of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he never would apologize for his conservative views
and would continue ``to refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as
though I'm an intellectual slave because I'm black. I come to state
that I am a man free to think for myself and do as I please. I came
to assert that as a judge I will not be consigned to the
unquestioned opinions of others.''

HOUSE VOTES TO DENY PRISONERS THE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the first time in the state's history, the
Legislature moved Wednesday to take away a group's right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But this being an election year, and the group being prisoners,
the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment to the
Massachusetts Constitution taking away inmates' ability to cast
absentee ballots from behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   To finalize the decision, the Legislature must vote in favor of
the amendment again next year, which is likely, and then the
measure would be put on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the state would fall within the norm across the
country. Currently, only three other states allow prisoners to
vote: Utah, Maine, and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told other states place restrictions,'' Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham said. ``I think it's within that context, in
terms of constitutional issues, that we're on very solid ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners have had the right to vote under the state
constitution and, in the 1970s, the Supreme Judicial Court upheld
that right.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue came to the fore last year when Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci discovered that Norfolk County prisoners had
formed a first-in-the-nation political action committee to urge
fellow inmates to vote and lobby lawmakers on the transfer of
convicts to cells in Texas and on cuts in rehabilitation and
substance-abuse treatment in correctional facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci issued an executive order banning inmate fund-raising
and vowed to take away their voting rights. Wednesday, the
Legislature followed Cellucci's lead, approving an amendment to the
constitution, 155-34.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of prisoners' rights said the Democratic Legislature
was acting cynically, to avoid giving Cellucci an inflamatory issue
in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the Republicans mostly,'' said Represenative Byron
Rushing, a Boston Democrat, who voted against the measure. ``And a
lot of people not giving due consideration would feel uncomfortable
voting green (yes) in an election year. No one could tell us how
many prisoners could vote.''
</P>
<P>
   David Elvin of the Massachusetts Prisoners Assocation _ the PAC
that Cellucci tried to quash _ said that at least 2,000 prisoners
out of 24,000 in state and county facilities registered to vote
using their most recent address in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main activity over the last year has been to increase
voter registration,'' Elvin said. ``There aren't that many
prisoners that vote on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, usually more liberal than the House, voted with
similar support Wednesday to take away a prisoner's right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate on the House floor during the joint session
spanned a range of opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Represenative Benjamin Swan, a Springfield Democrat, said his
grandfather was born a slave who could not vote and he argued
against taking the ``very serious'' step of taking away the rights
of any disenchfranchised group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it abhorrent that we would vote to take away the
franchise rights of individuals, the right to vote, especially in
this election year,'' Swan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Businger said he was concerned about making any change
to the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we're fiddling with it because we want a headline,''
said Businger, a Brookline Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Paul Frost, a Republican from Auburn, argued those who
have committed crimes have impinged on the freedoms of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murderers have taken the voting rights of their victims,'' he
said. ``They forfeited their rights in cases of murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Marini, a Republican representative from Hanson, filed
the constitutional amendment in January, 1997. It bans voting for
the span of inmates' sentences, then restores their rights once
they are released. In 13 states, according to Elvin, convicts never
get that right back.
</P>
<P>
   Marini predicted that the amendment would win wide popular
support. ``People who oppose this measure, know the public will
approve this,'' Marini said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer praised the Legislature's
move. ``Those people who can't obey our most basic laws forfeit
their right to participate in the law-making process,'' she said.

TORTILLA-CHIP MAKER SQUEEZED BY GIANT FRITO-LAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN CRENO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's hard for Bob Murillo to keep the frustration from
boiling over. He's trying to stay upbeat about his company's
chances for survival while he watches it slowly die.
</P>
<P>
   Murillo has to keep a happy face for the grocery store
executives and buyers who decide what foods you see in stores. He's
pitching hard to keep his company's tortilla chips in enough stores
to let his business stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Murillo is seething. His company, Mi Ranchito, has been
dropped from one grocery chain after another and may have to close
if it's removed from any of the last three it does business in.
</P>
<P>
   Murillo says his chips are selling, but he's still losing store
space.
</P>
<P>
   He says it's tough to compete with a giant like Frito-Lay,
Pepsico Inc.'s snack food division, which offers stores
compensation for increased space, including premium spots at the
ends of aisles, ``slotting fees'' for new displays, and marketing
deals his company could never afford.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay says it's doing nothing wrong and is merely an
aggressive player in a very competitive business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our intention to drive small, regional companies out
of business, but the business environment probably has been
difficult for small companies,'' Frito-Lay spokeswoman Lynn Markley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our single focus is on growth, and you get that growth through
quality, innovation, and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores say that when Mi Ranchito, or any product is dropped,
it's due to sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer wants a product, we won't discontinue it,''
Safeway spokeswoman Debra Albery said.
</P>
<P>
   Fry's spokesman Mike Donnelly and Marsha Gilford, spokeswoman
for the Smitty's-Smith's stores, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really dictates to us what products we carry,''
Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Mi Ranchito is trying to overcome one of the biggest obstacles
confronting small, independent retailers: Big companies and big
brands rule the marketplace and can spend huge amounts of money
promoting their products.
</P>
<P>
   Local or regional companies often operate on a shoestring and
don't have the money for a big marketing push to establish or
promote their brands.
</P>
<P>
   Mi Ranchito, for instance, has bought ads on the announcement
board at the Fiesta Bowl. Frito-Lay now sponsors the game and
renamed it after its Tostitos chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have been trained that if it's a name brand, it's
OK,'' Bashas' spokeswoman Becca Anderson said. ``It's that habit
that really works against a small company until someone is used to
their product and tells other people about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported in 1996 that the U.S. Justice
Department's antitrust division was looking at whether Frito-Lay is
buying shelf space to keep out competitors. Markley said
investigators contacted Frito-Lay a year ago, but the company
hasn't heard anything since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been accused of any wrongdoing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mi Ranchito - Spanish for ``my little ranch'' - operates out of
a 15,000-square-foot office and production facility in Phoenix. It
has a staff of 18, including 14 who work on the production floor.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded more than 20 years ago by Espiridion
Murillo, 82, who said he picked up the nickname Pancho years ago
when a man logging bets for a boxing match couldn't spell his name
and scribbled Pancho on the sheet instead. Espiridion Murillo is
the company's president and his face is on the side of the bag as
its trademark, ``Senor Pancho.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Murillo is the son of the founder, as is company treasurer
Rudy Murillo. As of 1991, Mi Ranchito was in every major grocery
chain in the Phoenix area with prominent shelf space and end-caps,
the coveted display space at the ends of aisles.
</P>
<P>
   The brand recently was taken out of Southwest Supermarkets and
is down to three chains: ABCO, Fry's and Bashas' Food City stores.
Mi Ranchito says its sales have fallen from $3.5 million six years
ago to $1 million last year, even though the company has added
revenue by taking on distribution for another snack-food company.
</P>
<P>
   Mi Ranchito's production is sporadic, and some employees' hours
have been cut to 32 a week. The Murillos say some employees left
for more stable jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Mi Ranchito has complained to the state Attorney General's
Office, and has asked a private lawyer what it can do. The
prospects seem dim.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay said it faces plenty of competition from such chip
companies as Mission and Poore Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have succeeded for decades by being totally open honest and
fair,'' Markley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilford, of Smith's-Smitty's, said stores face huge pressure to
find space for the avalanche of new products introduced every year.
</P>
<P>
   She said her company depends on vendor research to assess how
well those products will be received, and watches sales of
merchandise that's already on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult when there are so many new products out there
that grocery stores cannot be the test arena for them,'' Gilford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Murillo acknowledges that Mi Ranchito has grown, but says
that growth hasn't come at the expense of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting rich here,'' he said. ``We're just trying to
make a living. We're not flaunting anything because we don't have
anything to flaunt.'' &QL;

BASEBALL UNION GETS BOOST FROM SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a proposal that would help reduce the possibility of a
strike, Major League Baseball players would, for the first time
since 1922, have the right to sue owners under legislation unveiled
in the US Senate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement among Senate leaders and Major League Baseball
owners and players would be a major change in baseball's
controversial 76-year-old antitrust exemption. It would put
baseball players on the same footing as athletes in other major
sports when it comes to the ultimate legal recourse in settling
disputes with owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress may not be able to solve every problem or heal
baseball's self-inflicted wounds,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy,
a Vermont Democrat. ``But we can pass legislation that will declare
that professional baseball can no longer operate outside the law as
it applies to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the proposal became possible when both the
players' union and commissioner Bud Selig sent senators a letter of
agreement on the proposed language in the legislation. It was also
boosted when it was agreed among the parties that the minor
leagues, represented by the National Association of Professional
Baseball Leagues Inc., would continue to be exempt from antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress adopts this agreement,'' said Donald M. Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Association, ``it will be a significant step toward minimizing the
labor discord and disruptions in play that have plagued our
national pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have long complained that they had no leverage if the
owners moved, as they did in 1994, to unilaterally impose the
provisions of an expired contract. In both the National Football
League and the National Basketball Association, players can sue
under antitrust law when such conditions are imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball players have never had that,'' said Steve Fehr, chief
legal counsel to the Major League Baseball Players Association.
``Not having that recourse has exacerbated the tensions many of us
have always felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Fehr, Donald's brother, said that in 1994, for example, if the
baseball owners had succeeded in breaking the union, the players
could then have taken the owners to court under antitrust law, with
fairly easy access to remedies like injunctions and back-to-work
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is enacted to law, this is a big step forward,'' Steve
Fehr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has been considering changes in
baseball's antitrust exemption since the bitterly divisive players'
strike of 1994 that resulted in the cancellation of the World
Series for the first time _ a strike that resulted in lower
attendance and television viewership, which baseball continues to
recoup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me that the existence of an antitrust exemption
contributed negatively to those developments,'' Leahy said. ``That
was a low point in the history of baseball and one from which it is
only now recovering.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Judiciary
Committee and announced the accord in Washington with Leahy, has
for years pushed for changes in the exemption. Hatch has sponsored
the so-called Curt Flood Act, named for the late major leaguer who
pressed an assault on Major League Baseball's reserve clause, which
had bound players to teams for life.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed agreement would remove one of the last obstacles to
passage of the legislation, which has been pending for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fans are returning to the ballparks, they deserve to know
that players will be on the field, not mired in labor disputes,''
Hatch said. ``I am pleased that Congress will, it now appears, be
able to help guarantee that this is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi has indicated that
he favors the proposal, and they expressed confidence Congress will
pass it in September after returning from the summer recess.

MEGGETT'S BROKEN FOOT INJURED DURING SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Patriots running back David Meggett may be out
for the entire 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Agnone, his agent, said Wednesday that Meggett sustained
further injury to his broken foot during surgery at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett suffered a broken right foot during the Patriots' 7-6
playoff loss in Pittsburgh Jan. 3. The Patriots released Meggett
May 29, some three months after he was charged with sexual assault
and robbery in Toronto. The assault charges were dropped; the
robbery charge is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Agnone said Meggett returned to Boston for the removal of a pin
that had been placed in his foot to stabilize the break. However,
during surgery, a tendon in his foot detached from the bone and had
to be reattached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave thought he would be ready to come back to play in
October,'' said Agnone, ``but that is doubtful now. The doctors
told him this (setback) would add another six weeks to the recovery
process, and that would take him close to the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett is still a free agent, but several teams had maintained
interest in him and were considering him as a possibility once he
was cleared medically to play again.

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Strikes against two General Motors auto parts
factories ended here Wednesday after nearly eight weeks as workers
ratified a settlement and trooped back into the plants, but the
showdown has harmed GM and the United Automobile Workers while
appearing to produce limited gains for either side.
</P>
<P>
   The strike cost GM about $3 billion in after-tax losses, the
nation's costliest strike ever before adjusting for inflation, yet
produced a deal that mainly calls for a few small changes in work
rules at the factories here and other parts factories in Ohio and
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has left GM dealerships with few popular models, so
GM's market share in July and possibly August most likely will fall
below Ford Motor Co.'s for the first time since a national strike
against GM in 1970. And GM could have serious problems producing
enough 1999 model cars and trucks in time to compete with rival
automakers' 1999 offerings this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   UAW leaders have praised the agreement since it was announced
Tuesday, but they have relatively little to show for the $1 billion
in paychecks that their members gave up. The strike mostly
maintained the status quo, but at the cost of giving the union a
national image for taking workers out on long strikes. That could
hurt the UAW's planned push over the next several years to organize
workers at independent auto parts makers.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's strikes also cost GM nearly half a year's worth of
earnings, which will reduce workers' profit-sharing checks at the
end of the year. And the further erosion of GM's market share
during the strike means that the world's largest automaker may need
even fewer workers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   GM could probably rebuild the factories here from the ground up
for less than $1 billion, so Wall Street analysts questioned what
the company and the union had achieved after fighting each other to
a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, they both are suicidal _ nobody won,
but you can conclusively say both sides lost a little,'' said
Maryann Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The final details of the settlement, presented to workers before
their ratification votes Wednesday, include some small adjustments
in work rules. Seeking to rally public opinion against the UAW, GM
often painted the walkouts as a struggle over whether decades-old
work rules would continue to allow about 600 welders to draw a full
day's pay for four to six hours of work. The welders, who labor in
a hot factory with no air-conditioning and must move 55-pound
engine braces with their bare hands because there is little
automation available, must produce a certain number of parts during
a shift. Once they have met their quotas, they can stop work,
although they are not allowed to leave the factory until eight
hours have elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The final settlement maintains these work rules but raises the
number of parts a welder must produce before stopping work. Yet
even the increases in required parts are fairly modest and will be
phased in gradually. Welders producing engine braces for the
Chevrolet Astro van, for example, will be required to produce 800
braces during an eight-hour shift by next March, compared with 768
now.
</P>
<P>
   One of these welders, Kim Cramer, said he would still be able to
finish work early. ``I'll get done in five hours or six hours, it
depends on how hard I work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The accord protects GM against further strikes for a year at
some of its most important auto parts factories here and in
Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio. In exchange, GM promised that, at
least through the end of next year, it would not sell or close a
spark plug factory here or brake factories in Dayton, a distinct
possibility that had worried workers in both cities.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of these factories will be on the table again when
GM and the UAW start bargaining next summer on a new national
agreement. The current accord will expire in September 1999, and
many workers and UAW officials said here Wednesday that they were
already bracing for another possible strike then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be just as hard fought as this one,'' said Dennis
Savage, 55, who operates parts-making equipment. ``Better start
saving now.''
</P>
<P>
   GM and UAW leaders agreed Tuesday to talk more regularly to head
off future strikes. But the two sides continued to aim barbed
remarks at each other, suggesting that the peace may not last long.
The two sides may also have a tacit understanding not to engage in
further showdowns of this sort for a while, although neither party
would confirm this.
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign that restarting production may be a long, slow
process, GM announced Wednesday that it would reopen just four of
its 25 closed assembly plants in North America on Friday. The first
assembly plants to reopen will be a highly profitable sport utility
vehicle factory in Janesville, Wis., two small-car factories in
Lansing, Mich., and a Cadillac factory in Hamtramck, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials have said they would like to reopen all of their
assembly plants within a week, but outside experts predicted that
it could take 10 days to return to full production..
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ursomarso, the chairman of the GM section of the National
Automobile Dealers Association, said that many dealers might not
have a full selection of cars and trucks again until September.
Ursomarso's Pontiac and GMC dealership in Wilmington, Del., has
only 27 vehicles in stock, compared with a typical inventory of 125
vehicles before the strike. He predicted that once the assembly
plants reopened, it would be three weeks before he started to
receive new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jacobs, an automotive sales consultant in Rutherford,
N.J., said that GM's short-term market share, which was hovering
around 31 percent before the strike began, would not recover until
October. The company will announce its July sales next week.
</P>
<P>
   GM's long-term market share will most likely continue to drop
because of the automaker's inability to find a way to cut costs
more quickly. Ms. Jacobs said, ``I think they'll drop below 30 next
year and just trend down over the coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's board is scheduled to meet Monday to consider the company's
latest plans to improve its competitiveness by eliminating
unprofitable car models, closing factories and streamlining the
separate bureaucracies at divisions like Chevrolet, Buick and
Oldsmobile. But the odds of a drastic move affecting thousands of
workers seem to have faded. GM and UAW officials said that they had
not discussed factory closings, and GM has also promised to start
working more closely with the UAW, making any sudden move unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   GM could stop production of some unprofitable models, like the
Buick Riviera, without closing factories or affecting employment.
The UAW has expressed no opposition to such a limited move. GM may
also cut further its white-collar staff, much of which is not
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts were generally unimpressed with Tuesday's
settlement and predicted that GM would continue to lag behind more
efficient rivals like Ford and Chrysler, to say nothing of low-cost
producers in Japan and South Korea. Shares of GM edged down 12.5
cents today, to $74.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM doesn't get one step closer to where it needs to be on cost
and competitiveness,'' Ms. Keller, the analyst, said. ``If this is
what they get in two factories after 54 days of strikes, how are
they going to get this across the country?''

   At 90, many pipe organs are totally worn out or in a state of
advanced decrepitude. In Ocean Grove, N.J., on Thursday, there will
be a cake and a concert to celebrate the 90th birthday of the still
vital Hope Jones Pipe Organ, installed in the 6,000-seat Great
Auditorium in the Victorian days when the seaside resort was
established as a spiritual retreat. The organ has 10,000 pipes, 600
stops and 40,000 feet of pine and weighs 20 to 25 tons. The
resident organist, Gordon Turk, and the harpist Kathleen Bride will
play works by Bach, Handel and Grandjany.

   Nevertheless, many stars are aligned in films competing for the
Golden Lion from Sept. 3 to 13. Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth'' is in
the running, as are Tony Drazan's ``Hurlyburly,'' with Meg Ryan and
Sean Penn; Meryl Streep in Pat O'Connor's version of the hit play
``Dancing at Lughnasa''; Emmanuelle Beart and Sandrine Bonnaire in
Yves Angelo's ``Voleur de Vie,'' Catherine Deneuve in Nicole
Garcia's ``Place Vendome,'' and Emily Watson as the cellist
Jacqueline Du Pre in Anand Tucker's ``Jackie.''

   The Beatles &UR;  &LR; are coming back, all of them, in their youth and

acquired ``A Hard Day's Night'' and plans to release a restored
version of the 1964 Richard Lester film with digitally remastered
six-track stereo sound and additional scenes for its 35th
anniversary next March.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute black-and-white feature, which was nominated for
two Academy Awards, tells a fanciful tale of a day in the life of
the Fab Four. Among the songs in the film are ``A Hard Day's

   ``Tosca'' is big in Rome. Literally. What is trumpeted as the
world's largest advertising poster has been unveiled by the
advertising agency Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in the circular Piazza del
Popolo in the heart of Rome. The poster is 913 feet long and 6 1/2
feet high and promotes the Teatro dell'Opera's summer staging of
the Puccini work.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind this outsize gesture? This ``Tosca'' is being
staged in Rome's Olympic stadium, more often home to soccer
partisans. Therefore, the poster, created by the Italian Pop artist
Marco Lodola and consisting of 30 panels that tell the story of the
opera, also shows opera devotees displaying their enthusiasm as
soccer fans do, with banners emblazoned with slogans like ``Support
Puccini'' and ``100 Percent Tosca.''

   &UR; TINA BROWN JUMPED GUN ON MURDOCH MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tina Brown &LR; 's final New Yorker issue, which was last week's,
included a much-talked-about excerpt from  &UR; John Bayley &LR; 's memoir
about his wife  &UR; Iris Murdoch &LR; 's Alzheimer's disease. The English
novelist Murdoch is a well-known intellectual, and the piece caused
much buzz in literary circles. Its publication in the New Yorker
may also have cost the author $100,000, says the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London had bought rights from the London publisher,
Duckworth, to be first to publish an excerpt. Brown had bought
rights from the book's American publisher, St. Martin's, which was
to publish the book in January, four months after it would appear
in England. When Duckworth heard that Brown, apparently looking for
some final splash, was going to publish the piece last week rather
than in the fall, as planned, the publisher threatened legal action
to stop her.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was unsuccessful. Last week, after the New Yorker
came out, the London Telegraph ran a 1,500-word summary of the
excerpt, pretty much ruining the Times's plans. ``It would be fair
to say this will cost John Bayley something,'' Duckworth's
 &UR; Robin Baird-Smith &LR;  told the Post.

   The New York Times News Service has moved the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Aug. 2,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (`e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-FILMS (Hong Kong) _ As recently as eight years ago,
Hong Kong was second only to Hollywood in exporting movies, and
Hong Kong films were among the most exciting things happening in
cinema. Talented directors were casting charismatic stars in movies
that were by turns stylishly violent, breathtakingly magical,
beautifully tender or silly kung-fu comedies. Slowly, Hong
Kong-style art direction, action choreography and even plot
elements began to appear in American films. Today, audiences here
are flocking to Hollywood films, especially ones filled with
special effects, and ignoring ones made in Hong Kong. By Neil
Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ Attendance at American art museums
is skyrocketing, but upstairs in the director's office, the desk
chair is often unoccupied and an eerie silence prevails. At last
count, there were about 20 openings for directors at prominent
museums, and trustees are insisting, with only partial
exaggeration, that they can't find anyone for the job. By Deborah
Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS and VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   RYAN-FILM-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ Though the landmark film event
that is Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' opened last
weekend to strong attendance and critical cartwheels, it also set
off a flurry of talk-show trepidations. Worries spread about the
violence level in this already famously harrowing World War II
epic. By Janet Maslin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BENOIT-JACQUOT-FILMS (New York) _ Benoit Jacquot is not about to
write his autobiography. ``I'm not interested in recounting my life
through my films,'' the famously reticent French director said
recently. ``I'd rather they teach me something about my life.'' His
presence in his work is close to transparent: a finely tuned eye
and intelligence, focused on the intricate, oblique entanglements
of human beings. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MINNIE-DRIVER-FILMS (New York) _ Minnie Driver is equally at
home telling an off-color joke or spelling Aeschylus correctly on a
crossword puzzle, as she did recently in a rare moment of repose at
a midtown Manhattan hotel. The British actress, 27, who has made a
career for herself in the United States in hit movies like ``Big
Night,'' ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' and ``Good Will Hunting,''
displays a dizzying array of attributes: she's intellectual and
earthy, statuesque and spirited. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Some film reviews and their suitability
for children. This week: ``Mark Twain's America in 3-D''; ``The
Parent Trap''; ``There's Something About Mary''; ``Mafia!''
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   VIEWPOINTS-DANCE (Undated) _ Invented in the 1970s by two dance
choreographers, Mary Overlie and Wendall Beavers, Viewpoints has
recently become part of the contentious debate currently going on
in America about actor training. In the last five years, there has
been an explosion of interest in new ways to train American actors.
Some people in the theater believe the itch to explore different
theories is a reaction to the longtime dominance of the Method,
preached by the controversial teacher Lee Strasberg, who died in
1982. By Rachel Shteir. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN-SYMPHONY (Undated) _ Many things about the Russian
Symphony Orchestra seem to resonate of formative youth. The
ensemble was organized just six years ago, and the average age of
its members is 25. But to judge from a collection of exceptionally
well-produced recordings, the sapling Russian Symphony might be as
old as its musical roots. Indeed, the youth of its players is
belied by an intensity, insight and precision that usually come
with more years on stage than most of these musicians have lived.
By Lawrence B. Johnson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DON-GIOVANNI-OPERA (Aix-En-Provence, France) _ Peter Brook's
production of ``Don Giovanni'' is at the Festival Internationale
d'Art Lyrique this summer. Brook gives us not much of a production
at all: a few benches on the big courtyard stage of the
Archbishop's Palace, the Don in a vanilla suit and Panama hat, his
colleagues in street clothes and party dresses. Yet Mozart has been
treated exceptionally well: not with visual effects or theatrical
coups that draw us into the events, but by an attempt to look at
the opera's people from the inside out. By Bernard Holland.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ST.-FRANCIS-OPERA (Undated) _ In the 15 years since its
premiere, Olivier Messiaen's opera ``St. Francois d'Assise'' has,
like a classic of older times, gone on growing through repeated
performances. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-DRUMMER (New York) _ In barely a decade, the percussionist
Leon Parker has gone from stints with the pianist Kenny Barron to a
chair in the pianist Jacky Terrasson's fine trio to a major label
contract. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-COMPOSERS (New York) _ The last quarter century has seen
the emergence of female composers as serious professionals. Opera
and the bigger forms of `serious music' require both practical
experience and real opportunity to learn (and earn) from
performance, as Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, the Pulitzer Prize winning
composer of large scale instrumental works, points out. It has been
easier for women to compose pop. But successful women are often
more readily co-opted by commercial forces than men. By Albert
Innaurato. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-FILMS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Hollywood-crazed collectors
have long been willing to pay handsomely for original props like
Dorothy's red shoes. But reproductions of collectibles? Chronicle
Books, a medium-size San Francisco publishing house, is betting
that there is a market out there for such items, and somewhat
closer to earth than the Tatooine desert. Chronicle has just issued
``Star Wars Scrapbook: The Essential Collection,'' by Stephen J.
Sansweet, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is
revered by other collectors for having one of the world's largest
collections of ``Star Wars'' memorabilia. By James Barron. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   SHOCK-ART (New York) _ With art, there are three forms of shock:
the shock of recognition, the shock at something merely appalling
and the shock of the new. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   ITALIAN-GESTURES-TV (Undated) _ In the documentary ``The
Italian-Americans II: A Beautiful Song,'' which has its premiere on
Tuesday at 8 p.m. on WLIW, Nick Stellino, a New York cookbook
author of Italian descent, describes the way he and family members
used hand gestures when speaking to one another. By Warren Berger.

 &HT;    Parental Bounty Hunters
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Candy Williams used to hound her ex-husband about
child support. Even so, the money sometimes didn't come.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May 1996, the 28-year-old Decatur hairstylist saw a
television ad for Child Support Network, a collection agency in
Phoenix, and gave the company a call. Within a month CSN had begun
collecting payments.
</P>
<P>
   Now Williams gets monthly checks for $162.50 like clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Like other private agencies that specialize in tracking down
deadbeat parents, CSN takes a hefty cut of what it collects _ as
much as 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them taking out something, to me, is better than me not
getting anything at all,'' she says. ``They took the pressure off
of me. I don't have to even question him about whether he's going
to send me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is one of many parents who have resorted to collection
agencies to enforce child support orders. Local governments have
departments to do the job, but with huge caseloads and a limited
number of workers, they end up letting many nonpaying parents
slide. In DeKalb County, where Williams lives, child support
prosecutors have up to 1,500 cases apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, collection agencies take only cases that will
likely turn a profit for them. Austin, Texas-based Child Support
Enforcement Co. won't even bother with monthly payments, limiting
its services to tracking parents who owe at least $5,000 in back
support. Its collectors handle no more than 350 clients apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The collectors pursue nonpaying parents with the diligence of
bounty hunters.
</P>
<P>
   They conduct background checks to determine where the nonpaying
parent works, how much he earns, what kind of car he drives, what
assets he holds and where he banks. Armed with that information,
they approach the wayward parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we make that first phone call we don't have to listen to
the nonsense excuses,'' says Casey Hoffman, CSE's founder and
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work the cases ... consistently. We work them efficiently.
You really don't have to be a rocket scientist to determine why we
are successful,'' adds Hoffman, who ran the Texas child support
enforcement agency before founding CSE.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Jacobson, president of CSN, says his company locates 90
percent of the nonpaying parents in its case files and collects
from half of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tenacious,'' Jacobson says. ``It's not a matter of if
they're going to pay, it's when they're going to pay.'' When the
company fails, he says, it's because a parent has no job, no
unemployment benefits and no property.
</P>
<P>
   He cites another metro Atlanta case: In February, a Stone
Mountain woman complained that her son's father had given her only
two $150 checks in the past 15 years. Three months later, CSN sent
her a check for $27,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone's applauding, however.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Collins, coordinator of the Georgia chapter of the
Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, thinks parents
are better off collecting through the government, no matter how
long it takes. She thinks collection agencies are a rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not concerned about the children. If they were, they
would only charge 5 (percent) to 10 percent,'' Collins says.
</P>
<P>
   (That criticism might also apply to parents who get behind in
their payments until collectors force the issue. For his part,
though, James Williams doesn't seem to mind that his ex-wife
receives only $162.50 of the $250 he sends CSN each month for his
son.
</P>
<P>
   (``I don't have a problem with it,'' he says. ``That's what she
chose to do, so she'll have to live with it.'')
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Collins' solution is that, though governments
do in fact charge only small fees to enforce child support orders,
the wheels of officialdom move slowly. In 1996, more than $1.2
billion in uncollected support was owed to 788,000 Georgia kids,
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Nationally that year, 30 million children were owed more than $41
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has enacted several recent measures to make it easier
for parents to collect. One mandates that states take monthly
payments directly from a noncustodial parent's paycheck, even if
there is no history of late or delinquent payments. The only
exceptions: if both parties agree to waive the deduction, or if it
would be in the child's best interest to collect the money some
other way.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent law requires businesses with more than 25
employees to put the names of all new hires in a nationwide
computer system, making it harder for noncustodial parents to hide
their income.
</P>
<P>
   And a federal law that went into effect this year requires
states to enforce child support orders granted in other states. In
the past, if a noncustodial parent moved to another state, a new
court order had to be issued from that state.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the new enforcement tools, 80 percent of clients who
turn to government to collect child support never receive a dime,
creating an opportunity for private collection agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies seem to have friends in Congress, which is
dominated by Republicans, many of whom support privatization of
government functions. CSE's Hoffman got a favorable reception in
May when he testified before a House Ways and Means subcommittee,
arguing that businesses such as his should have better access to
government records on nonpaying parents.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Johnson, managing attorney of the Clayton, DeKalb and
Gwinnett offices of Atlanta Legal Aid Society, thinks that for some
parents, private collectors fill a need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have occasionally told clients you might as well try one of
those places,'' Johnson says. ``I view that as sort of a last
resort, because I think in a perfect world a person shouldn't have
to give up a third of the money that was awarded to their kids just
to get it collected.

HOUSE REJECTS BID TO KILL SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House turned back another attempt to kill the
international space station Wednesday, with 323 members voting to
continue funding the NASA-run project, now costing more than 12
times the original $8 billion estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Only 109 members voted to eliminate the $2.1 billion budgeted
next year for the orbiting laboratory. But many more members who
ended up voting against the amendment that would have killed it
said they were running out of patience with the cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   The project includes 16 nations, spearheaded by the United
States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas,
complained about Russia's lack of a substantial financial
commitment and its failure thus far to build and deliver on time
the propulsion module for the project. He called on the president
to support the removal of Russia as a full partner in the space
station, saying that ``inaction'' by NASA and the administration in
addressing the problem would only increase the costs to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   When it was authorized in 1984 by President Reagan, the cost of
the space station was estimated at $8 billion. Today the estimate
is $98 billion and growing, according to critics such as Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., and Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind. Both men have been
offering annual amendments for several years in attempts to kill
the project, which supporters insist is needed to conduct important
``medical and disease-curing research'' and other work that would
lead to advances in new technologies and products.
</P>
<P>
   A killer amendment offered by Bumpers was defeated by the Senate
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   During debate in the House on the project, Rep. Nick Lampson,
D-Texas, summed up the view of supporters by arguing that Americans
are willing to spend the money necessary to continue manned space
flight and research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe it to millions of Americans who could benefit from
future medical advances to continue funding, rather than gutting,
the international space station,'' Lampson told his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say that the same research supporters talk
about can be accomplished just as well on Earth They say the cost
overruns would be better spent on more earth-bound research
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody had told us that the space station was going to
cost this much, we wouldn't have voted for it,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass.

 The playwright Albert Innaurato writes frequently about music.  
 By ALBERT INNAURATO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who's this thing by _ Ally McBeal?'' asked the cabby,
dropping off a group of men in front of the John Jay College
Theater in midtown Manhattan. There were regiments of women
flooding in to see ``Patience and Sarah,'' presented by the Lincoln
Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he was told, ``it's an opera by Paula Kimper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An opera by a lady?'' the cabby said. ``Women! You can't get
away from them your whole life, and now they're taking over
opera!''
</P>
<P>
   Taking over is putting it strongly, but the last quarter century
has seen the emergence of female composers as serious
professionals. Judith Weir has blossomed in the 90s with ``Blond
Eckbert'' (just recorded), ``A Night at the Chinese Opera'' and
``The Vanishing Bridegroom,'' and composers like Sofia Gubaidulina
and Kaija Saariaho have made international reputations.
</P>
<P>
   This trend is even more remarkable in pop, in which women play
solo or front bands and hence enjoy a greater autonomy than a
classical composer dependent upon a symphony orchestra. Lilith
Fair, a tour organized by the Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah
McLaughlan and run totally by and for women, has been unexpectedly
popular the last two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimper's work, words by Wendy Persons, was an event of
sorts. The two title characters are women who fall unabashedly and
sexually in love. After the first act, young gay women were roaming
the lobby shrilling in falsetto, making fun of opera voices;
they're more at home with Melissa Etheridge or perhaps Queen
Latifah. ``Oh, Zena, I love you!'' intoned one clasping a program
to her chest as if shot by an arrow. ``Worry not, Gabrielle,''
warbled her companion, who, though probably 18, had an impressive
dramatic soprano, ``Zena's here, never fear, I'll get that arrow
out of you, dear!''
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing them, several of the men present seemed uncomfortable.
``Feels a little like the Bacchae,'' said one. Yet at the end of
the third act, there was a soaring affirmation in this music of the
transcendent beauty of life and love, regardless of sexuality or
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience _ men and women _ jumped to their feet
and screamed. That's not impressive merely because a woman composed
it; that's just good opera.
</P>
<P>
   There was an Eve of opera _ though for a long time her
contribution was erased from the history books. In the 1630s, the
earliest days of the form, the beauteous Barbara Strozzi sang her
own arias to the delight of the Venetian Academy. Singing as a way
of surviving for female composers still holds true, right up to Ani
DiFranco and Lisa Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   Signora Strozzi was an heiress, the adopted daughter of the
influential librettist Giulio Strozzi. She studied with the great
composer Francesco Cavalli (who worshiped her). Her wonderful and
often daring settings of texts from operas demonstrate a big
talent, far beyond the short dance forms favored by her male
colleagues. The vicious satires published about her effectively
caused her to rein in her large-scale ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Opera and the bigger forms of ``serious music'' require both
practical experience and real opportunity to learn (and earn) from
performance, as Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
composer of large-scale instrumental works, points out.
</P>
<P>
   It has been easier for women to compose pop. But successful
women are often more readily co-opted by commercial forces than men
are. There are sad, even tragic stories about significant figures
like Laura Nyro and Joni Mitchell who for all their success had to
fight the record industry to stay viable.
</P>
<P>
   With all respect to the estimable Ned Rorem and the magnificent
Francis Poulenc, it could be argued Mitchell is one of the great
song composers of the 20th century, more impressive for writing her
own words. Like Franz Schubert's, her music erupts from a deeply
felt, idiosyncratic emotional life, outside the mainstream.
Schubert was probably a homosexual. Both his great song cycles,
``Winterreise'' and ``Die Schoene Mullerin,'' and the majority of
his songs to poems by others deal with blighted love.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell, a fiercely independent woman long before the
Baptists felt it necessary to remind us that women are subject to
men, has also fought battles over validation.
</P>
<P>
   Schubert deliberately plays with conventional forms and
accompaniments (like the Alberti bass) only to shock the ear with
unprepared changes and shifts. Ms. Mitchell, with a finely judged
irony, uses the conventions of blues, rock and folk to add bite and
surprise to her songs.
</P>
<P>
   She's not as daring as Schubert harmonically, but has fought to
achieve liberation not just from men but from the inhibiting chord
progressions of most successful pop.
</P>
<P>
   Nyro, who died in near-obscurity last year, had her personal
problems, but they were surely exacerbated by having to contend
with a music business unsympathetic to women's concerns. Female
rappers and rockers of all kinds still come up against
old-fashioned male power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if the fantastically talented
Paula Cole is co-opted by the corporate world now that one of her
songs has become the theme song for the hugely popular television
series ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace can be just as stern a censor of artistic
ambitions as the church or an absolutist state once was, and if a
composer has to contend with the prejudices of a male-dominated
musical world, as well, so much the worse for her.
</P>
<P>
   The enormously gifted Tracy Chapman refused to depart from her
thorny political muse and has had to struggle to keep from being
marginalized. Still, where a singer can sing her own songs on a
permanent document like an LP or a CD, there is always hope. No
musician reading the scores for Laura Nyro's songs would realize
just from the notes how original and magical a cantata like ``New
York Tendaberry'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Classical composers must trust conductors (still overwhelmingly
male) to make sense of marks on a page. ``We have to be able to
manipulate symbols in various languages, number systems and keys,''
Ms. Zwilich says. ``There are three different systems of tuning in
every symphony orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For many years it was seriously argued that women lacked the
cranial resources to compose ``serious'' music. Studies in left
brain and right brain differences appeared to suggest that men were
``naturally'' more adept at mathematical thinking _ crucial in
larger musical forms, just as in the sciences, while women were
better at verbal, immediately emotional expression.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zwilich just laughs at such notions. ``In fact,'' she says,
``anyone of either sex soon finds out the male numbers theories of
composition are all very simple-minded when compared to the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such male theorists and teachers were evidently ignorant of the
larger-scale works by the genius Lili Boulanger, younger sister of
the famous pedagogue Nadia (who nurtured generations of American
male composers including Aaron Copland).
</P>
<P>
   Lili was only 24 when she died in 1918, after an agonizing
battle with Crohn's disease. In the immense ``Du Fond de l'Abime,''
her taut logic is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in many primitive cultures it is women who are in
charge of music, particularly that of lament. Anthropologists like
Constantina-Nadia Seremetakis and Gail Holst-Warhaft have studied
the ways women create, sing and pass on the songs and poetry of
lament as men stand around uncomfortably and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the original version of the Gospel of Mark,
thought by most scholars to be the first one written, ends not with
Resurrection but with women lamenting.
</P>
<P>
   Western music has its origins in what is called the Visitatio
sepulchri _ sung dialogues concerning the three Marys visiting the
tomb of Christ. But Mark was redacted to emphasize the physical
Resurrection to bring it into line with later Gospels.
</P>
<P>
   Women were crucial in spreading Christianity, but the
misogynistic rantings of the early church ``fathers'' eventually
robbed them of any leading role in the church. Once Christianity
became a state religion, the suppression of women was enforced by
law.
</P>
<P>
   Since secular Western music evolved from church practice, women
were relegated to limited participation in all aspects of society.
To be sure, there were exceptions like the 12th-century abbess
Hildegard von Bingen, who celebrated the ecstatic union with
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The baby boomers have changed all this. ``Classical'' composers
were freed by the multimedia artist Laurie Anderson, a remarkable
and individual voice, a composer in a different sense than the term
had been understood before, a performer and conceptualizer unafraid
of the most alien terrain. Her influence, direct and indirect, can
be felt in the work of remarkable experimentalists like Pauline
Oliveros and Eve Beglarian, even in techno pop and the trance music
from raves.
</P>
<P>
   Female composers have learned a lesson from men: charity begins
at home. Lilith Fair will play 57 North American dates through Aug.
31. Listeners can encounter the vast range of women creating in all
styles from Paula Cole and Emmylou Harris to Dead Girls and Other
Stories to Erykah Badu.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts are dizzyingly jubilant, insanely inventive and
transporting, just what most classical concerts are not.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zwilich, composer in residence at Carnegie Hall, underwrites
a prize given by the International Association for Women Composers
for a female composer under the age of 21. Next season, the New
York Philharmonic will devote a week to the Russian composer Sofia
Gubaidulina.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zwilich, a much-admired mentor of composers of both sexes,
is careful to insist that the problems of getting heard and making
a living afflict everyone who tries to compose, and always have.
She's aware that it's easier for women today than in the time of
the gifted Mrs. H.H.A. Beech or the eccentric Ethel Smyth.
Nonetheless, she remains cautious: ``After a battle, a treaty
usually gets signed, so maybe there's peace for a time. That
doesn't mean the war is over!''

BASEBALL UNION GETS BOOST FROM SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a proposal that would help reduce the possibility of a
strike, Major League Baseball players would, for the first time
since 1922, have the right to sue owners under legislation unveiled
in the US Senate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement among Senate leaders and Major League Baseball
owners and players would be a major change in baseball's
controversial 76-year-old antitrust exemption. It would put
baseball players on the same footing as athletes in other major
sports when it comes to the ultimate legal recourse in settling
disputes with owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress may not be able to solve every problem or heal
baseball's self-inflicted wounds,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy,
a Vermont Democrat. ``But we can pass legislation that will declare
that professional baseball can no longer operate outside the law as
it applies to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the proposal became possible when both the
players' union and commissioner Bud Selig sent senators a letter of
agreement on the proposed language in the legislation. It was also
boosted when it was agreed among the parties that the minor
leagues, represented by the National Association of Professional
Baseball Leagues Inc., would continue to be exempt from antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress adopts this agreement,'' said Donald M. Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Association, ``it will be a significant step toward minimizing the
labor discord and disruptions in play that have plagued our
national pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have long complained that they had no leverage if the
owners moved, as they did in 1994, to unilaterally impose the
provisions of an expired contract. In both the National Football
League and the National Basketball Association, players can sue
under antitrust law when such conditions are imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball players have never had that,'' said Steve Fehr, chief
legal counsel to the Major League Baseball Players Association.
``Not having that recourse has exacerbated the tensions many of us
have always felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Fehr, Donald's brother, said that in 1994, for example, if the
baseball owners had succeeded in breaking the union, the players
could then have taken the owners to court under antitrust law, with
fairly easy access to remedies like injunctions and back-to-work
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is enacted to law, this is a big step forward,'' Steve
Fehr said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has been considering changes in
baseball's antitrust exemption since the bitterly divisive players'
strike of 1994 that resulted in the cancellation of the World
Series for the first time _ a strike that resulted in lower
attendance and television viewership, which baseball continues to
recoup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me that the existence of an antitrust exemption
contributed negatively to those developments,'' Leahy said. ``That
was a low point in the history of baseball and one from which it is
only now recovering.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the Judiciary
Committee and announced the accord in Washington with Leahy, has
for years pushed for changes in the exemption. Hatch has sponsored
the so-called Curt Flood Act, named for the late major leaguer who
pressed an assault on Major League Baseball's reserve clause, which
had bound players to teams for life.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed agreement would remove one of the last obstacles to
passage of the legislation, which has been pending for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fans are returning to the ballparks, they deserve to know
that players will be on the field, not mired in labor disputes,''
Hatch said. ``I am pleased that Congress will, it now appears, be
able to help guarantee that this is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi has indicated that
he favors the proposal, and they expressed confidence Congress will
pass it in September after returning from the summer recess.

IN TONY GREENWICH, A WEALTH OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST POWERBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ In a tony town where many residents have
already won life's lottery, a Powerball frenzy has drawn flocks of
out-of-state optimists bearing not just traffic jams and litter
piles, but a world that locals say has gone from novel to scary.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Interstate exit and the first train station over
the Connecticut border for New Yorkers hoping to buy their slim
chance at the world's largest jackpot, Greenwich became ground zero
this week for a pastime that is thoroughly alien to most well-to-do
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this morning, I thought it was PowerBOWL,'' Lisa C.
Gentil confessed as she headed for her architect's office in her
silver Mercedes-Benz sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Greenwich is a place where the wrong side of the
tracks means new money instead of old. Many of the taxis are
Mercedes-Benzes, wallpaper is sold not in a store but in a gallery,
and the main drag is regulated by white-gloved officers instead of
stop lights.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Powerball. The six-number tickets are sold in the
District of Columbia, Connecticut and 19 other states _ but not in
New York or New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Each night this week, the boutique-lined streets of Greenwich
have been packed with clunkers from the boroughs _ with some
drivers going the wrong way, forcing the Land Rovers to screech and
dodge. The previously pristine sidewalks now resemble the floor of
a theater after a double feature, and the restaurants have been
empty because regulars have been afraid to go out or have not be
able to find a place to park. After the lottery machines are shut
off at 11 p.m., scalpers roam Greenwich Avenue, hawking their
tickets with come-ons like, ``How many? Got plenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the hours before the drawing for the
quarter-billion-dollar jackpot, which if unclaimed would balloon
further, the town fathers wrote to state officials to ask that
Greenwich be allowed to secede from Powerball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Town of Greenwich has been under siege from an
uncontrollable force,'' First Selectman Tom Ragland, who is the
equivalent of mayor, wrote to state lottery officials. ``If there
is not a declared winner, the Town of Greenwich is respectfully
requesting the Connecticut Lottery Corporation to shut down all of
the lottery machines in Greenwich no later than 7 a.m. Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   If the state refused, Ragland said he would shut the game down
himself, using his emergency powers in the interest of what he
called ``the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the
Town of Greenwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there has been cause for concern among town officials.
Town police said they responded this week to 300 reports of
disorderly conduct, plus a smattering of people urinating in public
or causing fender-benders by gawking at the Powerball lines. A
roving squad of 15 officers has moved from store to store at
closing time to make sure the disappointed people who were left in
line kept their disappointment to themselves. When a shoving match
broke out at Greenwich Cigar and Stationery, sirens wailed and two
dozen officers rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The toll is fiscal as well as emotional. Town officials have
estimated Powerball has cost Greenwich nearly $100,000, most of it
for overtime for police officers and sanitation workers. The
Greenwich Police Department said every one of its 158 officers was
assigned to Powerball duty, with many working double shifts. The
Connecticut State Police sent 20 troopers to help keep order. Gov.
John G. Rowland announced Wednesday night that the state would
reimburse Greenwich for what he called its ``extraordinary costs,''
with details to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very likely that the town will have some time to
simmer down. Powerball officials said 94 percent of the possible
combinations were represented among the 200 million tickets sold,
making it likely that a winner was among them. Officials of the
Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs Powerball, said they
would know by early Thursday whether anyone had won. If not, the
jackpot would roll over to Saturday night and would grow by tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Greenwich's Powerball problem is not going away.
Powerball officials say their computer models indicate that under a
new game design introduced in November, a jackpot of at least $250
million can be expected to come up every two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   And very much against its will, Greenwich, population 58,000,
has become the Powerball capital of America: Connecticut was the
top state in sales for this drawing, and Connecticut's top eight
Powerball retailers are all in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   The Powerball invasion may be the most action Greenwich has seen
since the Revolutionary War, when British troops raided homes and
farms for seven deadly years. With the construction of a rail line
in 1848, the town became a summer resort for rich New Yorkers, who
built huge estates and entertained lavishly. The population swelled
again after World War II with corporate types who made the town
their home.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 Census, the per-person income of $46,000
in Greenwich was more than twice the figure for the state. Now,
residents say they fear becoming known as ``the North Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can these people ignore it when it's $20 million, and then
be so retarded as to line up here in the 98-degree heat?'' asked
Melissa J. Bariere, 33, the owner of a furniture gallery called
Painted. ``I just want to drive by and scream, `You're not going to
win!'''
</P>
<P>
   Few residents of Greenwich admit to playing the game. No one,
though, is more eager for a winner to be declared. Curvin O'Rielly,
an advertising consultant who lives and works in Greenwich, was
approached by one of the ticket buyers flooding the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said in a New Jersey accent, `Where's the nearest Powerball
outlet?''' O'Rielly recalled. ``I said `Exit 14' _ way up the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles F. Strutt, the executive director of the Multi-State
Lottery Association, which is based in Iowa, acknowledged that
Greenwich was in a tough situation, although he did point out, ``A
wealthy population wanting a sleepy town next to New York City is
an odd mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Strutt said the association's board would meet soon to consider
caps on jackpots, self-service lottery terminals and other ways to
tame Powerball-mania.
</P>
<P>
   Such gestures are unlikely to quell the Powerball backlash in
Greenwich, however. Signs urging residents to ``Boycott Powerball
Stores'' have sprouted around town, and a State Representative and
the Chamber of Commerce held a packed forum at Town Hall tonight so
business owners could vent their fury.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Trilnick, the owner of Cafe Rue, a French-Argentine
restaurant, sent a call-to-arms to fellow merchants that included
the declaration: ``Invaders from neighboring states are swarming
our streets. They are tireless and determined, overwhelming our
public servants with their persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   These desperate times call for desperate measures. Until last
week, the Police Department would dispatch an officer to
investigate a stolen lawnmower, broken window or toppled mailbox.
Because of the Powerball strain, the police have begun asking
residents to go to the station to lodge such reports.

THOMAS DEFENDS CONSERVATIVE STANCE TO LAWYERS GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in an
extraodinary, sweeping attack on his critics, defended Wednesday
his right to hold conservative views, and dismissed as ``silly''
the idea that his opinions are molded by some ``ideological Pied
Piper'' among his white court colleages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to state I'm a man, free to think for myself,'' Thomas
said in a speech to the nation's largest association of black
lawyers and judges, the National Bar Association. ``I'm a judge not
consigned to assert the opinions of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The justice, who appeared at the convention despite the open
hostility of some of its most prominent members, also made an
emotional appeal for reconciliation between the association and the
nation's most prominent black jurist and conservative _ Clarence
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it time to move on...to realize that being angry with me
is no solution?'' Thomas said. ``Isn't it time that we respect
ourselves and each other as we have demanded respect from others?''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he sought an end to animosity, Thomas offered an
unapologetic defense of his controversial court opinions on
affirmative action and other subjects as the product of his
reasoning rather than his race.
</P>
<P>
   He emphatically rejected the notion that ``I have no right to
think the way I do because I'm black.'' And he caustically wondered
if some who criticize his views have ever read his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but wonder whether some of my critics can read,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a political climate where ``some go so far as to all
but define each of us by race and to establish the range of our
thinking and our opinions by our color,'' Thomas said he had long
been free of ``racial identity problems'' and had no need for
blacks or ``anyone telling me who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said some whites, in particular, had ``elevated
condescension to an art form by advancing a monolithic view of
blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly offensive in that regard, Thomas said, is the
notion that he doesn't think for himself but merely echoes the
views of the white conservative justices, particularly Antonin
Scalia, whom he frequently votes with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stench of racial inferiority still confounds my olfactory
nerves,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, only the second black man ever to serve on the high
court, did not disarm his audience _ there was little applause but
also few boos. He did, however, earn the grudging respect of some.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke from the heart,'' said National Bar Association
President Randy Jones, a federal prosecutor in San Diego. ``He's a
man who's not afraid to come into the lion's den and face his
detractors and critics. I think we all have to respect him for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas, who joined the court in 1991, did provoke a few
chuckles when he noted that the Supreme Court is ``not infallible,
just final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of us can claim infallibility, even from the
overwhelming advantage of hindsight. This makes it all the more
important that fallible ideas be examined in a resonable manner and
not as some doctrinal or racial heresy.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance at a luncheon meeting of nearly 1,000 black
lawyers, judges and law professors had triggered opposition from
the time the event was announced. After an effort to disinvite him
failed, some were believed prepared to walk out on his address.
</P>
<P>
   Few did. Before his speech, hecklers in the ornate lobby of the
Peabody Hotel were making placards branding Thomas as a
``traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas was finishing his lunch, he heard Judge Shelvin Hall
of Chicago,the new chairwoman of the group's judicial conference,
say that the National Bar Association was ``offended'' by the
presence of a guest who ``would willfully destroy the purposes'' of
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was murdered a few blocks from the
convention hotel 30 years ago, and Thurgood Marshall, Thomas' black
predecessor on the court. Referring to the invitation to Thomas,
she said, ``The NBA has broken my heart and the heart of the NBA
has been broken.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to defuse the situation, D'Army Bailey, a local
judge who originally extended the invitation to Thomas, drew a
metaphor from Memphis in the days following the King assassination.
In the midst of racial turbulence, he said, ``We learned the
importance of talking to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey invited those who might want to leave to do so before
Thomas began his speech. Only a half-dozen departed. The vast
majority who stayed in the ballroom gave Thomas a respectful
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The culture in Washington encourages ``the tendency to
personalize differences,'' Thomas told the group, ``and I have been
singled out for particularly bilious and venomous assault.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he welcomed ``constructive'' arguments, but warned that
``criticism of the court goes beyond the bounds of civil debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas did not address his opposition to affirmative action
except to say that ``any effort, policy or program'' founded on the
presumption that ``blacks are inferior is a non-starter with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he elaborate on any of ther other positions,
particularly on criminal justice topics, that have drawn the ire of
much of the black legal community.
</P>
<P>
   But he did object strenuously to those who took his dissent in
one case to imply that ``I supported the beating of prisoners.''
Thomas said his opponents had to be ``either illiterate or fraught
with malice'' to make that argument.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who rarely makes public appearances, described his
passage from an angry black militant in the days following King's
death to become a jurist embracing conservative beliefs he once
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   He said he appreciated ``the comforts of racial solidarity,''
the feeling by blacks that they must stick together in the face of
bigotry and ``frustrations with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has moved to his own destiny, Thomas said. Referring to a
fictional character in Richard Wright's novel, ``Native Son,''
Thomas said he had ``contained his anger'' as a black man to avoid
``suffering the fate of Bigger Thomas,'' the novel's protagonist
who is consumed by racial animosity and dies in a rampage.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ ``Look, the human rights here in Nigeria are
terrible,'' Theodore Luttwak says, ``but the opportunities are just
fantastic. Tell me, where else in the world do you have so much
money?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Abuja, Nigeria's capital-under-construction, is
full of the whiff of oil money, and not just at the exclusive golf
course said to absorb 25 percent of the city's water supply just to
keep the greens smooth. Luttwak _ ``just call me Teddy'' _ is out
to get his share of the $10 billion that Nigeria earns each year
from oil.
</P>
<P>
   His logic is simple enough. The military officers who have ruled
Africa's most populous nation for two decades, and siphoned off a
good share of its oil revenue, are busy building vast mansions on
their Abuja real estate. They want gold-inlaid basins for their
bathrooms and Jacuzzi baths, sophisticated water purifiers and huge
quantities of Italian marble that Luttwak is busy importing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man from the national petroleum company just gave me
$100,000 only for the marble in his house,'' Luttwak said. ``My
company started three years ago, and I'm now the major importer of
Italian marble. This is Africa's land of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it is a surprise to find the older brother of Edward
Luttwak, a former defense policy adviser to the Reagan
administration and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, hustling imported marble in
Abuja, Nigeria. But then this place is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the National Human Rights Commission _
``created by presidential decree.'' It is just off Sani Abacha Way,
a prominent avenue named after the late dictator whose flouting of
human rights, including the wholesale imprisonment of journalists
and execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, turned Nigeria into an
international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Or, not far from Luttwak's premises, the Sani Abacha Foundation,
a palatial enterprise whose aim, its prospectus says, is ``to
immortalize the name, ideas and achievement of Gen. Sani Abacha in
relation to his efforts in promoting peace, unity, conflict
resolution and the universal brotherhood of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Abacha plundered Nigeria with single-minded zeal during his
nearly five years in power before his abrupt death, apparently from
a heart attack, in June.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Maryam, was recently stopped trying to leave the
country on a flight bound for Saudi Arabia with eight suitcases
full of cash. Western officials estimate that the late general may
have more than $3 billion stashed away in overseas bank accounts,
the sort of sum that Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire took decades to
accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   All this, for Teddy Luttwak, is no surprise. He deals every day
with ``the Nigerian factor'' _ the bribes needed to get anything
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha was tremendously corrupt, more than than any mafia you
can imagine,'' he said. ``The general took a share in every
contract, everybody, everything. He was a ruthless warrior. But the
fact is, you probably do need a soft-spoken dictator here.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Transylvania in 1939, Luttwak has a scar on his head
from the years of Nazi oppression. A postwar move to Italy brought
fortune and fame in the plastics industry, notably in the
production of plastic beach balls, but the good times ended when he
was kidnapped and held for ransom in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   While his brother Edward made his way in Israel and the United
States, Luttwak, an Italian citizen, eventually washed up on
Nigeria's shores, where he has been wheeling and dealing for two
decades. A day spent at his company Pated _ ``mirror polished
granites and marbles at very, very, very, very competitive prices''
_ is instructive in the ways of this country.
</P>
<P>
   As Luttwak, sweat glistening on his brow, blue eyes gleaming,
rushes around his premises looking for a driver to make a huge
marble delivery to the northern city of Kano, in walks Ahmud
Agberankhe. He is 34 and has a university degree in physics. He
works for Nigerian Radio for a monthly salary of about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Agberankhe's assignment for the day is to work on a jingle for
an advertisement for Pated, which is looking to hire salesmen to be
paid on commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s a graduate like me could have a car,'' Agberankhe
lamented as he played a proposed jingle focused on the ``very,
very, very, very competitive prices'' for Luttwak. ``But now it's
difficult to make ends meet. You have the knowledge, but there are
no openings. If you strive, you should be given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of downwardly mobile Nigerians like
Agberankhe whose chances of making it have evaporated as this
potentially rich country has succumbed to sweeping decay,
mismanagement and corruption on a scale so vast that it has made
people despair of a fair reward for a fair day's work. Per capita
income here is now a quarter of what it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why work for a pittance when you see a military man making $10
million a month because he has the power to award contracts?'' an
architect in Luttwak's office said. ``What's the motivation?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The architect was particularly unhappy because he had just spent
a substantial share of his monthly salary of about $400 on
black-market gasoline, often the only kind available in a country
that is one of the world's largest producers of oil and the
fifth-largest supplier to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Luttwak, 59, is used to bending the rules to get ahead in his
adopted land. He once spent several days in prison for refusing to
pay a bribe and has learned his lesson. He has a 28-year-old
Nigerian wife named Patience, who, formally speaking, is the owner
of the company. Under Nigerian law, majority ownership of
corporations must be in Nigerian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Handing out a Pated bill for about $100,000 to a messenger, he
let drop a few crumpled Nigerian naira notes. ``We are of course
aware of the `Nigerian factor,' and please tell your boss that we
are waiting for payment as soon as possible,'' Luttwak said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking on in admiration, and mild dismay, was Marino D'Ermo, a
major Italian marble producer, visiting Nigeria to examine the
business possibilities. ``Teddy is fantastic,'' D'Ermo said, ``and
the potential in this town is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the town in question is supposed to be home to a
democratic government by May 1999, under commitments made this
month by Nigeria's military rulers. If so, the boom in
marble-bedecked mansions could evaporate, but Luttwak is not
alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   As he sees it, a northern, Muslim ruling caste controls the
country through the military and is unlikely to be budged.
Disciplined, God-fearing and determined, this caste, for Luttwak,
stands in contrast to what he sees as an impossibly unruly south.
He is unconvinced that change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he is wasting no time. ``There is no tomorrow at
this company!'' he shouts at a worker who has made the mistake of
saying something will be done tomorrow. ``Tomorrow does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   To a sign maker, Luttwak complains that his proposals are not
gargantuan enough. ``I want this corner of Abuja to be called Pated
Marbles Plaza,'' he said. ``Whatever goes up has to be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has huge reserves of marble and granite. But, as in the
oil industry, mismanagement has led the domestic industry to ruin.
State-owned factories are idle. So Nigeria imports marble and
granite, just as it imports petroleum. And disaster for the
majority translates into opportunity for a few.

LAWMAKERS ANNOUNCE AN ADDITIONAL $200 MILLION TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Take an election year and a brimming state economy and
the tax cuts keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders Wednesday announced a surprise $200 million
one-time tax break to give another $50 back to every taxpayer in
the state, according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round follows a $160 million reduction already agreed
upon, and a historic $770 million taxcut expected to be signed into
law Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called press conference late Wednesday, House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham said they had just struck a deal on how to spend the
$1.1 billion state revenue surplus and decided to take a ``blended
approach'' to ``sop up extra cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan: To give another $200 million back to taxpayers; put
$60 million in a so-called best and brightest education fund for
teacher signing bonuses and other professional development; add
another $150 million to the state's rainy day fund; and spend an
unspecified amount out-of-pocket on capital improvements across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we'll look back on these days as being quite
responsibly led,'' Finneran said. As for the surplus, he said it
``makes little or no sense to hold onto it when it was productively
earned'' by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear last night whether Acting Governor Paul Cellucci
will sign off on whole agreement or whether either branch would be
willing to override a veto after the legislative session adjourns
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer said the acting governor has
line-item veto power over leftover budget matters, from which
Wednesday's proposal came, and he could veto spending items while
approving tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a step in the right direction but it's not enough,''
Hoffer said. ``He will have his veto pen poised to veto excess
spending and get even more money back to the taxpayers...he's going
to fight for the whole enchilada.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, lawmakers passed the largest budget in state
history which includes the $770 million tax cut, expected to be
signed by Cellucci today. That tax cut will double the exemption
for personal income taxes -- saving between $131 for a single filer
to $262 for joint filers -- and cuts in half the 12 percent tax
rate on interest and dividend income.
</P>
<P>
   This additional $200 million tax cut could add another $50 in
exemptions to single filers and $100 to joint filers on this year's
tax returns, according to what leaders called ``back of the
envelope'' calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The previous plan also increases the size of the stabilization
or rainy day fund from 5 percent of current revenues to 7.5
percent, allowing reserves to grow from $950 million to a maximum
of $1.42 billion. At Wednesday's announcement, Finneran and
Birmingham said they had allocated $150 million from the surplus to
go into that fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every part of the Commonwealth will benefit,'' said Stanley
Rosenberg, chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state will pay cash -- rather than borrow money --
to fix up tourist destinations, cultural centers, environmental
retreats and historical sites.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said more of the surplus will also be used to pay for
environmental cleanup legislation known as Brownfields, a tax cut
for the insurance industry, and other ``boring items'' such as
collective bargaining issues.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, a Republican gubernatorial
candidate, is asking for the full $1.1 billion to be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told this surplus is better off in the hands of state
bureaucrats than in the hands of the people who earned it. I will
always fight to make sure surpluses get back into the hands of the
people of Massachusetts, where it belongs,'' Malone said. ``This is
people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be someone like Joe Malone who will burp and
say `more,''' Birmingham said. ``We are taking a more rational,
more reasonable, more blended approach. There are other needs that
need to be addressed.''

BRAWLEY PLAINTIFF GETS ONLY FRACTION OF DAMAGES HE SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ After an eight-month trial that revived the
racially divisive Tawana Brawley case, a Dutchess County jury
Wednesday set $345,000 as the total damages that Steven Pagones, a
white former prosecutor, can recover from three advisers to Miss
Brawley, a black teenager who said Pagones abducted and raped her
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The sum was sharply lower than the $150 million Pagones had
sought in the damages phase of the case. The same jurors had
decided July 13 that he had been defamed in 10 instances by the
advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's award was approximately what Pagones has said he
spent waging what became an emblematic struggle by a man to clear
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Although in their original verdict the jurors found that
Sharpton slandered Pagones more times than the other two
defendants, in Wednesday's decision they assessed lower damages
against him. Two jurors said they thought Sharpton had been duped
and that he did admirable work.
</P>
<P>
   They set Sharpton's total damages at $65,000. Maddox's damages
were $95,000. Mason's damages were $185,000.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews after the verdict, three of the jurors adopted a
tone of reconciliation, saying they had respect for all the
participants in the case and several took issue with the media's
portrait of the trial as an unruly circus.
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors said Pagones had been wronged, but they did not
want to hurt the three advisers, who had portrayed their fight on
behalf of Ms. Brawley as a singular battle in the decades-long
civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors said they had taken a cue in settling on the amount
from the message that Pagones gave them in 25 days of testimony .
``He did not want to destroy them,'' said jury foreman Patrick
Cody, a warehouse worker. ``He wanted them held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve said it himself, he didn't want to hurt these guys,''
said Mark Urbin, another juror at a news conference, with Pagones
watching from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial Pagones had repeated his version of a legal
mantra _ ``it's not about money'' _ to summarize his position that
he was taking on the advisers because they had crossed the bounds
of civilized behavior with accusations that he said came out of the
blue and altered his life. In their remarks Wednesday, the jurors
said they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones appeared dazed after the verdict and he did not display
the celebratory mood he showed after the July 13 verdict. But he
said the jurors had been right. ``I didn't want to destroy anybody,
ironically, because they didn't care about destroying me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said, his long battle was over. ``It's time to heal. It's
time to move on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three jurors who spoke at a news conference here said they
did not know what happened to Miss Brawley when she disappeared for
four days in November 1987, but they said it was clear that Pagones
had not attacked her.
</P>
<P>
   But the jurors, who were never told by the court of the damages
that Pagones sought, said they were surprised when reporters told
them the amount. One of the jurors, Glen Heinsohn, who said he
earns $20,000 a year, said the jurors thought the amount they
assessed was a lot of money compared with what they earn.
</P>
<P>
   But reaction to the verdict in the metropolitan area indicted
that its size came as a surprise and prompted supporters of the
advisers to say Pagones had only won a symbolic victory.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Sharpton, who said he was stunned by the small
amount and that the size of the verdict would negate its impact as
a political symbol. ``As I run for mayor in 2001,'' he said after
th verdict, ``it's now going to be very difficult for anybody to
raise the issue because of the size of the award.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors who spoke were three white members of the panel,
which included two black jurors who did not join the news
conference. One of the black jurors who did not appear at the news
conference, Althea Williams, a post office clerk, had been the
subject of intense scrutiny since the verdict July 13 because she
did not sign the verdict sheet, indicating that she disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   There had been reports in recent days that she expressed deep
disagreement with some of the white members of the panel. And
deliberations were interrupted Tuesday after a court officer
interceded in an emotional argument between Ms. Williams and a
white juror. Only five votes were required to reach a verdict.
Wednesday's verdict sheet included the signatures of all six
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   At her Dutchess County home after the verdict, Ms. Williams
denied that her opinion of the case had anything to do with
prejudice. But she said, ``I have a right to my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the award was a fraction of the damages that could have
been assessed, several members of the defense team immediately
claimed that they had won the case. When the trial began last Nov.
18, Pagones was seeking $395 million. The amount went down to $150
million because the jurors only found 10 of 22 statement in the
original complaint were defamatory in their July 13 verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hardy, Sharpton's lawyer, declared the verdict was a
major victory, reminding reporters that Pagones' lawyer, William
Stanton, had asked the jurors to hit the advisers with a large
damage award to ``shut them up.''.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who was often the most combative of the advisers, said:
``This was the greatest comeback in American jurisprudence. Pagones
was looking for $395 million and we ended up getting only a slap on
the wrist.''

<P>
   Leonard Barrack, a prominent fund-raiser for Democratic causes
and the finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has
been a generous contributor to the campaigns of Mayor Ed Rendell in
Philadelphia and Carl McCall, the state comptroller in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Barrack, a prominent securities class-action lawyer, represents
the Philadelphia and New York state public pension funds in huge
class-action cases against companies whose stocks have tumbled
because of undisclosed setbacks or accounting irregularities,
earning substantial fees in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Did the contributions influence officials who hired him? Not at
all, Barrack says. ``I'm not sure that there's anything wrong with
political contributions like these, as long as we have vigorous
representation and the best recovery for the shareholders,'' said
Barrack, a partner in the Philadelphia firm of Barrack, Rodos &AMP;
Bacine. The firm represents McCall's fund and two others in a
securities case against Cendant Corp., potentially one of the most
lucrative class-action cases in history.
</P>
<P>
   But with the number of securities class-action cases up sharply
this year, some people think there is something very wrong here,
something that runs counter to the goals Congress had in 1995 when
it enacted a law giving pension funds and other institutional
investors an enhanced role in class-action litigation.
</P>
<P>
   One critic is Howard Sirota, a veteran class-action lawyer in
New York. ``There is a non-arm's-length arrangement between Len
Barrack and the politicians hiring him,'' Sirota said. ``And what
is wrong with that is that it puts last the economic interest of
the people in whose name the cases are being filed _ all the small
shareholders in the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrack and Sirota will be battling on Tuesday in federal court
in Newark, N.J., over whether campaign donations by Barrack and his
co-counsel disqualify their firms from adequately representing
Cendant shareholders. He wants the legal work to go to whichever
qualified firm will to do it for the lowest fee.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of lawyers who cultivate public business by
contributing to politicians _ a practice known as ``pay to play'' _
is Harvey Goldschmid, the new general counsel of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. ``If we allow wild political contributions to
be made to get public benefits,'' Goldschmid said, ``we're going to
create questions about the integrity of the people and the
integrity of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldschmid was a member of an American Bar Association task
force that last week called for new professional rules that would
sharply restrict, and fully disclose, the contributions lawyers
make to politicians who award them business. On Tuesday, as Sirota
argues in Newark, the bar association's delegates will be debating
the task force's recommendations at their annual convention in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Leading class-action lawyers are offended by Sirota's complaint.
``The pejorative implication is that one cannot be appropriately
appointed if one is politically engaged _ and that would be a sorry
state of affairs,'' said Samuel D. Heins, who represents the
Minnesota pension fund and who has supported two Democrats on the
fund's bipartisan five-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sirota's challenge and the bar association's debate are
being watched carefully by executives at the large pension funds
that have become active in the class-action arena since 1995. The
general counsel of the $13 billion Florida state pension fund plans
to fly to Newark to observe the courtroom arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The funds insist their lawyer-selection procedures are immune to
political influence. Yet interviews with dozens of lawyers and
pension executives show that in most states the hiring of a
class-action lawyer is protected from politics by little more than
an honor system. Indeed, questions about a law firm's political
contributions have rarely been raised in the selection process
until now. And some funds do not even try to use their clout to get
lower fees from lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   This was not how it was supposed to work under the 1995
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, the class-action arena was dominated by a handful
of giant firms _ Barrack, Rodos prominent among them _ considered
by critics to be quick-draw lawyers who kept ``pet plaintiffs''
handy so they could sue at the drop of a stock and settle quickly
for substantial fees. The passive plaintiff whose lawyer got to the
courthouse first was likely to be named ``lead plaintiff,'' even if
his actual loss was minimal, and his lawyer got the bulk of the
fees awarded by the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a process that hadn't been working particularly well,''
said the SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., with his typical
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   To improve it, Congress decreed that the investors with the
largest financial losses had a presumptive right to be lead
plaintiff, an arrangement that was expected to put powerful,
sophisticated institutional investors _ like mutual funds, money
managers and state and city pension funds _ in the driver's seat.
Congress expected public pension funds and other institutional
investors to take the reins of the securities class-action process
out of lawyers' hands, demanding lower fees and larger recoveries
for shareholders. But that model does not exactly match what is
happening in, say, Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the Florida State Board Administration has elected
officials on its board, but they are not involved in the selection
of counsel in the handful of cases the fund has filed. But then, no
one really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't choose them; they choose us,'' said Horace Schow II,
the board's general counsel. ``It's first come, first served,
really.'' As for fees, any law firm representing the fund ``is
entitled to whatever the court will award them,'' Schow said,
adding, ``We haven't gotten around to negotiating them yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's approach to the class-action challenge also bears
little resemblance to the congressional vision, so far as anyone
outside the city solicitor's office can tell. Barrack acknowledged
that he represents the city pension fund in several cases, but he
did not identify them. The fund's chairman could not identify them
either, explaining that all litigation is ``the exclusive domain''
of the city solicitor, who is appointed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   And Deborah Butler, the chief deputy city solicitor, refused to
discuss any aspect of the city's securities class-action
procedures, including what steps are taken to insulate them from
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Barrack also filed numerous class-action cases on behalf of the
state of Pennsylvania's public pension funds, after being hired in
1996 by the state treasurer, who has since left office. But the
cases were filed without the required approval of the pension
fund's board and the treasurer was not authorized to hire outside
counsel, said Paul Tufano, the governor's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   After learning accidentally of Barrack's work, Tufano protested.
Barrack balked at dropping the cases, Tufano said, and was
ultimately allowed to proceed with one or two cases that were too
far advanced to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Barrack described the dispute as ``a misunderstanding.''

</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, William T. Reeves, general counsel for the
Teachers Retirement System, said all his class-action work so far
had been done by I. Walton Bader, a partner in a two-member law
firm in White Plains, N.Y. Despite its tiny size, the Bader firm
has done extensive work for the Florida pension fund as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bader was selected after he got in touch with the fund six years
ago, Reeves said, but the fund is exploring other ways to handle
its class-action legal work. And while Bader's fees are left to the
discretion of the court, Reeves said, ``If we ever do anything with
anybody else, we're not going to do it that way.'' Typically,
court-awarded fees in such cases can be as much as 30 percent of
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the New York state comptroller, has retained three firms
to handle class-action cases on behalf of the state's various
pension funds. Besides Barrack's firm, they are Bernstein,
Litowitz, Berger &AMP; Grossmann and Milberg, Weiss, Bershad Hynes &AMP;
Lerach, both in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Bernstein firm is co-counsel with Barrack in the Cendant
case. The firms agreed to a sliding scale of fees that range from 3
percent of any early settlement exceeding $400 million to 20
percent of a post-trial award up to $150 million, a McCall
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Wednesday that that the three firms
and their lawyers have contributed more than $165,000 to McCall's
campaign since they were retained in June 1997. McCall denied any
impropriety, saying that the contributions are completely unrelated
to the decision to retain the firms for the state's class-action
work. Lawyers in his office chose the firms after rigorously
reviewing the qualifications of 14 applicants, and he merely
approved the selection, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   The role played by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board,
which manages that state's $55 billion pension fund, seems to be a
little closer to what Congress had in mind. The board is the lead
plaintiff in the class-action cases against Cellstar and Physician
Computer Network, said Keith Johnson, assistant legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the outside lawyers were selected after a
competitive review by a four-member panel made up of Johnson, an
in-house investment manager, a representative of the attorney
general, and a local lawyer, recruited for his litigation
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Fees are negotiated in advance and are always ``way, way below''
the 30 percent that is the norm in class-action cases, Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the California Public Employees Retirement
System, called Calpers, has so insulated its procedures from
politics that one of its board members _ the state controller,
Kathleen Connell _ has actually sued to overturn a new fund rule
that bars her from accepting campaign contributions from anyone who
does business with the fund, including the lawyers it hires.
</P>
<P>
   Most other states active in class-action cases fall somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Silvester, the state treasurer in Connecticut, is ready to
become active in appropriate cases, he said. And a state law
prohibits him from awarding business to anyone who has contributed
to the treasurer's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester's outside lawyers are selected by Richard Blumenthal,
the state's elected attorney general, who is not barred from hiring
firms that have contributed to his campaign. But Blumenthal said
this week that he had an internal rule against hiring campaign
contributors. ``So the practical effect is to insulate the
selection from politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This growing dispute could discourage pension funds from getting
involved in the class-action arena, as Congress hoped they would,
said Michael Perino, a law professor at St. John's University in
New York and co-author of a recent study that shows a sharp
increase in class-action filings.
</P>
<P>
   Sirota's challenge provides further evidence that lawyers must
change their campaign contribution practices, said Michael A.
Cardozo, a former president of the New York City Bar Association,
who supports curbs on campaign contributions. ``I think many major
firms realize this is a bad practice and should be stopped,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawyers, including Barrack, see such restrictions as
irrelevant and unnecessary. ``There are serious problems out there
in the campaign financing area, but this isn't one of them,'' he
said. &QL;

FOR WHITE HOUSE, JULY IS NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS JANUARY
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-TRIPP) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing, White House aides insist, could be as bad
as late January, when the Lewinsky accusations first crashed over
them.
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of the country, or at least that fraction of it that
is paying attention, the last couple of days of revelations and
reversals in the investigation of Kenneth Starr surely looked like
a nightmare for the White House. But the people living through them
just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison between late January and late July,''
said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``There is no shock value in anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another said: ``This is not the first six days.'' He added, with
the deadeye accuracy of a prisoner or a hostage marking time,
``This is after 6 months and 11 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of President Clinton's political advisers had been
pushing White House lawyers for him to testify and not fight the
subpoena by Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. They were
clearly relieved on Wednesday by the president's decision to do so.
``I told you,'' crowed one. ``Clinton wants a quick resolution. Get
this done.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, such strategic decisions are out of the hands
of all but a half-dozen officials at the White House, mostly in the
counsel's office. Those officials have had a more panicky couple of
days. Late on Tuesday evening, one was telephoning reporters to
question them about what they had learned of the immunity deal
between Starr and Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the staff, to a remarkable degree, has gone on with
business as usual _ for better or for worse. On Tuesday afternoon,
after the news of Ms. Lewinsky's deal was announced, an internal
memorandum rocketed through the building from the president's
famously aggressive communications office.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a directive on how to discuss the deal or to describe
the president's negotiations over his own testimony. Instead, it
was a stern memorandum stating that certain words were off-limits
to speech-writers and others, because they were reserved for the
``millenium project,'' an administration effort led by Hillary
Rodham Clinton to herald the change of century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of the Millenium, and the logo (until we hear
otherwise), is for millenium use only,'' warned the memorandum, a
copy of which was provided to The New York Times by an amused staff
member, who like others wondered if he was now allowed to refer in
conversation to the 21st century. It added that ``it is very
important to the overall strength and infrastructure of the
millenium project'' for it to remain distinct from ``our day-to-day
messages and words that we use.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current circumstances, talking about talking about an
event two years' hence might seem like a remote endeavor. But life
has a strange way of going on in this White House, despite all the
buffeting by prosecutors or pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inured to it,'' said another a White House aide, who is
not involved in the day-to-day damage control effort. But, he
added, he had been startled by the abrupt acceleration of Starr's
investigation in recent days. ``That's what everyone's amazed by,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president went resolutely about his business on Wednesday,
much as he has done since January.
</P>
<P>
   He met with a task force he convened on adults with
disabilities. And in a speech on Wednesday morning to an
international meeting of educators, he laid out lofty goals,
calling for a guarantee of ``universal, excellent education for
every child on our planet.'' He criticized Republicans for not
embracing his education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a White House briefing about the president's mood, Mike
McCurry, the president's press secretary, said, ``He seemed to be
enjoying all the work he is doing today. He's giving a speech on
education, which some of you may or may not report.''
</P>
<P>
   Many White House staff members express a certain fatalism or
resignation about the investigation. ``One, this president's done
nothing wrong, and if the facts get out it'll be fine,'' said one.
``And two, this will never end.'' The reason that scandal will
continue to dog the White House, he said, was that ``It's a
politically charged opposition, and it's set out to destroy this
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aides acknowledge harboring private doubts about Clinton's
truthfulness. But they say they are convinced that Starr's
investigation is doing much more damage than any lie he might have
told. One adviser said that anger at Starr has intensified since
his decision to subpoena Secret Service officers in the
investigation. ``The Service subpoenas made everybody furious,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been energized in the last two days by press
reports that the so-called talking points, which Ms. Lewinsky
apparently gave to Linda Tripp, were no longer believed by Starr's
team to have come from the White House. The talking points appeared
intended to coach Mrs. Tripp, a former White House secretary, on
possible testimony about the president. They were repeatedly
reported to be central to Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeful White House aides fed reporters their own words,
compiling lists of quotations from news organizations and sending
them out. And they brandished the story of the talking points as a
talisman; other news reports about Starr's accumulation of
evidence, they said, may also prove flimsy.

GORE BRINGS ADMINISTRATION EDUCATION MESSAGE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, N.H. _ She was a refugee asking a favor of an
American Vice President, but Beata Umugwangwali wasn't nervous,
saying: ``I went through so many things in my life that I wasn't
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Umugwangwali is a nurse who fled the war ravaging her native
Rwanda with three children and a niece three years ago. She now
works in a rehabilitaion hospital in Dover, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was on a swing through New Hampshire, a
state where the first presidential primary of the milennium will be
held. The visit marked his fourth trip to the state since the last
election and the 12th of his vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip included a meeting with Governor Jeanne Shaheen and
Democratic stalwarts, but he began his day talking to business
leaders, educators and people who have benefited from federal
education programs. He held a town hall meeting at Insight
Technology, a manufacturer of night-vision goggles and laser sights
for weapons that has grown from three to 140 employees since its
founding in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted so much to say something to him and I am so happy
that they put education on top and are pushing everyone to go back
to school'' Umugwangwali said after asking Gore's help in getting
American licensing boards to recognize college degrees earned
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly praised President Clinton for his education
initiatives and made no secret of the fact that his trip was also
meant to chastize Congress for stalling education and environmental
programs pushed by the Clinton adminstration.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts proposed by the Republican majority would cost New
Hampshire $8.5 million in lost federal funds for education alone.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked about continuing education and skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is a big controversy in Congress about lifting
the immigration limits for people with higher skills to come in and
fill these jobs. ... Yes, that's something that needs to be debated
but, why don't we at the same time make a commitment beyond
partisanship to invest what is needed to give the skills to
Americans so they can fill those jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, on the banks of the Oyster River in Durham,
Gore told a group of some 150 UNH students and faculty that the
state would soon get $1.6 in federal funds to help restore the
state's polluted esturaries and reopen long closed shellfish.

   ``We are now, I think, past the old mistake people used to make
of having to choose between the economy and the environment.'' In
tourist dependent N.H., as in many other states, they are one and
the same, Gore said.

COMMENTARY: JUSTICE DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Think of the criminal justice system as an old
dilapidated vehicle, a jalopy. Sometimes it will get you where you
want to go. Frequently it will not.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Blake is in prison in upstate New York, serving a
sentence of 36 years to life for a double homicide, because the
jalopy broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who is 29 and has already served eight years, was accused
of ambushing and killing two men in a car in the East New York
section of Brooklyn on the afternoon of June 18, 1990. It was a
spectacular and brazen crime. The victims were killed by a gunman
who riddled them with bullets from an Uzi as they tried to get away
by backing down the street. The car crashed into a building and the
gunman fled.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence against Blake was the testimony of a man named
Dana Garner, who said he saw Blake running beside the moving car,
firing the Uzi. Blake had an alibi. He was at work that day in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, about 4 1/2 miles from the murder scene. His
boss and co-workers testified on his behalf. But the alibi was not
airtight. Blake had taken his regular lunch break, from 1:15 to 2
p.m., and the murder happened at 1:45.
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely that within 45 minutes a man could travel 4 1/2
miles through busy neighborhoods in Brooklyn, ambush and execute
two men, dispose of the murder weapon, and return to work as if
nothing had happened. But it is not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Blake said he had eaten lunch at his sister's apartment, not far
from his job. His sister concurred. But the jury chose to believe
Dana Garner, the man who said he had seen the murder. Blake was
convicted of two counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced
to 18 years to life on each count, the sentences to be served
consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of case tends to get very little scrutiny. The police,
the prosecutors and the press all see it as cheap, not worth
getting excited about. The accused probably did it, the victims
probably deserved it. Case closed. Who's on Leno tonight?
</P>
<P>
   But this case demands a closer look. Blake is very likely
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Dana Garner has an almost miraculous penchant for
witnessing homicides. These are not murders in which he is
involved. He just happens upon them. A week after the murders that
landed Jeffrey Blake in prison, Garner stumbled upon a double
shooting at another Brooklyn intersection. This one took place at 3
or 4 o'clock in the morning and one man died. Garner said he saw it
and testified in that case, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were more. Detective Richard Brew said at Jeffrey Blake's
trial that Garner had been a witness in two or three other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also homicides?'' asked a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the detective.
</P>
<P>
   There were problems with Dana Garner's testimony in the Blake
case. He said Blake had fired into the passenger side of the car.
But the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on the victims
said the wounds indicated the gunman had fired from the driver's
side.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, when it came time for Garner to testify, he
balked. He told prosecutors from the office of Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes that he couldn't remember whether Blake had
been involved in the shooting. That led to a flurry of
conversations, after which Garner agreed to go ahead and testify.
He took the witness stand and said Blake was the killer.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half after the conviction, while the case was on
appeal, Garner admitted on videotape that he had lied. But
according to Michelle Fox, a legal aid lawyer who handled Blake's
appeal, when it came time to testify at a post-conviction hearing,
Garner refused. He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Blake's appeal was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the appeals process exhausted and Blake having spent
more than a quarter of his life in prison, Garner is admitting once
more that he lied. At Fox's request, he submitted to a polygraph
test and passed. Blake also took a polygraph test, and he passed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a spokesman for Hynes said investigators were willing
to take another look. They've asked to see the polygraph results.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A rebel movement dislodged early this year from
a brief period in power in Sierra Leone is waging a campaign of
butchery against civilians, human rights groups and government
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By the hundreds, poor farmers and villagers _ men, women and
children _ have been shot, disemboweled or mutilated by having
limbs hacked off, survivors report. Thousands are thought to have
died, many in a rebel campaign code-named No Living Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims have been turned into messengers of death,
disfigured then sent away bearing letters warning President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah and the African peacekeeping troops who restored him
to office in March that armed resistance, led by remnants of a
former military junta, will continue and that no one is safe.
</P>
<P>
   A refugee who reached Guinea, his arms hacked to stumps, told
his story to a representative of Refugees International, a
Washington-based advocacy group that videotaped his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a military government,'' the refugee said the
rebels told him. ``You say you want a civilian government. Then we
will have to cut off your hands. Then go to Tejan Kabbah and he
will have to give you more hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Another refugee, with bandaged stumps where his hands had been,
shook with fear as he repeated again and again that he would never
be able to use a toilet without help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing really is atrocious,'' said Fode Dabor,
Sierra Leone's representative at the United Nations. ``I've never
seen it before. This is one of the most vicious rebel organizations
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred thousand people have fled their homes in recent
months for government-controlled areas or refugee camps in Liberia
and Guinea. Hospitals in Sierra Leone and in the camps are treating
a steady stream of mutilated victims.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the United Nations is to convene a special
conference on Sierra Leone to discuss how to begin rebuilding a
country that has endured decades of civil war and ruthless military
leaders since its independence in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Kabbah,
who is in New York for the conference. Annan said later that Kabbah
had told him that Nigeria on Wednesday turned over Foday Sankoh,
the rebel leader, to Sierra Leone to stand trial on charges of
treason and crimes against humanity, including atrocities he has
been associated with for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who was arrested in Nigeria last year while trying to
buy weapons, told his followers in a televised message after his
return to Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, that they should end
their terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the cutting off of people's hands and feet,
and when I heard about this I felt sick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbah, a civilian and Sierra Leone's first democratically
elected president, served for only a year before being overthrown
in May 1997 by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and the
Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   The Front is now trying to regain power even as Kabbah's
government begins to re-establish shaky institutions and repair a
ravaged capital. Political power and economic spoils have been the
object of this struggle and those that have gone before, though the
rebels have no political platform, according to experts on the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups came to the United Nations this week in
force to press participants in the Sierra Leone conference to mount
an international drive to insure that trials are held and
punishments meted out to the rebels. Officials from Sierra Leone
say the country may need international help to hold such trials.
</P>
<P>
   Dabor, Sierra Leone's representative, said in an interview that
the rebels are strongest in eastern Sierra Leone, where they have
been selling diamonds to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem has been the diamonds,'' he said. ``We have a lot
of people who want to lay their hands on our diamonds. I know that
the rebels finance their operations by the diamonds they recover
from this mining area. That's why they don't want to give up these
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Campbell, who recently completed a report on violence in
Sierra Leone for Human Rights Watch, said that the rebels had been
using brutal tactics for years but that they now appear to be more
desperate because of the presence of the Nigerian soldiers, who
make up the majority of the peacekeeping force sent by the Economic
Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Sowing Terror,'' was published Wednesday. Written
by Campbell and Jane Lowicki, both consultants to the organization,
it says children and women have also been singled out for sexual
abuse. Accounts of gang rapes and kidnappings for purposes of
sexual slavery are common.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes accounts of abuses by civilian defense
forces supporting Kabbah, in particular a group known as the
Kamajors, which it describes as ``responsible for the majority of
the most serious abuses committed by those fighting on behalf of
the Kabbah government since February 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch says child soldiers have been used by these
forces, but the Kabbah government has promised to end that
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The most brutal offenses seem to have been committed by the
rebels, however, especially the Revolutionary United Front, the
report says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Since 1991, when the RUF got going, in one of their first
attacks they allegedly decapitated administrators, put their heads
on sticks,'' Campbell said in an interview Wednesday. ``In order to
make statements of power, political statements, in 1996, they would
mutilate people. They would write things like `No election' or
`Don't vote' on peoples' backs _ they would burn it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of chopping someone's hands off allegedly came from
rebels saying to people: We're going to cut your hands off so you
can't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed now,'' Campbell said, ``is that the military
balance has changed, with ECOMOG there. ECOMOG is really powerful.
They control the urban centers and the rebels have become more
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their new strategy to put themselves back on the political
chessboard is to do these horrible things to civilians. That does
two things: It makes the civilian population subservient, and it
makes them somebody you have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The report included transcripts of testimony from survivors of
rebel attacks. One was from a farmer in Koidu, in the Kono
district, identified as Sam R., whose home was attacked twice. This
is his story:
</P>
<P>
   ``At about 4 a.m. I heard bombs and gunshots outside my house,''
he said of the first attack. ``The rebels came and banged on the
door. They said they would kill us all outside. My wife took five
of the six children outside. I stayed inside with one. My wife
threw herself on top of two of the children to protect them. They
shot my wife, killed two of the children, shot my 7-year-old
through the stomach and cut one on the buttocks. Two got away.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another attack in June. ``They accused me of being a
Kamajor,'' he said. ``When they want to kill you, they accuse you
of anything. There is no reason. I am a farmer. I don't vote. I
have no money. They burnt my house.'' &QL;

WAVE VICTIMS TO GET U.S. AID FOR RESCUE, PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea _ Government rescue workers said
Wednesday that they had given up hope of finding large numbers of
additional survivors from a series of giant waves that crashed into
the northwestern coast of the island of New Guinea on July 19,
killing an estimated 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The search for bodies continued as Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived here to announce a package of more than $1 million
in aid from the United States to help pay for the rescue effort and
to install a seismic early-warning system to help prevent loss of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only begin to imagine the horror of what took place,''
said Albright, who viewed the devastated area from the air as she
flew to Port Moresby, the capital of this western Pacific nation of
4 million people. ``It simply staggers the imagination. Words can
only begin to describe the sorrow we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole villages along an 18-mile stretch of the northern coast
disappeared, their residents pitched into island lagoons or swept
out to sea after an earthquake about 30 miles offshore unleashed
three huge waves, or tsunami, the largest of them reported to be
about 30 feet high. The bodies of about 1,600 victims have been
recovered so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papua New Guinea is grieving over the loss of human life as a
result of the tidal-wave disaster,'' Prime Minister Bill Skate said
at a ceremony to mark the arrival of Albright, the highest-ranking
American official to visit Papua New Guinea since it gained
independence from Australia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit, which lasted about two hours, was scheduled long
before the recent disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already sent about $400,000 in relief
supplies to the Papua New Guinea government. In announcing an
additional $650,000 in aid, Albright said that while ``it's hard
not to feel helpless before the awesome destructive power'' of
nature, ``we are not powerless to help those who are suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials here described a desperate situation in the
coastal area where the waves struck, with hundreds of bodies
decomposing in a central lagoon near the village of Sissano, about
400 miles northwest of Port Moresby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, people had used that water for washing, for fishing,''
said Cecilia Sangul, a spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs. ``Now it is completely contaminated. The bodies decompose
so fast.'' She noted that the Sissano lagoon was created by a huge
tsunami in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   While the government had originally planned to dynamite a sand
spit at the mouth of the lagoon to allow it to drain into the
ocean, officials said the idea had been abandoned out of fear that
corpses and debris would contaminate hundreds of miles of coastline
near the border with Indonesia. News reports from Indonesia said
that nearly 200 bodies had already been sighted by fishermen in
Indonesian waters.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials here said the largest number of victims
were children, who lacked the strength to fight the pull of the
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sangul, who met with reporters traveling with Albright, said
the government wants to reopen the schools in the area quickly, if
only to determine through student rosters how many children are
missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 people have been left homeless by the waves.
Most of them are subsistence farmers and fishermen, and many are
frightened to return home. Ms. Sangul said that some are afraid
that another wave might be imminent, while others are terrified
that the ghosts of the dead now haunt the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright's visit took on a somber tone as a result of
the disaster, she was still greeted on the tarmac of Port Moresby's
airport with a raucous display of traditional dance, which in many
remote regions has changed little since the Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
   As she stepped from her government jet, she was met by a troop
of scantily clad dancers from the country's central Mekeo region.
Each wore a necklace of dogs' teeth and a headdress adorned with
feathers from chickens, parrots and birds of paradise. Their skirts
were made from pulverized tree bark.

TEXAS DISTRICT JUDGE MIKE MACHADO, 74, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Complete writethru, adding death, details)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO and GLORIA PADILLA  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Mike Machado, a Depression-era child who rose from
poverty to become a revered war veteran and judge, died at a San
Antonio hospital Wednesday from complications associated with a
brain aneurysm. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime jurist, who spent 41 years as a judge in the
municipal and district courts, died at 3:30 p.m. with friends and
family by his side at Santa Rosa Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Machado, the Democratic nominee for Bexar County
district attorney, sends party officials into a scramble for to
find a replacement candidate for the November general election
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Machado was looked upon by many as a godfather who took young
defense lawyers and prosecutors under his wing while they learned
their trade.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career as a judge, Machado performed marriage
ceremonies for hundreds of couples and gave them all an open
invitation to his chambers. Many took them up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, friends and colleagues held out hope that the
gritty Machado would conquer his latest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Sid Harle said that in recent weeks he had
encountered a confident Machado who was looking forward to his bid
for district attorney in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was typical Mike Machado _ giving 'em hell and talking to
everybody he saw,'' said Harle, who first met Machado when he was a
county prosecutor in the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow District Judge Mary Roman, who was sworn in by Machado as
a new lawyer in 1984, said she often spent hours in Machado's
courthouse office discussing politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was strong in his beliefs,'' she said. ``He was passionate
about everything. If he thought I didn't agree him, he'd proceed to
try to persuade me and he wouldn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1940 Lanier High School graduate, Machado often referred to
himself as ``La Garra Kid,'' said Ronnie Waiters, the judge's
longtime court coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was from the West Side and I'm from the East Side and we
put our experience to work downtown,'' Waiters said. ``That's a lot
of experience from two old fools.''
</P>
<P>
   Machado joined the U.S. Army Air Corps after high school and
soon found himself shooting at enemy targets as a nose-gunner
aboard B-24 bombers during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, 1944, a B-24 carrying Machado and others was strafed
by enemy fire while flying a mission over Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of intelligence reports that captured American flight
crews were being tortured by German soldiers, those aboard the
damaged bomber decided not to bail out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they guided the failing aircraft to a crash landing in
northern Italy. A resulting fire badly scarred Machado's upper
body, forcing him to spend 36 months in the hospital to receive
skin grafts.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Cahill recommended nine friends to come to work for his
employer, Citizens Bank of Massachusetts _ the bank paid him $2,700
for his help finding good recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Shelley re-entered the job market with some trepidation
after 25 years with one company and soon learned how valuable her
skills were. She received three job offers in one day, and took one
as a store manager for Best Buy, a retailer opening stores in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Haan, a software systems manager, can top that: 13 calls
in one day, after posting his resume on the Internet. ``I
constantly got jobs,'' the Haan said while standing in the computer
``control room'' of his employer, OrderTrust of Lowell, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to get a job than it has been in decades. With
unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s, employers report
that the job market is so tight it is driving up wages and bonuses.
But there is a downside: Rising wages often trigger greater
consumer demand and price hikes, which in turn can spur inflation.
That hasn't happened so far, but the Federal Reserve Board and many
investors will be anxiously watching today for any spike in what
has been an obscure measure of quarterly wage changes, the
government's Employment Cost Index.
</P>
<P>
   The index has already shown an acceleration in wages, which rose
3.3 percent during the year ending March 1998, up from 2.9 percent
for the year ending March &UR;  &LR; 1997. A big increase in the index report
could heighten fears of inflation on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Whatever the numbers are today, the pressure on employers to
hike wages continues. ``If you're not competitive on pay, you might
as well hang up your hat,'' said Joann Laipson, director of human
resources for Lotus Development Corp., an IBM Corp. subsidiary in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do employers feel compelled to raise basic wages, they
also are passing out more bonuses, rewarding emplyees who help with
recruitment, more employees to justify pay hikes, and responding
more aggressively with raises for employees who receive job offers
from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Though most acute in the high-technology industry, the labor
shortage is also occurring in retail, consulting, and financial
companies and healthcare organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether higher wages will be reflected in the Consumer Price
Index, the main inflation gauge watched by the Fed, is unclear. So
far, despite strong growth in the US economy, inflation has
remained calm: The Consumer Price Index, rose 0.1 percent in June,
even less than the scant 0.3 percent May increase.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman said in recent
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that he is worried
that a tight job market means ``increasingly confident workers
might place gradually escalating pressures on wages and costs,
which would eventually feed through to prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although wages push up inflation, other forces are working
against it. Asia's economic crisis has lowered the cost of goods
imported from the Pacific Rim, and US companies are responding by
lowering their prices. Commodities prices, notably oil, a key
component of the CPI, are falling.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation ``would be with us today, were it not for Asia,'' said
Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group Inc. in
Boston. ``If Asia had continued to jump along at the rate it was
growing, oil prices wouldn't be running $14 a barrel _ they'd
probably be closer to $20. The dollar exchange rate would probably
be weaker rather than strong _ and US interest rates would be
higher rather than lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is ample cause for Greenspan's concerns about labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   An estimate by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a Wellesley, Mass.
consultant to coroporate human resource departments, based on a
survey of 180 companies in New England, said 1998 raises were 4.1
percent, about the same as the average in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not take into account other costs of keeping and
hiring workers. In Watson Wyatt's survey, 75 percent of employers
said they use counter-offers to keep their best employees, more
than 60 percent use incentive plans to reward employees for good
performance, and half gave raises to prevent people from quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's Perna said, ``These hidden costs that don't show up in
wages affect the total level of costs.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate study by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington, Mass.
research firm, found that wages and salaries for Massachusetts
workers in all industries increased between 4.6 percent and 4.8
percent in each of the past three years. That is a sharp rise from
wage increases of below 2.5 percent in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both locally and nationally wages have been accelerating for
the past three years,'' said Sara Johnson, chief regional economist
for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``Eventually this will surface in the
general price inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The tight job market gives employees confidence to demand
more in job interviews and in seeking pay raises from current
employers. ``It is definitely a job applicant's market, and
employers have to move very, very quickly,'' said Heidi Toppel, a
consultant for Watson Wyatt in the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Shelley, for example, who had worked for Montgomery Ward
for 25 years, most recently as a store manager in Portsmouth, N.H.,
had many offers she didn't really even consider. After several
interviews, she chose Best Buy, she said, in part because the
retailer offered better pay than other retailers _ and much better
than Montgomery Ward.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. ``Best Buy's benefits were by far the best. Best
Buy offered a 401k after six months,'' Shelley said. ``You can get
into stock options after a year. Their discount is 5 percent over
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   When he makes an offer to a job applicant, Chris Coffin,
director of human resources for Citizens Bank Massachusetts, said
that potential recruits sometimes respond with ``irrational
counter-offers'' from their existing employers. ``It feels like the
mid-80s where it really heated up.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffin said he resists costly bidding wars. But the bank in
December boosted pay for tellers by 50 cents an hour, to $8.50 an
hour, to help fill the difficult-to-fill positions.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can often secure better pay by changing jobs. Lisa
Carroll, one of the nine employees that coworker Cahill helped to
recruit, said she got a ``moderate increase'' in pay when she
switched from Fleet to Citizens, where she is now a manager of its
branch on West Broadway in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether pervasive stories about the tight labor
market turn up in the US Department of Labor's wage index.
Economists have forecast a rise in the Employment Cost Index for
the April-June quarter ranging from 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent.
That would boost the cost index for the year ending June to 3.4
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anecdotal stories make you confident the acceleration you
see is real. You could argue it could be worse than what we're
seeing'' in the numbers, said William Dudley, the chief US
economist for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York. But, Dudley
concluded, ``we need more data.''

ANALYSIS: GM STRIKE NOT A BIG BOOST FOR ORGANIZED LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (with GM-STRIKE) 
(bl) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The General Motors strikes will certainly not give the nation's
labor movement the shot in the arm it received last year from the
Teamsters strike against the United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Unions trumpeted the UPS strike as an unequivocal victory that
gave part-time workers a big raise, but labor can describe the GM
strikes as, at best, an ultimately successful but extremely costly
goal-line stand.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks on the picket line, the striking auto workers can
boast that they achieved their main but modest goal: GM agreed to
proceed with a $180 million investment at a metal stamping plant in
Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Automobile Workers achieved that small victory
for a huge price: workers who went on strike at two plants in
Flint, as well as workers at dozens of other GM plants that were
forced to close, lost $1 billion in wages.
</P>
<P>
   Though the labor movement used the UPS strike as a rallying cry
to tell nonunion workers there was a reason to join a union, the
results at General Motors are likely to send a different message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to be a UAW organizer,'' said Dale Brickner,
a professor of industrial relations at Michigan State University.
``How do you go out and tell people they should join a union that
has had people out for 50 days, 190,000 of them, and gained
absolutely nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   The auto workers may not have made significant gains, but union
officials say they did prevent a pivotal loss. GM precipitated the
strike at the metal plant by removing some valuable stamping dies,
which are like large molds used to shape metal, over the Memorial
Day weekend, a move that caused union members to fear that the
plant's days might be numbered. Anxious to protect their jobs, the
workers at the plant struck, and they now insist workers at the
plant struck, and they now insist they were victorious because they
persuaded GM to return the dies, which will be used to produce a
vaunted new pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the union achieved what they set out to achieve _ to
bring the dies back, which were the catalyst that started this
whole thing,'' said Daniel Hoffman, a former GM factory worker who
is coordinator of the Labor Studies Center at the University of
Michigan. ``The fact that they got the corporation to follow
through on the investment in the plant, that's going to be looked
upon as a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly not as a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Katz, a professor of labor relations at Cornell
University, expressed more skepticism about how much the union
achieved. ``In the grand scheme, I'd call it a lose-lose draw. If I
had to say who lost more _ not in the dollar sense, but in the
symbolic sense _ GM lost more. The UAW did get at least partially
what they fought the strike over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the strikes began locally and grew to national
proportion, they never captured the public's attention the way the
UPS strike did. Moreover, officials at other unions often said that
UAW leaders did a poor job framing the issues to win public backing
for the strikers, a weakness considered especially important
because these strikes, while national in impact, focused on local
issues. That was one reason many Americans saw the strikes as yet
another example of some Brahmins of blue-collar labor biting the
hand that feeds them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even though the UAW achieved its main goal in the strikes,
the result has so few implications outside of Flint that it will be
hard for the union to convince the nation this was a big victory.
That is especially so in light of the staggering losses the union
and the company suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM lost, but the UAW didn't win,'' said Harley Shaiken, a
professor of labor relations at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes could hurt labor in ways that go beyond the loss of
$1 billion in wages. Fearing a costly stoppage like the General
Motors strike, an employers who wants to keep out a union can be
expected to fight unionization all the more. And though the main
goal of the strikes was to protect job security, the results might
end up causing some unionized employers _ perhaps even General
Motors _ to accelerate plans to move jobs to other countries with
more pliant workers and less obstinate unions.
</P>
<P>
   For labor, Shaiken saw a silver lining: after the number of
strikes has declined nationwide to its lowest level in 50 years,
the GM walkouts certainly demonstrated that labor could still
muster plenty of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, this was a strike in which two local unions
paralyzed the world's largest industrial corporation,'' Shaiken
said. ``If anything, this shows that strikes still pack a wallop.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, labor has been trounced in some
highly visible strikes, including those by the air traffic
controllers and workers at Phelps Dodge and Caterpillar. Labor's
losses in those showdowns discouraged other unions from walking
out, and, the GM strikes, some labor experts said, might prove more
encouraging to workers thinking of striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all the dust settles from this one,'' said Hoffman of the
University of Michigan, ``the auto workers come out of this very
supportive of their union. I think the average auto worker will
have the resolve to say, `I either stand now and strike or there
may be no tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   But labor experts said the GM showdown might cause other unions
to think hard about striking because what seemed like a minor
dispute mushroomed into a conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts said the strikes turned out to be at least as much
of a loss for GM as for the union. Company officials said GM's
biggest gains _ which many industry analysts said were modest _
were getting the union, first, to agree to regular meetings to
improve labor relations and, second, to promise to improve
productivity at the Flint metal stamping plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM lost because it lost close to $3 billion and 50-odd days of
lost production in obtaining a settlement that it likely could have
had without a strike,'' Shaiken said. ``You have to ask how does
what GM gained transfer to any other plant and what did they
accomplish other than antagonizing the union. I think the strike
was a miscalculation for GM. If this strike was a car, it would be
a Corvair.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said that considering how modest the issues were
and how much the two sides lost, GM and the union would have been
far wiser to have intensified its negotiating efforts before the
strikes erupted.
</P>
<P>
   If any person emerged stronger in the dispute, it was Richard
Shoemaker, the UAW vice president for General Motors issues. By
playing field commander and chief negotiator, he burnished his
credentials as an eventual successor to union president Stephen
Yokich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of the UAW leadership and the rank and file, Dick
Shoemaker comes out of this looking like a very strong leader,''
Hoffman said. ``He was able to mobilize everybody and pull it
together when it came to crunch time.''

   CORRECTED WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 216.
WASHINGTON, July 29 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFETY
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, July 21, the Senate voted, 61-39, to table, or set
aside, an amendment that would have required handguns to be sold
with child-proof safety devices. Supporters of the amendment said
it would protect children from handgun accidents. Opponents said
the amendment was an unnecessary federal regulation and would not
accomplish its purpose. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside, or
rejecting, the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GUNOWNERS
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, July 22, the Senate voted, 69-31, to table, or set
aside, a measure that would have allowed federal prosecution of gun
owners whose weapons were used by children in a crime, if the guns
were stored insecurely. Supporters of the measure said it would
have kept guns out of children's hands by requiring people to keep
their guns out of reach. Opponents argued that innocent people
could be held responsible if children found a way to access the
guns, even though they were properly stored. A ``yes'' vote favors
setting aside, or rejecting, the measure.

RUSSIA FAILS TO FREE IRAQ FROM INTRUSIVE INSPECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   ( rm ) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Russia tried and failed to get Security Council
action Wednesday on a resolution declaring that Iraq had complied
with demands to destroy its nuclear weapons program and was ready
to move away from intrusive inspections to long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain objected to two versions of a
Russian proposal, diplomats said after the council heard a report
from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Iraq expert, Garry
Dillon of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The council agreed to put off further discussion until member
governments had time to review the issue. There is no formal plan
to revive the discussion Thursday, although Russia may continue to
press for action, backed by China and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no reason, based on the IAEA's report to
the council, for the Security Council to take any action favorable
to Iraq,'' said Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IAEA report makes it absolutely clear that Iraq has made
no progress, that it has failed to provide information on weapons
design, on uranium enrichment, on nuclear exports,'' he said.
``Accordingly, there is no reason to close the nuclear file.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has to be certified as being free of nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons and the means to produce them, as well as
long-range missiles, before an 8-year-old embargo on the sale of
Iraqi oil can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been arguing that those files can be ``closed'' one
at a time, to give Iraq some motivation for further cooperation.
The United States has held that all requirements must be met before
sanctions can be altered. The atomic energy agency watches progress
on nuclear weapons. The U.N. Special Commission is responsible for
biological, chemical and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's chairman, Richard Butler of Australia, went to
China Wednesday for talks with officials there before meeting Iraqi
leaders early next week. China, which bristles at any outside
intrusions, has been critical of Butler's inspectors in Iraq,
saying at one point that they behaved like an occupying army.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, there have been no major advances that could
lead to lifting sanctions in areas Butler controls.

 &HT;    CLINTON AGREES TO TESTIFY BEFORE STARR'S GRAND JURY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed Wednesday to answer
questions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr, setting the stage
for a late summer climax of Starr's investigation into perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony is expected to pit the word of the nation's chief
executive against that of former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, who reportedly is ready to change her story and testify
that she had sexual relations with Clinton and that they discussed
concealing the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than appearing in person before a grand jury, Clinton
will give his testimony from the White House. It will be videotaped
and later played for grand jurors, the president's personal
attorney, David Kendall, announced.
</P>
<P>
   In a second concession to Clinton, Starr will allow attorneys to
be at the president's side as he testifies, Kendall said in a
statement read outside the White House. Normal practice is for
witnesses to undergo grand jury testimony alone and behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to testify Aug. 17, delaying a New England
vacation, after receiving a court order requested by Starr seeking
his testimony. The counsel's office then withdrew the subpoena,
which had been issued after months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from Clinton and Lewinsky are the final elements
needed by Starr to complete his investigation. If the probe turns
up evidence of impeachable offenses by the president, Starr is
required to report them to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that a Starr report could be sent to
House Speaker Newt Gingrich by September, presenting Congress with
a politically delicate decision just a month before it is scheduled
to adjourn to allow members to campaign for the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   While many lawyers say perjury and obstruction of justice would
warrant removal of a president, recent opinion polls suggest that
most Americans do not now believe a president should be removed
from office for lying about a private affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to testify voluntarily heads off a potential
constitutional clash over whether a sitting president can be forced
to appear before a federal grand jury. If the courts ruled against
him, Clinton would have become the first chief executive in history
required by subpoena to go before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has previously stated in a sworn affidavit in a civil
sexual harassment lawsuit brought by former Arkansas state employee
Paula Jones that she never had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
The president has said the same thing, under oath, in a deposition
in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials indicated that in his testimony
Clinton would insist, as he first did six months ago, that he never
had sexual relations with Lewinsky and did not urge her to lie
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president, back in January, leveled with the American
people, and he said what he had to say about this matter, and
nothing has changed about that in the time since,'' said White
House spokesman Michael McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to testify, Clinton rejected a list of other legal
options, including asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the
undecided question of whether a president can be forced to testify
against his will.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic might have delayed Starr's investigation by another
two or three months, but in the end, both failure and success would
have posed risks for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Failure _ meaning the Supreme Court might, in the end, order
Clinton to go before the grand jury _ would have been a historic
setback for the presidency and personally embarrassing for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Success _ meaning he would escape by the will of the court _
would have been politically damaging, in the view of many of his
top domestic aides.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these aides have grown openly weary of an investigation
that has sapped enormous resources from the administration and
taken the focus away from an ambitious policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner we get this behind us, the better it is for the
country and, therefore, the better it is for the president,'' said
White House political counsel Paul Begala.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no denying this is an aggravation,'' Begala said.
''It's no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry conceded there had been lively debate within the
administration this week over whether to continue a strategy built
around delaying on the issue or whether to confront it head-on.
McCurry said he and others wanted Clinton to address the matter
sooner rather than later, a position opposed by some members of
Clinton's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think sometimes we acknowledge the wisdom of their position;
sometimes they acknowledge the wisdom of our position. And, no,
they don't always win out,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no plans to address the American public on the issue
in the near future, McCurry said, adding that he didn't know
whether Clinton would go public with his testimony after he gives
it to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wanted to talk about it he could talk about it,''
McCurry said. ''But remember, grand jury proceedings, for all the
reasons we've talked about in the past, are conducted in secret,
first and foremost to protect the rights of the innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not given up his Fifth Amendment right to remain
silent on any questions he believes could incriminate him.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking that right, however, would also carry a high political
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''While legally that's viable, politically it's not,'' said
Clifford S. Fishman, law professor at the Catholic University of
America in Washington. ''For the president of the United States to
plead the Fifth Amendment ...it's a tacit admission of guilt.''

 &HT;    Falcons Notebook
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons haven't quite hit the wall yet,
but the shadow was looming as the first week of training camp ended
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one practice, for just under two hours in the
afternoon, and more than half of it was spent working on various
special teams and group drills. The 10th practice of camp was not
one of the most intense.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are guys getting tired physically, and tired of doing
many of the same things over and over, but they're getting tired of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is they'll scrimmage twice against the Jaguars
Saturday in Jacksonville. The bad news is it won't be a true
scrimmage, but rather almost the exact same drills they've been
doing, minus much of the special teams work.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know the tendencies of each other, and sometimes it
doesn't give you a very good look (against teammates),'' left
tackle Bob Whitfield said. ''So it's exciting to go up against
somebody you haven't seen in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Shane Dronett and running back Jamal Anderson
viewed the road trip with different kinds of indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ''In training camp you got to keep the same attitude whatever
they ask you to do,'' Dronett said. ''It doesn't really matter to
me. It's the same work. It's good competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said, ''I hate training camp, period. The whole thing
is a pain I could do without. I'm glad we're not going down there
for four or five days, but I wish they were coming here so I
wouldn't have to get on a plane.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons today will practice at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., and at 9
a.m. Friday. After meetings Friday afternoon, the team will fly to
Jacksonville for Saturday's 8:15 and 2:15 scrimmage-practices.
Actually, the Falcons will take the field a little earlier than the
Jags in order to get in extra special teams work.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the first time Reeves had the first offense run a
hurry-up drill against the first defense. It was the last part of
practice. Quarterback Chris Chandler and the starters had a minute
and five seconds to go 70 yards with one timeout. Chandler was very
sharp, hitting on all five of his passes, including a perfect throw
down the middle to Terance Mathis even though cornerback Ray
Buchanan had tight coverage. Generally, the ball was spotted a few
yards past where it was caught. That 30-yarder moved the ball to
about the 15, and after Chandler downed the ball on the next play,
he hit receiver Kevin Thornal on a look-in to move it to about the
7. But time ran out. The second unit did not fare well. Backup QB
Tony Graziani misfired on a few passes, and the backups barely made
it across midfield. ''Things went pretty well for it being the
first time,'' Reeves said. ''Chris had a really good grasp of it.
Usually the first unit does. Defensively, that's something we have
to work on. When your offense moves it like that you feel good, but
then you worry about the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler -- In addition to the above, he took turns
throwing passing drills, include extra work with receivers and
defensive backs after practice.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani -- See above, and also worked with kickers for the
first time as a holder. Did not throw well.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg -- Didn't get to go in the hurry-up offense drill,
but did run the No. 1 offense in a 9-on-9 running drill while
Chandler was working passing drills on the next field.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan -- Used only in passing drills, and a couple
running drills.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad, and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: The Falcons for the first time worked on a drill where the
outside coverage men on the punt team streak downfield to try to
keep a punt from bouncing in the end zone. Rookie Elijah Williams
caught a kick on the one-foot line.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: Rookie Octavus Barnes made a nice catch on a deep route
down the middle when receivers were working against defensive backs
without linemen and linebackers. But he ran into secondary coach
Ron Meeks after the grab. Way to make an impression, er,
indentation.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Falcons president Taylor Smith's shorts and T-shirt.
They're old. In fact, it is believed they once belonged to former
Falcon and Georgia running back Preston Ridlehuber, who played for
Atlanta in the first year of the franchise: 1966. The gray shorts
and white shirt are riddled with holes and creased by wrinkles. But
Smith has a good story. He was working out before he walked out to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   What they said
</P>
<P>
   ''It'd be really nice if we could get one of them to block.'' --
Reeves, on the possibility of running backs Jamal Anderson and
Bryon Hanspard in the lineup at the same time. Anderson's response:
''Dan's comment was very accurate, and that's why I tell people it
will never happen. Actually, I can block for Byron in some
situations. I'm not going to be running in there and iso-ing
anybody . . . at all. And Byron's not going to be lead-blocking for
me, unless it's a cornerback or something. But really, man, it's
like having two tailbacks back there. Tailbacks aint blockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   This is remarkable. Reliable sources say one of the players'
absolute favorite foods in the dining hall is steamed cabbage. On a
day when it is served, cooks typically go through 40 pounds of the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Close book on Davis
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Davis, who was waived by the Falcons Tuesday, cleared
waivers without being claimed by another team. That means the
6-foot-5, 326-pound defensive tackle is a free agent. He will count
$245,700 against the Falcons' cap this year, and $220,700 next.
These numbers pale to the $1.1 million former center Roman Fortin
will count against the cap after being waived in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   If we were to list every player that has something wrapped,
iced, taped or strapped, you'd be reading until opening day. But
the three players who missed both Tuesday's practices missed
Wednesday as well. CBs Randy Fuller (ankle) Ronnie Bradford
(hamstring) and DE Barry Mitchell (quadriceps) were out. Wednesday,
LB Jessie Tuggle (mild back strain) and WR Keith Crawford
(hamstring) came up lame. DE Chuck Smith (back spasms) also was
limited. Fuller looks worst. He's wearing a removable cast with an
electrical stimulation pack as a constant companion. G Scott Adams
(ankle and hamstring) practiced, but continues to limp badly. He
too wears a removable cast -- when he's not practicing.
</P>
<P>
   The boss talks
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Taylor Smith didn't look so good, but he had good things
to say after practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year there was such a newness to everything (in Reeves'
first year),'' he said. ''The coaches didn't know the news players,
or even the players we already had. The players didn't know the
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no worrying about switching from the run-and-shoot,
and no worrying if we can understand the new defense. Everybody
just seems much more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving life
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Swayda is a happier man these days. He was drafted in the
sixth round last year by the Bears after playing defensive tackle
at Arizona State. But the 6-foot-5, 290-pounder played only at end
in Chicago's camp, and got cut. He started out at end in the
Falcons' camp, but since switching to tackle Saturday, he's made
some plays and is working at No. 2 right tackle behind Shane
Dronett.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm better suited to play inside,'' he said. ''(The Bears) . .
. didn't give me a chance inside. I wasn't very happy. I can handle
not making it as long as I get a fair shot at where I think I
should play.''

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When the green flag waves for Saturday's
Brickyard 400, a large contingent of local fans will tell you that
this is Indianapolis' biggest sporting event of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, even bigger than the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the Brickyard 400 is the race now,'' said
Curt Cavin, who covers motorsports for the Indianapolis Star. ``The
demand for everything surrounding this race is much higher than the
Indy 500. People here have acquired a taste for Winston Cup
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the break between the Indy Racing League and CART,
support for the Indy 500 has declined the past two years. And
NASCAR, which began racing here in 1994, has more than filled the
void.
</P>
<P>
   The fans' hunger for speed and competition is being supplied by
such drivers as Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Dale Earnhardt, Rusty
Wallace and Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners around the track have noticed the change, and
some have made adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   George Harrison, who owns a racing collectibles store outside
Turn 1, points to the shelves in his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around here,'' he said. ``It used to be all Indy stuff.
Now we have a little shelf for that, and the other 99 percent of
the place is NASCAR. The fans are fed up with the IRL-CART split.''
</P>
<P>
   But you won't find many Winston Cup officials or drivers who
will jump into the middle of the fray. They love racing Indy, but
they respect the history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Indy 500 still is one of the most prestigious
races in the world,'' said Dale Jarrett, the 1996 Brickyard
champion. ``I don't think there ever was any illusion that any of
us as NASCAR drivers had a thought of trying to replace that, and
(I) still don't think we're going to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the Brickyard has grown in stature in a short
period of time, as NASCAR races go,'' Jarrett said. ``It's
certainly one of the two or three that every driver here wants to
win. It's a huge, huge race for us in a lot of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin, who drives the No. 28 Taurus for Robert Yates and
grew up in this area racing the USAC open-wheel circuit, says
die-hard Indy fans will always be die-hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been coming to the 500 for years, have season tickets,
suite privileges and call the drivers by their first names,'' Irwin
said. ``But I think the people outside of Indianapolis and the
casual Indy-car fans would probably say the Brickyard is bigger
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Rawlings lives 54 miles from the speedway and has seen
every 500 since 1982. He wonders if the two factions ever will be
one again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy watching the Winston Cup boys, and they've filled some
of the void,'' Rawlings said. ``But I'm an open-wheel fan. I can't
see NASCAR ever being No. 1 here. I hope it's not wishful
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   IMS officials don't want to say which race is bigger, but it's
clear they're thrilled with the enormous success of the Brickyard
400, which will have a sellout crowd of 307,000 in the stands and
50,000 more in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those big dances. Everybody brings their best
stuff,'' Bobby Hamilton said. ``Win at Indy, and you know you've
beaten the best. I don't know if the Brickyard is surpassing the
Indy 500. I don't usually pay attention to stuff like that. But if
this Kodak Chevrolet is sitting in victory lane at the end of the
day, you can rest assured I believe the Brickyard 400 is bigger
than the Indy 500.''

 &HT;    Memorial funds set up in honor of killed fans
 &HT;    BY Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Families of two spectators killed in last weekend's
CART U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway have designated charities for
those who want to make memorial contributions in their names.
</P>
<P>
   The designated charities are for Sheryl Ann Laster of the
American Cancer Society, 1599 Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, 30329, and
for Michael Terry Tautkus the National Kidney Foundation, 2350 S.
Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48104. No requests have been made
yet for the third victim, Kenneth Dale Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Speedway has set up a national counseling ``hotline''
for spectators who might have been affected by the accident, at
800-253-2182.
</P>
<P>
   NHRA
</P>
<P>
   Like the fine wine from the vineyards that surround Sears Point
International Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., NHRA Pro Stock driver
Warren Johnson of Duluth just keeps improving with age. The
55-year-old GM Goodwrench Service Plus Pontiac driver scored his
fifth win of the season and the 68th of his career Sunday at the
Autolite Nationals. Johnson's victory tied him with Funny Car
driver John Force for the No. 2 spot on the list of all-time NHRA
winners and put him 210 points ahead of No. 2 Jeg Coughlin with
1,098. Son Kurt Johnson of Lawrenceville is No. 3 with 780 points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native Whit Bazemore made it to the Funny Car finals
before his Team Winston Camaro Z28 was defeated by Cruz Pedregon.
Heavy on Bazemore's mind is the impending loss _ in 1999 _ of his
Winston sponsorship. ``It's an emotional weekend, and to finish it
on the upside is good,'' Bazemore said. ``I have six weeks to land
a corporate sponsor that's willing and has the ability and the need
and recognizes the benefits of going out there and really competing
for a Winston championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech star Tom Hammonds keeps getting better at
drag racing. The Minnesota Timberwolves power forward made it to
the second round of the Autolite Nationals in his Winnebago/Mac
Tools/ Kendall Camaro Z28, the second time in four races. Hammonds
debuted his Camaro in Columbus on June 12, qualified and won the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Road Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Joe Foster has been named chief driving instructor for the Panoz
Racing School and the Panoz Performance Driving School, replacing
Jeff Purner, who was named Road Atlanta's manager of new business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Motocross
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Lusk of Bainbridge finished third in the AMA Mazda Truck
Motocross at Troy, Ohio. Jeff Emig of Riverside, Calif., won the
event, taking first place in Moto 1 and 2. Lusk finished 4-3, and
second-place finisher Doug Henry of Oxford, Conn., finished 5-2.
Henry remains points leader after eight events with 316. Lusk and
Emig are tied for fifth with 262

 &HT;    Donnan: At least 6 recruits should play
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- Georgia football coach Jim Donnan said at
least six freshmen from the Bulldogs' highly regarded recruiting
class will play this season.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jasper Sanks of Columbus and quarterback Quincy
Carter of Decatur could have the best shots at extensive playing
time. Sanks, a Parade All-American at Carver High in 1996, attended
Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy last season. But Sanks, who
rushed for 5,043 yards during his prep career, reported to Athens a
few weeks ago a little heavier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disappointed that he's been in Athens this summer
and hasn't worked like our other players have worked,'' Donnan
said. ``I'm disappointed that he's not further along in his
conditioning. For him to be the kind of player we need him to be,
he needs to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanks reported at 230 pounds; Donnan wants him at 220.
</P>
<P>
   Sanks' emergence could be a key for the Bulldogs, who might be
forced to run early while developing an inexperienced quarterback.
Also returning in the backfield are senior Olandis Gary, junior
Patrick Pass and senior Ronnie Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good that we're going to build our offense around what
our quarterback can do and not what he can't do,'' Donnan said.
``We've always been pretty balanced, but we might be a little more
stubborn about running the ball even if it's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia already has received a big boost, because freshmen
offensive lineman Jon Stinchcomb of Parkview High and linebacker
Boss Bailey of Charlton County High, who suffered serious knee
injuries as high school seniors, both appear ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said freshman cornerback Tim Wansley of Buford and
first-year linebacker William Witherspoon of Panama City, Fla.,
also could receive extensive playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Champ
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said junior cornerback Champ Bailey of Folkston would
probably play ``25 to 30 percent'' of the time on offense this
season. Bailey, an All-America candidate on defense, had 12 catches
for 234 yards last season, including two clutch receptions in
Georgia's 27-24 win at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best big-play guy that we've got,'' Donnan said.
``You need to have a guy like that when you've got a young
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   First commitment
</P>
<P>
   Georgia received its first verbal commitment, from defensive end
Shedrick Wynn of Lincoln County High. Wynn, 6-4, 235 pounds, is the
cousin of former Bulldogs running back Garrison Hearst. He also was
recruited by Tennessee, Clemson, Louisville, Georgia Tech and South
Carolina. Wynn had 76 tackles and 11 sacks as a junior.

 &HT;    Mumme keeps QB out of spotlight
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The conspicuous absence of quarterback Tim
Couch from SEC Media Days on Wednesday could be just the first of
several gestures from Kentucky coach Hal Mumme to bring attention
to other players and to lend some normalcy to what figures to be an
increasing spotlight for the junior quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, who will have his own conference call with reporters next
week, was left home in favor of one of his main blockers, offensive
tackle Kris Comstock, and free safety Willie Gary.
</P>
<P>
   It underlined Mumme's assertion that the Wildcats, who were a
surprising 5-6 in his first season, have to present more than a
one-man show to build on the excitement of a high-flying passing
attack. Even if that one man threw for 3,884 yards and 37
touchdowns, and led the nation in pass attempts, completions,
yardage and a completion percentage of 66.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought never really crossed my mind that you guys would
want to talk to him,'' Mumme deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the questions were about Couch anyway, especially
about his candidacy for the Heisman Trophy. ``It's a great honor,
but football's a team sport,'' Mumme said.
</P>
<P>
   Strange feeling
</P>
<P>
   Since he got the Arkansas job in December, new top Razorback
Houston Nutt estimates that he has spoken to about 79 booster clubs
and groups around the state to drum up support for the program. But
it's nothing like the lengths he went to to get students to turn
out for games when he was at Division I-AA Murray State 1992-96.
</P>
<P>
   There, students were noticeably absent from games, until he
started making his rounds on fraternity row, at one house in
particular. ``They invited me to come at 12 midnight, even though I
thought 7 p.m. was more reasonable,'' Nutt said. ``They said,
'Coach, we don't get started around here until midnight.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Nutt arrived at the house, he was instructed to enter
through a window and then onto the roof, where he was handed a
bullhorn to invite students to a game the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was great,'' he said. ``It broke the student record. I
think we had about 3,000 students come out. I'd do it at Arkansas,
if I had to. But I don't think I'll have to.''

 &HT;    Tennessee turnout pleases officials
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though a massive downpour diminished the gate, the 3,757
spectators in Chattanooga on July 22 for a quarterfinal
doubleheader of the U.S Open Cup sent an encouraging signal about
interest in soccer as a spectator sport in the South.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opinion of a high-ranking U.S. Soccer Federation
official who is seeking the group's presidency next month. Current
executive vice president Larry Monaco, who attended the
doubleheader at Finley Stadium, said that outside of the Major
League Soccer markets, little has been done to attract soccer fans
to major competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons we came here,'' he said. ``We've got
to spread the game around. We can't keep going to MLS cities and
over-saturating them.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures in Chattanooga to see four MLS teams stacked up well
with those the same night in Dallas, an MLS city, where only 3,812
showed up at the Cotton Bowl for the other quarterfinal matches,
including one with the hometown Burn.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament semifinals will be held next week at a
10,000-seat stadium in New Orleans, and the finals are scheduled
for Aug. 26 in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Five figures again
</P>
<P>
   Women's World Cup organizers got some better news from the
Goodwill Games this week than the 2-0 win by the U.S. over China
would indicate. The crowd of better than 11,000 on Long Island
Tuesday is the sixth five-figure crowd the women have played in
front of this season at home, a positive sign about attendance
projections for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 tickets have been sold for the Women's World
Cup, which will be played in seven cities. All first-round matches
will be played in a doubleheader format to ensure a healthier gate,
although there are concerns about the draw for games not involving
the U.S. or other favorites _ Germany, Norway, China, Italy and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey kicks it around
</P>
<P>
   Anyone doubting Disney's interest in attaching itself to soccer
should tune in the MLS All-Star weekend in Orlando. The typical
all-star fare that includes a Celebrity Rock 'n' Soccer game is on
tap at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   It starts at 8 p.m. Friday on ESPN2, which will show a highlight
program of the first half of the MLS season Saturday at 10 a.m.
ESPN will air a players' skills challenge Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The all-star game is taking a page from the National Hockey
League, featuring MLS stars from the U.S. against the league's best
international competitors. The game at the Florida Citrus Bowl
begins at 2:30 p.m. Sunday on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   MLS and Disney recently extended a television contract with
ABC/ESPN/ESPN2 through the year 2000. Disney also is interested in
pursuing a possible expansion franchise in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo has no regrets
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's 3-0 loss in the World Cup finals was considered
``disastrous'' enough for coach Mario Zagallo and his entire staff
to get the pink slip Tuesday. But the white-haired veteran of all
four Brazilian World Cup triumphs, either as a player or coach,
insists he'll hold his head high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not walking away distraught. I've been to five World Cup
finals, with four wins and a runner-up finish. I'm very proud of
what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama fined
</P>
<P>
   After the Miami Fusion fired coach ``Cacho'' Cordoba last week,
Colombian center Carlos Valderrama sulked, missing two practices
and getting left out of Sunday's win over New England. On Tuesday,
he received an MLS record fine of $10,000 for his absences.

 &HT;    Tyson snaps during hearing
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In his quest to show that he now has``good
character, honesty, integrity and responsibility,'' as mandated by
the statutes of the New Jersey Athletic Commission, Mike Tyson made
one fatal mistake Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He failed to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, appearing before state officials in an attempt to regain
the boxing license he lost last year after biting Evander Holyfield
twice, was on his best behavior for 3 1/2 hours at the Hughes
Justice Complex.
</P>
<P>
   Then he snapped. After Anthony Fusco, the fighter's attorney,
asked the commission rhetorically, ``How many times should one man
have to (answer), `Are you sorry for what you did?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson nodded approvingly and vented, ``You know what I mean,
man? Why do I have to relive my (bleeping). ...''
</P>
<P>
   Fusco immediately put his hand on Tyson's shoulder and cautioned
him to ``relax.'' The lawyer then said he felt too frustrated to
read a statement he intended for his closing remarks and told the
commission, ``It's one thing to criticize (Tyson), but you don't
want to look for a crucifixion, and that's the frustration that you
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tyson's outburst, it would be surprising if New Jersey
rejected his application. He has maintained a relatively low
profile in the past year and the amount of dollars he generates for
the sport and any local economy hosting one of his fights is
unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
   Three board members of the New Jersey commission will meet in a
closed session Aug. 6 to determine Tyson's fate and will announce a
decision within two days.
</P>
<P>
   Even Holyfield, who has the greatest reason to hold a grudge
against Tyson, thinks that Tyson has been ``sufficiently penalized
over the past year,'' according to a brief letter signed by him
that Fusco entered into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson had his license revoked by Nevada for at least one year
and was fined $3 million after his disqualification loss to
Holyfield in June 1997 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson camp members deny they are trying to circumvent Nevada and
made the same claim to New Jersey officials. Tyson has said he
always enjoyed fighting in Atlantic City but hasn't had a bout
there since a December 1990 win over Alex Stewart. Then came the
rape trial, three years in prison, a lucrative deal with the MGM in
Las Vegas upon his return and promoter Don King's inability to
obtain a promoter's license in New Jersey because of legal
problems. If the license is granted, Tyson figures to fight a
non-ranked fighter before the end of the year and at least one more
warmup bout before possibly pursuing a title fight. A third fight
against Holyfield remains a long shot for financial and logistical
reasons. Holyfield is interested in only three bouts: mandatory
defenses against Vaughn Bean and Henry Akinwande to retain his IBF
and WBA belts, and a unification fight against Lennox Lewis next
spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
   However, some people still find repulsive the idea of Tyson
making millions again. Bear Atwood, one of 10 members of the New
Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women picketing
outside the judicial building, wore a button that read, ``Stop
honoring and rewarding violent athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't even make it through a hearing without losing it,''
Atwood said. ``We're suppose to believe that he's now under
control? How does he meet the criteria of having good character?''
</P>
<P>
   Fusco tried to portray Tyson as an angelic creature, lining up
seven character witnesses to testify. All were either Tyson's
friends or had financial ties to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Rotman, a New Jersey psychologist, asked if he would be
compensated for his court appearance, replied, ``I hope so.'' Asked
how much, Rotman said, ``I have to go back and work out a bill,''
drawing laughter from an audience of approximately 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who wore a dark gray suit and a black shirt, wasn't
quizzed until nearly three hours into the hearing and answered
questions for 45 minutes. He appeared to grow irritated as Haas
went over every detail of his rape conviction and the ear-biting
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ear bite, Tyson reiterated that he thought that
Holyfield head-butted him in their two fights. ``I don't even know
why I bit Mr. Holyfield. I don't even know how I did it. I went
berserk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the head-butts, Tyson said, ``I was blacking out. I
was getting light-headed. I snapped. ... I'm very sorry. My life
has been devastated by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the rape conviction and Holyfield fight had
changed him, Tyson said, ``Both of those ordeals ruined my life
internally. Do you think I want to do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   The character witnesses said he felt remorseful. Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's new adviser, said the boxer rejected multiple offers ``in
excess of $10 million each'' for Tyson to fight in Russia,
Scandinavia, Germany and the Middle East in the past year because
he wanted to serve the penalty.

 &HT;    Speed is name of IRL game
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Cheever Jr. was cruising around the speedy, asphalt
Atlanta Motor Speedway quad-oval Wednesday afternoon. On a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   This was a guy who was going to zoom around later at speeds of
220 mph or better, but the bike served a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for bumps,'' the 1998 Indy 500 winner said,
``and working on race strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever and some of his Indy Racing League (IRL) competitors
were in Atlanta on Tuesday and Wednesday, practicing for the Aug.
29 Atlanta 500 Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while IRL drivers practiced on a track used
primarily by stock cars, NASCAR drivers were at Indy getting ready
for the Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   For the stock-car drivers it was a trip to America's hallowed
racing mecca.
</P>
<P>
   For the IRL drivers, it was a chance to really feed that need
for speed.
</P>
<P>
   The good ol' boys will probably be the bigger draw this year.
AMS general manager Ed Clark said, ``I'll be pleased if we can have
about 50,000'' attend the IRL race. That many were at Charlotte
last week.
</P>
<P>
   It's a getting-acquainted process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Cheever said. ``That's the future for you. Race
fans will have more types of racing available.''
</P>
<P>
   And the speed. Last week, IRL drivers averaged 214 mph.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, it will be faster, Cheever said, because of the
smoother surface _ ``flat as my mother's pancakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't get no better than this,'' said the American, who was
raised in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It will be something racing fans this far south normally don't
see or hear _ open-wheel racing under the lights at lightning
speeds. Cheever predicted that the driver who can average 218 mph
will win.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and eighteen mph. Stock cars might get in the 190s
at AMS on a test run, but IRL drivers will go into the turns at
220, three abreast.
</P>
<P>
   Clark compared the IRL cars' swiftness to F-16s. They swoop
around the track with their trademark throaty roar, reeking of raw
power, produced by four-liter, 32-valve Oldsmobile Aurora V-8
engines. A.J. Foyt, who has raced everything and won almost
everything, had his team here and was enthusiastic about the
renovated AMS. ``These cars work a lot better than stock cars,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Michigan 500 tragedy last weekend _ when three
spectators were killed by hurtling debris _ safety is a big factor.
AMS' track is surrounded by a sharply angled safety fence.
</P>
<P>
   As for fan turnout, Foyt has this to say: ``Atlanta is like
Houston. If you don't come up with something special, they won't
come out.''

CELLUCCI WON'T RELEASE SOFT-MONEY LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In his first public comments on the issue Wednesday,
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci declined to release the list of large
corporate and individual donations he solicited for a Republican
Governors Association fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who has denounced the use of such soft-money donations
in campaigns, referred all inquiries to the governor's association,
saying only the Washington-based group can release the names.
``That's up to them,'' Cellucci said. ``It's their list.''
</P>
<P>
   Association officials would only point to their filings at the
Federal Election Commission, but those lists do not indicate which
donations were solicited by Cellucci or his fundraising team.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged Cellucci skirted state campaign finance
laws that require disclosure by raising the money. The donations,
which ranged up to $40,000 for the June 26 Boston event, were to be
deposited into a national Republican fund that is used to
distribute money back to state campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Patricia McGovern
joined the chorus of candidates and others who are demanding
Cellucci release the list of donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hide it, to launder it....is a disgrace,'' McGovern said.
She said much of the national GOP's soft-money funds are from
controversial special interests groups like the gun lobby, tobacco
industry, and major polluters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know, did the gun lobby give to Paul Cellucci?''
McGovern told reporters at a State House press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Democratic candidate, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger and former US Representative Brian J. Donnelly, have
also called on Cellucci to release the list. So has his Republican
rival, state Treasurer Joseph D. Malone.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci lashed back at McGovern and the others, saying they
must first get a commitment from the state Democratic Party that it
will not use the soft-money donations that it has already and will
continue to pour into Massachusetts. ``Then come back to me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci cited a statement by Democratic national chairman Steve
Grossman that the party is going to use soft money to win back the
governorship in Massachusetts. ``What is she going to do about
that?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern has said that if she wins the nomination she will call
on the state committee not to use any soft-money donations whose
source is not made public.

TRW MAY CUSHION ARIZONA WORKERS FROM JOB CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER AND CRAIG ANDERSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - One of Mesa's biggest private employers said
Wednesday that it will cut 7,500 workers worldwide and close up to
21 factories in its automotive division.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing use of automotive air bags may cushion the blow
to TRW Inc.'s 3,500 workers in east Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking primarily at where our sales are and
aren't,'' company spokesman Jay McCaffrey said. ``Air bags are a
very good product for TRW.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which workers or plants will be affected, McCaffrey added,
``At this point, it's impossible for me to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The company plans on announcing details of the cutbacks, which
amount to 14 percent of its workforce, later this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland-based conglomerate, which makes a wide variety of
products for space, defense and information systems, is targeting
its automotive products group based on ever-shrinking profits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few growth areas in the division has been air bags,
especially those used for side-impact crashes. TRW, the largest
maker of U.S. air bags, produced 19 million air bags worldwide in
1997, up from 13 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But growth in the business doesn't guarantee jobs for TRW's Mesa
employees, who make parts for inflatable air bags used in both the
driver and passenger side of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, TRW laid off about 20 workers in Mesa as part of a
1 percent North American workforce reduction in the inflatible
restraint division. And last week, an additional 100 employees took
a voluntary one-month layoff with health and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   TRW spokeswoman Linda Ellerbusch said there are no indications
that employees who voluntarily left now would be cut permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anticipating the return of all our employees,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   TRW built its first factory in Mesa in 1989. It expanded in the
Phoenix area with a second facility two years later. The area has
the largest of TRW's six U.S. air-bag manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several years, the company has been fined for
multiple safety violations after an explosion of sodium-azide
propellant resulted in the death of a construction worker in 1994.
Several others also were injured.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the labor dispute between the United Auto Workers
and General Motors Corp. prompted the company to ask for volunteers
to take a month off without pay. It also eliminated 400 jobs at a
seat-belt plant in Mexico, and its second-quarter earnings slipped
6 percent due, in part, to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown has led to rumors that more cutbacks were in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me at all,'' said a former manager laid
off in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were originally going to trim 1 percent on the
engineering side,'' he said. ``I was in that 1 percent. Then I
heard they were going to trim the manufacturing side 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   TRW CEO Peter Hellerman has said that cost cutting is his top
goal for the year.
</P>
<P>
   TRW will take a pre-tax charge of $125 million to $150 million
in the next year to cover the plant closing and severance packages
for affected workers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street anaylsts applauded the move. Its stock closed at 54
and 7/8, up 3/8 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something they need to do and if they don't do it,
they're goisng to continue to suffer,'' said Brian Eisenbarth, an
analyst with Collins &AMP; Co. in San Francisco. ``They need to get
costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Casey, an analyst with Midwest Research in Cleveland,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better that they take a hard swallow and follow
through on the actions that they announced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Casey and Eisenbarth said they forecast continued growth in
air bag sales, especially in side-impact units.
</P>
<P>
   Both also agreed that problems with worker safety and explosions
will not make either TRW factory in Mesa more of a target than
other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll look at it from more of an operating-cost
perspective,'' said Casey. &QL;

TYSON'S TEMPER MAY HAVE UNDERCUT LICENSE BID AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Mike Tyson, displaying the same loss of control
that compelled him to bite off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear
and led to his banishment from boxing, testified Wednesday before
the State Athletic Control Board to apply for the reinstatement of
his New Jersey boxing license.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by two lawyers and a parade of character witnesses,
Tyson made his case inside the hearing room at the Richard J.
Hughes Justice Complex here.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts to portray him as a changed man who deserved the
right to fight again may have been undercut by a moody 35-minute
appearance that ranged from a near-tearful apology to an angry
outburst laced with an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not rule on Tyson's petition, delaying a decision
until it could convene in a private session on Aug. 6. The final
ruling could come two days later on Aug. 8, although the board has
45 days to render a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he did not reapply for a license in Nevada because he
wanted to make a fresh start. But his adviser, Shelly Finkel, said
Tyson might apply for a boxing license in other states in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a gallery of reporters and friends, including his
wife, Dr. Monica Tyson, and boxer Larry Holmes, Tyson at first
expressed remorse for biting Holyfield's ear in a heavyweight bout
on June 28, 1997, an act that prompted Nevada to revoke his
license.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson said he did it only after constant head butting from
Holyfield made his ``head foggy and incoherent'' and that he became
``desperate, irate and I just snapped. Nothing really mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tyson seemed to choke back tears when talking
about how his life had been irrevocably altered by the events on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry for what I did,'' Tyson said. ``It will haunt me for
the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Haas, an assistant attorney general, asked Tyson if
he thought he would ever commit a similar act if he were granted a
New Jersey boxing license, Tyson said: ``I doubt it. My life has
been devastated over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bertram Rotman, a Wayne, N.J., psychologist who evaluated
Tyson for an hour on July 21, testified that he saw no reason why
Tyson shouldn't get his license back, and Raymond Reddin, one of
Tyson's lawyers, read a brief letter from Holyfield that said the
fighter did not object to Tyson's getting a license from New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although he slumped forward on the table occasionally, Tyson
patiently sat through the three-and-a-half-hour proceeding, and
withstood a 43-minute questioning from Haas before he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Haas' questions centered around Tyson's 1992 conviction
in Indiana for the rape of Desiree Washington and the biting
incident with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who was dressed in a gray pinstriped suit and wearing a
black T-shirt, twice complained of the cold temperature in the
room. But following the questioning from Haas, Tyson reached a slow
boil. When Haas asked him if he wanted to make a final statement,
Tyson declined, saying he was too angry to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later as one of his lawyers, Anthony Fusco, was
delivering an impassioned closing statement Tyson couldn't contain
his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was wrong,'' Fusco said. ``But how many times does
one individual have to hear `Are you sorry for what you did?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson angrily interjected, agreeing with Fusco: ``You know what
I mean, man? Why do I have to relive my. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Tyson uttered an expletive, Fusco reached over and
stopped him and told the panel hearing the petition that Tyson was
not angry at them, but was merely expressing the frustration that
had built up in him during his exile from the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a hastily called news conference in the lobby of the
Hughes Justice Complex, Tyson said he used the wrong choice of
words when he told the panel that he was too angry to deliver a
final statement in his own behalf. As for the outburst and the
expletive, Tyson said: ``I never lost my cool. I was just
expressing my hurt, if anything.''
</P>

<P>
   Wednesday's public hearing, which drew a throng of fans and
protesters from the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization
for Women, attracted great news media interest, with television
satellite broadcast trucks crowding the sidewalk outside the
building and banks of television cameras corralled by wooden
barricades inside. The proceeding was broadcast live by ESPN,
CNN-SI and Fox News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hazzard, New Jersey State Boxing commissioner, said the
board decided to hold a public hearing on Tyson's request because
it wanted to avoid the appearance that Tyson was getting a
back-room deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson is allowed to return to boxing, it will be a boon to
the casino economy in Atlantic City. Tyson hasn't held a New Jersey
boxing license since 1991. His last bout in New Jersey came on Dec.
8, 1990, against Alex Stewart. Finkel said if Tyson gets his
license back, his first bout would be in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under state commission rules and New Jersey law, Tyson has to
provide ``clear and convincing evidence of good character, honesty,
responsibility and integrity'' in order to get a New Jersey boxing
license.
</P>
<P>
   There was a videotaped statement attesting to Tyson's honesty
and good character from Camille Ewald, the 93-year-old woman who
ran the house in Catskill, N.Y., where Cus D'Amato trained the
young Tyson. And there was an explanation from Chuck Wepner and
Bobby Czyz as to why a boxer would do what Tyson did to Holyfield
during a bout.
</P>
<P>
   Czyz, a television boxing analyst, described it as ``performance
blackout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world title fight, if I hit an opponent and his eye fell
out of his head, I'd eat it before he could pick it up and put it
back in,'' Czyz said regarding the state of mind that boxers have
during a title bout. &QL;

 &HT;    HEALTH GAP WIDENS BETWEEN RICHER, POORER

   WASHINGTON _ Americans' health seems to be getting better, but
low-income families or those less educated aren't benefiting as
much, according to a government report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services found record high
life expectancy, with a narrowing gap between whites and blacks;
record low infant mortality rates, and declining death rates for
heart disease, cancer, AIDS and firearm-related casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The life expectancy for all Americans reached 76.1 years, with
males born now expected to live 73.1 years and women 79.1 years.
The long-standing gap between blacks and whites has narrowed to
about six and a half years, or 76.8 years for whites and 70.2 years
for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1996, the leading cause of death, heart disease,
decreased 12 percent from 152 to 134 per 100,000 people. Deaths
from cancer, the second leading cause, declined 5 percent, from 135
to 128 per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1996, deaths from HIV infection, which causes AIDS,
dropped about 30 percent, from 73 to 51 per 100,000 adults aged 25
to 44. It declined from the first to the third leading cause of
death for people in this age group after accidents and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Firearm-related deaths dropped from 14.6 to 12.9 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is improving in America along many fronts, and our
challenge is to share that progress as widely as possible,'' said
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in issuing the
annual report, titled ``Health, United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This comprehensive report shows the progress we're making, but
it also documents the strong relationship between socioeconomic
status and health in the United States for every race and ethnic
group studied.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found those with low incomes or less education have
more health risk factors _ such as a sedentary life style and
cigarette smoking _ were not as likely to have health insurance or
receive preventive care, and were more likely to report unmeet
health care needs.
</P>
<P>
   The report found:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cigarette smoking declined among adults 25 and older between
the years 1974 and 1995, but the decline was greater for more
educated adults. In 1995, roughly one out of four adults with less
than a high school education smoked, compared to one out of seven
who completed college.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low birth weight and infant death rates were higher among
children of less-educated mothers than more-educated mothers.
Mothers that did not finish high school were about 50 percent more
likely to have low-birth weight children than college-educated
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Young children in low-income families had greater exposure to
environmental lead and elevated blood-lead levels.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Children in low-income families were more likely to be without
a regular source of health care than children in higher-income
families. Roughly 12 percent of children in families with incomes
below the federal poverty level did not have a regular source of
health care compared to 4 percent of children in families with
incomes at least twice the poverty level.

CLARENCE THOMAS RESPONDS ANGRILY TO HIS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., La.)  (mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ In an explosion of pent-up anger, Justice
Clarence Thomas on Wednesday lashed out at his critics, both black
and white, saying they were racists who have been unable to accept
the notion that he is able to think for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to have my ideas assigned to me because I am black,''
he told an audience of several hundred black judges and lawyers.
His critics, he said, have subjected him to particularly ``bilious
and venomous assaults'' because his conservative views and judicial
opinions since he joined the court in 1991 do not conform to what
is expected of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Up until Wednesday, Thomas has generally confined his public
speeches to small and friendly audiences. But in speaking before
the National Bar Association, the nation's largest group of black
lawyers, Thomas was facing a very mixed group, some of whom had
openly protested his invitation to address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, Thomas said, have engaged in what he called silly
speculation that he must be taking his cues and ideas from other
conservative justices on the court who are white. ``What else could
be the explanation when I fail to follow their ideology or
anti-intellectual prescription,'' he said. ``The stench of racial
inferiority still confounds my olfactory nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' troubled relationship with his fellow black Americans
was on vivid public display in his appearance before the annual
convention of the bar association. It was an event to which he had
been invited months ago, only to have a large and prominent group
of members attempt to have the invitation rescinded. He told the
audience of more than 2,000 that it had become a wearisome ritual
that when he is invited to speak publicly, people seek to deny him
that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that his acceptance of Wednesday's invitation
was like when he was younger and ``tired of turning the other
cheek.'' As for those who have said he has forgotten his black
roots, he said they were engaging in ``psychosilliness'' and
probably had too much time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although his delivery was calm, his words Wednesday were harsher
than ever before. At one point he said his critics were
``illiterate'' and that many of them had been ``half-steppers'' in
earlier times, a black expression meaning they were craven
appeasers of white people.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Thomas said, ``Despite some of the
nonsense that has been said about me, I am a man, I am a black man,
I am an American.'' He added, ``Isn't it time to move on? To be
angry with me solves no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the audience applauded, some standing, while the
other half remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the speech, several hundred lawyers and
judges went into an adjoining room to hear Thomas' critics analyze
his work and compare him unfavorably to the man he replaced on the
court, Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leon Higginbotham, the former chief judge of the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia, and one of Thomas'
most consistent critics, said Thomas was deceptive in his speech
Wednesday. He had said his critics purposely misinterpreted his
dissent in a 1992 case in which he wrote that it was not a
violation of the Constitution's proscription against ``cruel and
unusual punishment'' when a black prisoner was beaten by guards. He
described the injuries as minor, but Higginbotham said that the
shackled prisoner was beaten so badly his dental plate was broken,
his lips were burst and some teeth were loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham had argued before Wednesday's event that it was a
mistake to have Thomas be the bar association's keynote speaker
because that would bestow an undeserved honor on someone whose
rulings on the court ``have done more to turn back the clock of
racial progress than any other African-American public official in
the history of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernette Johnson, a member of the Louisiana Supreme Court and
chairwoman of the bar association's judicial council, said she knew
the choice of speaker would be controversial. But Ms. Johnson said
that she did not view extending the invitation as an honor to
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she said, ``It gives us a chance to interact with a
Supreme Court justice and dialogue is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   But like most of those who supported the invitation , Ms.
Johnson said she disagreed strongly with Thomas' views and his
writings on the Supreme Court. ``I'm not an apologist for him,''
she said. ``I'm just saying he has a right to say what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Bar Association opposed Thomas' confirmation to the
court when he was nominated in 1991, largely over his conservative
views and outspoken opposition to affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas offered a fervent defense of his views against
affirmative action programs Wednesday, telling the audience that
such programs are inevitably based on black inferiority and are
``non-starters in my view. I do not believe kneeling is a position
of strength and I do not believe that begging is an effective
tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' opponents have said his views on affirmative action are
particularly galling since he was a major beneficiary of such
programs, including his admission to Yale Law School under an
explicit set-aside program for minority students. Keith Watters, a
Washington lawyer and a former president of the National Bar
Association, said that he decided at the last minute to picket the
speech outside the hotel because he found Thomas' views so
hypocritical.

TRIPP DEFENDS TAPING HER CONVERSATIONS WITH LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-STARR, CLINTON-MOOD, CLINTON-TALKINGPOINTS) 
(sw) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, the woman whose secret tape recordings
of Monica Lewinsky started the sex-and-perjury investigation of
President Clinton, emerged on Wednesday from her eighth and final
day of grand jury testimony and told America to think of her as
Everywoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm you,'' Mrs. Tripp said in a bitter apologia outside the
federal courthouse. ``I'm just like you. I'm an average American
who found herself in a situation not of her own making. I'm a
suburban mom, who was a military wife for 20 years, and a faithful
government employee for 18 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Pentagon assistant complained that she had been
vilified by middle America for tape-recording the confidences of
her close friend and colleague, mocked by late-night comedians for
her physical appearance and attacked as untruthful by the
president's personal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But in her dramatic statement before reporters and
photographers, Mrs. Tripp portrayed herself as a victim of
circumstances, a reluctant witness to wrongdoing and a nonpartisan
patriot who is without malice or a political agenda and whose only
motive is the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has never been, quote, `just about sex,' ''
she said, her hands shaking, her voice halting as she struggled to
catch her breath while reading from a prepared text. ``It has been
about telling the truth, the truth matters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I have been vilified for taking the path of truth.
I've been maligned by people who have chosen not to tell the truth,
and who know that they are not telling the truth. That's a pretty
frightening thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Banished in 1994 from the White House to a basement cubicle in
the Pentagon, Mrs. Tripp quietly laid plans two years later to
write a tell-all book chronicling what she believed were the
secrets and lies of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   She hinted at those events on Wednesday, saying, ``I became
aware between 1993 and 1997 of actions by high government officials
that may have been against the law.'' Knowledge of those events,
she added, ``made me increasingly fearful that this information was
dangerous, very dangerous to possess.''
</P>
<P>
   The day last January when she approached the Office of the
Independent Counsel was the day she decided that ``fear would no
longer be my master,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not explain exactly why she turned on a friend and began
tape-recording their telephone conversations. But she praised Ms.
Lewinsky for her decision to testify before the grand jury about
her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged that it appears from press reports that Monica
has decided to cooperate with the independent counsel,'' Mrs. Tripp
said. ``The facts will show that, time after time, I urged her to
tell the truth right up until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With her son, Ryan, and daughter, Allison, her two lawyers and a
press spokesman standing behind her, Mrs. Tripp used the occasion
not only to proclaim her own innocence but to point fingers at
others, including Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I am just like you, I ask you to imagine how you would
feel if someone you thought was a friend urged you to commit a
felony that could jeopardize your job, potentially put you in jail
and endanger the well being of your children,'' Mrs. Tripp said, an
apparent reference to a suggestion by Ms. Lewinsky that Mrs. Tripp
deny any knowledge of a sexual relationship between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how you would feel if your employer illegally released
your confidential records to the media, then demoted you and cast
you aside for daring to tell the truth,'' she said of her bosses at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon insists that it did not demote Mrs. Tripp from her
$88,137-a-year job, but had changed the job description to
acquiesce to her request to work at home after the scandal broke.
But the Pentagon did tell reporters that Mrs. Tripp may have lied
on a security clearance form in 1987 when she said she had never
been arrested. (She was arrested when she was 19 on a charge of
grand larceny; the case was dismissed).
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how you would feel if your boss' attorney called you a
liar in front of the whole country,'' she said of a statement last
year by Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer, that she was not
believable. ``And imagine if that boss was the president of the
United States.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Tripp expressed anger about the way in which she
has been publicly portrayed. She charged ``people'' whom she did
not name with enlisting `'legions of paid prevaricators'' to attack
her. And she expressed hurt that entertainers had chosen to
ridicule her, ``going so far as to even make fun of my appearance
in a manner so mean and so cruel that I pray none of you is ever
subjected to it.''

   UNDATED - Maybe you watched the Powerball drawing last night,
like I did, checked the winning numbers against your tickets and
cursed your rotten luck.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you'd made a special trip to the convenience store on your
way home from work in order to buy the tickets. Maybe that caused
you to be late and your family ate dinner without you and by the
time you got home they were all watching TV or talking on the
telephone or out somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you didn't even tell them you'd bought the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   You wanted to surprise them.
</P>
<P>
   You pictured yourself sneaking into the living room in the
middle of the night and blasting ``For the Love of Money'' by the
O'Jays on the stereo until they all woke up wondering what the heck
was going on and found you out there holding the winning ticket
above your head shouting ``WE'RE RICH!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But, you didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   You never win, except in your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you pictured yourself buying news houses and new cars for
family and close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you even made a secret pact with God concerning the many
charitable deeds you planned to perform after winning Powerball.
You genuinely believe a person with money has that kind of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you figured having the Big Guy on your side could go a
long way toward improving your luck.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So, you tore up the tickets and tossed them in the trash and
told no one. When asked, you said you didn't buy any tickets
because lotteries are for saps who have never won a thing in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Like you.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you'll leave work and drive straight home.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that means you have a job and a car and a place to
live. And, if you drive, you must be relatively healthy. If you
weren't, the lottery would be the last thing on your mind.
</P>
<P>
   When you get home your kids will be there.
</P>
<P>
   And a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   They're healthy too.
</P>
<P>
   You have food on the table and telephone service and a TV.
</P>
<P>
   You have a few extra bucks in your pocket, or did, until you
stopped by the the convenience store to buy lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning were 80 million to 1 but you laid your money
down anyway, thinking you might get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   You had a 5,000 to 1 chance of being killed in a car crash on
your way to buy the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   You weren't.
</P>
<P>
   You had a 2 million to 1 chance of being sucked up by a tornado
before you got home.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen, either.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the drawing, you could have fallen out of bed
and died. The odds of that happening also were 2 million to 1. The
same as getting killed by a wild animal.
</P>
<P>
   Life is a crap shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's life.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering what the odds were that my grandfathers would make
it out of hill towns in Italy all those years ago, onto boats and
over to America.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know each other in the old country. Imagine the
probability that each of them would wind up in Pittsburgh working
in the same steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, it was a long shot for the children of poor
families to survive, but the babies who would become my mother and
father did.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came along, and by the wildest chance bumped into a
beautiful brown-eyed girl.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have two kids and a house and a car and a few extra
bucks in your pocket to blow on games of chance, which you never
win because you're unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe the unlucky ones aren't those with the wrong
Powerball numbers, but those who hit the lottery a long time ago,
and still don't know it. &QL;

COMMENTARY: RUSSIA'S JEWISH POLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: bold-faced words are italicized) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ I am not Yevgeny Primakov's favorite columnist. In a
recent interview with my New York Times colleagues, Russia's
foreign minister brandished a piece I wrote about his scheme to
sell missiles to Cyprus _ thereby to ignite a war between Greece
and Turkey _ and characterized it as `` &UR; glupo &LR; .'' Although his
interpreter gentled that down to ``unwise,'' the Russian word means
``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying reason for his irritation is probably a
biographical aside I filed last year about his name: Primakov is
the Ukrainian word for ``stepson.'' He adopted that name because
the one he was born with _ Finkelstein _ was hardly useful to a KGB
espionage agent under cover as a Pravda correspondent in the Arab
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the sensitivity of many other Russian politicians to
their Jewish parentage is changing. This was dramatized in the last
presidential campaign when the reformer Grigory Yavlinsky pointed
to the nutty nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and said, ``Both of
us are half Jewish, but I'm the one who admits it.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the IMF bailout, Anatoly Chubais, is listed in
the ``Jewish Encyclopedia of Russia.'' So is his archrival, Boris
Berezovsky, the equally unpopular auto-and-oil tycoon who took
Israeli citizenship five years ago and has since been appointed to
powerful Russian posts. Berezovsky warned Boris Nemtsov, the
charismatic reformer elected to be governor of Nizhny Novgorod, not
to run for president because he has ``a purely genetic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov shrugs this off. ``In the first stage of your entry into
politics,'' he told me the other day in his Moscow White House
office, ``they look at your biography. But after you've been on TV
a hundred times, they forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet 40, Nemtsov was brought to Moscow by Boris Yeltsin and
now tries to bring reform to the energy sector as deputy prime
minister. His popularity in national polls has dipped with the
state of the shaky economy, but is little affected by the public's
knowledge that he is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   When asked as far back as January by Yeltsin's chief of staff to
put down five names as choices for a replacement to Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin (who did not know his head was on the block),
Nemtsov included in his list Sergei Kiriyenko, an energetic
executive in his mid-30s who had worked with him in Nizhny, who
comes from a Jewish family.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chernomyrdin had earlier thought Kiriyenko to be too
young to be a deputy minister of oil and gas, Nemtsov saw him as
``smart, honest, liberal.'' Yeltsin, looking for a shaker-upper
with no political base, stunned the world by making Kiriyenko his
prime minister. Criticism centered on his youth and political
inexperience, and on Yeltsin's seeming impulsiveness, but not on
the new man's ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean? Nobody can claim that Russia, home of the
pogrom and the Pale and Stalin's ``anti-cosmopolitanism'' campaign,
has suddenly lost its deep-rooted prejudices, or that nearly a
million Jews were  &UR; glupo &LR;  to abandon Russia in this decade for
security and opportunity in Israel and America.
</P>
<P>
   When a bomb exploded two months ago at Moscow's Marina Roshche
synagogue, a Communist member of the Duma said ominously: ``For
some reason, priority is bestowed on one nationality _ Jews.
Unfortunately, I do not rule out that there may be more
explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Communists are in decline and the more opportunistic
exploit bigotry against Muslims, usually darker-skinned Russians
from the Caucasus. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a nationalist
presidential hopeful who is trying to drain off Communist voters,
put on a skullcap and attended synagogue services to make Moscow's
300,000 Jews (few religious) feel more secure.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment is directed at manipulative oligarchs like Berezovsky
who dominate the economy; few of them assert their Jewishness,
though media mogul Vladimir Gosinsky leads Russia's Jewish
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In tough economic times, this general acceptance of Jews in the
full glare of Russian politics suggests a cultural change for the
better. As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright could tell her
counterpart Primakov, revelation of a Jewish background is no
handicap and should be no cause for embarrassment. That augurs well
for the beleaguered Russian people.

   CORRECTED WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 216.
WASHINGTON, July 29 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the
last week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNSAFETY
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, July 21, the Senate voted, 61-39, to table, or set
aside, an amendment that would have required handguns to be sold
with child-proof safety devices. Supporters of the amendment said
it would protect children from handgun accidents. Opponents said
the amendment was an unnecessary federal regulation and would not
accomplish its purpose. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside, or
rejecting, the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: GUNOWNERS
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, July 22, the Senate voted, 69-31, to table, or set
aside, a measure that would have allowed federal prosecution of gun
owners whose weapons were used by children in a crime, if the guns
were stored insecurely. Supporters of the measure said it would
have kept guns out of children's hands by requiring people to keep
their guns out of reach. Opponents argued that innocent people
could be held responsible if children found a way to access the
guns, even though they were properly stored. A ``yes'' vote favors
setting aside, or rejecting, the measure.

TRIPP DISMISSES CRITICS AS `PAID' LIARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky, bitterly dismissed critics of
her role in the investigation of President Clinton as ``paid
prevaricators.''
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional statement following her final day of grand jury
testimony in the sex and cover-up probe said she is not the villain
portrayed by her detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp described herself as a former military wife, a mother and
federal employee with no political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am you, I am just like you,'' Tripp said, looking into a
forest of TV cameras outside the U.S. District Courthouse. ``I am
an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been vilified for having taken the path of truth,'' she
said. ``I have been maligned by people who have chosen not to tell
the truth and who know they are not telling the truth. That is a
pretty frightening thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To cast me in the role of the villain, they have enlisted
legions of paid prevaricators,'' Tripp said. ``Not surprisingly,
many in the entertainment industry have chosen to ridicule me as
well, going so far as to even make fun of my appearance in a manner
so mean and so cruel that I pray none of you is ever subjected to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp said that during her tenure as a secretary in the Clinton
White House she ``became aware ... of actions by high government
officials that may have been against the law.'' This knowledge made
her ``increasingly fearful'' and she decided ``this information was
dangerous, extremely dangerous to possess.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in January, she contacted independent counsel Kenneth Starr,
who already was investigating Clinton's Arkansas business dealings.
Within days, Tripp agreed to turn over her tapes of Lewinsky's
conversations and cooperate with Starr as he expanded his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that fear would no longer be my master,'' said
Tripp, who was transferred in August 1994 from her White House job
to a position at the Pentagon, where records from her personnel
file were leaked to a reporter after the Lewinsky matter became
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how you would feel if your employer released your
records to the media, then demoted you,'' Tripp said, her voice
quavering and her hands shaking as she read her statement.
``Imagine how you would feel if your boss' attorney called you a
liar in front of the whole country. Imagine if that boss was the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp did not discuss her grand jury appearances except to say
she told the truth and was glad her testimony is over. She took no
questions, thus leaving unanswered why she made the tapes, whether
anyone put her up to it, and exactly what _ other than ``fear'' _
prompted her to go to prosecutors.

WRITER, HUMORIST REX LARDNER, 80, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mich., Minn., Ill., Calif.)  (jw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rex Lardner, a humorist who spent the better part of his life
doing what he did best and enjoyed most _ writing, playing tennis
and making people laugh _ died on Monday at the top of his game,
playing mixed doubles with his usual tenacious skill at a court
near his home in Great Neck, N.Y. He was 80 and the author of more
than a dozen books and hundreds of magazine articles.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of a storied literary family, Lardner, a nephew of
the celebrated humorist Ring Lardner and a cousin of acclaimed New
Yorker critic and Newsweek columnist John Lardner, could have been
forgiven if he had chosen a different line of work.
</P>
<P>
   But as a man who was funny by nature and competitive on
principle, he did not shrink from the challenge. And if he never
achieved spectacular success, he more than held his own. As the
chief radio and television writer for the innovative comedian Ernie
Kovacs, for example, he won a Sylvania Award in 1956 for creative
television technique. And one of his first books, ``Out of the
Bunker and Into the Trees,'' a 1960 parody of golf and golfers, was
considered so funny that various chapters have been widely
reprinted in sports magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wrote other golf books, including ``The Great
Golfers'' and ``Downhill Lies and Other Falsehoods,'' golf was
never his game, perhaps because he claimed to have discovered the
reason people played golf: ``to destroy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lardner, who also wrote ``Ten Heroes of the '20s,'' ``The
Legendary Champions,'' ``Ali'' and ``The Lardner Report,'' a
humorous account of life in the suburbs, was more in his element
writing about tennis and other racket sports. He wrote
instructional books on squash and badminton and several books on
tennis, among them, ``The Complete Guide to Tennis,'' ``How to
Attack Your Opponent's Weakness'' and ``Tactics in Women's Singles,
Doubles and Mixed Doubles,'' all of which mixed humor with
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an itinerant newspaperman, Lardner, was born in St.
Paul, Minn., and grew up in Great Neck after his father, also named
Rex, got a job as an editor at The New York Times. The younger
Lardner developed the two great themes of his life, writing and
sports, at the University of Michigan. He majored in journalism and
won two Big 10 wrestling championships.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as a freelance writer in New York, he served
in the Army in World War II, then returned to New York, where he
became a reporter for The New Yorker and began turning out articles
for magazines like Esquire, Look, Holiday, World Tennis and The New
York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was through tennis that he and Kovacs met and discovered such
a mutual offbeat humor that Lardner became the comic's chief writer
for a succession of radio and television shows in New York and
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   After Kovacs' death in 1962, Lardner worked for several years as
a staff writer for Sports Illustrated, but the strictures of a
regular job with erratic travel schedules did not appeal, and he
retired from the rat race to work out of the attic of his home as a
decidedly prolific freelance magazine writer and author.
</P>
<P>
   A man for whom writing came easy, Lardner worked out an
agreeable regimen for himself. Getting up early to work out with
weights in his basement (he believed in preparation), he would then
play tennis, come home to type for a while before lunch and,
perhaps after a nap, play some more tennis followed by more typing,
dinner and still more typing.
</P>
<P>
   For all his sense of humor, Lardner was a stickler for semantic
accuracy and a master at solving crossword puzzles, which was
hardly surprising for a man who once used a review in The New York
Times to sum up a book by the humorist S.J. Perlman as ``a
gallimaufry of harrowing experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Martha; two sons, Rex Jr. of
Chicago, and Michael of Garden City, N.Y.; a daughter, Lonnie of
Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.

JAPAN PICKS EX-PREMIER AS FINANCE CHIEF TO GUIDE IT IN CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Kiichi Miyazawa, a veteran politician who only five
years ago was forced out of office as prime minister, was named
finance minister Wednesday and charged with steering Japan out of
its worst financial crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa is a familiar face to U.S. officials, who have worked
with him for more than four decades, as he held a variety of senior
posts. And he is a veteran of the Finance Ministry, the powerful
institution that in recent years has fallen into disgrace in a
series of scandals and accusations of mismanagement of the world's
second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also Miyazawa, serving as finance minister in the
late 1980s, who oversaw the growth of the Japan's ``bubble
economy,'' and starting this week he will be charged with cleaning
up the enormous mess that the bursting of that bubble has caused.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miyazawa, 78, appeared hesitant to accept the post in
recent days, he was persuaded to do so by Keizo Obuchi, the new
president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party who is to be
confirmed as prime minister Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Japanese news reports, Obuchi has also chosen his
deputy, Masahiko Komura, to be foreign minister, Deputy Chief
Cabinet Secretary Fukushiro Nukaga as defense minister and former
Education Minister Kaoru Yosano as trade minister.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has little expertise in financial engineering himself and
needs a powerful finance minister to give his administration
credibility in a skeptical world. Many consider the choice of a
finance minister to be more important than the selection of the
prime minister, and in many ways, the next finance minister will in
fact be a more pivotal and powerful figure than Obuchi. But while
Miyazawa is well known internationally, and negotiated the Clinton
administration's first major trade accord with Japan, he has not
been considered politically powerful at home.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa will take the ministry's helm at a critical juncture.
The economy has stalled, unemployment is climbing to unheard of
levels and the banking system is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   More and more economists are drawing comparisons to the Showa
Depression of the late 1920s, which lasted more than a decade. The
Japanese press has compared Miyazawa with Korekiyo Takahashi, a
politician and financial expert of the time, whose suspension of
the gold standard and increase of government spending helped combat
the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what Miyazawa will do to fix Japan's economic
woes. He has reportedly been involved in the ``total plan'' to
clean up the banking system, which will be debated in the special
session of Parliament that begins Thursday and which is generally
regarded as a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   World financial markets have so far greeted rumors of Miyazawa's
appointment with cautious optimism. The yen has traded in a narrow
band ever since his name first appeared in the press as the
favorite candidate, and the Nikkei Stock Average has climbed as his
appointment has seemed more certain.
</P>
<P>
   A concern about Miyazawa is his age. He initially declined the
job for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   But his years of experience dealing with Japan's carefully
orchestrated government financial system, including a stint as
finance minister in the 1980s, as well as his outspoken support of
Obuchi in the recent party election, made him an obvious choice for
a job that few people seemed to want.
</P>
<P>
   He will inherit the task of weeding out the banking system,
which is suffocating under bad debt, and of fashioning policies to
drag Japan out of its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa did speak out last fall, when the banking and
securities industries seemed on the verge of a meltdown, urging
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to commit to using public funds to
bail out the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa is regarded as one of the more globally minded of the
senior ruling party members. He speaks English well, one of the few
Japanese politicians of his generation to do so, and his daughter,
Keiko, is married to Christopher Lafleur, deputy chief of mission
at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He worked closely with Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary
during the Bush administration, in putting together a bailout for
Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sought
out Miyazawa while the Japanese politician was on a trip to New
York to suggest some ideas Japan might want to consider for pumping
up domestic demand and jump-starting its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa was forced to resign as finance minister in 1988 after
being implicated in a scandal surrounding Recruit Co. efforts to
buy political influence.
</P>
<P>
   He is also remembered in some quarters for his economic
prescriptions in the mid-1980s, when he was a high-ranking party
official jockeying to become a candidate for prime minister. His
views helped create the ``bubble'' that defined Japan in the 1980s
and became the root of its problems Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa will be the first former Japanese prime minister in the
postwar era to take a job in the Cabinet after serving as prime
minister. He was prime minister from 1991 until 1993, when he
resigned after the Liberal Democrats lost control of Parliament, a
setback from which they have yet to fully recover.

AT LAST, MYSTERY OF `TALKING POINTS' APPEARS TO BE SOLVED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Kenneth Starr's six-month investigation of
President Clinton and the former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, few subjects have fueled more speculation than a
three-page document known as ``the talking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the authorship of the document remained a mystery until
this week, the talking points had always been portrayed as an
important piece of physical evidence in Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ms. Lewinsky provided at least a partial solution to
the guessing game that has consumed Washington. As she began talks
with the office of the independent counsel as part of an immunity
deal, Ms. Lewinsky said she was prepared to testify that she wrote
the talking points, said lawyers familiar with her account. While
someone else may have helped her, she has also said no one at the
White House was involved, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky gave the talking points to her former friend and
Pentagon colleague, Linda Tripp, on Jan. 14, after both women were
summoned to testify in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit
against Clinton. Unknown to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Tripp was already
cooperating with Starr, and she later gave him the talking points.
</P>
<P>
   The document appeared intended to coach Ms. Tripp to give benign
answers to potential questions in the Jones case, especially
involving Clinton's alleged encounter in a hallway just off the
Oval Office with Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer.
The document contained suggested language for Ms. Tripp, including,
``You never observed the president behaving inappropriately with
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that someone in the White House _ perhaps Bruce
Lindsey, the presidential aide and confidant _ helped write the
talking points was published and broadcast widely by the news
media. The speculation persisted after both the White House and a
spokesman for Lindsey denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Ms. Lewinsky had claimed authorship and exonerated
the White House was greeted with elation there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talking points were the basis of Ken Starr's
investigation,'' said Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser to the
president. ``They were the only venue of legitimacy. And now that's
been stripped away.''
</P>
<P>
   The talking points were one area of Starr's investigation into
possible obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury. But
they were not the only basis for the investigation. The independent
counsel is also investigating whether efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky
get a job were part of an attempt to shape her testimony in the
Jones case, lawyers familiar with the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the talking points mystery may have sparked
even more ill will between Ms. Lewinsky and Mrs. Tripp. On
Wednesday, Mrs. Tripp angrily denied news reports that she had
helped Ms. Lewinsky prepare the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing, let me repeat, nothing to do with preparing the
so-called talking points,'' she said after completing her eighth
and final day of grand jury testimony.

CENDANT SHARES UP 8 PERCENT AFTER BOARDROOM CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Fla.) (jw) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cendant Corp., which is struggling to emerge from an accounting
scandal that erupted in April, saw its shares rise by more than 8
percent in heavy trading Wednesday, as investors reacted to
sweeping boardroom changes announced after the market had closed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The shares closed Wednesday at $18.375, up from $17, on volume
exceeding 16.4 million shares, making it the most active New York
Stock Exchange issue.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on Tuesday had been buoyed by early reports that
auditors did not expect to make more revisions to estimates of the
scandal's financial impact on the company, which is a direct
marketer and franchiser that owns brands like Avis car rentals and
Ramada hotels.
</P>
<P>
   All told, shares of Cendant, formed in December from the merger
of HFS Inc. and CUC International, have gained more than 16 percent
since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's advance followed the announcement the night before
that Walter Forbes, Cendant's chairman and the founder and former
chairman of CUC, had resigned, along with eight other former CUC
directors who sat on Cendant's board. His resignation was the
latest in a series of events that began on April 16, when Cendant
announced the discovery of serious ``accounting irregularities'' at
businesses formerly operated by CUC.
</P>
<P>
   In resigning, Forbes insisted he had been unaware of the
accounting irregularities, which are under investigation by
Cendant's audit committee, federal prosecutors and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors had been pressing for Forbes'
resignation, and their demands intensified after Cendant disclosed
July 14 that the accounting irregularities were considerably more
pervasive than it had originally reported. The company expects to
revise its financial statements for the last three years, and it
substantially reduced its reported 1997 operating profits as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares, which have traded as high as $41.6875,
fell 46 percent when the accounting problems were first disclosed
and weakened further when the bad news worsened. This week's rally
is only a small respite for Henry Silverman, Cendant's chief
executive, who added the title of chairman after Forbes resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Additional hurdles remain between now and the company's annual
stockholders meeting, scheduled for Oct. 1. Sometime early next
month, Cendant expects to release audited revisions of its
financial statements for 1995 through 1997, giving Wall Street
analysts their first close look at the damage done to the company's
track record.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman has already disclosed that the damage will reduce
Cendant's operating profits, originally reported as $900 million,
or $1 a share, to between $648 million and $702 million, or between
72 and 78 cents a share, before extraordinary merger-related
expenses. Downward revisions in those expenses will largely offset
the impact of the reductions on the bottom line, however.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after those revised results are released, Cendant, based in
Parsippany, N.J., will report on its financial performance in the
last three months. Given the upheaval in operations during most of
that period, and the impact on franchisers and employees, those
results may be an additional source of surprise or disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already indicated to analysts that the current
year's financial results will probably be affected slightly by the
problems under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant hurdle for investor confidence will
come around Aug. 17, when Cendant's audit committee expects to
receive a report from its independent counsel, Willkie, Farr &AMP;
Gallagher. The law firm has engaged a forensic accounting team from
Arthur Andersen to investigate how the accounting irregularities
occurred and who may have been responsible.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on the irregularities was made at the
special board meeting on Tuesday, but did not assign any blame.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthur Andersen report, besides clarifying the mystery that
has plagued the company since April, is essential to Cendant's
ability to proceed with its proposed acquisition of American
Bankers Insurance Group, a credit-card industry insurer based in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Dowdell, legal services director for the Florida
Department of Insurance, asked Cendant, in a letter released on
Tuesday, to provide information about the company's efforts to
identify who was responsible for the irregularities, or who knew of
them. It also asked Cendant to indicate whether any of those
individuals currently served in any capacity that could influence
the operations of American Bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are apparently optimistic that state regulators will
be satisfied with Cendant's investigative efforts. Shares of
American Bankers, which fell when Cendant's troubles were
disclosed, rallied Wednesday to close at $60.1875, up $1.3125.

JAPANESE BANKS' BAD DEBTS MAY BE TWICE OFFICIAL ESTIMATES

 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American officials and private financial experts
evaluating the depths of Japan's banking crisis have concluded that
it is far worse than Tokyo has publicly acknowledged, with bad
debts approaching $1 trillion, or nearly twice the official
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and outside experts caution that their
estimates are extremely rough, in part because Japanese banks have
been using accounting tricks to hide their bad debts, that is, the
loans that are not being repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figures greatly complicate the challenge facing the
man set to become Japan's new prime minister on Thursday, Keizo
Obuchi, these officials say. Obuchi has little experience in the
financial sphere and has offered only the vaguest of plans about
how he will deal with what appears to be the largest banking crisis
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, he persuaded an elder statesman, former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, to become finance minister _
placing the 78-year-old politician, a fixture in U.S.-Japan
relations for four decades, at the center of the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimates suggest that bailing out the Japanese banks,
which include some of the world's largest, could cost Japanese
taxpayers far more than the $214 billion that Tokyo has set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The government has declared plans to establish a ``bridge bank''
that would assume bad assets from the commercial banks and sell
them off, presumably for a fraction of their value; the weak
lenders would be closed or merged. The cost to taxpayers, some
officials believe, will double.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Wall Street have long assumed
that the Japanese were understating the problems they face.
Officially Japan has said that its banks currently hold around $550
billion in bad debt, although in recent weeks that figure has crept
up to closer to $700 billion, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The far greater scale of the problem, and cost of fixing it,
could make it harder for the new Japanese government to act
decisively.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Japan's bad debts may well be the most important
statistic in the Asian financial crisis. Since the crisis struck,
Japanese banks have become so beleaguered that their lending at
home and elsewhere in Asia has all but halted, and they are closing
many of their offices throughout the region. This has contributed
to a scarcity of credit that has worsened the recession _ in some
places the depression _ that stretches from South Korea to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned for several reasons: exports to
Japan have plummeted, and the Japanese banking crisis is hampering
the effort to rescue other Asian nations, which are heavily
dependent on trade, investment and borrowing from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they have not conducted any formal study
of Japan's banking troubles, and they almost never discuss it in
public for fear of scaring even more investors away from the
Japanese markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the overall debt figure is both unknowable and
less important than the cost of closing or merging some of Japan's
largest banks. Because even bad loans have some value, most experts
say that the cost of cleaning up the books will probably be only 60
percent to 70 percent of the bad loan portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But the $1 trillion figure is being floated around during
meetings at the White House, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve,
and appears based on new estimates from Japan, unofficial estimates
from investment bankers on both sides of the Pacific, and anecdotal
evidence of how Japanese banks have been performing
sleights-of-hand to avoid a true accounting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some banks are reported to be quietly lending even
more money to apparently insolvent companies that have been
long-time customers. The companies, in turn, are using the new
loans to pay back interest on overdue loans that would otherwise be
in default. As a result, the banks are able to report to
authorities that their loans are being repaid _ even though the new
loans they are providing only deepen the the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are hard to pin down because the banks go to such
lengths to hide the bad news,'' said Richard Medley, managing
partner of Medley Global Advisors, a private research firm in New
York that often consults with top American officials about the
Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But referring to the savings and loan crisis in the United
States of a decade ago, he said, ``if you add up what the Japanese
have admitted, and look at the usual margin of error in the
American S&AMP;L crisis and similar crises, you get to a trillion very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, who declined to be
identified, said, ``What's become clear is that Japan is going to
need to spend tens of billions more in public money to get out of
this mess, and they are going to have to take some banks out of
their misery.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the cost of resolving the bad debts generated in
the American savings and loan crisis of a decade ago were roughly
$160 billion, in an economy that in 1990 had a gross national
product of $5.74 trillion. The cost amounted to about 2.7 percent
of the economy's annual production.
</P>
<P>
   If Japanese taxpayers spend upwards of $500 billion to rescue
their banks _ and that may prove to be conservative _ it will
exceed 12 percent of the country's GNP.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only part of the problem. Most experts believe that
losses in the life insurance industry could amount to another
several hundred billion dollars. Like the banks, the insurance
industry relied on a property market that turned out to be wildly
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that if you are spending so much to clean up
your banking system, it takes a real whack at the economy,'' said
Bert Ely, a financial consultant who was deeply involved in
evaluating the American savings and loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is hardly the only country in Asia mired in bad debt. In
Indonesia, most domestic companies have simply stopped repaying
loans, and the banks are working out details of a delay in paying
back overseas lenders. Many of those lenders are Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   And American officials are increasingly focusing on banking
troubles in China. Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday that it
had placed its ratings of nine Chinese banks on review, to
determine if it should downgrade its assessment of their credit
worthiness. It cited ``the continued deterioration in the financial
fundamentals of the Chinese banking system.''

SOME BIG BROADCASTERS VOLUNTARILY ADHERE TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
RULES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Some of the nation's biggest broadcasters,
including the four major networks and several of the largest owners
of radio stations, have agreed to continue following the Federal
Communications Commission's affirmative action guidelines even
though they are no longer required to do so under a recent court
decision, the industry's chief regulator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard said he had received commitments
from several of the radio and television companies to voluntarily
continue outreach and recruitment programs specifically designed to
increase the number of minority employees. Such efforts had been
required by the FCC until a federal court declared this spring that
the agency's mandate would inevitably lead to quotas and was
therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have agreed to continue following the
FCC guidelines are ABC, CBS, NBC, the Fox network, Time Warner
Inc., which includes CNN, Tribune Co. and Clear Channel
Communications Inc., the owner of 183 radio stations and 18
television stations. Kennard also received commitments from cable
companies Cox Communications, Cablevision, the TCI Group and
Comcast Inc. In all, the companies agreeing to follow the
guidelines earn one-third of the annual advertising revenue in the
broadcast industry, the FCC said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the companies comes after a three-judge panel of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
ruled April 14 that the FCC could no longer require broadcasters to
follow such guidelines. In their opinion in the case Lutheran
Church-Missouri Synod vs. FCC, the judges ruled that the agency's
affirmative action program did not serve a compelling public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly that we can't allow three judges to dictate
what is important to the country as a policy,'' Kennard said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sent shock waves through many civil rights groups,
since the FCC requirements did not mandate quotas, preferences
based on race, or set goals for particular companies and timetables
for when they should be met. The rules essentially required that
broadcast companies, as a condition of maintaining a license, make
good-faith efforts to recruit and hire minorities, which even some
critics of extending preferences based on race say they could
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not think it matters whether a government hiring program
imposes hard quotas, soft quotas or goals,'' Judge Laurence
Silberman wrote at the time. ``Any one of these techniques induces
an employer to hire with an eye toward meeting the numerical
target. As such, they can and surely will result in individuals
being granted a preference because of their race.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has petitioned for a review of the three-judge panel's
decision by the full Court of Appeals. The Clinton administration
has not decided whether it would appeal an adverse ruling to the
Supreme Court. Some civil rights leaders have been lobbying the
administration not to bring the case to the Court, fearing that it
might issue an even more sweeping prohibition against affirmative
action efforts in employment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruling, however, Kennard has been lobbying
broadcasters to maintain efforts to increase the number of minority
employees. The announcement of the agreement with the broadcasters,
which he will formally make in a speech Thursday in Washington at
the convention of the National Association of Black Journalists,
represents Kennard's first success in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our rules work,'' Kennard says in a draft of his
speech, which was provided by his office. ``And we know how
important they are in giving minorities a start. Employment is not
just an end unto itself. For some it can also be a path to
ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Kennard has also met with owners of media
conglomerates to see if ways could be devised to increase the
number of minority station owners. Since 1995, when Congress
repealed a tax break for companies that sell television and radio
stations to minorities, the number of stations owned by minorities
has declined slightly to 322.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive , Kennard is proposing a trade-off in which he
would support the broadcasters' efforts to increase their media
holdings if they helped increase the number of minority-owned
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these companies have come to me and said, `We want to
get bigger,''' he said. ``My question is, you're asking me to relax
ownership rules so you can get bigger. But what does that do for
the goals I am interested in, in terms of ownership?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A current and a former top executive of the
nation's largest satellite maker urged a Senate panel Wednesday not
to subject the industry to a more restrictive licensing review by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   But senators Wednesday criticized one executive, C. Michael
Armstrong, the former chairman of Hughes Electronics Corp., for
lobbying President Clinton too aggressively, and for acting as an
unofficial envoy between the United States and China to lift
sanctions that blocked Hughes from launching two satellites aboard
Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``American corporations should not serve as mini-State
Departments,'' Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who heads the
Governmental Affairs Committee, scolded Armstrong at a hearing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is weighing whether to revert the licensing control
over satellites to the State Department, which had that
responsibility until 1996, from the less restrictive Commerce
Department. Lawmakers fear that engineers from Hughes, which is a
unit of General Motors Corp., and from Loral Space &AMP; Communications
gave Chinese officials sensitive information after a failed
launching of a Loral satellite on a Chinese rocket in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who became chairman of AT&AMP;T last fall after running
Hughes for five years, and Steven Dorfman, Hughes' vice chairman,
told senators that they did support giving the State Department
authority to approve any technical exchanges in a disaster review.
</P>
<P>
   But the executives said transferring licensing authority to the
State Department would hurt American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we raise unnecessary barriers to satellite exports,''
Dorfman said, ``we will jeopardize the continuing U.S. pre-eminence
in this critical technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said he favored shifting
jurisdiction to the State Department and insuring that the
department's ``processes are more responsive to industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wednesday's hearing focused on Armstrong, 59, a
hard-charging executive and motorcycle buff, who has headed
Clinton's advisory panel on exports since it was created three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1993, when the administration imposed sanctions on
China for shipping missile technology to Pakistan, Armstrong thrust
himself into the dispute that grounded two Hughes satellites, and
threatened company profits and thousands of jobs in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released by the committee Wednesday, and by the White
House in the last two weeks, showed how Armstrong worked to free
his satellites from the sanctions and, two years later, how he
pushed the White House to shift the licensing jurisdiction to the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Oct. 29, 1993, Armstrong reminded Clinton that he
had supported the president's economic package and the North
American Free Trade Agreement. ``I am respectfully requesting your
involvement to resolve the China sanctions,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dec. 8, 1993, internal White House memorandum to Clinton's
national security adviser, Anthony Lake, said, ``Armstrong is now
fairly directly threatening to wage a more public campaign against
the administration's sanction.'' Armstrong, the memorandum said,
was threatening to ``write op-eds and/or spur union opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Wednesday that he and Hughes never compromised
national security. But senators voiced concern that Armstrong's
blunt approach pushed the limits of corporate advocacy expected
from any industry chieftain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a bare minimum, you need some help in letter-writing,''
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told Armstrong. ``That's not any way to
write the president.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In seeking to have the sanctions lifted, Armstrong mixed
diplomacy with business by passing messages between senior Chinese
and American officials. ``I hope this information is useful and can
be used to resolve the situation,'' Armstrong said in a Nov. 16,
1993, letter to Samuel Berger, Clinton's deputy national security
adviser, relaying his conversation with China's vice premier, Qian
Qichen.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1994, Clinton reached a compromise that allowed Huhges
to modify its satellites and refile its applications with Commerce.
The administration ended the sanctions in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With the sanctions issue resolved, Armstrong still was waging a
war to shift licensing authority over all commercial satellites to
the less restrictive Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   By March 1996, Armstrong got what he wanted by enlisting
Berger's help in reversing the State Department objections. ``It
was indeed some battle, two and a half years and more politics than
a textbook,'' Armstrong told Berger in an Oct. 17, 1996,
``thank-you'' note.

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Mike Tyson, displaying the same loss of control
that compelled him to bite off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear
and led to his banishment from boxing, testified Wednesday before
the State Athletic Control Board to apply for the reinstatement of
his New Jersey boxing license.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by two lawyers and a parade of character witnesses,
Tyson made his case inside the hearing room at the Richard J.
Hughes Justice Complex here.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts to portray him as a changed man who deserved the
right to fight again may have been undercut by a moody 35-minute
appearance that ranged from a near-tearful apology to an angry
outburst laced with an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not rule on Tyson's petition, delaying a decision
until it could convene in a private session on Aug. 6. The final
ruling could come two days later on Aug. 8, although the board has
45 days to render a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he did not reapply for a license in Nevada because he
wanted to make a fresh start. But his adviser, Shelly Finkel, said
Tyson might apply for a boxing license in other states in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a gallery of reporters and friends, including his
wife, Dr. Monica Tyson, and boxer Larry Holmes, Tyson at first
expressed remorse for biting Holyfield's ear in a heavyweight bout
on June 28, 1997, an act that prompted Nevada to revoke his
license.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson said he did it only after constant head butting from
Holyfield made his ``head foggy and incoherent'' and that he became
``desperate, irate and I just snapped. Nothing really mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tyson seemed to choke back tears when talking
about how his life had been irrevocably altered by the events on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry for what I did,'' Tyson said. ``It will haunt me for
the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Haas, an assistant attorney general, asked Tyson if
he thought he would ever commit a similar act if he were granted a
New Jersey boxing license, Tyson said: ``I doubt it. My life has
been devastated over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bertram Rotman, a Wayne, N.J., psychologist who evaluated
Tyson for an hour on July 21, testified that he saw no reason why
Tyson shouldn't get his license back, and Raymond Reddin, one of
Tyson's lawyers, read a brief letter from Holyfield that said the
fighter did not object to Tyson's getting a license from New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although he slumped forward on the table occasionally, Tyson
patiently sat through the three-and-a-half-hour proceeding, and
withstood a 43-minute questioning from Haas before he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Haas' questions centered around Tyson's 1992 conviction
in Indiana for the rape of Desiree Washington and the biting
incident with Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who was dressed in a gray pinstriped suit and wearing a
black T-shirt, twice complained of the cold temperature in the
room. But following the questioning from Haas, Tyson reached a slow
boil. When Haas asked him if he wanted to make a final statement,
Tyson declined, saying he was too angry to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later as one of his lawyers, Anthony Fusco, was
delivering an impassioned closing statement Tyson couldn't contain
his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was wrong,'' Fusco said. ``But how many times does
one individual have to hear `Are you sorry for what you did?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson angrily interjected, agreeing with Fusco: ``You know what
I mean, man? Why do I have to relive my. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Tyson uttered an expletive, Fusco reached over and
stopped him and told the panel hearing the petition that Tyson was
not angry at them, but was merely expressing the frustration that
had built up in him during his exile from the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a hastily called news conference in the lobby of the
Hughes Justice Complex, Tyson said he used the wrong choice of
words when he told the panel that he was too angry to deliver a
final statement in his own behalf. As for the outburst and the
expletive, Tyson said: ``I never lost my cool. I was just
expressing my hurt, if anything.''
</P>

<P>
   Wednesday's public hearing, which drew a throng of fans and
protesters from the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization
for Women, attracted great news media interest, with television
satellite broadcast trucks crowding the sidewalk outside the
building and banks of television cameras corralled by wooden
barricades inside. The proceeding was broadcast live by ESPN,
CNN-SI and Fox News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hazzard, New Jersey State Boxing commissioner, said the
board decided to hold a public hearing on Tyson's request because
it wanted to avoid the appearance that Tyson was getting a
back-room deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson is allowed to return to boxing, it will be a boon to
the casino economy in Atlantic City. Tyson hasn't held a New Jersey
boxing license since 1991. His last bout in New Jersey came on Dec.
8, 1990, against Alex Stewart. Finkel said if Tyson gets his
license back, his first bout would be in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under state commission rules and New Jersey law, Tyson has to
provide ``clear and convincing evidence of good character, honesty,
responsibility and integrity'' in order to get a New Jersey boxing
license.
</P>
<P>
   There was a videotaped statement attesting to Tyson's honesty
and good character from Camille Ewald, the 93-year-old woman who
ran the house in Catskill, N.Y., where Cus D'Amato trained the
young Tyson. And there was an explanation from Chuck Wepner and
Bobby Czyz as to why a boxer would do what Tyson did to Holyfield
during a bout.
</P>
<P>
   Czyz, a television boxing analyst, described it as ``performance
blackout.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world title fight, if I hit an opponent and his eye fell
out of his head, I'd eat it before he could pick it up and put it
back in,'' Czyz said regarding the state of mind that boxers have
during a title bout. &QL;

   U.S. Dreamers must &QL; 
grow up in a hurry
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Zorba the smiling waiter put down a menu on the
table and quickly realized he had made a mistake when a pair of
would-be diners looked at the pages as if they were covered by the
random scribblings of a chicken with ink on its claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said. ``It must be all Greek to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ba-da-boom!
</P>
<P>
   ``It is actually a very easy language to learn,'' said Zorba.
``How long will you be here?''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, it sinks in about the third week,'' he replied with a
grin.
</P>
<P>
   Ba-da-boom! Rim shots and jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Tomjanovich will have to hope the learning curve for his
ragtag band of Dreamers at the World Basketball Championships is a
little faster. For in spite of a final score that was a lopsided
83-59 over Brazil, the debut of the American team had more lurches
and stops than a ride in an Athens taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can attribute a lot of what you saw out of us in
the first half to nerves,'' said Trajan Langdon, the Duke star and
the only collegian on the team. ``We've been working to get ready
for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot of the talk about what people at home think
we can't do, and I think everybody was pushing a little bit extra
at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed shots. We didn't make plays. But in an international
tournament like this, that's what the first day can be all about.
Calming down. Sorting things out.''
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans fade fast
</P>
<P>
   At two locations on opposite sides of Athens, the 16 teams
finally kicked off a tournament that had received a kick in the
teeth when the NBA stars who would have made up Dream Team IV
bailed out as a result of the current labor discord.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Peace and Friendship Arena, one of the favorites,
Yugoslavia, came out of the blocks sprinting with an impressive
thumping of Puerto Rico, and Russia beat up on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic Stadium, there was an intimate gathering of
family and the custodial staff on hand to see the opening game,
which had South Korea giving a first-half scare to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans took spreading the court to extremes, set up about
10 yards apart, were hotter than kimchi in burying a raft of
3-pointers and crisply executed a half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, when you see Sang-Min Lee and Dong-Hee Kang run the
pick-and-roll, you have flashbacks to Cousy and Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans led for a long while, trailed by only six at
intermission, but were done in by the small matter of a 48-8 burst
by the Lithuanians to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, by comparison, were never in that much trouble,
though they fell behind 22-17 with about seven minutes left in the
first half before settling down and resembling a team that can walk
and dribble a basketball at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to rely on our defense in this tournament,''
Tomjanovich said. ``It will be the foundation of everything we hope
to accomplish. This isn't a team with a lot of big offensive
weapons. So we're going to have to be persistent with our defense
and hang in until the offense follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentals over flash
</P>
<P>
   The offense started to come around when Rudy T put Langdon into
the game as his 12th man in the final minutes of the first half,
and Langdon responded with a pair of treys that seemed to boost the
U.S. confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The no-name Americans rode a solid-if-unspectacular game by
point guard Michael Hawkins, who played last year in the Greek
League for Olympiakos of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins made all but one of his shots to finish with 12 points,
dealt a U.S. tournament-record 10 assists and grabbed seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently on the receiving end of Hawkins passes was forward
Wendell Alexis, formerly of Syracuse, a half-dozen NBA tryout camps
and a handful of pro leagues in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis scored inside on feeds and opportunity hoops and made one
crushing block on a Brazilian layup attempt that led to a layup by
Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Dreamers will have to do it. By choking off the
middle with team defense, by taking advantage of their overall team
depth and beating opponents down the floor in the running game.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. was 10-for-11 in converting fast breaks, and with the
exception of David Wood, every player on the roster scored.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is Lithuania. The learning process must accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people back home don't think we can even medal,
let alone win the gold,'' said Langdon. ``But I think this team
will surprise you. We're learning who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   It will have to be faster than Zorba the waiter says we can
learn the language.

 &HT;    Struggling Wohlers puts team in bind
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ While the Braves continue to try publicly to
maintain a forward spin on the Mark Wohlers situation, it has
become clear the club is going to have to make a move to remedy the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Even manager Bobby Cox, who has tried to remain positive as his
former closer fights for his control, was astounded by Tuesday
night's five-walk, five-run outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't good,'' Cox said Wednesday. ``What more can I say.''
</P>
<P>
   But there, the team is stuck. It could ask Wohlers to accept
another optional assignment to the minors (Wohlers has declined
comment on that possibility). It could wrangle a way to place him
on the disabled list and let him work in the minors (remember the
New York Mets had Pete Harnisch on the DL much of last year with
anxiety).
</P>
<P>
   Or the Braves could release him, which is highly unlikely. Even
with control trouble, Wohlers is still a prized commodity and the
club is liable for his contract. Wohlers would be owed $7.375
million if released based on pro-rating the remainder of his $4.125
million salary this season, the $5.2 million he has coming next
season and an $800,000 buyout clause.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the club would prefer the first option, since it costs
the Braves nothing and Wohlers can work on his problem on his own
terms. Keeping him in Atlanta may prove a burden to the bullpen. In
his six appearances, three times the club has had to scramble
another pitcher to finish Wohlers' innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep finding him opportunities,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   But those opportunities are not never-ending. His progress, to
judge by his results, is indeterminable. In his six outings,
Wohlers has pitched 3 2/3 innings, allowed 10 runs on five hits and
11 walks. He has not struck out a batter since June 9. Of the 25
men he has faced since rejoining the team after the All-Star break,
he has retired 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, he would come in and say, here it is, see what
you can do with it,'' said Cincinnati's Reggie Sanders. ``Now, it's
like he's saying, I don't really know what I'm doing and I hope
it's there. He's a little more timid,''
</P>
<P>
   Skinning the Cat
</P>
<P>
   After being plunked for the 17th time Tuesday night, Andres
Galarraga is within four of breaking Jeff Blauser's record, set
last year, of being hit by pitches 20 times. Adding insult to
injury, Galarraga's arm shield isn't helping. He has been hit six
times since he began wearing a padded sleeve guard and only once
has the device stopped the ball. Cincinnati's Scott Sullivan caught
him Tuesday where he has most often been struck _ in the left
triceps above the guard.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has not been so successful this month driving the

 &HT;    On Deck: Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 12:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (10-9, 3.60; 7-3,
4.67 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. LHP Rick Krivda (0-1, 7.62; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Neagle and his changeup were much improved last time out.
Although he lost at Pittsburgh on Saturday, he only gave up two
runs while striking out six, a vast improvement over his nine-run
debacle against Chicago on July 20. He has not faced the Reds this
year, but Cinergy Field has not been one of his favorite stops. He
is 3-3 in eight career appearances in Cincinnati, where his ERA is
5.40 and the Reds have a .300 average against him. Krivda, acquired
by the Reds from Cleveland on June 16, will be making his first
National League start. In five Cincinnati appearances, he has given
up 18 hits, including three homers, and six walks in 13 innings,
but he is being tried as a starter after the club returned Scott
Winchester to the minors. After seven years in the Baltimore
organization and going 9-14 in 45 games with the Orioles, he was
cut during the winter and signed by Cleveland. After 20 appearances
and one start with the Indians (2-0, 3.24), he was dealt to
Cincinnati for pitcher Eddie Priest and outfielder Christian Rojas.
Although the Braves are unfamiliar with him, Danny Bautista will be
glad to see him. One of his 19 career home runs came off Kridva in
1994, when Bautista was a Detroit Tiger.

CLINTON TO TESTIFY TO GRAND JURY VIA VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will provide videotaped testimony
to the independent counsel investigating the Monica S. Lewinsky
allegations on Aug. 17, Clinton's attorney announced Wednesday,
marking the first time a president will testify for a grand jury as
the presumed criminal target.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Linda R. Tripp, who triggered the Lewinsky
probe, defended her actions in her first extended comments on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement on Clinton's testimony, announced by David
Kendall in an appearance on the White House driveway, came after
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr bowed to Clinton's insistence
that he testify from the White House with his lawyers present. In
return, Clinton, under apparent pressure from a federal judge,
abandoned his attempts to postpone the testimony until
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The timing still allows Clinton to testify after Lewinsky,
giving the president some knowledge of Lewinsky's version of events
as he provides his own detailed account of their relationship for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   As events continued to tumble toward an uncertain conclusion,
Tripp, the former White House worker who secretly tape recorded
Lewinsky, said she had no political agenda when she approached
Starr with the tapes in January and instead was trying to conquer
her own fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of simply trying to earn a living, I became aware
between 1993 and 1997 of actions by high government officials that
may have been against the law,'' Tripp said from the steps of the
US District Court, after completing her eighth and final day of
testimony before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that period of nearly five years, the things I witnessed
concerning several different subjects made me increasingly fearful
that this information was dangerous, very dangerous to possess,''
Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, her hands and voice shaking, Tripp added: ``I bear no
malice toward anyone in this case. I have never had any political
agenda. I still don't. I have been honored to serve presidents of
both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another in a string of eventful days in the capital, the
image of Lewinsky's lawyers announcing Tuesday's immunity deal
still fresh on television news shows when Kendall stepped before
the microphones Wednesday to make his announcement. And just
minutes after Kendall disappeared without taking questions, Tripp
appeared at the courthouse and seemed ready to burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall addressed reporters after meeting privately with Clinton
to inform the president of the testimony arrangement. On Tuesday
afternoon, Kendall pleaded with US District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson to have the president's testimony postponed but was rebuked
in a closed-door hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter, the president will voluntarily provide his testimony on
Aug. 17, 1998, to the office of independent counsel, as he has on
prior occasions,'' Kendall said. ``The president's testimony will
be videotaped at the White House with lawyers present.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Wednesday that Starr had
agreed to withdraw the July 17 subpoena after Clinton had agreed to
testify. That move, while largely symbolic, allows Clinton to
answer prosecutors' questions without the stigma of being under
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   That official, speaking under the cloak of anonymity, strongly
hinted that the testimony would be concluded in a single day.
Clinton is delaying his departure to Martha's Vineyard for vacation
at least two days to stay in Washington and testify, officials
said, and is likely to clear out blocks of his schedule before then
to prepare. He will now leave for Massachusetts either the night of
Aug. 17 or the morning of Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's deal was reached, defense lawyers and
analysts had been increasingly speculating that Clinton would
somehow back out of his plan to testify, largely because they saw
no clear legal benefit for Clinton in presenting his case to the
grand jury. It is extraordinarily rare, lawyers said, for a
criminal suspect to appear before a grand jury investigating him.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury appearance, those lawyers and analysts said, might
only serve to provide more legal ammunition to Starr to pursue a
perjury allegation. Clinton had already said under oath in January,
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, that he did not have
a sexual affair with Lewinsky, and further testimony would either
exacerbate his legal plight or force him to confess to a prior lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do is after the fact, after you've
been called to a grand jury, is lie,'' said Mary Cheh, a professor
at George Washington University Law School. ``Prisons are filled
with people who have lied and burned files. When there's even the
hint of risk, you tell people not to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparring Lewinsky and Clinton grand jury appearances will
create a climactic summertime showdown in a case that was launched
in the coldest days of January and has lurched forward, to
considerable criticism, ever since. Under the current plan, Starr
could not conceivably present the House of Representatives with a
report of his findings by September.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is prepared to testify that she had a lengthy sexual
relationship with Clinton while she worked as an intern at the
White House and after she was transferred to the Pentagon,
according to sources familiar with her account. She also told Starr
that she would testify that Clinton discussed with her a strategy
to keep their affair secret, the sources said. At least part of
that discussion occured after Lewinsky was named on a witness list
in the Jones lawsuit, but before she was actually subpoenaed, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also plans to testify that she typed the now-famous
so-called talking points herself, under Tripp's guidance, the
sources said. The talking points describe ways for Tripp to tailor
her testimony in the Jones suit so as not to implicate Clinton in
illicit relationships with other women. Lewinsky handed the sheet
with the talking points to Tripp on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Tripp dismissed Lewinsky's account as ``illogical''
and ``patently false.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing _ let me repeat: nothing _ to do with the
so-called talking points,'' Tripp said on the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, ABC News resurrected the issue of a
semen-stained dress, reporting that Lewinsky told Starr this week
that as part of the immunity deal, she would now turn over clothing
to prosecutors that could prove her version of a sexual affair with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Over the winter, reports of the dress were widespread in the
news media. But at one point, Lewinsky's former lawyer, William
Ginsburg, said explicitly that no such dress existed.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Lewinsky also expressed private concern last
night that White House officials had launched what they described
as a ``smear campaign'' against the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the whirlwind events, it was Tripp, silent since the
investigation was launched in January, who appeared the most
forceful, with a vivid recounting of her role and a dramatic
defense of her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Her face seemed to quiver as she spoke, her eyes darting from a
page of text to the battery of reporters and cameramen who stood
before her in the summer sun. Villified by pundits for seeking a
book deal and by administration officials for pursuing a partisan
agenda and pushing the White House toward a political crisis over
allegations of a sexual affair, she started with a simple apology
for being a mediocre public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that there has been a great deal of speculation
about just who I am and how I got here,'' Tripp said, her son and
daughter behind her. ``Well, the answer is simple. I'm you. I'm
just like you. I'm an average American who found herself in a
situation not of her own making. I'm a suburban mom who was a
military wife for 20 years, and a faithful government employee for
18 years. I never asked to be placed in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Tripp, a former employee in the Bush White House, said,
``I have been villified through taking the path of truth. I've been
maligned by people who have chosen not to tell the truth and who
know that they are not telling the truth. Not surprisingly, many in
the entertainment industry have chosen to ridicule me as well,
going so far as to even make fun of my appearance in a manner so
mean and so cruel that I pray none of you is ever subjected to
it.''

GOLDMAN SETS PAYMENT CHOICES FOR RILED PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The top executives of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. have
promised that when the firm, Wall Street's premier private
investment bank, sells shares to the public, everyone at the firm,
from general partners to janitors, will get a share of the
multibillion-dollar payoff.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of that pledge came at a meeting in New York on
Wednesday, when Goldman's co-chairmen and chief executives, Jon
Corzine and Henry Paulson Jr., tried to salve a wound that opened
when the firm decided to go public in June: how much 111 limited
partners, who built Goldman into a powerhouse in wholesale banking
but have retired or left the firm, should get.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that the payoff will be less than some limited
partners hoped, but more than many feared. The limited partners,
who retain cash stakes, were given a choice of investing in the new
Goldman shares or cashing out now. They would earn premiums on
their current investments of 25 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was not enough to appease all elder partners. Among
the most vocal critic was John Whitehead, a former senior partner.
Whitehead, also a former deputy secretary of state, led a group of
disgruntled retired partners who complained that their lifetime
contributions to Goldman were being played down at a time when it
mattered most, according to people who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead did not return telephone calls to his office
Wednesday. But people present at the meeting of the limited
partners Wednesday said he argued forcefully that Goldman's current
partners had a moral obligation to reward their predecessors, some
of whom worked at the firm for nearly half a century to create the
blue-chip Goldman brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the limited partner settlement appears to be enough to
placate others. ``I would characterize the reaction as mild
disappointment,'' said one limited partner who asked to remain
anonymous. ``They should have been more generous. But are people
really upset? No. We can live with this.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute shows how difficult it will be for Corzine and
Paulson to satisfy soaring expectations. Many analysts expect a
public offering will value Goldman at $30 billion or more, creating
windfall profits with thousands of claimants. One Goldman executive
described his colleagues' dreams of wealth as ``off the charts and
through the roof,'' even before plans for the share offering are
complete.
</P>
<P>
   A misstep could prove damaging. The two Goldman chiefs have to
figure out how to shore up the firm's capital base for future
expansion, reward people who have contributed to its success over
the years and keep current partners and senior employees committed
to working long hours even after their net worth increases by three
or four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly why some people, including Whitehead, told
them not to go public,'' said another limited partner who attended
Wednesday's meeting. ``You get into all these delicate issues where
peoples' egos are at stake, and you potentially wreck Goldman's
formula for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the risks, Goldman is proceeding apace toward a public
offering, most likely in October. The 190 current partners are
expected to vote on Aug. 10 on details of the offering plan,
including which other investment banks will help underwrite Goldman
and the schedule for dividing shares among employees.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners will be the 190 general partners, the firm's
owners, who will see the value of their stakes increase as much as
four times. Senior partners are likely to get shares valued well
over $100 million, although they would not be able to sell those
shares for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Limited partners will not receive such exalted premiums for
their stakes. But Corzine and Paulson have gone some way toward
appeasing their demands for a bigger and more flexible cut.
</P>
<P>
   After tense negotiations in recent weeks, Goldman agreed to
offer the limited partners both more choice in how their
investments are handled and a greater premium whichever option they
choose. They can elect to have their ownership stakes exchanged for
cash, choose a debt instrument that would pay a fixed rate of
interest, accept new Goldman shares, or a mix of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Taking shares would bring the biggest premium, estimated to be
55 percent over the current value of their investments. But those
who accept this plan would also take a risk that the shares would
drop in value, and they would have to agree not to sell during a
``lock-up'' period, perhaps a year, after the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Limited partners would get a 25 percent premium if they elected
to cash out entirely. If they chose the debt option, they would
earn a fixed rate of return from a debenture that matures over many
years, an option considered attractive for limited partners who are
retired.

   Moon considering retirement
</P>
<P>
   Rift with Seahawks over pact has ex-Oiler mulling end of career
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
If the Seattle Seahawks do not increase their one-year, $1.8
million offer, quarterback Warren Moon says he will retire after 20
seasons in professional football, including 14 in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, 41, is under contact to the Seahawks and holding out for
the first time in his career. The two sides are as far apart as
Seattle and Houston, and Moon says he will not let the stalemate
continue into the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given it a lot of thought, and if the situation doesn't
change, I'll retire,'' Moon said after returning to his home
outside Houston. ``First, I'd ask for my release, but I don't think
they'd give it to me. Then, yes, I'll just retire.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawks and Dallas Cowboys kick off the NFL's
preseason schedule Friday night at Texas Stadium, Moon won't be
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised it's come to this,'' Moon said. ``What
bothers me the most is that it wasn't addressed seriously until a
couple of weeks before camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking for a ton of money. Two years ago, my base
salary with Minnesota was $4.3 million. Last year, it was $550,000.
Now, my situation's changed. I'm just asking to be paid like a
starting quarterback. I still believe I'm one of the better
quarterbacks in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon, who played the first 10 years of his NFL career with the
Houston Oilers, signed a two-year contract with the Seahawks in
1997. At the time, John Friesz was the starter. Moon accepted base
salaries of $550,000 and $600,000 and a lot of incentives. Seattle
assured him that if he became the starter, the second year of his
contract would be redone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never complained about my salary last year,'' he said. ``I
accepted my situation. But they said they were going to pay me more
this season since I was the starter. They said I'd be taken care
of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, who paid Moon a $150,000 roster bonus this year,
are willing to give him a new one-year deal for $1.8 million, a
$300,000 increase from their initial offer. They also are willing
to add $1.6 million in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll have to have the most unbelievable season of my
career to earn those incentives,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Leigh Steinberg has made several proposals, but the
Seahawks say no new offers will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Moon says he wants a two-year deal so he can get a large signing
bonus that would provide a 1998 income of $3.5 million to $4.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they don't want to give me a two-year deal because
they're afraid I won't play next year,'' Moon said. ``They're
afraid I'll retire after one season and they'll have that portion
of my prorated signing bonus count against the 1999 cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll play as long as I can. I'll sign an agreement
guaranteeing I'll play the second year.''
</P>
<P>
   When Friesz was injured in the first game last season, Moon
became the starter. He finished with 25 touchdown passes and set
team records with 313 completions and 3,678 yards passing, but
Seattle finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the ninth
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fired up before camp,'' Moon said. ``I was as fired
up as I've ever been. When you look at the talent they've acquired,
it reminds me of our old Oiler teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In free agency, the Seahawks signed running back Ricky Watters,
center Kevin Glover and guard Brian Habib for the offense and
outside linebacker Darrin Smith for the defense. They used their
No. 1 pick on linebacker Anthony Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be in camp watching everything come together,''
Moon said. ``We've got a great combination of speed and athleticism
and youth and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in quite a while the Seahawks have
depth. I think it's going to be a very good season. I think we can
compete for the AFC West title, and we play in the toughest
division in the league. I definitely think we're a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this so frustrating. This team has a chance
to be very, very good. I hate not being in camp. Not only am I the
quarterback on the field, but I'm the quarterback off the field,
too. That extends into the dressing room and meeting room. We've
got a lot of young players, and I try to help them as much as I
can. I spend an awful lot of time with the younger guys. I try to
help take care of them. There are times when we have some
mini-crisis like every team, and I help take care of them. I can't
do that sitting home in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon earned a lot of respect last year when he had the best
season of any quarterback in his 40s in NFL history. Not only did
he throw 25 touchdown passes and establish Seahawks passing
records, but he won the Most Valuable Player award at the Pro Bowl
for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if holding out while he is under contract will hurt
his reputation with fans, Moon said, ``I think it might if people
didn't understand the dynamics of the deal.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed Wednesday to submit to
questioning by federal prosecutors in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation after independent counsel Kenneth Starr withdrew an
unprecedented subpoena to compel his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrangement to secure Clinton's testimony was announced,
new details emerged of what Ms. Lewinsky is prepared to tell grand
jurors under a broad immunity deal reached with prosecutors on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers involved in the investigation, Ms. Lewinsky
has told prosecutors that, after consultation with the president,
she returned gifts from Clinton and concealed other physical
evidence that was under subpoena in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's videotaped testimony will take place at the White
House on Aug. 17, and the president will be permitted the unusual
courtesy of having his lawyers at his side, unlike other grand jury
witnesses. Starr was willing to agree to many of Clinton's
conditions in exchange for the president's decision not to
challenge the subpoena on constitutional grounds and further delay
the lengthy investigation, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement allows Clinton to avoid the humiliating spectacle
of being led under subpoena into a federal courthouse to appear
personally before the 23-member grand jury that has heard scores of
witnesses, from high government officials to uniformed Secret
Service officers, over the past seven month. But it gives Starr
something important as well _ the chance to confront the president
in person and question him extensively on matters ranging from his
relationship to Ms. Lewinsky to alleged efforts to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now secured the testimony of the two central and final
witnesses in the Lewinsky inquiry, after Ms. Lewinsky accepted an
immunity agreement that requires her to provide ``full and
truthful'' testimony about what she says was an 18-month
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky scheduled to tell their stories in
the next few weeks, the independent counsel will soon have the
final pieces of a complex mosaic that may or may not constitute
crimes or impeachable offenses. Starr is expected to quickly
conclude the Lewinsky investigation and prepare a report for
Congress on his findings.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has said he is investigating allegations of
perjury, witness tampering and obstruction of justice arising from
charges that Clinton carried on a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and directed a conspiracy to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   The final judgment on Clinton will be rendered by the House of
Representatives, should it choose to pursue impeachment hearings,
not by Starr or a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, announced the
arrangement for the president's testimony in a brief statement in
the White House driveway on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter the president will voluntarily provide his testimony on Aug.
17, 1998, to the Office of Independent Counsel as he has on prior
occasions,'' Kendall said. ``The president's testimony will be
videotaped at the White House with lawyers present. No further
statement will be issued.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in a week of negotiations over Clinton's
testimony came Tuesday, when Starr agreed to withdraw the subpoena
that he issued on July 17, allowing Kendall to characterize the
President's prospective testimony as ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials acknowledged for the first time on
Wednesday that a subpoena had in fact been issued and served on
Kendall last week.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that when Clinton learned
of the subpoena he instructed Kendall to quickly find ``a way to
get the grand jury the information it needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, ``The president is
obviously looking forward to a prompt resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to the subpoena was the subject of intense debate
within the White House and among the president's official and
private attorneys. Several of the president's political and media
advisers wanted Clinton to comply quickly to avoid the appearance
of stonewalling, but some members of the president's legal team
believed the subpoena was unenforceable and an affront to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the decision was made to make the president available
for questioning, but only under favorable conditions and not under
compulsion of a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the odd twists that have marked this investigation
since it began in January, Linda Tripp emerged from the federal
courthouse 10 blocks from the White House a few minutes after
Kendall spoke and read a statement of her own. She had just
completed her eighth and final day before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp brought her former friend, Ms. Lewinsky, to the
attention of Starr's office on Jan. 12, saying that Ms. Lewinsky
had confided in her details of a long-running sexual relationship
with the president. She provided tape recordings of their
conversations and documents that appeared to point to a conspiracy
to obstruct justice involving the president and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has never been, quote, `just about sex,'''
Mrs. Tripp said in a breaking voice under a sweltering sun. ``It
has been about telling the truth, and the truth matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the Judiciary Committee,
welcomed news of the president's impending testimony as a sign that
Starr's inquiry was in its ``closing throes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be more than just alleged sexual peccadilloes in
the White House, and frankly all of us would like to get this over
with,'' Hatch said at a news conference. ``I'd be surprised if Ken
Starr would allow this to go well into September.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, was more blunt, calling on Starr to conclude his
investigation and ``give us a report on what he's done to date. Let
the American people, let the Congress do it and let the Congress
act whichever way they want. But wrap this sucker up.''

DEAL REACHED ON ANTITRUST LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Vt.)  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In baseball parlance, the Senate Judiciary Committee for the
first time Wednesday moved into scoring position with a bill that
would alter the antitrust exemption Major League Baseball has
enjoyed since 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the committee, and Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee's ranking Democrat,
announced an agreement on the bill, which would affect players'
rights in labor relations. For the first time, owners, players and
the minor leagues support the same legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch called the step ``a truly historic milestone'' in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   The joint support of the bill by owners and players arose from
the collective bargaining agreement that ended the most devastating
work stoppage in sports history. The legislation would give
baseball players the same rights as players in other professional
sports, allowing them to challenge owners' actions in a labor
dispute with an antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not affect the status of antitrust law with
respect to the minor leagues, franchise expansion or relocation and
the amateur player draft.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate and then the House pass the bill, known as the
Curt Flood Act, by the end of this year, it will affect the
termination date of the current labor agreement between the players
and the owners.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes law, the termination date will remain Oct.
31, 2000, which the owners prefer. If Congress does not pass the
legislation, the date will change to Dec. 31, 2000, which the
players prefer.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have long wanted the earlier date because it would
affect contract negotiations for the following season. Players who
become free agents, for example, would not gain that status until
after Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on dates was part of a compromise under which the
owners agreed to join the players in seeking a change in the
antitrust exemption as it applies to labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, Hatch, holding a baseball
bat, said it was unlikely that Congress would have time to act on
the bill in the current session _ the Senate is trying to adjourn
for the summer by Saturday _ but he added that it would probably be
approved in September.
</P>
<P>
   If the act becomes law, Hatch added, ``the owners will not have
an unfair advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy alluded to the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, a
victim of the last labor dispute, and said, ``Sometimes a
near-death experience is an enlightening thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee initially approved the Flood Act a year
ago by an 11-6 vote, but it stood little chance of passage because
the minor leagues opposed the language. Their concerns, however,
have been allayed by new language.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Brand, vice president of the National Association, the
umbrella organization of the minor leagues, wrote a letter to Hatch
earlier this week saying the amended bill assures ``the continued
survival of minor league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, using his title of commissioner formally for perhaps
the first time, and Donald Fehr, the players' labor chief, wrote a
joint letter to the two senators acknowledging that they agreed
with the bill's new language.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Fehr said passage of the bill would
``be a significant step toward minimizing the labor discord and
disruptions in play that have plagued our national pastime.'' &QL;

CONGRESS-ARMSTRONG, 7-29 -- C. Michael Armstrong, the former
chairman of Hughes Electronics Corp. - the nation's largest
satellite maker - urged a Senate panel Wednesday not to subject the
industry to a more restrictive licensing review by the government.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Campaigning in a patchwork district of Indians
and cowboys, Hispanic residents with centuries-old ties and New Age
Anglo transplants, Carol Miller is determined to become the United
States' first Green in Congress. If recent election returns in New
Mexico are a guide, that ambition makes her the Democratic Party's
worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into discontent with what they call ``Republi-crats,''
members of New Mexico's Green Party have used a populist and
environmentalist platform to achieve rare influence for a third
party in American politics: the ability to determine an election.
In three major races since 1994, the Greens have won enough votes
to allow Republicans to win the governorship and two Congressional
seats, in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2 to
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the Greens hurt the Democrats,''
said former Gov. Bruce King, a Democrat who says the cause of his
1994 re-election defeat was a Green candidate who drew 10.5 percent
of the votes. ``By and large,'' King said, ``the party they split
off from was the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who won 17 percent of the votes in a special election
for Congress last year, in Northern New Mexico's Third District,
says she believes that the electoral math shows how the Greens are
tapping alienated voters. In another special Congressional election
last month, in the First District in Albuquerque, the losing
Democrat, Phil Maloof, spent $35 a vote, and the winning
Republican, Heather Wilson, $18 a vote. But the Green, Robert
Anderson, spent 19 cents a vote in gaining 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in New Mexico don't like the money going into the
campaigns,'' said Miller, a rural health planner. ``They like our
low-budget approach. We go out and talk to people wherever they
are. We don't rely on television ads.''
</P>
<P>
   The greening of New Mexico voters bears watching because they
may be the vanguard of a national electoral emergence of American
Greens, belatedly following Green Party inroads in Western Europe.
And while the Greens are still unlikely to elect major candidates
of their own, the New Mexico races show their potential for
deciding close contests between major party candidates and even in
keeping Democrats from regaining a majority in the House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go, Green, Go,'' Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate for
governor in California, chanted on July 19. Lungren, the state's
attorney general, was tipping his hat to the potential of the Green
Party candidate, Dan Hamburg, for drawing votes from Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are 57 elected Greens, largely city council
members. Half of these officials are in California, which has
93,000 registered Green Party voters, 81 percent of the national
registration. Elected Greens serve in 12 other states, largely in
the West and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Green candidates have earned automatic ballot
access in nine states: Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii,
Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont and Wisconsin. Automatic ballot
access means a party has gained enough votes in past elections so
that it does not have to petition to get candidates on the ballot.
Earning that status in more states, including New York, is a major
goal this year, said Dean Myerson, the secretary of a new national
network, the Association of State Green Parties.
</P>
<P>
   The draft platform of the Green Party includes an eclectic list
of positions that are largely left of center: national health
insurance, limits on campaign spending, cutting military spending
in half, a national campaign against AIDS, civilian review boards
for police forces, more recycling and solar power and an end to
``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's strongest support comes from the nation's youngest
voters. In surveys of two statewide races in New Mexico and Rhode
Island in 1994, Green candidates won majorities of voters under the
age of 29. In New Mexico's Congressional race last month, Anderson,
a University of New Mexico instructor, won a majority of votes cast
in the university voting precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create new Green parties where they don't
exist, to get better ballot access, and to prepare the groundwork
for a national Green Party, hopefully for the year 2000,'' Myerson
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's Greens are fielding 12 candidates this fall for
offices from Congress to county commissioner. Miller and Anderson
are running again and are expected to repeat their double-digit
performances in their Congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico Republicans have given the Greens the red carpet.
Gov. Gary E. Johnson, a Republican, has appointed a Green, Steven
J. Schmidt, to the state Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing for the Republican Party here since
they won the Civil War,'' said Roger Morris, a political writer
here. ``It has enabled them to win these races that otherwise would
have been closer.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico's campaigns, Greens emphasize issues with a strong
local resonance, but they can take advantage of national issues,
too. Anderson, a 53-year-old combat veteran of Vietnam, won points
among some veterans and retirees for his arguments against cuts in
the Veterans Administration budget and against privatization of
Social Security. ``My support is more blue collar, union people,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Udall, New Mexico's attorney general and the Democratic
candidate for the Third Congressional District seat, noted that
Miller won 17,000 votes last year in the district that had only
3,500 registered Green Party voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about voters other than Greens voting for Green
Party candidates,'' said Udall, who hopes to unseat Rep. Bill
Redmond, the Republican who won the seat in last year's special
election. ``I see that as my challenge: bringing voters back to the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moving into electoral politics after Ralph Nader's 1996 campaign
for president, the new national network was formed by Green parties
from 23 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a plan: local-issue activism, then building a base
with local races,'' said Mike Feinstein, a two-term Green member of
the City Council of Santa Monica, Calif. ``We are not going to be
top down, like the Reform Party with Ross Perot.''
</P>
<P>
   Factionalism, the chronic plague of the American left, has split
the Greens into two groups: the newer and larger association, and a
smaller group, the Green Party USA. New York state voters will see
two Green lists in voting booths in November, a Green Choice Party
and the Green Party of New York State. The latter group's candidate
for governor is Al Lewis, who portrayed Grandpa in the 1960s
television series ``The Munsters.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Green candidates are running this fall in Boulder
and Fort Collins, cities with the state's two largest universities.
In California, Greens control the City Council in Arcata, a
northern coastal university town. In Wyoming, Green support is
growing in Laramie, home to the University of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal voters anguish over voting their conscience _ and
thereby perhaps handing victory to a conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support most of what I know about the Green Party,'' said
Mark Matthiessen, an AIDS nurse and a Green voter in Santa Fe.
``Everything I know about Carol Miller I really like. But it is one
of those cases where I dislike Redmond so much that I might vote
for Udall.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's mainstream newspapers editorialize against the
Greens, while the state's alternative tabloids increasingly endorse
Green candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in the Santa Fe Reporter, a free newspaper
with a strong readership among the young, said, ``Perhaps it is
time for the Democrats to consider the idea that the Greens are not
siphoning votes away, they are winning votes away.''

7-29 -- Charles ``Chip'' Homer Willauer, center, has been leading
the weekly Sunday night sing-along at the Prouts Neck Yacht Club
for 42 years, since he was 17. Change is exactly what this enclave
in the middle of Scarborough does not want. It is set apart from
the rest of the town by the configuration of land, which juts out
from the coastline and encompasses about 150 acres. A walk around

days when she could run faster, jump farther, and swim quicker than
any other woman in the United States. When it does, the honoree
will likely have little to say. ``I didn't think very much of it,''
says Rogan of the nine years, 1924-33, when she competed in track

VLADIMIR DUDINTSEV, 79, DIES; WRITER DISSECTED SOVIET LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Dudintsev, a reporter and novelist whose
dissection of mid-1950s Soviet life drew the wrath of Nikita
Khrushchev and the muffled praise of dissidents, died July 23 at
his dacha near here. He was 79 and had been ill since suffering a
stroke years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cold War was settling into a hard freeze in 1956,
Dudintsev stirred political and literary sensations with the
publication of ``Not by Bread Alone,'' a 500-page novel that took
indirect but unmistakable aim at the deadening effects of the
Soviet system on the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months the book was the talk of Russian intellectual
circles and the object of endless analysis by foreigners who were
looking for clues to the course of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Dudintsev paid dearly. The book was quickly denounced as a
``social evil.'' His writings became officially untouchable, and
his family sank into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, Dudintsev had fully regained favor, even publishing a
second novel, ``Robed in White,'' which won a state literary prize.
But a friend and fellow journalist, Yury Danilin, stressed that any
rehabilitation had occurred because Soviet leaders had changed
their opinions. But not Dudintsev.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a really unique person in the history of our
literature,'' said Danilin, deputy editor of the influential
Literaturnaya Gazeta. ``He never gave up. He was continually
claiming the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudintsev was not universally admired, especially among literary
experts. His writing style, such as it was, was often called wooden
and his plots were called convoluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said he was a great writer, a great artist,'' said
Tatyana Tolstaya, a literary critic, writer and professor of
creative writing who works in Russia and the United States. ``In
literature he was not a dissident. He just arranged his ideas in
the form of a classic boring novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Admirers respond that he was less concerned with entertaining
readers than with unearthing and publicizing the truth, a goal that
became a passion in his later years. Dudintsev's literary specialty
was stories about science and scientists, a preference that dated
from his days in the mid- and late '40s as a roving correspondent
for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, visiting and writing about
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Dudintsev, Danilin recalled, was especially struck by the tale
of one worker who could not convince his superiors that he had
found a valuable deposit of nickel, because the Communist Party's
scientific dogma stated that the metal could not exist there.
</P>
<P>
   Danilin said that story was the inspiration for ``Not by Bread
Alone,'' which recounts the efforts of an inventor, Lopatkin, to
persuade superiors to adopt his machine for the centrifugal casting
of iron drain pipes. Lopatkin succeeds, but not before being
oppressed, accused of divulging state secrets and spending time in
an arctic labor camp. Even in the end Lopatkin's tormentors, all
symbols of the overpowering Soviet bureaucracy, remain in power,
with luxuries and freedoms that ordinary Russians could only dream
about.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense the book turned on its head the formulaic Soviet plot
of the time, the lonely proletarian who strives against odds to
defeat capitalist heavies and advance the cause of communism.
</P>
<P>
   When an American edition of the book appeared in October 1957,
The New York Times said in an article, ``The author is careful to
show Lopatkin as a believer in communism and he ascribes the
inventor's troubles to evil men, not to any flaw in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The article continued, ``But so pervasive is the evil and the
intrigue that the reader may find it difficult to distinguish
between the failings of communist officials and the failings of
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudintsev had failed several times to persuade Russian
publishers to issue the book, and it might never have seen print
had not Khrushchev, who was premier, decided in February 1956 to
denounce the repressive regime of his predecessor, Stalin, and
mount a harsh attack on the Soviet bureaucracy. Those acts
apparently convinced the editor of a Moscow literary gazette, Novy
Mir, that it would be acceptable to serialize the novel that
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not so. The communist-controlled writers' union
accused Dudintsev of ``vilifying'' Soviet society. Khrushchev wrote
that Dudintsev ``took a malicious joy in describing the negative
sides of Soviet life,'' called the book ``unhealthy, tendentious
and noxious,'' and started a drive to force writers to hew more
closely to communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a brief preface to a British edition of his book, he
wrote that foreigners had misinterpreted the novel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he courted further punishment when Novy Mir published a
parable, ``A New Year's Tale,'' in which an evil and indolent
bureaucracy tries to thwart a scientist's effort to bring light to
a continent in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev was later deposed, and his successor, Leonid
Brezhnev, ordered the novel republished, in part to denigrate
Khrushchev and in part to keep Dudintsev from gaining martyr
status, some experts wrote at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Not by Bread Alone'' secured Dudintsev's fame, his
more courageous work may have been ``Robed in White,'' another
fictionalized account of how a Soviet scientist popular among
Khrushchev's aides all but destroyed Russian work in genetics and
aided the persecution of other leading scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Dudintsev researched the book in the Khrushchev era, and it ``is
very hard to imagine what courage it took,'' Danilin said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even studying this subject,'' he added, ``was so dangerous it
can be compared to working with a gun pointed at your head.''

   (NYT4) NEWTON, Mass. -- July 29, 1998 -- WOM-SPORTS-ROGAN-BOS,
7-29 -- When her family gathers here Saturday to celebrate the 90th
birthday of Katherine Mearls Rogan, talk will likely turn to the
days when she could run faster, jump farther, and swim quicker than
any other woman in the United States. When it does, the honoree
will likely have little to say. ``I didn't think very much of it,''
says Rogan of the nine years, 1924-33, when she competed in track
and field against the likes of Babe Didrickson. ``We didn't make a
big deal of it.'' (Frank O'Brien/Boston Globe Photo) *LITE

BRAZIL SELLS MOST OF STATE PHONE UTILITY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the one of the largest privatization transactions ever,
Brazil sold control of most of its telephone system Wednesday for
about $19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The auction of the 12 pieces of Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA,
known as Telebras, was dominated by Telefonica of Spain, Portugal
Telecom and MCI Communications Corp. _ partners in a loose global
alliance that spent a total of $11.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was a success for the Brazilian government, which
raised 64 percent more than the minimum bids it advertised for the
12 companies of the broken-up Telebras.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time when investors have been wary of emerging
markets and economies, like Brazil's, amid the Asian economic
turbulence, the auction's strong demand signaled confidence in the
Brazilian economy, government officials and Wall Street analysts
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the big European and North American telecommunications
companies that had winning bids, Brazil is a market with enormous
growth potential. The world's fifth-largest nation with 162 million
people, Brazil has two-year waiting lists for telephones in some
fast-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, multinational business customers are the most
profitable segment of the telecommunications industry, and Brazil's
prospects in that area are not as strong as in some more advanced
industrial and commercial nations. Thus, companies like AT&AMP;T, which
on Sunday announced a joint venture with British Telecommunications
to serve multinational business customers, did not make bids.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian market's sheer size and untapped profit
opportunities are too potentially lucrative to ignore for companies
like MCI, Portugal Telecom and Telefonica.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica, which was already the largest phone provider for
Latin America, bought the single richest license, spending $5
billion for control of the phone company that serves the Sao Paulo
region. It also spent $1.2 billion for the wireless carrier that
serves the regions of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Telefonica in Wednesday's auction only serves to
strengthen the alliance with MCI, which is to square off against
the AT&AMP;T-British Telecom venture and Global One consortium, which
includes Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   For the auction, Telebras was split into three local phone
companies, one long-distance carrier and eight wireless providers.
While the Brazilian government owned only about 20 percent of
Telebras, it controlled 51 percent of the voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   The total sale was about 13 percent larger than London's
privatization of British Telecom for about $16.8 billion in the
early 1990s, according to Securities Data of Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The auction of Telebras took about four hours on the trading
floor of the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange. Near the exchange,
police officers used tear gas, water cannon and batons against
thousands of angry demonstrators, the Reuters news service
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Brazilian government contend that the
privatization plan was a plot to deliver one of the nation's most
valuable corporate assets into the hands of foreigners on the
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which had been relatively slow in joining the global
wave of privatization and deregulation, has now sold one of its
last remaining state assets. The government had already sold its
stakes in Embraer, an aircraft manufacturer, and in steel,
petrochemicals, railroads and much of the electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
   Among the large buyers Wednesday were Telecom Italia S.p.A.,
which spent about $3 billion, and a Brazilian partnership of
Andrade Gutierrez, a construction company, and Inepar, a
communications and electric power equipment concern, which spent
$2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gutierrez-Inapar consortium spent $2.9 billion for control
of the local phone company serving the Brazilian northeast, now the
country's fastest-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia spent $1.8 billion for the local phone company
that serves the southern and central areas of Brazil, about $600
million for the wireless company that serves the southern region
and about $570 million for the wireless company that serves the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Telesystem of Canada spent about $650 million for the wireless
company than serves the region of Minas Gerais and about $160
million for the wireless carrier for northern states in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal Telecom acquired the wireless company for the Sao Paulo
region for $3.1 billion. Iberdrola, a Spanish electric power
company, acquired the wireless carrier for the Bahia and Sergipe
regions for $370 million. The wireless company for the central and
southwestern parts of the country was acquired by Splice, a
Brazilian high-technology company, for $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Wednesday's bidders could be concealing the identity of
U.S. partners, MCI appeared to be the only such company to win any
of the licenses. It spent $2.3 billion for control of Embratel,
Brazil's long-distance and international carrier.
</P>
<P>
   To acquire Embratel, MCI had to beat out Sprint, the No. 3 U.S.
long-distance company. The two companies' initial, sealed bids were
within 5 percent of each other, prompting an open auction process,
which MCI won.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in Brazil surged Wednesday after the Telebras
auction. The main index of the Sao Paulo stock exchange rose 223.93
points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 10,542.41.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, American depository receipts of Telebras rose
$4.9375, or 4.4 percent, to $118, after only two hours of trading.
Also on the New York Stock Exchange, a basket security representing
shares in the 12 spun-off companies of Telebras rose $5.6875, or 5
percent, to $119.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government was advised on the sale by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and by Salomon Brothers. &QL;

<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Well, they were listening, and they weren't yelling lewd

</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``You guys have to be easy on me. I'm a virgin up here. I'm
like having a heart attack up here'' _ Joanne Waters, creator and
producer of ``To Have and to Hold.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``I liked it. I was hungry, though. I snacked through the
whole thing'' _ Waters, on reading ``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``People ask me, `What kind of belt do you have?' Well, my
belt is Gucci belt'' _ director and martial arts stuntman Stanley
Tong.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``You don't. You're in there rooting for somebody to go
down. What do you think, we're crazy?'' _ William Devane, asked
about resisting the temptation to hope another show fails so his
show (``Turks'') can get a time slot.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``I trashed them right from the start. All the people I
hated, I got even'' _ former quarterback Phil Simms, asked if it
was hard to turn broadcaster and criticize players.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``This is my nightmare, and you know why? Because I went to
the set beforehand, and they did my hair and my makeup, and I look
like a French prostitute'' _ Waters.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``I pursued a career. It eluded me'' _ Kari Lizer, on giving
up acting to become an executive producer.

producer Marcy Carsey, on knowing which network to approach to
pitch a new series.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``In like the theater, they want to like hop in the abyss

to Los Angeles to write for film and television because I wanted to
make a lot of cash'' _ Waters.

</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``I was living in a room in Hollywood. So I would have
written a show about homosexual parakeets, you understand what I
mean?'' _ Waters, on writing a failed series pilot.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Joanne, in your show about homosexual parakeets, would you
have shown the characters kissing?'' _ critic's question to Waters.
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; ``They sent a box to the hotel room we were in. I mean, we
had a weekend basically to really get into `The Brady Bunch.' And
we watched about 25 hours of `Brady Bunch' episodes. It is Fellini

TEXAS MINISTER LEADS PUBLIC PRAYERS FOR RAIN
</HEADLINE>
 RAIN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GALE M. BRADFORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ Minister Terry Jones says he believes that
God uses famines and droughts to send his messages.
</P>
<P>
   And when everyone is complaining about the lack of rain, ``the
message I personally get is to stop complaining about it and do
something,'' said Jones, who runs the Provision Center in
Weatherford. ``The only thing we can do is what he told us, and
that's to pray. After we pray, we need to look up and thank him.
Then I can't wait to see the first raindrop.''
</P>
<P>
   The killer heat wave that has plagued North Texas for more than
a month continued Wednesday, with the official temperature hitting
103 degrees at Dallas/Fort Worth airport. And for the second day,
Jones led a noontime prayer for rain on the courthouse lawn. He
said the prayers will continue until the rains come.
</P>
<P>
   As about 20 people joined hands and prayed, the wind picked up
and the temperature reading on a nearby bank thermometer dropped
from 99 to 97 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   One man held a red placard reading, ``Prayer works'' toward
downtown traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers honked in response. Others showed their approval
with a thumbs-up motion. One driver shouted that a ``rain dance''
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones applauded the drivers and called the response ``an 80
percent improvement'' over those at Tuesday's prayer time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those praying Wednesday wore shorts. Some carried
Bibles; others had water bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, we need it to rain,'' Jones began, asking that the group
members acknowledge their agreement to pray together at a set time
each day and ``to give God all the glory'' for divine grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a need, right? And the need is for rain,'' Jones
appealed, looking skyward. ``He's going to send the rain, and we'll
persist till it comes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that as he called county churches to recruit support,
he was asked why he chose the courthouse lawn as the place to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I studied prayer meetings where they had similar
circumstances, maybe disasters, as in the old days, they chose to
come together in the center part of town, the marketplace, the town
square,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   So he applied to use the courthouse lawn and paid a $20 fee, and
Parker County commissioners approved his request Monday to use the
courthouse lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The permit procedure was set up after Richard Hogan, Texas state
director of American Atheists, objected to a Nativity scene on the
square.
</P>
<P>
   When informed about the noonday prayer service, Hogan noted the
irony of some parts of the country praying for rain to stop
recently, while ``we are praying for it to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hogan said he was pleased to hear that the
application process is in place and working.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Plugge, who said he baled hay until 2 a.m. Wednesday to
avoid the daytime heat, joined the prayer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it cools off is night. I'm trying to work by the
light of the moon. The vegetable and melon farmers have already
about lost their crops, and the hay people are just holding on,''
he said. ``The hay crop is about a third what it should be, which
has begun to affect cattle prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to rain,'' Plugge said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed.

FOUR INDICTED IN ASSAULTS VIDEOTAPED AT TEXAS JAIL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Mo., Hawaii, Idaho, Mass., Okla., Wis., Wyo.)  (jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A mock riot staged for a training video for guards, in
which prisoners were hit, kicked, shocked with a stun gun and
bitten by police dogs, has led to the indictment of four jailers on
federal charges of violating the civil rights of three inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners used in the videotaping, at the Brazoria County
Detention Center, just south of Houston, were from Missouri and had
been transferred to Texas under a widely criticized program to make
money from vacant jail cells by filling them with out-of-state
inmates. The program, involving thousands of prisoners from more
than a half-dozen states, has been the subject both of numerous
court proceedings questioning its constitutionality and of prisoner
complaints of harsh treatment and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The indicted jailers are Lester Arnold, 47, a former lieutenant
with the Brazoria County sheriff's office; David Cisneros, 38, a
former deputy and canine handler in the office; Robert Percival,
36, a current county jailer, and Wilton Wallace, 51, a former
lieutenant for Capital Correctional Resources Inc., a company hired
to help county officials with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments were handed up on Monday but were sealed until
the arrest of Arnold, Cisneros and Percival this morning. Wallace
was already in custody, having been arrested in June on a civil
rights charge involving a separate incident at the jail.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments, announced by U.S. Attorney James DeAtley and
Don Clark, special agent in charge of the FBI's Houston office,
accuse all four officers of assaults on one of the Missouri
prisoners, while Arnold is charged with assaults on two others.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Cisneros, Percival and Wallace face as much as 10
years in prison and a $250,000 fine each. Conviction of Arnold
could mean 30 years and a $750,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments resulted from a yearlong inquiry by the FBI,
spurred by the videotape, which was made by jailers in September
1996. The video, in which guards could be seen kicking inmates,
goading dogs to bite them and shocking them with a stun gun, first
came to light during court proceedings on a lawsuit brought by a
group of Missouri inmates, including the three whom the indictments
cited as victims.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the video was made public last summer, by The
Brazosport Facts, a local newspaper, Missouri canceled the contract
under which 415 of its prisoners had been jailed at the Brazoria
County center. Missouri brought its prisoners home, and both the
FBI and Texas Gov. George Bush promised an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the prisoner transfer program, which at its height
involved more than 5,500 prisoners, out-of-state inmates are kept
either in city and county jails or in privately run prisons that
operate under the jurisdiction of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to make use of cells that had become vacant in
Texas after new prisons opened around the state in recent years.
That would ease a crush of prisoners in other states while making
money for local jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   But prisoners from elsewhere in the country often found the
conditions much harsher in Texas jails.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2,600 prisoners _ from Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts,
Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Wyoming _ are still being held under the
transfer program, said Jack Crump, executive director of the Texas
Commission on Jail Standards. ``We have them in jails ranging from
San Antonio to Texarkana to Dallas,'' Crump said. ``All across the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has become smaller, he said, because it was always
intended to work that way, not because of the Brazoria County
incident or the broader controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very obviously Texas didn't enter into this for a long-term
effort,'' Crump said. ``We had some bed space available at the
time. It certainly appeared to us that we could afford to use those
for out-of-state inmates. Other states obviously are resolving
their shortage of housing and recalling the inmates.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   BofA Execs Exit As NationsBank Flexes Muscle  
   
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In another sign that NationsBank is in the driver's seat in its
merger with BankAmerica, two more of BofA's top seven executives
are leaving the bank.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice Chairman Kathleen Burke, head of human resources and the
bank's highest-ranking female, told colleagues last Friday that she
is leaving the bank in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, her NationsBank counterpart, Charles Cooley, was
named corporate personnel executive of the combined bank and will
report to NationsBank Chairman and CEO Hugh McColl, who will head
the new BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Jack Meyers, BofA's vice chairman of risk
management, gave notice that he would be leaving, too.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of top BofA officials began shortly after the $63
billion merger with North Carolina-based NationsBank was announced
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Lockhart, head of retail banking, and Martin Stein, head
of technology and computer operations, announced then that they
would leave after their posts were filled with NationsBank
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers, 55, and Stein, 58, expressed interest in retiring even
before the merger with NationsBank was announced.
</P>
<P>
   But the departure of four of BofA's top seven officers, in
contrast to no resignations by NationsBank's top brass, suggests a
definite power shift to the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Neither bank could say yesterday how the approximate 240
executive appointments have been split between BofA and
NationsBank. But NationsBank clearly has the majority. When 35
executives were named to high consumer and corporate banking posts
in May, for example, 21 came from NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a powerful combination, and I will remain a big
booster,'' said Burke, 47. ``But after a lot of dialogue with the
two CEOs and my counterpart at NationsBank ... the career
opportunities didn't match with my aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, NationsBank corporate affairs director Lynn
Drury was given company-wide responsibility for public relations,
internal communications, charitable contributions and corporate
special events.
</P>
<P>
   BofA Executive Vice President Cheryl Sorokin was named
government policy executive, responsible for international, federal
and state relations. NationsBank's James Kiser was named corporate
counsel and secretary.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank also has been beefing up its Montgomery Securities
investment banking unit, which it acquired separately last year.
Yesterday, it hired Salomon Smith Barney veteran Mark Hallock to
head a group that will provide money to buyout firms. A few weeks
ago, it signed former Deutsche Bank securities boss Carter
McClelland as co-head of investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   The BofA bank merger still needs to be approved by shareholders
and federal regulators. Both banks are shooting for a September 30
closing date.

 SEC Goes After Net Fraud   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Responding to a torrent of complaints about fraud on the Internet,
the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday announced the
formation of a special unit to fight it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Office of Internet Enforcement, which operates under the
auspices of the SEC Enforcement Division, is collecting e-mail
gripes ( &LR; enforcement(at sign)sec.gov &LR; ) and focusing on
investigations of widespread fraudulent operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect investors and boot scam artists off
the Internet,'' said John Stark, who heads the two-person unit.
``The Internet provides a lot of good information, but a small
group of users is trying to rip people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said the division is about to get two more officials from
the SEC, with which it shares finances and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While the SEC has pursued litigation in the past against
Internet companies accused of fraud, the Office of Internet
Enforcement represents a concerted effort to step up the battle
against online securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the SEC has brought more than 30 cases involving
Internet fraud. The probes include nearly every type of investment
scam, such as phony stock offerings, stock-price manipulation,
affinity frauds that target specific ethnic or religious groups,
and pyramid schemes in which funds from new investors are used to
pay off promised returns to other investors.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent scam involves an alleged $7.2 million ponzi
scheme, in which Massachusetts-based Royal Meridian International
Bank &UR;  &LR; deceived widows and the elderly into forking over fixed
income and other investments to purchase fraudulent securities
issued by RMIB.
</P>
<P>
   The division, acting as a civil-enforcement agency, typically
seeks injunctions and fines against guilty parties. In some cases,
the SEC may assist in criminal cases with the aid of state attorney
generals, the FBI, the Justice Department and local police.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's online Enforcement Complaint Center now receives more
than 120 e-mail complaints a day of potential securities fraud via
the Internet, according to Stark.
</P>
<P>
   When it launched a Web site in June 1996 to register gripes, it
received 10 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Securities fraud over the Web has mushroomed in recent years
along with the bull market on Wall Street, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Federal Trade Commission report this month said
the Web is overrun with a variety of online scams _ ranging from
pyramid schemes and get-rich-quick offers to fake businesses that
don't deliver products as advertised. The study is based on
information gleaned from 250,000 users during the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are gambling on investments, and that brings
with it, unfortunately, gross cases of fraud and misconduct,''
Stark said.
</P>
<P>
   Stark said he was unaware of travelzoo.com, a controversial
Bahamas-based Internet company that is giving away stock to lure
consumers to its site and bolster online traffic. It is uncertain
how much the stock is worth or whether the practice is legal,
industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC spokesman declined to say whether travelzoo.com, which
advertises discount airfares and resort packages, is under
investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins, who simultaneously became one of
20th-century ballet's greatest choreographers and a towering
innovator in Broadway musicals, died Wednesday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who also had a house in Bridgehampton, was in Manhattan
when he suffered a stroke at home Saturday and lapsed into a coma
at New York Hospital, said Deborah Koolish of the New York City
Ballet. He was taken home on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined the City Ballet in 1948 and helped shape the
company's creative profile with daring and brio for half a century
through his often startling, always experimental choreography in
ballet's classical idiom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he enjoyed phenomenal success on Broadway.
From 1944 to 1964, Robbins' golden touch was evident in musicals as
disparate as ``On the Town,'' ``The King and I,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``West
Side Story'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his acclaim on Broadway, Robbins made it clear that his
first love was dance, and ballet in particular. He returned to the
commercial theater briefly in 1989 with ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' but even this hit was an anthology of dance sequences
from past shows.
</P>
<P>
   His association with the City Ballet began when George
Balanchine, the company's artistic director, invited him to join at
the troupe's founding. Balanchine named Robbins associate artistic
director in 1949. After Balanchine's death in 1983, he and Peter
Martins served jointly until 1990 as the company's artistic
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance is about relationships,'' Robbins said. Attached to this
credo, he imbued his ballets, no matter how plotless, with human
insights and emotions that had a universal resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he was a very American choreographer who knew how to
distill the spirit of his time. But unlike others who created
ballets with pioneers and cowboys, Robbins did not indulge in
``Americana.'' He was not concerned with the myth of America but
with its reality.
</P>
<P>
   This genius for capturing the essence of an age was the Robbins
signature. It could be sensationally overt in a landmark Robbins
musical like ``West Side Story,'' with its indelible images of
1950s gang rumbles. But the same gift was even more vividly
expressed in any Robbins ballet, beginning with ``Fancy Free,'' an
evergreen masterpiece about three sailors on the town during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater,
Robbins created ``Fancy Free'' in 1944 as his first ballet. The
score was by a fellow unknown, Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, the choreographer said that he was more
interested in a world ``where things are not named,'' and his
exploration of ballet's classical idiom became more abstract and
profound. Nonetheless, he never lost sight of the pulse of his
times. In the epic ballets he created to music by Chopin and Bach,
he extended technical virtuosity and the art of partnering but also
defined contemporary encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation was a favorite Robbins theme, restated in works as
different as ``The Cage,'' an early masterpiece; ``Moves,'' a
ballet without music; the impressionistic ``Ives, Songs,'' and
cool, classical essays like ``Glass Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' artistic voice was distinctly his own, dazzling in its
originality. Remarkably, and unlike other choreographers, he never
seemed to repeat himself, especially in his 66 ballets. The same
was true to a lesser degree in the 15 Broadway musicals he
choreographed and occasionally directed (he was also production
supervisor for ``Funny Girl''). Shows from ``West Side Story'' to
``Peter Pan'' made Robbins' name familiar to hundreds of thousands
in the 1950s and '60s, and yet all differed in tone and style.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' inventiveness, in both ballet and musicals, stemmed in
large part from his willingness to mix disparate theatrical
elements. In 1945, while still in Ballet Theater, he wrote that his
vision of classical ballet encompassed a ``combination with other
theater forms in order to experiment and achieve a wider horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, he introduced conventions from ballet and
vernacular dance styles. A Robbins show was a model of integration,
driven especially by the idea that dancing, like words and music,
could carry the story forward. Descended from the innovators of
18th-century ballet d'action, Robbins never saw dance as just a
divertissement.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, his works for ballet companies were usually
essays in dramatized emotion, as seen in ``Afternoon of a Faun''
and ``The Cage,'' two provocative studies of male-female relations
that became Robbins classics. Even his 1969 Chopin masterwork,
``Dances at a Gathering,'' was, for all its plotlessness, a study
of a community.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical appeal of Robbins' ballets was quickly recognized
by Balanchine, and Robbins was as responsible as Balanchine in
establishing the City Ballet's reputation after 1948. The crucial
role that he played in the City Ballet's initial success was
recalled in 1988 by Todd Bolender, a former choreographer and
principal dancer in the company: ``Jerry was a great incentive for
Balanchine, contributing an American dance creativity in his
ballets that was of great importance to our early 1950's tours,
especially in Europe, where the Robbins ballets had an explosive
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure was, in fact, anathema to Robbins. Often abrasive in his
demands on both Broadway and in ballet, he ruthlessly drove his
collaborators, including actors and dancers, to extend themselves
beyond their own expectations.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional person who was known as something of a prankster in
his early career, Robbins, trim and white-bearded as time went by,
eventually acquired a solemn, patriarchal air. But anyone who knew
Robbins knew him as the ultimate perfectionist; he cast himself
aptly as a whip-cracking ringmaster in ``Circus Polka,'' a witty
piece he created for the City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival in 1972.
Here as well, he declared that his primary allegiance was to
ballet.
</P>
<P>
   After 1964, show business had ceased to interest him as a
serious endeavor. Rightly, he sensed that whatever his success on
Broadway, his eventual reputation would rest on his enduring
ballets. It was this output that made him the first major
American-born classical choreographer and a member of the
20th-century ballet pantheon that included Balanchine, Sir
Frederick Ashton, Michel Fokine and Antony Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins was born to Harry and Lena Rabinowitz on Oct. 11,
1918, in New York City. Robbins and his parents legally changed the
family name in the 1940s.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Why Huge Corporate Marriages Are Busting Out All Over  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The six biggest corporate mergers in history have all occurred in
the past three three months. Investment banker Paul Deninger put
that in perspective.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It would be like six batters busting the home run record in
the same season,'' said Deninger, who tracks mergers for Broadview
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers Group knocked the first one out of the park on April
6, by offering $72.6 billion for Citicorp. A week later,
NationsBank blasted off a $62 billion bid for BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   May produced two more record-breakers, when Daimler-Benz
overtook Chrysler for $39.5 billion, and SBC placed a $62.5 billion
call to Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   Last month AT&AMP;T offered $60 billion for cable-giant TCI, and
this week, Bell Atlantic said $52 billion was GTE's number.
</P>
<P>
   Three mega-deals in telecom, two in finance and one in
manufacturing: What's the message?
</P>
<P>
   Deninger thinks that telecom and finance executives have decided
that, to respond to deregulation and rapid technological change,
``the bigger you are the better off you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Powell, a member of the Federal Communications
Commission, happened to be in San Francisco Tuesday speaking to 70
telecommunications lawyers &UR;  &LR; the day the GTE news broke.
</P>
<P>
   They naturally asked how the FCC would handle this third
mega-deal in as many months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mergers are overwhelming,'' he confessed. ``They're
swamping the government (review) system.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Powell, one of two Republicans on the
five-member FCC, is against them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in his hourlong remarks, Powell painted himself as a
staunch free marketer, who would prescribe strong doses of
deregulation for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy-makers should learn to err on the side of the market,''
he said, repeating Yoda-like: ``When in doubt, trust the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Powell _ the 35-year-old son of retired General Colin Powell
_ acknowledged the dark side of these market-driven mergers. The
recent mega-deals have been heralded as promoting lower prices by
increasing competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But competition brings economically more &LR;  efficient &LR;  prices,''
he noted. What that means is charging prices that cover the true
cost of producing a good or service.
</P>
<P>
   Phone bills are a good example of inefficient pricing. It may
cost $10 to deliver basic phone service in San Francisco and $100
in rural Sonoma County, but customers in both areas pay the same
rate.
</P>
<P>
   That might have been fine when the phone monopoly could average
out costs, but it won't work as telecom rules are revised to
encourage a competitive free-for-all, he said. Telephone
deregulation is already pressuring rates up for some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the turd in the punch bowl nobody wants to talk
about,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if some people's rates must rise in the short term,
Powell believes most of us will be better off in the long run if we
trust the competition to set prices and services.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not so sure. Banks, which have also been merger-crazy, have
steadily increased their fees. Does that mean other industries are
also inefficient and need mergers to create ``more efficient''
pricing?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see where this merger mania will end. Baseball
players have an October deadline to bust Roger Maris' home run
record. But in the boardrooms, they could still be swinging for the
fences when spring training starts next year.

26 PERCENT OF PHOENIX POPULATION IS HISPANIC BUT ARE IN
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix is the sixth-largest city in the country, with
a population of more than 1.2 million. And 26 percent of that
population is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Paul Lopez looks at the city and wonders why there
are no Hispanics among the city manager's deputies. There was one,
David Garcia, but he left Phoenix and starts Monday at a job in
Texas. Of the city's 24 department heads, two are Hispanic. There
is no Hispanic City Council member.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is not alone. National and local Hispanic leaders will
meet today (Thursday) at City Hall to call on Phoenix officials,
specifically City Manager Frank Fairbanks, to improve those
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our issue is with the city manager and the appointments from
the city manager,'' said Lopez, vice president of Phoenix
International Consultants. ``It is a huge concern. We're
outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Council of La Raza, including officials
from the group's Washington, D.C., office, will meet at City Hall
with Fairbanks and City Council member Doug Lingner.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group were unavailable for comment Wednesday.
Some were en route to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez, who works with the group, though he is not a member,
said the concern is clear: Phoenix needs to do more in recruitment,
retention and promotion of Hispanics in the city, especially in key
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Hispanic leaders are outraged that when Garcia
left for Texas, his position was filled by Alton Washington, who is
Black, not Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not appoint a Hispanic in that position leaves a big gap,''
Lopez said. ``Somebody who represents our community is not sitting
at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the concern is not with Washington but the fact that
a Hispanic was not selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that Frank Fairbanks had the choice. . . . What
we're going to make sure is that our community is aware of what's
going on at City Hall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel it's a lack of qualified applicants,'' he added.
``There's a process, if you will, that prevents us from reaching
positions of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks said, ``We would like our organization to look like
the community. . . . We need to do better. We need to work at this.
We are.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to think about, he said, is that the city is working
with one less deputy city manager than in the past. He said it is
``entirely possible'' that Phoenix could add another deputy city
manager; three department-head positions also are vacant, and
Hispanics could fill any of those four spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would really hope that our organization's going to look
different six months from now than it does today,'' Fairbanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Lingner said the Hispanic leaders are right to be frustrated.
``This has been talked about for 20 years, about the hiring,
promotion and retention of Hispanics,'' he said. ``I think we have
to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingner, who is White, represents the city's District 7.
Sixty-two percent of that district's residents are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Lingner said he will ``do everything I can'' to help improve the
situation. Successful organizations have managers and a workforce
that reflect their base, he said. Does Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``That's our challenge.''

   Success came early to Robbins. At the age of 3, he played the
piano in a public children's concert. Rabinowitz operated a
delicatessen, and with his wife, offered Jerome and his older
sister, Sonya, a breadth of cultural opportunities. ``I grew up in
the Jewish tradition that children must get all the culture
possible,'' Robbins said in 1979.

N.J., the family moved to nearby Weehawken, where Robbins graduated
from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1935. Although he entered New
York University, planning to major in chemistry, he left in a year
because of a slump in his father's business.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Robbins had also taken lessons with his
sister's modern-dance teachers, Gluck Sandor and Felicia Sorel, who
directed the Dance Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor, whom Robbins later called his ``guru,'' attracted
considerable attention with his experimental productions. These
included ``Petrouchka,'' with Constructivist costumes by Vincente
Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor also worked with theatrical companies, and it was in
``The Brothers Ashkenazi,'' a 1937 Yiddish Art Theater production,
that Robbins made his professional debut with a two-word walk-on
role.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tenets crucial to Robbins' future success might be
traced to the influence of the Dance Center. Sandor impressed him
most, he said, by ``an imagination that evolved a different style
for every production.'' The Robbins gift for establishing immediate
audience contact stemmed from these early years. ``We dancers were
taught to perform with the concentration of actors,'' the
choreographer said, explaining that this meant ``the centering of
everything to pull the viewers into the performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance, not ballet, was dominant in the 1930s, and no
American ballet troupes independent of opera houses managed to
survive. But Sandor told his student: ``Study ballet. It's going to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins immersed himself in ballet classes with Ella Daganova.
He also studied Spanish dancing with Helene Veola, oriental dance
with Nimura, interpretive dancing with his sister and Alyce Bentley
and choreography with Bessie Schoenberg at the New Dance League.
Many of the classes were subsidized by the New Deal's Works
Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Fancy Free'' was his first work for a ballet company,
Robbins had started choreographing while performing in summer shows
at Lake Tamiment, a Poconos resort in Bushkill, Pa., that served as
an incubator for rising talent like Danny Kaye and Imogene Coca.
The dancers there ranged from members of Martha Graham's company
like Dorothy Bird and Anita Alvarez to Balanchine disciples like
Ruthanna Boris. ``Jerry was considered to be a modern dancer at
that time, although he was deeply committed to ballet,'' Miss Bird
recalled in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' choreography at Tamiment included a duet for himself
and Miss Alvarez set to ``Strange Fruit,'' Billie Holiday's
recording of Lewis Allen's song about lynchings. Named after the
song, the work displayed the political commitment then common in
modern dance. Like-minded Robbins pieces, later seen in New York,
were ``Incident in Harlem'' and ``Death of a Loyalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also created a dance version of ``Our Town'' that was
incorporated into ``The Straw Hat Revue,'' which Max Leibman,
Tamiment's entertainment director, and the Shubert Organization
brought to New York in 1939. The show introduced Kaye to Broadway
and was in fact Robbins' Broadway choreographic debut although he
received no credit.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Robbins danced in the chorus of four musicals.
Some, including ``Keep Off the Grass'' in 1939, were choreographed
by Balanchine, then bereft of a ballet company.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins joined Ballet Theater only in its second season in
1940-41. Although not primarily remembered today as a dancer, he
left an impact on many who saw him perform at Ballet Theater and in
his own and Balanchine's works at the City Ballet. In any event,
his dancing career was overshadowed by his sensational success as a
choreographer. Robbins retired from dancing in 1952, although he
later appeared in cameo roles at the City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   While at Ballet Theater and in his early years on Broadway,
Robbins was also politically active. When called before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities in May 1953, the choreographer
said he had belonged to the American Communist Party's Theatrical
Transient Group between 1943 and 1947. Many in the arts never
forgave Robbins for naming eight colleagues as members of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Velde, R-Ill., chairman of the committee, praised
Robbins for his testimony, which the choreographer justified on the
grounds that he had made ``a great mistake in joining the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his testimony, Robbins had already choreographed
hits like ``On the Town,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and ``The King and
I.'' His Broadway career was at stake: had he not cooperated with
the panel, he risked being blacklisted in the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for the Soviet Union was nonetheless common when that
country and the United States were allies in World War II. A more
universal statement about that period came from Robbins in ``Fancy
Free.'' A shrewd, warm and idiomatic picture of young people in
1944, ``Fancy Free'' offered something new in ballet: ``The
revelation of democratic human relationships,'' as George Amberg
wrote in his book, ``Ballet in America'' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   The same writer saw Robbins' next and equally enduring ballet,
``Interplay'' (1945) as proof ``that the contemporary American
style is not determined by the nature of the subject but by the
character of the execution.'' In The New York Times, John Martin
wrote that the work's ``eight dancers perform in an idiom and a
style that have meaning for them.'' The idea that Robbins ballets
offered a collective self-portrait of an entire American generation
was shared by the choreographer himself through the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the success of ``Fancy Free'' catapulted
Robbins into a second, parallel, career on Broadway. Oliver Smith,
the ballet's designer, urged Robbins and Leonard Bernstein to
expand the sailors-on-leave theme into a musical comedy. With a
book by two unknown writers, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and the
authority of a veteran director, George Abbott, the collaborators
had a hit on their hands. The musical, called ``On the Town,''
opened on Dec. 28, 1944, and struck a responsive chord in a
war-weary audience that identified with its urban comedy.

 NEW YORK: urban comedy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dance became a major component of any Robbins musical. In 1945,
he choreographed ``Billion Dollar Baby,'' also directed by Abbott,
while ``High Button Shoes'' (1947) confirmed his ingenuity for
period stylization. The Roseland Ballroom honored Robbins and
Martha Graham simultaneously with an award, she for ``bringing art
to the masses'' and he for being ``tops in Terpsichore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Ma _ I'm Dancing'' (1948), with a book by Robbins and
directed by him and Abbott, was a takeoff on a touring ballet
company. The typical Robbins comic timing was illustrated by a
Pullman car scene in which sleepwalkers tumbled in and out of
berths. In quick succession, Robbins choreographed ``Miss Liberty''
(1949), ``Call Me Madam'' (1950), ``The King and I'' (1951) and
``Two's Company'' (1952).
</P>
<P>
   Although not the first to treat serious subjects in musical
comedy, Robbins impressed Broadway with ``The Small House of Uncle
Thomas,'' his unconventional antislavery ballet in ``The King and
I.'' The sequence borrowed from Asian dance idioms. La Meri, an
American modern dancer, had earlier retold ``Swan Lake'' in the
same way, but ``The Small House'' looked fresh, not derivative.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' integrated vision of musicals became more pronounced in
shows when he took over the role of director as well as
choreographer. He was co-director of ``The Pajama Game'' (1954)
with Abbott; he adapted, directed and choreographed ``Peter Pan,''
starring Mary Martin (1954), and he directed ``Bells Are Ringing''
(1956).
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he directed and choreographed ``Gypsy,'' and in 1964,
he served as production supervisor of ``Funny Girl.'' But the two
most successful musicals of his career were those he conceived,
directed and choreographed: ``West Side Story,'' an updated version
of ``Romeo and Juliet'' in 1957, and ``Fiddler on the Roof,''
inspired by Sholom Aleichem's stories, in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins also acted as show doctor, patching up five productions.
He choreographed Aaron Copland's ``Tender Land'' for the New York
City Opera (1954) and directed two nonmusical productions: Arthur
Kopit's ``Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm
Feelin' So Sad,'' and Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage and her
Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his acclaim in show business (which included five
Donaldson Awards, four Tonys, two Oscars for the 1961 film version
of ``West Side Story'' and an Emmy for a televised version of
``Peter Pan''), Robbins remained primarily devoted to ballet.
</P>
<P>
   His later works were more classical but in 1946, he typically
caused a stir with ``Facsimile,'' the first of his ballets about
contemporary neuroses. The cast consisted of Robbins and two Ballet
Theater stars, Nora Kaye and John Kriza. The ballet's love triangle
came to an end with Ms. Kaye's cry of ``Stop!'' Looking back in
1990, Robbins said, ``It was sort of a transitional piece, and it
came out of a situation in my own life when I was involved with two
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaye, in fact, told The New York Times in 1951 that she
planned to marry Robbins on April 16 of that year. The engagement
was broken and Robbins, who was very private about his life, never
married. He is survived by his sister, Sonya Cullinen of
Wilmington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins had cast Miss Kaye in ``The Cage,'' an allegory about
man-eating female insects that commented at best on the eternal
battle of the sexes and at worst suggested that women instinctively
hate men. For all its sensational aura, it became one of the
classics Robbins choreographed in his first decade at the City
Ballet. In 1953, ``Afternoon of a Faun'' stunned audiences by its
mix of sensuousness and simplicity. An updated gloss on Nijinsky's
1913 ballet to the same Debussy score, the work epitomized the
Robbins genius for discovering the rightness of every movement.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Robbins was shuttling between Broadway and
ballet. In 1958, he took a step that led to an informal leave from
the City Ballet. For the first Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto,
Italy, that summer, he directed an ad hoc group of dancers that
became Ballets: U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Although short-lived, this Robbins troupe had a huge success in
Europe and embodied a specifically American spirit in ballets like
``Moves'' and ``N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz.'' The group disbanded in
1961 but reassembled for a White House dinner in 1962 given by
President John F. Kennedy for the Shah of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Robbins returned to Ballet Theater to choreograph his
version of a peasant wedding in ``Les Noces.'' Just as
surprisingly, he then embarked on three years of quiet
experimentation in a project that he called the American Theater
Laboratory. His unrealized aim, he said later, was to create
theater pieces in the way that he composed ballets.
</P>
<P>
   On some level, the experience reopened the floodgates of his
creativity. Returning to the New York City Ballet in 1969, where
Balanchine named him ballet master, he astonished both the theater
and dance worlds with the invention that poured into ``Dances at a
Gathering.'' Subsequent major ballets included ``The Goldberg
Variations,'' an 85-minute exposition of the ballet lexicon, and
``Watermill,'' in which Edward Villella reclined onstage,
meditating on life and phases of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Balanchine, who had choreographed little between 1968
and 1972, was subject to increasing speculation that his creativity
had come to an end. That he then needed Robbins by his side was
obvious. Yet even after he recovered from this dry spell,
Balanchine continued to work with Robbins in a relationship of
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before Balanchine died on April 1, 1983, the City
Ballet's board named Robbins and Peter Martins, a principal dancer
in the company, as artistic directors. After Lincoln Kirstein, the
company's co-founder, resigned in September 1989, Robbins announced
that he wished to work on other projects and would resign his own
post on Jan. 1, 1990. He continued to rehearse the company for its
``Festival of Jerome Robbins' Ballets'' and, in effect, left the
troupe in June of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after restaging his works for the Paris Opera Ballet,
Robbins choreographed a plotless Bach ballet, ``Two- and Three-Part
Inventions,'' in June 1994 for the School of American Ballet. It
was transferred in the fall to the City Ballet. Robbins explained
that he was returning from ``a break.'' A few months earlier, he
had created a solo to Bach for Mikhail Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the City Ballet acquired a hit in ``West Side
Story Suite,'' based on dances from his show, Robbins had a heart
valve replaced. But in 1997, he finished a major work for the
company, ``Brandenburg,'' to the Bach concertos. During rehearsals,
he had said, ``I feel I have one more big ballet in me.'' It was
his last new work.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Making Meetings Merry  
   
 By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When top executives at Yahoo get together for a high-level huddle,
they might do it in Frogs. Or Locusts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Apple Computer, staffers can put their heads together in Play
Doh or Lincoln Logs. Meetings at Sun Microsystems may be in Wrigley
Field or even Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, where a whole new way of working was born,
even mundane office facilities like conference rooms have a
personality. That's especially true at go-go businesses like Yahoo,
where one building's conference rooms are named for biblical
plagues, or Cisco, where the rooms are named after comedians like
the Marx Brothers and Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   But even at seemingly staid IBM, engineers joke about meeting in
Paris or Rio de Janeiro _ conference rooms inside IBM's Cupertino
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Such inside jokes may provoke a chuckle before an otherwise
tedious meeting. But they also are one way high-tech businesses are
fashioning corporate cultures that encourage new ideas, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about making it fun to be there,'' said Sheila Adams
Hart, a psychologist who helps Silicon Valley executives with
interpersonal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing an otherwise stuffy conference room ``Bugs Bunny'' _ a
name chosen by both PeopleSoft, a Pleasanton-based software-maker,
and Netscape, the Mountain View Internet company _ encourages
people to relax, drop their professional demeanor and be more
playful and creative, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fosters the environment we believe in,'' said Corey Wong,
western regional real estate manager at Mountain View-based Sun
Microsystems. ``It gives people a sense of ownership and inclusion.
And it makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the computer company's more than 100 Bay Area buildings,
people can meet in ``Toy Story''-themed rooms such as Buzz
Lightyear (soon to display artwork of the square-jawed hero),
``Star Trek'' rooms (a life-sized cutout of Spock adorned one) or
rooms named after such movies as ``Ben Hur'' and ``King Kong.'' Sun
also has less formal meeting areas with stereos and comfy chairs to
``stimulate communication and spontaneous thinking,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show your corporate culture in everything _ the way the
building looks, the way people act, the names of the conference
rooms,'' said Joe Kraus, a co-founder of Excite, an Internet
gateway and search engine company in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides conference rooms called goofy things like Tsar and Mr.
Swiss (the first e-mail handles of two founders) Excite's
headquarters building sports a screaming red-and-yellow interior
design and a real fire pole that gives the place a ``Romper Room''
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies want to have some identity that makes them
special,'' said Jean Hollands, a Mountain View-based corporate
psychologist and executive coach.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, dubbing a conference room something memorable and
unique _ say, ``Three Amigos'' or ``Three-Ring Circus,'' both on
the third floor at Apple's Cupertino offices _ creates instant
history. A shared past is often lacking in an industry that's young
and fast-moving. That's one reason conference-room naming is rarely
a practice at older, more established companies with plenty of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a place (the high-industry) where there's so little
stability and so much change, the names create a culture and a
tradition,'' Hollands said.
</P>
<P>
   The whimsical names also convey a message about the company _
usually something like ``this is a cool, hip place.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why employees at IBM's Java center in Cupertino proudly
broke tradition (Big Blue does not baptize rooms) and gave both
meeting rooms and laboratories silly names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing the Silicon Valley culture to IBM,'' said Rajiv
Jain, technical director at the company's Java center in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer-heavy group chose a characteristically precise
naming system, dividing their two-story building into four
quadrants matching four quadrants of a world map. The system makes
it easy for the geography-savvy to locate, say, the New Orleans
room on the second floor, west side.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't know much geography, a map would come in
handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring to have conference rooms with numbers and
letters,'' said David Ogden, PeopleSoft's historian.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft, like many high-tech companies, allows employees who
work in each area to vote on the room names. Among the 40-plus
conference rooms scattered over its Pleasanton campus, PeopleSoft
has Goldilocks and Rapunzel (fairy tales), Humpback and Orca
(whales), Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill (golf courses), Alcatraz
and San Quentin (prisons).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employee base is really young, mostly people in their 20s
and 30s,'' Ogden said. ``They expect something less conservative
than you would find at a Bank of America or older company.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the comically christened conference rooms become
an inside joke that makes employees feel they're part of a team.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Clara-based Yahoo, meetings are held in rooms called
Decent, Disposed and Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love calling people up from the conference rooms and
saying, `Hey, where are you? We're all in Decent.' It always gets a
laugh,'' said Erin Moore, a producer in Yahoo's e-mail area.
</P>
<P>
   In another building, all 10 plagues are represented, but only
Darkness is decorated to theme, offering soft couches with pull-out
beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a couple of people who booked it to take a nap,'' said
Moore, who helped with the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about us. We're part of a new wave of
industry, a new generation of companies that are different from
older companies,'' Moore said. ``The names and the attitude are a
way of saying, `This is not your father's Oldsmobile. It's the
company of the 90s.'''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   RealNetworks' Plan Backfires  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Confronting Microsoft can be bad for your corporate health, as
RealNet works chief executive Rob Glaser is discovering.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week after he blasted the software giant for ``breaking''
his company's software, RealNetworks' stock has fallen 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks is a pioneer of audio and video on the Internet.
Its RealPlayer software, which is free, lets Web users get
recordings and live broadcasts of news, sports, music and other
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks says its software has been downloaded more than 50
million times and holds a commanding 80 percent of the market. But
now, Microsoft appears to have set its sights on the little
Seattle-based company with a piece of software called the Windows
Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, a mild-mannered former Microsoft executive, told the
Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday that Microsoft's new
software _ which also is free _ disables the latest version of the
RealPlayer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glaser complained that the Windows Media Player
automatically replaces earlier versions of the RealPlayer in a PC,
establishing itself as the default media viewer. If you want to use
RealNetworks' software, you have to start it manually.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Glaser's main allegation with a surprise parry,
Microsoft cited an independent study showing that the RealPlayer
contains a bug that causes it to break itself. RealNetworks denied
that, saying Microsoft's the one with the bug. The companies have
been waging a public relations battle over the issue on their Web
sites,  &LR; www.real.com &LR;  and  &LR; www.mi &LR;   &LR; crosoft.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's accusations were supposed to give lawmakers ammunition
for widening the government's antitrust probe of Microsoft.
Unfortunately, they've backfired on RealNetworks by spooking
investors, who seem to have concluded that broken software is a bad
investment, regardless of who breaks it, and that Microsoft may
begin to eat into RealNetworks' market share.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Wednesday, RealNetworks' stock has fallen $15. It
closed down $1.13 yesterday at $29.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge has knocked the wind out of the company, which had
been riding high since going public last November. Its shares,
which initially were priced at $12.50, had climbed as high as $45
last Tuesday _ the same day it reported second-quarter revenues of
$15 million, 115 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's critics will point to the battle with RealNetworks
as a textbook case of how the Redmond, Wash.-based powerhouse
subverts competition. Microsoft has been accused on several
occasions of licensing another company's software then
incorporating a version of the technology in Windows, the operating
system that runs nine out of 10 new PCs. With RealNetworks,
Microsoft both licensed the company's technology and invested in
it, buying a 10 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft doesn't deny that its Windows Media Player usurps the
operations of older versions of RealNetworks' software. And it
doesn't apologize, either. In fact, it wants its software to
replace most other media players, including the RealPlayer and
Apple's QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows Media Player has all the features found in each of the
other multimedia players, plus a whole lot more,'' the company
boasts on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's big fear must be that Microsoft could use its control
of Windows to do to RealNetworks what it already has done to
Netscape Communications. After Microsoft began bundling its browser
with Windows, Netscape's market share fell from 80 percent to less
than 60.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Microsoft tell it, however, it's not out to ruin
competitors, but rather trying to make life easier for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that Microsoft posted yesterday on its Web site,
Windows marketing executive Yusuf Mehdi urged Glaser to bury the
hatchet and ``join Microsoft in returning to the mission that both
companies share: `providing great technology for consumers.'''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Glaser would like to put this episode behind him _
especially if it turns out that Microsoft is right and his software
has a glitch. The question is, can he make peace with Microsoft and
still keep his shirt?

FAMOUS LAST WORDS FROM THE PRESS TOUR

   _ &LR;   &LR; ``Well, they were listening, and they weren't yelling lewd
things to us in the middle of a scene'' _ Christina Applegate,

UNDER PRESSURE, N.Y. ASSEMBLY PASSES BILL CURBING PAROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also sidebar, NY-PAROLE-DEMS) 
(bl) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Democratic-controlled New York state Assembly
passed a bill Wednesday sharply restricting parole for first-time
violent felons, handing Gov. George Pataki a big election-year
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the legislation _ already approved by the
Republican-controlled state Senate and thus on its way to becoming
law _ marked an embarrassing acknowledgment by the Democratic
leadership that it had misjudged public sentiment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The 128-20 vote stirred hours of passionate debate on the floor
of the Assembly. The measure's supporters argued that it would keep
violent criminals off the streets longer, while opponents attacked
it as an election-year gimmick that would do nothing to
rehabilitate prisoners before they return to society.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came in an unusual one-day special session that
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver called after Assembly Democrats
came under intense attack from Republicans for failing to pass the
measure during the regular legislative session, which ended last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a major policy reversal for Silver, a Manhattan
Democrat, who has acknowledged that he finally took action on the
bill to defuse a politically potent issue that had Democrats from
conservative districts fearful that they could lose their seats on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to Pataki, who has said he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would take effect Sept. 1 and is expected to usher
in far-reaching changes to the state's criminal justice system. It
will take away the New York State Parole Board's ability to grant
early release to first-time violent felons, no matter how
rehabilitated they are deemed, and require them to serve at least
85 percent of the maximum sentence before being released under
supervision. Three years ago, the Legislature approved a similar
measure for violent felons with previous convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, only a handful of inmates serve more than
two-thirds of their maximum sentence before they are released on
parole. Because 30,000 inmates in New York are eligible for parole
each year, many experts believe that the new law will cause the
prison population to grow well beyond its current level of 70,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate on the floor was sharp and personal, with many
liberal Democrats attacking the measure. The moment that Silver
decided to allow a vote on the measure, the outcome was decided.
Seventy-five Democrats and all 53 Republicans voted for the
legislation. Twenty Democrats voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the members of the Assembly began to vote on the
measure, a protester in the gallery screamed, ``Shame, shame!'' and
then sneered, ``Thank you for your courage!'' before being led away
by security officers.
</P>
<P>
   The floor debate underscored the deep ideological divide among
Democrats on criminal justice issues. Assemblyman Anthony Genovesi,
a Democrat from Brooklyn, harshly criticized the measure, saying it
merely extended prison sentences by a few years without providing
programs to insure that inmates are rehabilitated when released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy that brought us here is not a product of the
parole system,'' he said. ``It's a product of the failure to
rehabilitate people in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Genovesi added: ``We're not doing anything here. We're
increasing sentences slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblywoman Carmen Arroyo, a Democrat from the Bronx,
chastised her colleagues for not having passed the legislation
sooner so that violent criminals would be behind bars longer. ``I
believe we are here to do justice today,'' she said before the
vote. ``But there's much more that we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The parole measure was a pillar of Pataki's criminal justice
agenda this year. As part of his effort to have the proposal
enacted, he seized on the case of Jenna Grieshaber, a 22-year-old
nursing student who was killed in Albany in November 1997. Police
said her killer was a neighbor, Nicholas Pryor, who was on parole.
The governor named his proposal to end parole ``Jenna's Law'' and
enlisted her parents' help in his statewide campaign for the
legislation.

COWBOYS SEEK CAST TO REPLACE BATES' ONE-MAN SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Bill Bates never made more than $500,000
a year. He didn't possess hulking size or brute strength. He has
never been confused with being fast.
</P>
<P>
   But his transition from 15-year veteran to rookie assistant
coach left a hole in the Cowboys' special teams and prevent defense
that they are attempting to fill with a combination of at least
five players scheduled to earn more than a combined $2 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt seriously if people knew why Bill was a wonderful
player or what he did for us,'' special-teams coach Joe Avezzano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was a mainstay on special teams, particularly on punt
coverage and kickoff-return teams. Charlie Williams is expected to
replace him as one of the upfront blockers on kickoff returns. And
Billy Davis and Dexter Coakley have been working to replace Bates
as the upback on punt coverage teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose a guy that performed the way Bill Bates
performed, it's going to hurt,'' said fullback Daryl Johnston, who
works on some of the special-teams units. ``Bill had some on-field
leadership qualities that are difficult to replace, but Joe
(Avezzano) is a good coach and I'm sure he'll have us ready to go.
There are still a lot of talented guys on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Davis, and Coakley have been extraordinary
special-teams players for the Cowboys. Williams and Davis, Avezzano
said, ``are amongst some of the best kick cover men in the NFC.''
But each must now perform his craft at a special-teams position
different from last year. The resulting holes to be filled worry
Avezzano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the best,
we're like a two,'' Avezzano said. ``The rating has probably been
that low in other years, and I expect it to go up. But now we are
working with a committee made up of a bunch of unknowns. The good
thing is we have preseason games to get things figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Avezzano is not the only coach who must find a replacement for
Bates. Defensive coordinator Dave Campo has been looking at three
players to use as the club's nickel linebacker, where Bates played
eight to 10 snaps a game on obvious passing situations. Linebackers
Dexter Coakley and Randall Godfrey, and safety Omar Stoutmire have
received most of the repetitions at Bates' old nickel linebacker
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My physical build allowed me to do a lot of different
things,'' Bates said. ``I'm bigger than Billy Davis, but he's
faster, and he'll get in there and fight and scrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Charlie Williams, he's also faster than me, but he's
smaller and he'll be in some situations with bigger guys that'll be
tough on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Dexter and Randall is those are guys who can
stop the run,'' Bates said. ``A guy like Omar is going to be
stronger against the pass. Each have different strengths, and it's
just a matter of what the coaches want.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo wants consistency. And so does Avezzano, who must also
find a kickoff-return man to replace Herschel Walker, who the club
did not re-sign in the off-season. The Cowboys were fourth in the
league in kickoff-return average (24.1 yards per return) last year.
Davis, Jimmy Oliver, Stepfret Williams, and Kevin Mathis are each
expected to get a chance to return kickoffs in the preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not working with a lot of experience,'' Avezzano said.
``But we have a lot of talent.''

ANALYSIS: DEMOCRATS ORIGINALLY MISJUDGED PAROLE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with NY-PAROLE-BAN) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As much as it was a strike against first-time
violent felons, the state Assembly's passage Wednesday of ``Jenna's
Law'' was a political blow to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver _ an
admission that the Democratic leader and his allies had badly
miscalculated how potent an election-year issue it would turn out
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Under mounting pressure, the Democrats, who control the chamber,
were dragged back to the Capitol to pass the bill sharply
curtailing parole, legislation that many of them had hoped would
never come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Democrats rose on the floor _ sounding stung
and angry and not quite believing their circumstances _ to complain
that the Republicans had, of all things, used the issue as a
campaign cudgel against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we here today?'' asked Assemblyman Keith Wright,
D-Manhattan. ``Because of an onslaught of cynical and distorted
communications by the Republican Party about our record.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that the Democrats could have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who is running for re-election, began the
year by declaring the measure to be his top priority for the year,
and at every turn he beat the Democrats up for failing to pass it.
He found unexpectedly effective allies in Bruce and Janice
Grieshaber, the parents of Jenna Grieshaber, who was killed in
Albany last November, and for whom the Republican governor named
his bill. Assembly Republican Minority Leader John Faso made it
clear that this would be a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   For the governor, this was a no-lose situation. He would either
emerge from the year with a popular law that he had championed or
with an easily understood campaign attack against the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote gave him the result he preferred, adding to a
law-and-order resume that is crucial to his aspirations for
national office. In one term, Pataki had returned the death penalty
to New York, lengthened prison sentences for many crimes and
curtailed parole for repeat felons.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, Silver and many other Assembly Democrats
were convinced that the parole issue posed no threat to them. In
the last weeks of the regular legislative session, the Assembly
passed a bill that included the restrictions on parole for violent
felons, but also increased education programs in prisons, and would
have allowed many nonviolent offenders to go through drug treatment
rather than to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed their alternative to be popular, and the
Grieshabers endorsed it. Even though Pataki and the Republican
majority in the Senate rejected the Assembly plan, Silver and his
allies calculated that they had all the political cover they
needed.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, one of the speaker's top aides even tried to
persuade a reporter that the untold story of the year was how the
Democrats had managed to wrest the parole issue away from the
Republicans and turn it in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   But when the session ended June 19 with no law enacted in the
Assembly, the Grieshabers began complaining publicly that they had
been had by Silver. They appeared with Republican challengers to
Democratic Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his choice for lieutenant governor, Mary Donohue, did
the same, with the simple, pointed message that the Democrats had
refused to abolish parole for violent felons. People turned up at
political rallies wearing shirts with wanted posters of Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Assemblyman Roger Green, D-Brooklyn, protested ``the
political climate and the tactics that have been used.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, D-Brooklyn, said, ``It is my hope
that we will end the tradition of politicizing criminal justice
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He might as well have hoped for an end to partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote was evidence not only of the Democrats'
miscalculation but of their fear that come November, they will
founder in a Republican tide.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's popularity is high, no clear Democratic
front-runner has emerged from among his would-be challengers, and
the Republican Party has taken aim at many incumbent legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists fear the party could lose up to 10 of its
97 seats in the 150-member Assembly. Many Democrats from those
districts voted for the bill Wednesday despite their private
objections to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a normal year, a strong party, a secure
conference, we could stand firm and not vote this bill,'' one
Assembly member said on condition of anonymity. ``But we're running
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of these concerns is new. Many Assembly Democrats
considered the governor's race lost a year ago. Last winter, Silver
made it clear that he intended to avoid confrontation with the
governor at all costs, for fear of a political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday, many Democrats seemed stunned by the turn of
events. Even as they prepared to capitulate to the governor, they
could not resist the urge to keep arguing that their plan,
including drug treatment and education, was superior.
</P>
<P>
   Faso, the Republican Assembly leader, said, ``the majority in
this house only felt the heat; they never saw the light.''

PROUD `PARENTS' CELEBRATE: IT'S A PARK!
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The invitation was in the form of a birth
announcement. The baby's name: Hudson River Park, eyes ``marine
blue'' and hair ``naturally green.''
</P>
<P>
   The gestation period was given as 14 years, the amount of time
park proponents have been fighting to transform Manhattan's ragged,
derelict western edge into a lush if skinny new park. Thursday
night, they came together _ environmentalists, public officials and
community activists _ on Pier 40 in Greenwich Village to celebrate
state legislation officially establishing the park and defining its
borders and governance.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan still faces regulatory hurdles, questions about
financing and the possibility of lawsuits, proponents were exultant
over what had been accomplished so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, even the most optimistic _ we're amazed at what we
got,'' said Ross Graham, co-chairwoman of the parks committee of
Community Board 4 in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law _ which was passed by the Legislature last
month and is expected to be signed by Gov. George Pataki in
September _ 19 piers will be entirely or partly included in the
park, offering various forms of recreation. Along the park's length
will be a bike path, trees and flowers, education centers, places
to dip one's toes in the water and, possibly, sand beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some crumbling piers, which the public will be allowed to
observe only from the esplanade, will be planted with native plants
to attract nesting birds.
</P>
<P>
   Gone in the year 2000 will be an equestrian center that until
recently offered lifetime memberships, an enormous basketball
center and helicopter sightseeing flights. Such municipal uses as
salt storage and parking lots for towed cars and garbage trucks are
to be removed as soon as the city finds a place to move them.
Gambling casinos will be banned, and most of the piers will be off
limits to development.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass, eels and other fish species are to be strictly
protected in a new estuarial sanctuary extending the length of the
park, from Battery Park City to 59th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest possible level of protection for the
living resources,'' said Cathy Drew, director of the River Project,
which does aquatic research in the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The city and state, which own the land, had been proceeding with
plans for the park even before the legislation passed, but without
the new law any portion could have been withdrawn at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is a dedicated park,'' said Albert Butzel, a
lawyer who headed a coalition of environmentalists and community
groups to support the park. ``This is a night-and-day difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But celebrants readily acknowledged that the battle over the
park was not over. Opponents, who mostly fear that the plan cedes
too much to commercial interests and does not give enough
protection to the river ecology, are fighting the park in federal
and state permit hearings that could lead to long environmental
reviews and major changes. Lawsuits are expecting, and finding
funds is a major challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandchildren will be arguing about what should and
shouldn't go in this park,'' said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, an
author of the bill, whose district includes part of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the park is expected to begin this fall.

 The Woman Behind the Webbies   By Carolyn Said  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Tiffany Shlain may be the only woman in the world who has Rudolph
Guiliani and Willie Brown fighting over her. The mayors of New York
and San Francisco are vying to host the Webbies, the annual awards
ceremony for Web sites that Shlain produces.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Held in San Francisco for the past two years, the Webby Awards
have tapped into the growing obsession with the Internet, garnering
media attention from TV, radio, newspapers and, of course, Web
sites. San Francisco and New York, with rival new media industries,
both hope to bask in the Webbies' glamour.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The self-possessed Shlain ticks off her suitors' enticements.
``New York is offering Radio City Music Hall (as a venue for the
ceremony), and support to make the production happen,'' she said.
``But San Francisco is offering a lot of support through the
convention bureau, San Francisco Partnership and Multimedia Task
Force. ''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown was so worried that Shlain might yield to the Big
Apple's seductions that he assembled an ad hoc group of multimedia
mavens to keep the Webbies in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany Shlain has done a tremendous job as the city's digital
diva and we hope she will keep the awards where they belong,'' the
mayor's press office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really appropriate to have an awards ceremony like this
in San Francisco, because this is ground zero for the Internet,''
said Mara Brazer, managing partner of the San Francisco
Partnership, a public-private economic development group.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco offered to tie the Webbies to a multimedia summit
or digital arts festival, set up a permanent exhibit to showcase
Webby winners, provide public relations and help find sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With a combination of charm, persistance and an eye for what's
hot, Shlain, 28, has turned the Webby Awards into the Internet
equivalent of the Oscars, expanding the March event from a
600-guest ceremony in a nightclub at Bimbo's to this year's
2,000-person extravaganza at the Palace of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Webbies' first year, Shlain put together a first-class
show for less than $50,000, in part by attracting sponsors and
donations of products and services, said Michael Bayle, formerly of
The Web magazine, which started the Webbies. ``She took it from a
completely unsculptured idea and made something spectacular out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Tiffany's a classic impresario,'' said Douglass Humphreys,
CEO of the San Francisco multimedia firm Skyrocket and co-chairman
of the Multimedia Task Force of the San Francisco Partnership.
``She knows how to put on a show, she understands the marketplace
and she's very sharp. She has tremendous energy and great personal
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar producers could learn a few lessons from Shlain, who
brings her ceremony in at a zippy 60 &UR;  &LR; minutes by limiting
acceptance speeches to five words. (Sample: ``You ain't seen
nothing yet.'')
</P>
<P>
   To pump up the glitter, Shlain lured celebrity judges for this
year's awards _ including Dennis Rodman, Jerry Brown, Barbara Boxer
and ``Dilbert'' cartoonist Scott Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet community has responded eagerly to the event,
dressing up in ``future swank'' attire (tuxedos and ball gowns
mixed with piercings and tattoos), swigging vodka and boogieing to
a '70s band at this year's party.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the Web's egalitarian nature, upstart companies
competed head-to-head with giants _ and sometimes won.

   &UR;  &LR; San Francisco-based Cnet's News.com site won in the News
category, against the likes of ABCnews.com, MSNBC.com and the New
York Times on the Web. ``For people like us who do not have any
print or broadcast parentage ... winning a Webby gives us a stamp
of credibility and approval,'' said Jai Singh, editor of News.com.

   Shlain _ the daughter of a surgeon/ author and a psychologist _
brings a background in computers and creativity to her current
role. At 17, the Mill Valley native was a student ambassador to the
Soviet Union and launched a project to link U.S. and Soviet
students via modem connections.
</P>
<P>
   She studied film at the University of California at Berkeley,
where she was valedictorian of the Interdisciplinary Department.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1992, she launched a career as a filmmaker,
designing Web sites and CD-ROMs on the side. One of her clients was
The Web magazine, published by International Data Group.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When &UR;  &LR; The Web decided to launch an awards ceremony two years
ago, the editors hired Shlain to be its full-time executive
producer and creative director. The magazine folded just two months
before this year's Webby Awards, but IDG still owns the Webbies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Shlain is pushing the Oscar comparison a step further by
setting up an International Academy of Digital Arts &AMP; Sciences.
Like the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences, &UR;  &LR; Shlain's
digital academy will be selective (limited to professionals who
have helped advance new media) and will handle nominations for the
annual awards.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to turn the academy into a year-round organization
with a newsletter, conferences and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Shlain plans to open the 1999 Webby ceremony to the public,
selling tickets for the first time. Discussions are under way about
a television broadcast of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain, who hopes to make a decision about the Webbies' home in
the next two months, says she'll pick the city that is best for the
awards, but her heart seems to lie with the Bay Area. ``I am aware
that the home and foundation of the Webby Awards is in San
Francisco,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise solution is possible. ``It's not a question of New
York trying to steal the Webbies; this is something (New York and
San Francisco) should be doing together,'' said Arlene Weltman,
vice president of the New York Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``The
Webbies have what the multimedia industry has, which is huge
energy. They're very appealing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr have
reached a reasonable compromise in the deal to have Clinton testify
at the White House rather than before a grand jury. That is a
significant step in maintaining the dignity of the presidency. But
his videotaped testimony, on Aug. 17, should be only a preliminary
to the more essential steps of telling the truth and explaining his
conduct to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   The desire for a president who can be believed and who can
govern in an undistracted way is growing. One measure of that could
be found in the panel assembled on Tuesday by ABC's ``Nightline.''
It consisted of Lanny Davis, the most loyal defender of Clinton's
conduct in office; George Stephanopoulos, who helped put him there,
and David Gergen, who was hired to organize Clinton's first term.
Their unanimity on Clinton's needs as to political survival and his
obligations to the American people was striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for him to come forward,'' said Davis.
Gergen added that the president ``ought to take charge of his own
defense'' and ``tell the complete truth'' in legal proceedings and
then before the nation. ``It's absolutely essential. I think people
still doubt his word. And he's having a hard time governing. This
is his quagmire. This is becoming his Vietnam.'' He added, ``I
think if he doesn't tell the truth in this situation, if he's
thought not to tell the truth, I think the rest of his presidency
is going to be in serious peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos, who in his role as an ABC commentator was the
first Clinton associate to speak of impeachment, said that truth
was the president's best defense against that fate. ``He should do
what he should have done six months ago _ come forward now, tell
the truth, take responsibility.'' A restoration of public respect
for the president is ``the only way he can govern the country,''
Stephanopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such counsel, White House spinners were all over
the place Wednesday morning saying that the president was not
persuaded. Then came the news from David Kendall, his private
lawyer, about the Aug. 17 testimony. If agreeing to that date is
simply another of his defensive tactics, Clinton's troubles will
not end. If it means he has taken charge of his fate, as Gergen
urged, then Clinton may have decided that his legal vulnerabilities
do not preclude an appeal for public forgiveness and congressional
understanding, if the allegations are true.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by David Gergen quoted above may seem apocalyptic,
but it is worth remembering that he was in the Nixon White House
during Watergate, and he knows something about letting slip those
opportunities when the bleeding can be stopped. His remarks touch
on a curious legacy from President Nixon, which takes the form of a
public readiness to forgive a president who opts for candor rather
than the extended cover-up. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, in saying
that sexual indiscretions alone would not bring down a president,
was signaling that many in his party would be swayed by
presidential openness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took what could be a step toward openness Wednesday. But
he has to understand that he inhabits a unique political space.
Neither artful handlers nor skilled lawyers can relieve him of the
burden of his presidential contract with the American people. As
his former colleagues said, it is past time for Bill Clinton to
pick it up. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: `I FIGHT ... I'M SORRY ... I'M ANGRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BOX-TYSON) 
(af) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ His clothes were cool, a black T-shirt under a
dark gray pin-striped suit. Not exactly courthouse attire. And with
the air-conditioning blasting, the conference room in the Richard
J. Hughes Justice Complex was even cooler as the questioning of
Mike Tyson began. And he reacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold,'' he said. ``Aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the image Tyson was trying to project, ``cold'' was
a bad choice of words. It was a reminder of what he has always been
as a boxer and sometimes as a citizen: cold, cruel, combative. And
what, in a loss of cool minutes later, he would be again. In
another moment of truth, he was being himself.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't very likely to prevent the State Athletic Control
Board from licensing Tyson as a boxer. Nor should it. His return to
a New Jersey ring for a New Jersey hotel-casino is too lucrative
for the state coffers to reject his application. After all, isn't a
boxer supposed to be cold, cruel and combative?
</P>
<P>
   What did they expect, a seminarian? But for more than two hours
in Wednesday's hearing, Tyson's image appeared all warm and cuddly,
a candidate for canonization.
</P>
<P>
   What you heard most often was that Tyson had more ``integrity,
honesty, character and responsibility'' than when he bit Evander
Holyfield's ears. His lawyer, Anthony J. Fusco Jr., proclaimed that
Tyson was now ``a better person for it'' and Tyson's eight
character witnesses agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After only one session that lasted about one hour, Dr. Bertram
Rotman, a Wayne, N.J., psychologist, portrayed Tyson as ``a big
teddy bear.''
</P>
<P>
   His surrogate mother, 93-year-old Camille Ewald, described him
as ``very sad and very sorry.'' His wife, Dr. Monica Tyson, called
him a ``very good husband, a very good father.'' His friend, Tom
Patti, said Tyson ``has been a victim far more often than he has
been a perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   His spiritual adviser, the Rev. Muhamed Siddeeq, predicted that
boxing was Tyson's preparation for a ``greater calling,'' that ``I
see Mike solving many of the world's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to explain the ring's ``tremendous pressures,'' Chuck
Wepner, once a heavyweight contender known as the Bayonne Bleeder,
predicted that ``Mike is smart enough to know that if he ever did
it again, he would be banned for life'' and Bobby Czyz, a
three-division champion, had ``no reservation that Mike is
remorseful.''
</P>
<P>
   His new adviser, Shelly Finkel, described the Holyfield incident
as ``an anomaly that happens under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, as Tyson answered assistant Attorney General Michael
Haas' questions, the pressure began to build. Speaking at first in
a quiet, gentle voice, he talked about being on probation until
next March for his rape conviction, then he was asked if he
operated any other business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, ``I'm sorry for what I did,'' but soon he
blurted out: ``I'm cold. Are you cold?'' Then he was asked why he
had bitten Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know why I bit Holyfield,'' he said. ``I don't
even know how I was. In a rage. I went berserk. Let me take you
back to the first fight.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how Holyfield had butted him, then resumed
butting him in their second fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting weak,'' Tyson said. ``I was desperate, irate. I
just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would would display ``integrity, honesty, character
and responsibility'' now, Tyson said: ``I'm just a man. I'm no bad
guy. I'm no good guy. I do what's responsible for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might repeat the Indiana rape crime and the
Holyfield incident, he blurted: ``Both of those ordeals internally
ruined my life. You think I'm gonna do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   Fusco mentioned that Tyson had a statement to read, but Tyson
blurted: ``I don't want to say it now. I'm angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusco told him, ``Relax, Mike,'' then said: ``He's not angry at
you, Chairman. He's angry at himself.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Fusco later said, ``How many times does a man have to
be asked, `Are you sorry?' '' Tyson blurted: ``You know what I
mean, man. Why do I have to relive my ... ''
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby later, Mike Tyson insisted, ``I never lost my cool;
I was just expressing my hurt and frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   But he really had expressed who and what he is: cold, cruel and
combative. Just like boxing itself.

&HT;        HOUSE PASSES ANTI-DOMESTIC PARTNER AMENDMENT - SAN FRANCISCO
COULD LOSE $65 MILLION IN HOUSING FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 29 -- In what critics call a blow to both gay
rights and local autonomy, the House voted Wednesday to pull the
plug on an estimated $65 million of federal housing funds to San
Francisco unless the city repeals a domestic-partner law.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted, 214-212, to include in the housing and veterans
spending bill an amendment by Frank Riggs, R-Napa, that would
prevent San Francisco from using any federal housing money ``to
implement'' a city ordinance that forces companies doing business
with The City to provide domestic partnership benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a poorly disguised assault on a persecuted minority,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-South San Francisco. ``It is simply
preposterous for Congress to interfere with an ordinance of a city
that merely provides for equality of opportunity and fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggs had planned to introduce a broader plan that would have
targeted any city with such a domestic-partner law, but since San
Francisco is the only city with the ordinance, he decided to narrow
it to specify the city code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want leaders who respect and support,
rather than dishonor the sanctity of marriage,'' said Riggs, who
defined marriage as ``the covenant between one man and one woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think that we should elevate the relationship
between unmarried people as that between two married people, and if
we don't this is a form of discrimination?'' said Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, who estimated that the city
could lose more than $65 million in federal funds if the measure is
enacted, said the amendment interferes with the city's autonomy.
That's hypocritical, she said, for a Republican party that has put
state and local rights at the core of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi quoted a Riggs statement from a congressional debate on
block grants in which Riggs urged congress to ``decentralize
authority and responsibility and, yes, funding and revenues back to
the states. In turn we will be dispersing power to our fellow
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great idea, why not support it today?'' said Pelosi.
``This body is not the city council of any city in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, suggested to Riggs that, ``If he
wants to get involved in the laws of San Francisco, that he go to
San Francisco and run for city council.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure is the first of at least two Republican anti-gay
rights proposals expected to be tacked on to appropriations bills.
Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., plans to introduce an amendment later
this week to nullify President Clinton's executive order that makes
homosexuals a ``protected group'' against discrimination in federal
employment.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's debate crossed party lines. Two Republicans --
Reps. Jerry Lewis of Redlands, Calif., and Connie Morella of
Maryland -- spoke against the measure during the debate. They were
joined by 31 other Republicans who voted against the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no justification for this intrusion in local decision
making,'' said Morella. ``Frankly, it sets a terrible precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from other areas of the country also took
interest in the proposal, because of the jurisdictional questions
it raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It attacks home rule not only in the city of San Francisco,
but it attacks home rule in every city in America,'' said Rep.
Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, the former mayor of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan was of particular interest to Bay Area
Representatives. The entire Bay Area delegation including
Republican Rep. Tom Campbell, of Santa Clara voted against the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is discriminatory, hypocritical,
mean-spirited, and ill-conceived,'' said Rep. Lynn Woolsey,
D-Petaluma.
</P>
<P>
   Though passed by the House, the plan still has a ways to go
before it becomes law. The measure was is not expected to be
included in the yet to be passed Senate version of the spending
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In order to become law, the measure would have to remain in the
final version after House and Senate leaders hash out a compromise
bill, then that bill would have to pass both houses and be signed
by the President.

GAILEY'S COACH SHOWS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The coach behind coach Chan Gailey
visited Cowboys camp yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking about Jerry Jones here.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's head coach at Americus (Ga.) High School, Jimmy
Hightower, now retired, was in Wichita Falls to check on one of his
two star pupils. Gailey's only one of two because Hightower, 69,
also coached former Cowboys running back and now NFL head coach Dan
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower said that Gailey's leadership abilities were evident
way back when he was a starting sophomore quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real student of the game,'' Hightower said. ``He was
always the first guy to practice, the last guy to leave, the one
who really studied the scouting reports and always wanted to know
why we did things. That's not always the case with a high school
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hightower said he gave Gailey ``more leeway than any two
quarterbacks I ever coached.'' One time, Hightower gave Gailey the
option of going for the first down late in a tie game, or punting.
``He said, `Coach, you'll have to make that decision. That's what
they pay you for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like they say: what goes 'round, comes 'round. &QL; 
WANDERING MINDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers dropped an inordinate number of balls in
morning practice, and Gailey acknowledged it was a sign of a squad
with its mind elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our concentration level went down this morning,''
Gailey said. ``The offensive side especially. The thing I talked
about is we have to learn to handle prosperity. We had two good
practices in a row, and we have to learn to handle that and have
another one. We can't have two good practices and relax a little
bit. I thought we finished practice better than we started practice
today. I was glad to see that. We salvaged something out of the
last half of practice.'' &QL; 
SCHEDULE IS GOOD FIT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have five preseason games plus two scrimmages this
summer. Gailey was asked if that's too much of a load for his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not this year,'' Gailey said, ``and really, in general,
that's about what a lot of teams have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey called the full schedule, ``an opportunity. You don't
have to hit each other so hard. You know you're going to have seven
opportunities to go live against somebody else. So you don't have
to bang on each other so much in training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey added, however, that he and his coaches will have to be
smart about the work schedule on the days between games and
scrimmages. ``We're not going to run roughshod over our football
team.'' &QL; 
YES, THAT'S $1 BILLION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones didn't back off the idea that the new Cleveland
Browns will cost the owner-to-be something approaching $1 billion.
But he did provide some context to explain the extraordinary
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what that franchise will sell for,'' Jones
said, but ``I know if you looked at it as an asset, it's one of the
most unique assets. Certainly it's different than an expansion
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, Jones said, ``will be able to compete, and I believe
compete for a Super Bowl immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said, by the way, it's unlikely the value of the Cowboys
will be learned in his lifetime. That's because he doesn't intend
to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Jones said, ``and I'll never know. The only
real way to establish value is when you see a transaction.'' &QL; 
FAMILY FRIENDLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys played host to their first Family Day, on the
suggestion of Gailey. Families of players surrounded the field to
watch afternoon practice, then later joined players for dinner in
the cafeteria. &QL; 
THEY SAID IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that's what we had Beau Morgan here for.''_ Jerry
Jones, Cowboys owner, when told that Troy Aikman had been roughed
up while attempting a quarterback sneak in goal-line drills at
Tuesday's practice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, I feel like my grandma when she used to tell me to
give her a bucket because her feet were so swollen. That's how I
feel after practice. I just want to put my feet in a bucket.'' _
Billy Davis, Cowboys receiver &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed on Wednesday to submit to
questioning at the White House by federal prosecutors in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation after independent counsel Kenneth Starr
withdrew an unprecedented subpoena to compel his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 17 session will be broadcast via closed-circuit
television to a grand jury room to allow jurors to question the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorney, David Kendall, sought to delay the
testimony until late September, but the federal judge supervising
the case, Norma Holloway Johnson, admonished both sides to schedule
it sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be permitted the unusual courtesy of having his
lawyers at his side, unlike other grand jury witnesses. Starr was
willing to agree to many of Clinton's conditions in exchange for
the president's decision not to challenge the subpoena on
constitutional grounds and further delay the lengthy investigation,
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrangement to secure Clinton's testimony was announced,
new details emerged of the testimony and evidence that Ms. Lewinsky
is prepared to provide to grand jurors under the broad immunity
deal she reached with prosecutors on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Ms. Lewinsky turned over a dress and several taped
phone messages from Clinton on Wednesday to the office of the
independent counsel, according to lawyers familiar with Ms.
Lewinsky's case. They said the dress had been sought under subpoena
since late last year, and that Ms. Lewinsky had shipped it to her
mother for safekeeping. The dress became a bargaining chip used by
prosecutors to wield pressure against her mother, Marcia Lewis, and
ultimately was part of the reason Ms. Lewis was granted immunity
along with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's account said that the
25-year-old former White House intern told prosecutors on Monday
that she had expressed concern to Clinton in December about a
number of gifts he had given her, including a T-shirt, a brooch and
a hat pin, that had been subpoenaed by lawyers for Paula Jones in
connection with her sexual misconduct suit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president had made the hypothetical
suggestion to her that ``If you don't have them you can't turn them
over'' to Mrs. Jones' lawyers. Clinton's personal secretary, Betty
Currie, retrieved the gifts and gave them to investigators last
winter, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   That account closely tracks with Ms. Lewinsky's original
proposed testimony, or ``proffer,'' given to investigators last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's agreement to testify via closed-circuit television
allows him to avoid the humiliating spectacle of being led under
subpoena into a federal courthouse to appear personally before the
23-member grand jury that has heard scores of witnesses, from high
government officials to uniformed Secret Service officers, over the
past seven months. But it gives Starr something important as well _
the chance to confront the president in person and question him
extensively on matters ranging from his relationship to Ms.
Lewinsky to alleged efforts to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now secured the testimony of the two central and final
witnesses in the Lewinsky inquiry, after Ms. Lewinsky accepted an
immunity agreement that requires her to provide ``full and
truthful'' testimony about what she says was an 18-month
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky scheduled to tell their stories in
the next few weeks, the independent counsel will soon have the
final pieces of a complex mosaic that may or may not constitute
crimes or impeachable offenses. Starr is expected to quickly
conclude the Lewinsky investigation and prepare a report for
Congress on his findings.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has said he is investigating allegations of
perjury, witness tampering and obstruction of justice arising from
charges that Clinton carried on a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and directed a conspiracy to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   The final judgment on Clinton will be rendered by the House of
Representatives, should it choose to pursue impeachment hearings,
not by Starr or a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, announced the
arrangement for the president's testimony in a brief statement in
the White House driveway on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter the president will voluntarily provide his testimony on Aug.
17, 1998, to the Office of Independent Counsel as he has on prior
occasions,'' Kendall said. ``The president's testimony will be
videotaped at the White House with lawyers present. No further
statement will be issued.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in a week of negotiations over Clinton's
testimony came Tuesday, when Starr agreed to withdraw the subpoena
that he issued on July 17, allowing Kendall to characterize the
President's prospective testimony as ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials acknowledged for the first time on
Wednesday that a subpoena had in fact been issued and served on
Kendall last week.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that when Clinton learned
of the subpoena he instructed Kendall to quickly find ``a way to
get the grand jury the information it needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, ``The president is
obviously looking forward to a prompt resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to the subpoena was the subject of intense debate
within the White House and among the president's official and
private attorneys. Several of the president's political and media
advisers wanted Clinton to comply quickly to avoid the appearance
of stonewalling, but some members of the president's legal team
believed the subpoena was unenforceable and an affront to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the decision was made to make the president available
for questioning, but only under favorable conditions and not under
compulsion of a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the odd twists that have marked this investigation
since it began in January, Linda Tripp emerged from the federal
courthouse 10 blocks from the White House a few minutes after
Kendall spoke and read a statement of her own. She had just
completed her eighth and final day before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp brought her former friend, Ms. Lewinsky, to the
attention of Starr's office on Jan. 12, saying that Ms. Lewinsky
had confided in her details of a long-running sexual relationship
with the president. She provided tape recordings of their
conversations and documents that appeared to point to a conspiracy
to obstruct justice involving the president and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has never been, quote, `just about sex,'''
Mrs. Tripp said in a breaking voice under a sweltering sun. ``It
has been about telling the truth, and the truth matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the Judiciary Committee,
welcomed news of the president's impending testimony as a sign that
Starr's inquiry was in its ``closing throes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be more than just alleged sexual peccadilloes in
the White House, and frankly all of us would like to get this over
with,'' Hatch said at a news conference. ``I'd be surprised if Ken
Starr would allow this to go well into September.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, was more blunt, calling on Starr to conclude his
investigation and ``give us a report on what he's done to date. Let
the American people, let the Congress do it and let the Congress
act whichever way they want. But wrap this sucker up.''

SOFTWARE FLAW LETS COMPUTER VIRUSES ARRIVE VIA E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., N.Y.)  (Eds: The word PLUS in parentheses has been used instead of the
symbol, which is non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
(af) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The security flaw reported this week in e-mail
programs produced by two highly respected software companies points
to an industrywide problem _ the danger of programming languages
whose greatest strength is also their greatest weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the power and flexibility of C and C(PLUS)(PLUS), the
computer languages most commonly used to build commercial software,
derive from the fact that they give professional programmers the
ability to write enormously complex programs quickly and
efficiently. But they do this, in part, by allowing short cuts that
can also lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these short cuts, even the best commercial
programs today are riddled with bugs that range from merely
annoying to catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``C makes it too easy to slice your fingers off, and programmers
all over the world are doing so with great regularity,'' said
Steven Bellovin, a researcher and computer security specialist at
AT&AMP;T Laboratories, where the C language was developed in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   More modern programming languages, like the Java language
developed by Sun Microsystems, have built-in safeguards that
prevent programmers from making many common types of errors that
could result in security loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a price for these safeguards. Although closely
related to C and C(PLUS)(PLUS), Java runs far more slowly that
either of those languages. For that reason, it has met resistance
from programmers who are eager to get as much speed as possible
from computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, both the Microsoft Corp. and the Netscape
Communications Corp. said that some of their electronic mail
programs contained flaws that would enable a malicious programmer
to attach to an e-mail message a rogue program that would run
automatically on a computer receiving it. The results could range
from simply crashing the computer to stealing passwords or
destroying data.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft's Outlook e-mail products _ Express and Outlook
98 _ and Netscape Mail contain a flaw known as a buffer overflow
error that allows a virus to lock up the e-mail programs and trick
an operating system into running illicit software code in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   Such mistakes are easy to make when using the C language,
security researchers said, because it allows programmers tremendous
latitude in the way they store information in the computer's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although C(PLUS)(PLUS), a more advanced version of C,
offers many protections against errors, it also accepts the older
C-style programming conventions. This allows C(PLUS)(PLUS)
programmers to bypass the newer language's safeguards and drive
without a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   The problem exists because, unlike most other languages, C does
not differentiate types of data. A variable in C might hold any
kind of information _ a number, a string of text characters, a
date, etc.
</P>
<P>
   So, when programmers want to create a variable that can hold a
string of text characters, like a password or a file name, they are
forced to carve out a piece of the computer's memory to hold it.
But a password might be 5 letters or 8 letters and a file name
might be 4 characters long or 51 characters long. So the end of the
character string is supposed to be marked by a special value that
lets operating system know how much memory to set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The overflow bug occurs when a program fails to check the length
of each character string, in which case a string that is too big to
fit into the memory allocated to it will lock up the program.
</P>
<P>
   Although this type of error is well known and has been
documented in programming literature for more than 30 years, it has
been found increasingly these days in programs that send or get
Internet data, making them of particular concern to security
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bellovin said he had recently completed a review of the security
advisories distributed by the Computer Emergency Response Team at
Carnegie Mellon University. His study found that 4 out of 9
security problems in 1998 and at least 10 out of 28 in 1997
involved the same error found in the Microsoft and Netscape
products.
</P>
<P>
   Java, in contrast, prevents this error by automatically
allocating more memory to accommodate a character string of any
length.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language guarantees that data that isn't expected can't
get through and corrupt or interrupt a program,'' said Paul Haahr,
a San Francisco-based Java developer.
</P>
<P>
   Haahr said that the performance advantage enjoyed by C programs
was often gained because they failed to do the rigorous checking
that is built into Java.
</P>
<P>
   Despite safety advances in newer languages, many veteran
software designers are fatalistic about the possibility of
eliminating bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morris, a veteran security researcher who was once the
chief scientist of the National Security Agency, said that in part
the problem was a result of ``the emergence of a commercial culture
that is careless and counts on customers to find bugs once they are
in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a decade ago that Morris' son, Robert Tappan Morris, then
a first-year graduate student at Cornell University, used a similar
buffer overflow error as one of the mechanisms that permitted his
Internet Worm program to infect large portions of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Netscape, rushing software to the public in a
fierce battle to dominate the Internet, were well aware of the
danger and the consequences.

JURORS SOUGHT TO DISCIPLINE ACCUSERS, NOT FINANCIALLY BREAK THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sidebar with NY-BRAWLEY-SUIT) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ When jurors in the Tawana Brawley
defamation suit finally spoke Wednesday, they said they hoped their
verdict would satisfy Steven Pagones by clearing his name. They
said they wanted to teach a lesson to those who would accuse first
and ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a lesson delivered with a wagging finger, not with a
monetary bludgeon. The jurors said they saw no point in a
multimillion-dollar award that would destroy Pagones' accusers
financially.
</P>
<P>
   For all the enmity that the Brawley case had engendered over the
years and for all the delays and endless stretches during the trial
when the jurors were kept waiting outside the courtroom, while
who-knows-what went on inside, the jurors displayed little
hostility toward the participants.
</P>
<P>
   They ignored the most divisive question of all _ whether Ms.
Brawley was a victim, or the perpetrator of a hoax. ``There's
enough divisiveness in this country,'' said juror Glen Heinsohn.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this jury of factory workers and public servants,
who sounded awed by the college and graduate degrees of the
participants in the trial, managed to reduce eight and a half
months of arduous, often mind-numbing testimony and the rare
exciting courtroom moment to a simple statement: the Brawley
advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox _
had lied.

NASCAR COULD PASS INDY IN OWN BRICKYARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Like a freight train of Chevrolets and Fords
hooked up in the draft, NASCAR's Brickyard 400 is bearing down on
the mystique and the majesty of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's
Indy-car traditions.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's Winston Cup stock-car series already was the nation's
fastest-growing spectator sport when it, with the blessing of
Speedway president Tony George, ran the inaugural Brickyard 400 at
IMS on Aug. 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later _ and aided and abetted by the wrist-slitting
rift in open-wheel racing between George's Indy Racing League and
the Championship Auto Racing Teams _ the Brickyard 400 is closing
the popularity gap on ``The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I hate to even touch that one,'' defending Brickyard 400
champion Ricky Rudd said as practice began yesterday for the race's
fifth edition on Saturday. ``Indy has speed to sell, and
technology. Stock cars are a different sport. I'm still a fan of
the Indy 500, but I don't think they did the race any justice when
they split the sport. It has hurt the recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wouldn't be fair for me to say stock cars are bigger
now than Indy-cars'' at IMS.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd does not have to. As far as the almighty television ratings
are concerned, the Indy 500 has become just another race.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.6 rating for May's telecast on ABC of the 82nd Indy 500
was down 18 percent from 1996, the last time the race was run on a
Sunday. The rating also was down 33 percent from 1995, the last
year that Championship Auto Racing Team stars such as Michael
Andretti, Jimmy Vasser and Bobby Rahal competed at IMS. A rating
point represents 980,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Daytona 500 _ NASCAR's season-opening Super Bowl
_ has outrated Indy in each of the past three years. The 7.7 rating
for February's Daytona 500, the kickoff to NASCAR's 50th
anniversary season, was 38 percent higher than Indy. And even
less-renowned Cup events like the DieHard 500 at Talladega (Ala.)
Superspeedway on ABC (5.7) and the 2-year-old Texas 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on CBS (5.4) posted numbers comparable
to the famed Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Indy 500 champion Al Unser Jr. said the TV numbers _
and grumblings from corporate America and fans _ should be telling
George the thrill is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to tell Tony. He knows,'' said Unser, who is
scheduled to compete in the first International Race of Champions
event at IMS tomorrow. ``Rick Mears puts it really good. He wears
the Indy 500 ring on his finger (as a four-time winner) and so do
I. But when we won the race, it was something. It was the top of
the game. Now it's not. And it's really a shame that it isn't. At
least we did it (win) when it was a race.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Cup race, NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series is
scheduled to compete at nearby Indianapolis Raceway Park tonight.
And NASCAR's Busch Grand National Series is booked for the same
venue tomorrow night. Combined with the IROC finale, the weekend
looms as a showcase for full-bodied racing in the heartland of
open-wheel country.
</P>
<P>
   As per tradition, IMS officials do not routinely announce
attendance figures for either the Indy 500 or Brickyard 400. But
the 300,000-seat grandstands were filled in May for the Indy 500
and the Cup race also is a sellout. Fred Nation, vice president for
corporate communications and public relations for IMS, said
Speedway officials stopped taking ticket orders for the 1999 Indy
500 at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   But the sizzle that once marked the month of May has waned
noticeably since 1995, a fact driven home this year when George
opted to condense the traditional two weekends of qualifying drama
into two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's always made the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the
Indy 500 is that it's the best of the best in one series,'' said
Jeff Gordon, winner of the inaugural Brickyard 400. ``That's what I
think we hold right now. We've got the best of the best in
stock-car racing. It's all in one event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're here, and I'm in the Brickyard 400, I'd love to
see it be the top event here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton, rising star of Roush Racing's five-car Ford stable,
conceded that the Brickyard 400 does not enjoy the storied
traditions associated with the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I venture to say that right now there's more interest in the
Brickyard 400 than there is in the Indy 500,'' Burton said. ``But
to say an event that's in its fifth year compares wouldn't be
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Nation, who regularly travels an IRL circuit where empty seats
are plentiful, said the organizers of domestic open-wheel racing
are being challenged by NASCAR's runaway growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brickyard 400 is a major event because of the heritage of
the Indianapolis 500,'' Nation said. ``People say, `Which one do
you like the most?' It's like which of your children do you love
the most? You love them both, for different reasons. We want to see
the Brickyard 400 grow. But in our opinion, it will never overtake
the Indy 500.''

EDITORIAL: THE AUTO DEAL THAT RESOLVES LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   The most telling fact about union-management relations at
General Motors is that the agreement announced Tuesday to end the
strike promises that top officials of the union and the company
will talk to each other regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Such a promise would be unnecessary at Ford or Chrysler, which
have managed to maintain better relations with their workers while
making their plants more efficient. Management and workers at GM
have traditionally viewed each other as the enemy, something that
seems not to have changed. Told that GM's stock price had fallen
Wednesday, a union official responded, ``That's good,'' explaining
that he was pleased that GM executives would lose a little money.
</P>
<P>
   It is good news that the strike is finally over, but it is far
from clear that much was accomplished by either side. When the
strike began, GM was talking about ending a system at one Flint
factory where workers had to meet daily production quotas and could
then call it a day, even if they had only worked for four hours.
They wanted the workers to be required to work the entire day. What
the company got was a promise that some of the quotas would be
increased, but the system will remain.
</P>
<P>
   The union won specific promises of investment at certain plants
and promises that those plants would not be closed or sold until
the end of next year. That assures that those issues can be
addressed in next year's national labor negotiations, which
threaten to be just as confrontational as was this strike, which
was ostensibly over local issues.
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to believe that anything fundamental has
changed. GM, whose dominance of the American automobile market was
once so great that antitrust action was considered, appears to
remain in a long-term decline, the result of poor management
decisions and hostile labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wonderful if the renewed contacts promised by the
new settlement led to a real change at GM and made it easier for
the lumbering giant to compete in a world auto market that is
replete with excess manufacturing capacity. But there is scant
evidence that will happen. &QL;

<P>
   When Monica Lewinsky's legal troubles began last January, her
first phone call was to her mother, Marcia Lewis. The two, by all
accounts, are extremely close.
</P>
<P>
   So close, it seems, that when federal prosecutors granted Ms.
Lewinsky full immunity from prosecution on Tuesday, a similar deal
was given Ms. Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's shopping partner, roommate and,
perhaps most relevant, her confidante.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer familiar with the case said it was the mother's legal
vulnerability that ultimately helped bring Ms. Lewinsky to the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a well-documented case on the mother,'' one lawyer
familiar with the case said Wednesday. ``They always knew the
pressure point was Monica's mom.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the possible evidence against Ms. Lewis is not known. But
in conversations taped by a former colleague, Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky, according to lawyers who have heard the tapes, is quoted
as saying that her mother thought it was a ``brilliant'' idea for
Mrs. Tripp to fake an injury to avoid receiving a subpoena in the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   She also says that her mother told her to lie about the nature
of her relationship with President Clinton in a deposition to the
Jones lawyers. If that is true, Ms. Lewis could have been charged
with obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Given their strong relationship, Ms. Lewinsky is believed to
have confided to her mother many of the details of what Ms.
Lewinsky now reportedly acknowledges was a sexual relationship with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge, perhaps imparted over time as any relationship
developed, could be crucial to the case that independent counsel
Kenneth Starr appears to be building against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew everything,'' Lucianne Goldberg, the New York
literary agent who has heard some of the tapes, said Wednesday. The
impression given on the tapes, she added, was that the two are
``very close.''
</P>
<P>
   That became evident from the start of Starr's pursuit of Ms.
Lewinsky. When federal agents working for Starr first confronted
Ms. Lewinsky, she called her mother, and the agents had to wait in
a hotel in northern Virginia for hours for Ms. Lewis to take the
next train from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal?'' Ms. Lewis asked the investigators,
according to several reports published since then. ``So she lied
and tried to convince someone else to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   To Steven Schragis, who published a book that Ms. Lewis wrote on
the private lives of three male opera stars two years ago, it made
perfect sense that her daughter would call her in a time of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcia Lewis was an extremely competent, aggressive,
intelligent, worldly woman,'' Schragis said. ``I'm using a lot of
cliches here, but she knew the score. She knew what was going on.
The light bulb was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said it was Ms. Lewis who devised a novel marketing
strategy for her book: the hint, never addressed in the book, that
she had an affair with Placido Domingo. He has denied knowing her
more than casually.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since she divorced Ms. Lewinsky's father, Dr.
Bernard Lewinsky, a Los Angeles oncologist, Ms. Lewis, 49, and her
daughter carved out a comfortable life in which they rarely strayed
far from each other.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, while Ms. Lewinsky worked as aide in the
White House and later in the Pentagon, they shared a two-bedroom
apartment at the Watergate complex overlooking the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Starr called Ms. Lewis before a grand jury, and the
result was a public relations disaster for the independent
counselor. Ms. Lewis testified for two days but became ill at one
point, leaving the courthouse looking pale and distraught. It was
an opportunity that three men in her life _ her lawyer, Billy
Martin, her former husband, and her then fiance and now husband, R.
Peter Straus, a New York media executive _ took to excoriate Starr
and his tactics. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ROOTING FOR THE ANTI-DREAM TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From his old friend, Chris Webber has received the
following advice regarding his trade to the Sacramento Kings, a
team he is reportedly not overjoyed about playing for: Show up,
suit up and shut up.
</P>
<P>
   That is our own paraphrased version, but Jimmy King, Webber's
University of Michigan teammate when they were both one of five and
life was fab, had the right idea. ``I told him that to fight the
trade would make him look like what people already think of him, a
troublemaker,'' King said. ``With all that's gone on off the court,
this should be a wake-up call. Just go play.''
</P>
<P>
   That would likewise have been prudent advice to the rest of the
conscientious objectors from the National Basketball Association
who could not serve Uncle David Stern's country club in Athens at
the world championships, in the face of a lockout. So instead of
the likes of Webber and company, the United States went to battle
Wednesday with the anti-Dream Team, with players from the European
leagues and the basketball bushes, with Jimmy King of the Quad City
Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the Dream Team,'' King said by telephone before the
United States waxed Brazil, 83-59, in its first-round opener, ``but
we can still play the American game.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Goodwill Games in New York last week, a bunch of
unheralded college underclassmen gamely stormed back from an early
loss to Puerto Rico to win the gold medal. The most heartening
aspect of the tournament was its competitive honesty, in contrast
to the typical National Basketball Association dunk-and-pony shows.
The Michael-Magic-Larry original Dream Team was really the only one
worth the hype, the time, or a ticket. If there is any justice, the
potluck dinner coach Rudy Tomjanovich whipped up from these NBA
leftovers will leave a pleasant aftertaste, and people will realize
we don't need the NBA to win, or at least contend.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on that, though, because the whole world would
apparently rather watch scripted celebrity blowouts, including
America's leading print journals, which pulled their basketball
correspondents when the NBA players dropped out. USA Basketball
canceled its NBC and Turner television plans, belatedly selling a
few U.S. games to ESPN2. Promoting itself as a basketball hotbed,
Greece for years lobbied for international competitions like the
world games, but they began Wednesday with pitiful crowds including
one of 500 for the United States-Brazil game in an 18,000-seat
arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the absence of the American team, expectations are not
so good,'' said Vassilis Skountis of the Greek federation.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers with no stake in the collective bargaining conflict
banked on the NBA players, and got stiffed. Patrick Ewing, the
union president, cited the NBA's incestuous relationship with USA
Basketball, making a strong case but missing the salient point. The
much-criticized generation of players soon to inherit Michael
Jordan's league could have made their own public service
announcement that it isn't always about the money. But, of course,
it is.
</P>
<P>
   How can these players be so oblivious to the notion that how
marketable they are is directly related to how likable they are? It
is impossible for the young NBA stars to measure up to the
championship standard Jordan has set, and the majority do not drive
120 miles an hour with guns and drugs. But there have recently been
too many police reports and paternity suits, too many $100 million
contracts and too few legitimate money players. Fair or not, Chris
Webber, who has done little for two bad teams and been deservedly
banished by both, is the modern NBA poster child more than Grant
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Chris personally, and he's not what people say he is,''
King argued. ``He's a good person, and I'm not just saying that
because I'm trying to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Fab Five had a two-year run to the Final Four, then
Webber left for the NBA, followed by Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose.
Ray Jackson went to France. King, a 6-foot-5-inch swingman out of
Plano, Texas, played one season with the Toronto Raptors after his
four with Michigan. He drifted into the Continental Basketball
Association, was its most valuable player last season on a
championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Now King has a role on a global stage, a chance to play his way
into a nice European contract or all the way back to the NBA. In
that sense, this team is also about dreams, if it isn't about
stars. Tomjanovich rotates 12 men in a pressing, up-tempo style.
Wendell Alexis, who once played for Syracuse and now earns a
paycheck from Alba Berlin, led the Americans Wednesday with the
grand total of 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   At least these guys won't be snarling, or showboating. They are
here to make the most of an improbable chance. ``It's one none of
us ever thought we'd get,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had his own opportunity to begin to repair his image, and
his rich NBA friends could have demonstrated that they can be
bigger than a buck. They all blew it. They stayed home. Their
replacements may not be a hot sell at the gate but for the first
time since before there was a Dream Team, there are men in USA
uniforms for whom we can root.

CLINTON AGREES TO VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton headed off a potential
constitutional crisis Wednesday by agreeing to provide videotaped
testimony to a grand jury investigating whether he had sex with
Monica Lewinsky and tried to cover up the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement worked out between Clinton's lawyer and
independent counsel Kenneth Starr calls for the president to
respond to prosecutors' questions Aug. 17 at the White House with
his attorneys present.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter the president will voluntarily provide his testimony,''
Clinton's private attorney David Kendall told reporters following a
meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Starr withdrew a subpoena issued for
Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement allows Clinton to avoid becoming the first
president to personally appear before a grand jury investigating
criminal allegations against him. It also ends the prospects of a
legal challenge to the withdrawn subpoena, a fight that likely
would have reached the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to the videotaped testimony after Kendall failed
Tuesday to convince U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to
delay the interrogation until September. During a closed-door
session, Starr's deputies reportedly told the judge they were
willing to accommodate most of the president's demands about
testifying, but not a monthlong delay to avoid interrupting the
scheduled Aug. 15 start of Clinton's vacation to Martha's Vineyard
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The session with prosecutors _ scheduled two days before
Clinton's 53rd birthday _ sets up a likely conflict between the
president and the 25-year-old former intern over the nature of
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against the
president, both Clinton and Lewinsky denied under oath ever
engaging in sex. Clinton has publicly made similar comments and has
said he never told anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Wednesday he ``had no
reason to think'' the president would not make the same denials in
his grand jury testimony. Asked whether the president would prefer
to testify before or after Lewinsky, McCurry said: ``You'd have to
ask his attorney that. I don't know,'' Clinton's lawyers did not
return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to provide testimony came a day after
Lewinsky was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
cooperating with Starr's grand jury. In interviews with Starr's
deputies, Lewinsky reportedly said she is prepared to recant her
earlier sworn denial that her relationship with Clinton involved
sex.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting in New York, Lewinsky reportedly provided
prosecutors with details of her sexual encounters with Clinton at
the White House and how they discussed ways to keep their
relationship secret.
</P>
<P>
   Citing sources close to the case, the Washington Post reported
that Lewinsky plans to turn over physical evidence Starr could find
helpful in building his case against Clinton. The material includes
telephone message recordings with the president's voice and a dress
that could be tested for identifying DNA evidence against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   During the session with Starr's deputies, Lewinsky acknowledged
typing the so-called ``talking points'' _ two pages of suggestions
on how to mislead Jones' legal team.
</P>
<P>
   But the former intern provided information about the document's
origins that conflicts with statements by Linda Tripp, whose secret
tape recordings of Lewinsky's phone conversations triggered the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky reportedly is prepared to say the talking points were
compiled from conversations with Tripp, not with the help of anyone
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, a former White House secretary who befriended Lewinsky
when they worked at the Pentagon, denied the claim during brief
remarks on the steps of the U.S. District Courthouse as she ended
eight days of testimony before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allegations to the effect that I contributed to or assisted in
any way with the creation of the talking points are as illogical as
they are patently false,'' Tripp told reporters. ``I have testified
to the fact that I had nothing, let me repeat, nothing to do with
preparing the so-called talking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Starr's deputies were preparing for a series of
briefings with Lewinsky and her attorneys before she goes to the
courthouse _ probably within the next two weeks _ to testify before
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Clinton's Aug. 17 videotape session, Lewinsky's
impending testimony fueled speculation that Starr's investigation
is drawing to a close and a report to Congress _ as required by
federal law _ is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're now in the closing throes of this; at least, I
hope so,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs the
Senate Judiciary Committee. ``Once the president has testified, I
think (Starr) is going to make his recommendations within a short
time after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the
judiciary committee, said ``the time has come'' for Starr to issue
his report and ``wrap this sucker up.''

BILL TUTTLE, OPPONENT OF SMOKELESS TOBACCO, 69
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   (rm) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Tuttle, a former American League outfielder who waged a
campaign against the use of chewing tobacco after developing oral
cancer that left him disfigured, died Monday at a hospice in
Brooklyn Center, Minn. Tuttle, who lived in Anoka, Minn., and who
had been battling cancer since 1993, was 69.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1996, players at major league clubhouses around
the spring training circuit were visited by a man who had been a
center fielder with the Detroit Tigers, the Kansas City Athletics
and the Minnesota Twins in an 11-year career during the 1950s and
1960s. He had been an excellent defensive player, and in 1959 he
hit .300 for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   He had appeared on baseball cards with a wad of tobacco in his
cheek. But now, Bill Tuttle had lost part of his jaw and a cheek as
well as teeth and taste buds in a series of operations for oral
cancer that, he was told, had resulted from chewing tobacco for
almost 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his wife, Gloria, and the former major league
catcher and broadcaster Joe Garagiola, who had joined in his cause,
Tuttle was on a mission in 1996 to warn against the use of
smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   As Gloria Tuttle recalled Wednesday: ``The players felt, `Who's
this?' Then they would see my husband's face and they would just
look. Bill would give his story and you could hear a pin drop. Then
they would hug us. Million-dollar players would come up with tears
in their eyes and cans of tobacco in their hands and they would
say, `I want you to throw this away for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said then that he wanted players to consider the example
they were setting for youngsters, and he asked them at least to
refrain from chewing while they could be caught by television
cameras. ``It's going to be pretty hard to tell someone making $4
million a year not to chew,'' he said. ``So what we're trying to do
is get it off TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Tuttle said yesterday that her husband began to chew when
he was with the Tigers, who had signed him out of Bradley
University. He had asked a teammate, Harvey Kuenn, for tobacco to
keep him occupied while nursing an injury, and soon he was using it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   In his drive against chewing tobacco, Tuttle became involved
with the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, headed by
Garagiola and formed by the organization Oral Health America.
Tuttle spoke at schools as well as before players.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola, who had helped provide financial assistance for
Tuttle through BAT _ the Baseball Assistance Team, which aids
former players _ will deliver a eulogy for Tuttle tonight in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Tuttle is survived by three daughters
from their marriage, Debra Heyer of Andover, Minn; Kimberly Oliver
of Washington, Ill., and Cindy Chase of Rogers, Minn.; four
children from a previous marriage, Robert and James, Patricia
Bradley and Becky Porter, and 17 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The drive against smokeless tobacco has gained momentum since
the day Tuttle walked into those clubhouses, but chewing and
spitting are hardly things of the past. Last spring, 141 major
leaguers volunteered for screening by Dr. John C. Greene, an oral
cancer specialist for the spit-tobacco education program. Greene
found that 83 had at least one tobacco-related oral lesion and
recommended biopsies for 15. He estimated that as many as 300 of
the 750 players in the majors use chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Tuttle said that last Friday, her husband, unable to
speak, had written a note expressing remorse for anguish he had
caused his family, but also offering hope that his campaign would
succeed. It read: ``I know what I did to myself was wrong and I'm
so sorry I hurt everybody. But maybe I can show them how sorry I am
by teaching other people.''

EDITORIAL: PHANTOM OF CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to campaign finance reform, Newt Gingrich is like
the phantom of the opera. He likes to do his dirty work at night.
The House speaker plans to resume debate Thursday night on the
Shays-Meehan bill, with votes on more than a dozen killer
amendments designed by foes of reform to split the bill's
bipartisan support. The House has thus arrived at a critical moment
for the cause of reform. In the last several weeks, Republican
moderates have stood with Democrats to defeat the amendments. If
they do so again, reform legislation can pass the full House next
week.
</P>
<P>
   After promising to finish the bill by the end of the session in
mid-August, Gingrich has repeatedly scheduled and canceled debates
and then held many of them at night. In the last week, the speaker
has also stepped up his pressure on Republicans to support
amendments that would compel Democrats to vote against the
legislation. Two such amendments are most in danger of passing. One
would repeal much of the Voter Registration Act of 1993, the
so-called motor voter law that made it easier to register,
especially for the poor. Another would require congressional
candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their funds from within
their districts, which would also penalize candidates in poor
areas. Republicans who favor reform and who are sympathetic to
these measures should realize that attaching them to the
Shays-Meehan bill would doom its chances in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Rep. Martin
Meehan, D-Mass., the legislation would ban unlimited ``soft money''
donations and curb fund-raising for attack ads broadcast by
independent groups. At least 40 moderate Republicans have worked
with the Democrats in recent weeks to beat back killer amendments
and sustain bipartisan support for Shays-Meehan. They must not flag
in their support now.
</P>
<P>
   Among these independent Republicans are several from the New
York region. They include Michael Forbes, Benjamin Gilman, Amo
Houghton, Sue Kelly, Rick Lazio and James Walsh of New York; Bob
Franks, Rodney Frelinghuysen, Frank LoBiondo, Marge Roukema and Jim
Saxton of New Jersey, and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut. For these
lawmakers, the votes this week are among the most important of
their careers. &QL;

AMID CRUSH OF FAME, PAK TAKES HOOPLA IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ A few months ago, Se Ri Pak never imagined
that she would be overwhelmed with interview requests. Or that
phone calls to her hotel room would have to be screened. Or that
dozens of charitable organizations would want her to make
appearances or donations. Or that her presence at an LPGA
tournament would mean more fans and more news media.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Pakmania, the stir created by Pak, a 20-year-old
South Korean who is the hottest player in golf. Pak will attempt to
win her third major of the year starting Thursday, when the du
Maurier Classic begins at Essex Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Having already won the McDonald's Ladies Professional Golf
Association Championship and the U.S. Women's Open, Pak could
become the first player since Pat Bradley in 1986 to win three
majors in the same year. And Pak, as a rookie on the LPGA Tour,
could also become the first woman since Mickey Wright in 1961 to
win three consecutive majors.
</P>
<P>
   With four victories since May, including last week's Giant Eagle
LPGA Classic, Pak has soared to the top of the tour's money list
($768,211), becoming a star in the process.
</P>
<P>
   How much interest has Pak created for the LPGA? More than 500
credentials have been issued to the news media for this week's
tournament, more than 300 above last year's demand. And 76 of those
applications came from South Korea, where Pak has become the
nation's biggest sports hero.
</P>
<P>
   If Pak wins again this weekend, the focus on her will become
even more intense. But so far, Pak has handled the pressure, the
attention and the growing expectations as easily as she hits a
drive down the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have pressure; I'm happy,'' Pak said during a
pre-tournament interview this week. ``If I didn't play well, who
would care?''
</P>
<P>
   But many people do care about Pak, which is causing problems.
Her agent, Sung Yong Steven Kil, was angry Wednesday that someone
at Pak's hotel had revealed where she was staying, causing her
phone to ring with unwanted calls.
</P>
<P>
   Pak may soon have to start registering under an assumed name.
And while Pak loves to play, Kil and Pak's parents have become more
concerned about her schedule. Every LPGA tournament wants Pak now,
and she will have to learn to pace herself. Pak will be playing in
her sixth consecutive tournament this week, and while she plans to
take next week off, look for her to take longer breaks in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Se Ri to have a long career, like Nancy Lopez,'' Kil
said. ``We don't want her to burn out. We didn't know she would
attract this much attention this quickly. It's not just interviews.
So many charities, over 1,000, have contacted her, asking her for
money. We don't even know who most of them are. When we ask for
more information, they can't do it. You have to be so careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has become a mentor for Pak. The hope is that Pak's
popularity can help the entire tour, the way Lopez's did in 1978,
when as a rookie she won five consecutive tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is putting us on the map,'' said Lorie Kane, who is
seventh on this year's money list. ``Annika Sorenstam and Karrie
Webb got us there, but she is working from that. She is a very
strong young woman and she's a really nice kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hurst won the year's first major, the Nabisco Dinah Shore,
and Colleen Walker is the defending du Maurier champion. But for
the last few months, the spotlight has been on Pak. And her peers
have definitely taken notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tasted being one of the top players, and I'd like to be
one of the feared players again,'' said Laura Davies, who won two
majors in 1996, but who is without a victory on the LPGA Tour this
year. ``When my name goes on the leader board, no one cares
anymore. They might look, but probably figure I'll do something
wrong and fall off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Se Ri, you just count down the holes until she
catches you. It doesn't matter how old you are. If you're good,
you're good.''

FAVORITE OF PARCELLS LIKELY TO MISS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The New York Jets may have suffered a setback
on defense when Casey Dailey, a rookie linebacker from
Northwestern, sustained a foot injury on the last play of Tuesday's
practice that could end his season before it really began.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells said Wednesday that he had planned a heavy
workload for Dailey, a fifth-round draft choice. Parcells said he
had figured Dailey as a pass rusher as well as a special teams
player and had been impressed with the way he quickly picked up
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to do some of the things we did with Carl Banks
and Lawrence Taylor and Andy Headen,'' Parcells said, invoking
names of the New York Giants' great linebacking corps of the 1980s
and early '90s. Parcells said he hoped to use Mo Lewis and Chad
Cascadden, along with Dailey, in some schemes that would confuse
the offense about who would be rushing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurts us,'' said Parcells, who, for the first time this
camp, seemed glum at one of his news conferences. ``The kid was a
pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how after only a week, and with an untested player, he
could have such a high opinion, Parcells said: ``I coached the
position for 20 years. When you see one, you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Following surgery, Dailey is expected to be out at least 12
weeks. But the Jets do not yet know whether they will have to put
him on injured reserve for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Curtis Martin will sit out the entire week to rest
his injured hamstring. Parcells said that he is not concerned about
the injury, which happened last Saturday, and said that Martin
would play if there were a game this week.
</P>
<P>
   Next Question
</P>
<P>
   Do not ask Bill Parcells about individuals yet, he reiterated
following Wednesday's first scrimmage of camp.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he does not want to talk about the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, though, Glenn Foley, who may be tired following
eight days of taking most of the snaps, had little success
Wednesday alternating against first- and second-string defenses. In
three drives, he led the offense to only a field goal by John Hall.
He completed 13 of 23 passes, which gained only 97 yards. He was
intercepted once, and one pass was batted down.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his three drives, Vinny Testaverde led the offense to
points as he completed 15 of 22 passes for 170 yards. He passed for
touchdowns to Alex Van Dyke and Dedric Ward, and also got a field
goal from Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach was voluble about the things that matter to him
most: playing smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't too bad on penalties,'' he said. ``The mechanics of
running the game _ getting in and out at the right time _ worked
pretty well. I'm trying to get them game-ready. I've got to start
get them acting as a team. We've got a game next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' exhibition opener is at Philadelphia on Thursday,
August 6. Last year Parcells established the Jets as a smart,
well-drilled outfit, and he wants them to start out that way
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's scrimmage was marked by the continued improvement of
Marcus Coleman, who is backing up Otis Smith at right cornerback,
and the running and receiving of the backup Robert Farmer. Leon
Johnson, who replaced Martin as the feature back, had the day's
longest run of 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mawae Anchors Line
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line could be at its strongest in years with Kevin
Mawae (pronounced muh-WHY) anchoring center. He is surrounded by
Matt O'Dwyer at right guard and Todd Burger, an off-season pickup
from the Bears, at left guard. Jumbo Elliott is at his accustomed
left tackle spot, while Siupeli Malamala is trying to hold off the
rookie Jason Fabini of Cincinnati at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I'm on a line where there isn't a
rookie among the first five,'' Mawae said. ``It's helped us get off
to a big start.''
</P>
<P>
   Mawae came from Seattle, where a five-year, $17 million
free-agent contract with the Seahawks made him the National
Football League's highest-paid center in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys rag me about being the $17 million man,'' he said.
``They tell me they can't do certain things because they don't make
that kind of money. But the notoriety I got because of the
contract, my teammates have great expectations from me.''

EDITORIAL: CAMBODIA'S IMPERFECT ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   With a campaign marked by noisy rallies and turnout levels
topping 90 percent, Cambodia's parliamentary election on Sunday was
a feast for a people starved for democracy. Yet Cambodians were let
down by their leaders, who manipulated the election, and by an
international community too inclined to approve a flawed process.
</P>
<P>
   Although voting went smoothly, the campaign was monopolized by
Cambodia's strongman, Hun Sen, who forced his way into power after
losing U.N.-organized elections in 1993. Following his violent coup
a year ago, in which he ousted his co-prime minister and rival,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, opposition leaders fled the country. When
Hun Sen let them come back, it was to a campaign so controlled that
Ranariddh's return was not covered on Cambodian television. A U.N.
human rights office in Cambodia has confirmed 21 political murders
in the last two months. Almost all the victims are opposition
activists.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of few, preliminary results indicate that Hun
Sen will again lead a coalition government. But opposition parties
contend that the vote count was distorted by widespread fraud.
Given the problems, it seems premature to call the tabulation
``free and fair,'' the description used by the largest
international observer group, representing mostly European and
Asian nations. American observers were more nuanced, but still
minimized the unfairness of a skewed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition allegations must be investigated before the
results can be accepted. Many Cambodians fear that political
killings might increase, as they did after the 1993 elections.
Worrisome delays in releasing results could indicate that more
manipulation is afoot. The election is over, but Cambodia's
democratic process still requires international scrutiny and
pressure on Hun Sen. &QL;

CHINESE WOMEN `THE BIGGEST QUESTION MARK IN SWIMMING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ When Goodwill Games swimming began Tuesday
night with the American women routing China, the American men's
team sat together in the stands, cheering wildly. Wednesday night,
when men's swimming began wih the United States facing Germany, the
American women led the boisterous crowd in supporting their male
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The American men, like the women, are favored to win their
round-robin of dual meets. The only surprise in the American
women's 88-34 victory over China was how one-sided it was. The
Americans won 11 of the 14 events, some by huge margins for this
level of competition. There are reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, embarrassed by too many cases of their swimmers
testing positive for illegal bodybuilding drugs, are trying to
avoid more drug problems. Their 17 female swimmers here include
only one who swam in January's world championships, only two who
swam in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The oldest is only 21. The
oldest Americans are Lea Loveless Maurer, 26, and Jenny Thompson,
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the Chinese have better swimmers at home that
are clean,'' said John Collins, head coach of the Badger Swim Club
in Larchmont, N.Y., and an assistant coach of the American women's
team here. ``They have demonstrated the importance to them of the
Olympic Games and world championships, and they are not concerned
about other international meets. I think they are thinking about
the 2000 Olympics, and they brought this team to get some
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that when some American coaches learned the Chinese
women would swim here, they objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked why we should give China that credibility when some
countries want to throw China out of the international
federation,'' he said. ``But it is the Goodwill Games, and we are
trying to show good will.''
</P>
<P>
   While this may not be the best team China could present, it
isn't the best for the Americans either. Amy Van Dyken, who won
four gold medals in the 1996 Olympics, is recovering from shoulder
surgery and watched nervously from the stands. Kristine Quance is
pregnant. The world champions Brooke Bennett and Kristy Kowal
passed up this meet to continue training for the U.S. championships
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their victory, the American women were puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what to expect from the Chinese,'' said
Thompson, who won the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyles against the
Chinese and anchored a winning relay. ``They ebb and flow from meet
to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Maurer, who won the 100-meter backstroke and led off the
winning medley relay, said: ``They are the biggest question mark in
swimming. They're the most unpredictable team I've ever swum
against.''
</P>
<P>
   SPLASHES
</P>
<P>
   In the first dual meet Tuesday night, Penny Heyns, a South
African breast-stroker, led the World All-Stars to a 64-58 victory
over Germany. Wednesday night's second men's meet sent Russia
against the World All-Stars. The women return Thursday night with
the United States against the World All-Stars and China against
Germany.

   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ The young woman here rapped on the car
window and waved a stack of Powerball tickets at the driver.
``Notas de Connecticut?'' (``Connecticut notes?'') she offered in
Spanish, before moving on to the next potential customer.
</P>
<P>
   She was not the only person in New Jersey trying to capitalize
on the ballooning Powerball jackpot, according to the state's
Lottery Commission. By Wednesday afternoon, it had suspended the
licenses of six authorized lottery agents for selling Powerball
tickets bought out of state, said Holly A. Lehr, a commission
spokeswoman. ``Some of them were actually advertising outside of
the store, and there were complaints,'' she said. ``Some were
charging double the price.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give the names or locations of the suspended
agents or six other agents who were under investigation She said
they faced fines or loss of their license to sell lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey lottery games _ Pick 3, 4 and 6, Cash 5, Lotzee and
Instant Game tickets _ are sold by 6,000 licensed lottery agents
throughout the state, including grocery and convenience stores,
delis and liquor stores, Lehr said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, the manager of an A&AMP;P grocery store in New
Jersey was arrested in Manhattan Tuesday for scalping Powerball
tickets, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, Robert Maher, 31, was soliciting passers-by to buy
$5 worth of Powerball entries for $10, said Detective Joseph
Pentangelo, a Police Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Maher was arrested near Rockefeller Center about 2 p.m. with 144
tickets in his pocket. He was charged with promoting gambling, a
misdemeanor.

U.S. starts 
tourney 
with win
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ For their first dip into the FIBA World
Championship of Basketball, the U.S. squad did a lousy
impersonation of its ``Dream Team'' predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   About the only resemblance they had was if you looked at the
final score _ which is exactly the way coach Rudy Tomjanovich
wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   A Dream Team this is not. It has no NBA stars, who would have
spent more time scribbling autographs than worrying about the
competition at this tournament. No 20-point scorers every night.
Maybe not on any night. No endorsement contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But what these Americans do have is a unity and a bulldog
attitude that was a rousing success in their opening game. The U.S.
survived a slow start (hey, it's OK to be nervous when you're
replacing a Dream Team), then rolled to an 83-59 victory over
Brazil on Wednesday at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Michael Hawkins, who so far is the closest thing the
Americans have to a go-to guy, had 12 points, 10 assists and seven
rebounds. The 10 assists were the most in USA Basketball history
during a World Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no one-man show. Nothing with this team will be.
Only three players reached double figures, led by Wendell Alexis'
13 points.
</P>
<P>
   But it was players like Duke's Trajan Langdon, who wasn't even
on the squad five days ago, coming off the bench to knock in a pair
of 3-pointers just before halftime for some valuable breathing room
during a close opening 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ashraf Amaya (3-for-3) and Brad Miller (4-for-4) coming
off the bench with strong showings. It was a team defense that wore
down the Brazilians, who figure to be middle-of-the-pack pretenders
in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this was just a team. A good, cohesive team. The Dream
part will have to come later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win as a team,'' said Tomjanovich, without question
the perfect coach for this team of unstars. ``We don't have the big
superstar, a dominating player. We don't have a guy we can go to
every night and say he's going to get the job done. We have to do
it as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Test No. 1 was passed with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we don't have any dominant players,'' said Alexis.
``Every night, it's going to have to be somebody different.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, when the Americans play the more potent Lithuanians, it
will have to be everybody playing differently. And better. The
Americans were a cohesive unit, true. But they did not play
particularly well against a Brazilian team they were expected to
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   In the first moments, Jason Sasser squirted up a couple of shots
that even a Greek god couldn't have helped find the basket. David
Wood missed three shots in 30 seconds, and the U.S. was in a 6-1
hole after four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The game remained close throughout the first half. But with
Brazil up 27-24, Hawkins hit a pair of free throws and then Jimmy
King tapped in a miss. Langdon then fired up the first of his
3-pointers, and Miller, who still hasn't missed a shot for the U.S.
in exhibitions or on Wednesday, scored on a layup.
</P>
<P>
   That 9-0 blitz was the foundation of a 16-5 run to close out the
half, which ended with Langdon's second trey.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians never threatened in the second half as the U.S.
wore them down and steadily pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Trajan to come in here and hit those 3s was a big boost
for us,'' Alexis said.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who was cut from the team a week earlier,
returned from Europe to the U.S., then was recalled after Mateen
Cleaves' ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good feeling to get a chance to come in and help,''
Langdon said. ``I kept telling myself I was going to be on the
bench for a while. But when I got in there, if I got my looks, I
wanted to take them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear the beginning of their first game in the World
Championship was a little overwhelming to this team.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable the players would feel some pressure to live
up to Dream Team standards, even though they don't have the
credentials to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us awhile to get rid of the jitters,'' said Hawkins,
who ran the team smartly. ``We definitely were anxious. But our
bench did a heck of a job. And our defense got our offense going,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Alexis: ``It definitely wasn't the same feeling as in the
exhibitions. This was a little more nervous, like we were on the
start of a long trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he wasn't alarmed when his team started the
game cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing good basketball; we just weren't getting the
ball in the basket,'' he said. ``But our guys didn't panic. We
stuck with the defensive intensity, and that was the key to the
game, really, holding them under 60 points offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think we saw tonight is that we're a team that is 12
deep. Depth is one of our strengths. To me, our starting lineup is
good. But they're just the guys who start the game. I also rely on
the other guys who don't start. The bench was big.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've been talking about all along, to compete on
every possession. That's the only way we're going to be able to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the U.S. starters combined for only 31 of the
team's 83 points.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the starters don't expect to play that poorly
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent win, a great win,'' said Wood. ``I'm amazed
at how much better we can get. As a team, we really made some
mistakes in this game that I know we won't be making in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's four or five teams that could beat us. But if we
really lock in for 40 minutes, it's going to be hard for anybody to
beat us.''

THE KNICKS' DEPARTING ENFORCER SPEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the end, after he spent a decade plunging into
peril for the Knicks and absorbing blows like an air bag for their
superstar, no one protected Charles Oakley. Patrick Ewing did not
return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing did not dive in front of the Knicks' president, Ernie
Grunfeld, to keep the team from trading Oakley to Toronto for
Marcus Camby. But as Oakley sat in a Manhattan restaurant
Wednesday, just a coin flip from Madison Square Garden, he did not
lay an elbow into Ewing for allowing his exile. Oakley spilled the
blame in Grunfeld's lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about New York fans, you can't fake them,'' said
Oakley, who was relaxed and in good spirits as he talked with
reporters in New York just over a month after the draft-day trade.
``Ernie knows what he did. And fans know what he did. He might have
come out and said, `Well, we need to get younger.' But you traded
three young guys just two years ago. I don't want to hear it. Just
be a man about what you've done. Don't say you're getting younger.
You got one young body, and a dozen old ones. How young are you
going to get?''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley is 34 and Camby is 24, so the math is obvious. Next year,
Oakley will be a free agent, as will Camby. And because of Camby's
athletic youth, he has been viewed as the best deal for the future
of the Knicks. ``They probably didn't want to re-sign me at the end
of next year,'' Oakley said. ``And they probably want to re-sign
Marcus. I don't know, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a part of Oakley that doubts the team's immediate
future _ the one that stretches as long as the three years left on
Ewing's contract _ will lead to a title without his bouncer-like
presence beneath the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long I'll be in Toronto, but for the Knicks,
I don't see them winning a ring anytime soon,'' Oakley said. ``So
it's a dog race to get the ring. Now they don't have a guy who can
do the work, the hard and dirty work. They got a lot of guys on
that team to please. A lot of guys need shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley never needed to be a go-to man. Although he pushed for a
less Ewing-oriented offense if it meant more shots for Allan
Houston and Larry Johnson, Oakley was content with his occasional
18-foot jumper and with toiling away in obscurity for his 10 years
next to Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not knocking Patrick, because he's a franchise player no
matter who comes here,'' Oakley said. ``But Allan and Larry will be
the young bodies to get over the hump to win the championship. They
have to get their shots for the Knicks to go to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   But with that said, Oakley has always known that the ultimate
asset was Ewing. In all their time together, the two never grew
close. Oakley still has not returned a message that Ewing left for
him weeks ago. But there was a certain businesslike respect for
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with Patrick for 10 years, and it wasn't easy playing
beside him because he was the main guy,'' Oakley said. ``Night in
and night out I just tried to make his job easier, as far as the
dirty work. I understood that this was his team. I was willing to
make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby will arrive billed as the answer to the Indiana Pacers'
athletic duo of Antonio Davis and Dale Davis; they both burned the
Knicks with their shot- blocking and second-chance points in the
playoffs last spring. But Camby will also have to accept his
inferior place in the scoring hierarchy. ``He's a young
superstar,'' Oakley said. ``I don't know if he can take it. He'll
have to get used to it because there ain't no shots, I'm telling
him now, unless he's got a hoop in his back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby will have to find his niche with the Knicks, just as
Oakley did. But nothing the spindly Camby can offer physically will
fill the role of enforcer that Oakley played so well. Just how soft
the Knicks will be in Oakley's absence can be measured in December,
when the Raptors play the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   While Oakley is looking forward to facing his old team, in many
ways he will always be a Knick. If one day the Knicks honor him for
the decade of service, Oakley will be happy to answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they call me,'' Oakley said with a smile, ``I hope it
ain't Ernie.''

TALKS ON RANDY JOHNSON DRAG ON

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The New York Yankees continue to talk to the
Seattle Mariners about Randy Johnson as Friday's midnight trade
deadline draws near, but their bid may ultimately hinge on whether
Johnson agrees to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   According to one executive with knowledge of the discussions,
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has made it apparent that the
value of his offer will depend greatly on whether Johnson can agree
to an extension. Seattle wants a three-player package in return for
Johnson, and the Yankees being discussed include Ramiro Mendoza and
Mike Lowell, a minor-league infielder, and possibly Hideki Irabu
and second baseman Homer Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the executive, Cashman is leery of dealing a
substantial package for Johnson and then seeing Johnson depart as a
free agent after this season. For example, Cashman might be willing
to part with Mendoza and Lowell if he knew Johnson would accept a
three-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The only real incentive for Johnson to agree to an extension and
forgo free agency, however, would be if the Yankees gave him an
overwhelming offer _ and at a time when the Yankees are debating
whether to give a big contract to Bernie Williams, that seems
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Officials around baseball think the Yankees' primary competition
for Johnson will be the Cleveland Indians.

COMMENTARY: LET'S ABOLISH PARTISANSHIP, PARTISANS CRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wednesday night in Brooklyn, at the most recent
meeting of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Charter Revision Commission, it
was even harder than usual to distinguish the chutzpah from the
humbug.
</P>
<P>
   Under discussion was a proposal that, by the standards of New
York City politics, would, if taken seriously, surely rank as
revolutionary. Under the proposal, party primaries would be
eliminated for citywide offices. Instead, there would be one,
anyone-can-join primary, followed by a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   If placed on the ballot and endorsed by the voters in November,
the proposal would overnight turn New York City from a Democratic
town into a nonpartisan one.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the proposal was described as a cure for just
about everything that ails city politics, from low voter turnout to
a lack of robust debate. Thomas Ognibene, City Council Republican
minority leader, went so far as to suggest that nonpartisan
elections would eliminate the need for term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the commission see enough promise in the proposal
that they have hired an eminent political science professor to
analyze its implications in depth. They seemed heartened by his
conclusion that it would not violate the Federal Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   What they did not pause to discuss _ at least not in public _
were the immediate political consequences of offering up such a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   With time running out, the Charter Revision Commission is still
desperately seeking something, anything, that looks enough like an
idea to stick on the ballot in November. Already, the commission
has boldly taken up, only to drop, such ambitious ``reforms'' as
eviscerating the city's land-use review process, eliminating the
job of its second-highest elected official and abolishing the
Independent Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the commission dropped these proposals was,
according to Chairman Peter Powers, that they were too far-reaching
and controversial to pursue in the remaining weeks before ballot
proposals are due in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Which only makes one wonder what the commission members were
thinking in Brooklyn as they earnestly considered the merits of
nonpartisan elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the best of circumstances, the idea is not the sort
that Democrats, with a registration advantage in the city of nearly
5 to 1, would happily embrace. Yet these are, let's just say, not
the best of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being above politics, this Charter Revision Commission
is surely one of the most blatantly political creatures in New York
history. It was conceived for no other reason than that the
Republican mayor was peeved at the idea that the Democratic speaker
of the City Council, Peter Vallone, might use a referendum on a
ball park to make political hay at his expense. The commission is
stuffed with former members of Giuliani's administration who, if
they are not actually registered Republicans, all clearly feel
bound by loyalty _ or fear _ to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   For such a baldfacedly partisan body to suggest that the problem
in New York politics is its excessively partisan character is
madness or daring or, perhaps, the ultimate inside joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we have nonpartisan elections?'' asked former Mayor
Edward Koch, a critic of the commission since its creation.
``Simply so as to make it easier for Republicans to disguise
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they ashamed of their philosophy?'' he added.
``Apparently. That's why we only elect one once every 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for the commission, at this point it seems some sort of
joke at its own expense has become all but unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the one hand, the commission musters the courage to
forward to voters a proposal of real consequence, it will only
focus attention back on itself and its own highly dubious
legitimacy. What would be more preposterous than asking city voters
to decide a major constitutional question all because their mayor
did not want them to vote on the location of a baseball stadium?
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, the commission balks and settles for
something bland and inoffensive, then it will just be advertising
its own superfluousness. Who needs a Charter Commission to propose
a campaign reform package less bold than the one already offered by
the City Council?
</P>
<P>
   Chutzpah or humbug? It's not a pretty choice.

SARATOGA STARTS WITH SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ From the steeplechasers who opened
Saratoga's season Wednesday afternoon, to the 2-year-old fillies
seeking stakes status in the Grade II Schuylerville, the depth of
Wednesday's card served as a reminder of why Saratoga is racing's
best known and most prestigious meet.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd of 25,570, a record for a July opener, was treated
to an upset in the $100,000 Schuylerville as Jorge Chavez guided
the 17-1 shot Call Me Up to a narrow victory over the favored
Brittons Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After setting a track record at Aqueduct in her first start,
Call Me Up was beaten by 8{ lengths as the favorite in the Astoria
at Belmont. Wednesday she battled Fantasy Lake for five and a half
furlongs, edging clear in the final yards and holding off the late
surge from Brittons Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the stretch I knew there was a horse coming at me, but my
main concern was to stay straight and finish in front,'' Chavez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Call Me Up covered the six furlongs in 1:12 4/5 and returned $36
for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   _ Wagering at New York City Off-Track Betting was down $230,000
Wednesday compared with last year's Saratoga opening day, in the
wake of the decision by the New York Racing Association to withhold
it simulcast television signal from home cable viewers in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   _ The undefeated Mossflower, winner of the Hempstead Handicap at
Belmont by 12 lengths, will miss Sunday's $250,000 Go for Wand
because of a wrenched ankle. The trainer RICK SCHOSBERG detected a
slight filling in her right front ankle after a workout Tuesday,
but he said that X-rays were negative and that the 4-year-old filly
should return to the track in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ D. WAYNE LUKAS, who saddles the favored Time Bandit in
Thursday's $100,000 Sanford, will be challenged by his former
assistants DALLAS STEWART (Color of Smoke), TODD PLETCHER (Texas
Glitter) and MARK HENNIG (King's Crown) in the six-furlong race for
2-year-old colts. . . . Yagli, trained by BILL MOTT, is the
favorite in a field of 12 for Friday's $125,000 Bernard Baruch on
the turf.

AN OFFICE'S `ATMOSPHERE' GOES ON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Only two former assistant attorneys general are
named in a sexual harassment case brought by one of their
colleagues that is working its way slowly through a state court
here. But, in a sense, an entire division of the attorney general's
office has ended up on trial.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Barbara Davis, now 40, and other witnesses
have painted a picture of the Criminal Justice Division, where she
worked from 1989 to 1993, as a place of blatant sexual banter and
touching, of male superiors openly conducting sexual affairs with
subordinate women, and of a place where a woman's physical
attributes were fair game for public comment even after death, in
gruesome crime scene photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the public should know what was going on behind
the closed doors of that department _ what it was like,'' Davis
said in an interview between court sessions recently. ``Women were
just treated like they were nothing, and it was just devastating to
be there. Just the fact of having seven or eight witnesses come
forward to testify about what was going on has restored my faith a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has accused Richard T. Carley, the former deputy director
of the Division of Criminal Justice, of repeatedly touching and
propositioning her while she worked as an assistant attorney
general in the division. She has also accused the state and her
immediate supervisor, Gregory Sakowicz, of ignoring her complaints
about Carley. She said she had become unemployable as a result of
the harassment and the civil lawsuit, which went to trial five
weeks ago, and is asking for a life's salary as well as unspecified
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The state maintains that Davis failed to notify the right
authorities, and says it acted swiftly to punish Carley once she
filed her suit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Law and Public Safety, which is
led by the state attorney general, would not comment on the record
about Davis' allegation, noting that the trial, whose outcome will
turn in part on the atmosphere within the Criminal Justice
Division, was still in progress. But one official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that the department, which works
closely with the police in investigating and prosecuting prominent
crimes, had a reputation as a ``macho'' outfit in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had 150 lawyers in there, many of whom were ex-cops, and
they were working with police investigators and, yes, it had a
reputation for having a precinct-house atmosphere in those days,''
the official said. ``But it has changed since then,'' the official
added, because of the trial, and because of tightened sexual
harassment laws.
</P>
<P>
   Office atmosphere is a major element in proving sexual
harassment under New Jersey law, said Alan Hyde, a law professor at
Rutgers Law School in Newark who teaches a courses on labor and
employment law, because it can have the effect of discriminating
against women by creating an unbearable working environment for
them. Stressing that he had not followed the Davis case, Hyde said
that the heavily male atmosphere of police work could have the
illegal effect of telling women that they could not be on an equal
footing with men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sets up the classic sexual harassment case, which comes
from the male defense of a previously male preserve,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde later added: ``You can't hang a sign on the door that says,
`Men Only' in words, but this case seems to say they hung the sign
not with words but with deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Davis and several supporting witnesses described such
an atmosphere. If a crime under investigation was a sex crime
against women, Davis said, Carley would ask for photographs of the
victim and comment on her body. Sakowicz had a gag statue in his
office resembling a penis, a police investigator testifying for
Davis said. Carley, Davis said, displayed pictures of bathing
beauties in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses testified in support of Davis that Carley was
often uncomfortably familiar with women in his department. He began
a meeting with Carol Stanton Meier, a deputy attorney general, by
telling her that she had ``a nice body,'' Meier testified. Another
witness said Carley had dangled the keys for a sports car in front
of her and said, ``If I give you a ride in my Porsche, will you do
me?''
</P>
<P>
   But although the women confirmed stories about Carley's
occasionally lurid language and comments and about the atmosphere
of male swagger in the Criminal Justice Division in the early
1990s, none directly confirmed witnessing the acts that brought
Carley before Judge Maria Marinari Sypek and a jury of five men and
five women.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has accused Carley of touching her breasts, of stuffing
money in her brassiere, of caressing her from behind and of
suggesting that they have an affair. Carley admitted in court that
he was conducting an affair with a division subordinate at the
time, even though he was married. He has since divorced.
</P>
<P>
   But Carley denied that he had touched Davis or requested sex
with her. A state investigator who looked into Davis' charges in
1994 testified that Carley admitted saying things like, ``nice
boobs,'' or ``nice butt,'' but that he had said that the comments
had not been aimed at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis maintains that she complained about Carley to
Sakowicz, her direct supervisor, and that Sakowicz did nothing.
Sakowicz denied that Davis came to him, and the state argues that
in any case, Davis failed to take her complaint to any of several
offices established to enforce non-discrimination law for state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The state asserts that Davis concocted her charges and the
lawsuit after she was passed over for a promotion. Her inability to
find work as a lawyer since leaving state employment in 1994 is not
due to the shock of what happened or the burden of the trial, as
Davis contends, but to her own malingering and use of painkillers
and alcohol, the state maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Once Davis filed her suit in 1994, the state did investigate her
complaints and demoted Carley in rank and in pay, moving him to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Division, where he has no supervisory
authority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sanctions against Carley do not amount to an admission of
guilt by the state, said Cynthia Jacob, the lawyer defending the
state and Sakowicz. Carley may be liable for further punishment,
depending on how the trial comes out.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob maintains that the department's written policy on sexual
harassment gave Davis several places to turn for help, including
the department's Division on Civil Rights, the state's Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission, and the equal employment
opportunities office in the Department of Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we took prompt remedial action,''
Jacob said during a pause in the trial. ``We did everything
employers are required to do under the law when faced with a sexual
harassment complaint.''

BAD DEBT HELD BY JAPAN'S BANKS NOW ESTIMATED NEAR $1 TRILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for 400-word 2ndtake. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American officials and private financial experts
evaluating the depths of Japan's banking crisis have concluded that
it is far worse than Tokyo has publicly acknowledged, with bad
debts approaching $1 trillion, or nearly twice the official
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   American officials and outside experts caution that their
estimates are extremely rough, in part because Japanese banks have
been using accounting tricks to hide those debts that are not being
repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figures greatly complicate the challenge facing Keizo
Obuchi, the man set to become Japan's new prime minister on
Thursday, these officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has little experience in the financial sphere and has
offered only the vaguest of plans about how he will deal with what
appears to be the largest banking crisis in history.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, he persuaded an elder statesman, former
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, to become finance minister _
placing the 78-year-old politician, a fixture in American-Japanese
relations for four decades, at the center of the financial storm.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimates suggest that bailing out the Japanese banks,
which include some of the world's largest, could cost Japanese
taxpayers far more than the $214 billion that Tokyo has set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The government has declared plans to establish a ``bridge bank''
that would assume bad assets from the commercial banks and sell
them off, presumably for a fraction of their value; the weak
lenders would be closed or merged. The cost to taxpayers, some
officials believe, will need to double.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Wall Street have long assumed
that the Japanese were understating the problems they face.
Officially Japan has said that its banks currently hold around $550
billion in bad debt, although in recent weeks that figure has crept
up to closer to $700 billion, Japanese officials said. The far
greater scale of the problem, and cost of fixing it, could make it
harder for the new Japanese government to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Japan's bad debts may well be the most important
statistic in the Asian financial crisis. Since the crisis struck,
Japanese banks have become so beleaguered that their lending at
home and elsewhere in Asia has all but halted, and they are closing
many of their offices throughout the region. This has contributed
to a scarcity of credit that has worsened the recession _ in some
places the depression _ that stretches from South Korea to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned for several reasons: exports to
Japan have plummeted, and the Japanese banking crisis is hampering
the effort to rescue other Asian nations which are heavily
dependent on trade, investment and borrowing from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they have not conducted any formal study
of Japan's banking troubles, and they almost never discuss it in
public, for fear of scaring even more investors away from the
Japanese markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the overall debt figure is both unknowable and
less important than the cost of closing or merging some of Japan's
largest banks. Because even bad loans have some value, most experts
say that the cost of cleaning up the books will probably be only 60
percent to 70 percent of the bad loan portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 trillion figure is being floated around during meetings
at the White House, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and
appears based on new estimates from Japan, unofficial estimates
from investment bankers on both sides of the Pacific and anecdotal
evidence of how Japanese banks have been performing sleight-of-hand
to avoid a true accounting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some banks are reported to be quietly lending even
more money to apparently insolvent companies that have been
long-time customers. The companies, in turn, are using the new
loans to pay back interest on overdue loans that would otherwise be
in default. As a result, the banks are able to report to
authorities that their loans are being repaid _ even though the new
loans they are providing only deepen the the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are hard to pin down because the banks go to such
lengths to hide the bad news,'' said Richard Medley, managing
partner of Medley Global Advisors, a private research firm in New
York that often consults with top American officials about the
Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But referring to the savings and loan crisis in the United
States of a decade ago, he said, ``if you add up what the Japanese
have admitted, and look at the usual margin of error in the
American S&AMP;L crisis and similar crises, you get to a trillion very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official, who declined to be
identified, said, ``What's become clear is that Japan is going to
need to spend tens of billions more in public money to get out of
this mess, and they are going to have to take some banks out of
their misery.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the cost of resolving the bad debts generated in
the American savings and loan crisis of a decade ago were roughly
$160 billion, in an economy that in 1990 had a gross national
product of $5.74 trillion. The cost amounted to about 2.7 percent
of the economy's annual production.
</P>
<P>
   If Japanese taxpayers spend upwards of $500 billion to rescue
their banks _ and that may prove to be conservative _ it will
exceed 12 percent of the country's GNP.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only part of the problem. Most experts believe that
losses in the life insurance industry could amount to another
several hundred billion dollars. Like the banks, the insurance
industry relied on a property market that turned out to be wildly
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that if you are spending so much to clean up
your banking system, it takes a real whack at the economy,'' said
Bert Ely, a financial consultant who was deeply involved in
evaluating the American savings and loan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is hardly the only country in Asia mired in bad debt. In
Indonesia, most domestic companies have simply stopped repaying
loans, and the banks are working out details of a delay in paying
back overseas lenders. Many of those lenders are Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   And American officials are increasingly focusing on banking
troubles in China. Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday that it
had placed its ratings of nine Chinese banks on review, to
determine if it should downgrade its assessment of their credit
worthiness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the commercial Chinese banks under review are four of the
largest state-owned institutions: the Agricultural Bank of China,
the Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse in China could slow the nation's already-stumbling
economy. And a slowdown would worsen unemployment and threaten many
of the economic reforms that President Clinton celebrated on his
trip to China a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Japan's ability to deal with its huge banks that most
worries American officials. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin sounded
that note anew Wednesday in an interview on CBS, urging the new
Japanese government to move quickly on a range of problems,
including stimulating the economy and rapidly deregulating
long-protected corners of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how big the problem is because Japan's
audits of its banks have been almost comically insufficient.
American officials frequently note that Japan has about 400 bank
inspectors; the United States has about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   What the markets are watching now is how Obuchi, and the
newly-appointed Miyazawa, go about the painful process of dealing
with the banks _ which may, in the short term, result in more
corporate bankruptcies and higher unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative steps taken so far have failed. Japan closed one
insolvent major bank, in the northern island of Hokkaido, late last
year. The local economy immediately fell deeper into recession, and
Japanese officials argued in a recent visit to Washington that the
experience showed that closing banks could do more damage than
merging them or attempting to keep some open.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is rising concern that the government's
reluctant decision to use taxpayer money to bail out the banks is
going astray. Some of the first money was used to keep insolvent
banks afloat, simply prolonging their bad-loan problems.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bankers say that other banks decided not to sell off
bad loans because they thought they would get a better deal selling
them to the government than selling them on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this did was make the problem worse,'' one senior Japanese
banker said on a recent visit to the United States. &QL;

CASINO OPERATORS PLAN TO START LAS VEGAS AIRLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Nev., N.Y., Mass., Ga., Conn., Ind., Ariz.)  (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Aiming to ensure that a steady stream of visitors will fill the
rising number of hotel rooms scheduled to open in Las Vegas in the
next few years, two casino companies are helping finance a new
airline that is expected to be announced Thursday, several
executives and investors familiar with the plans said.
</P>
<P>
   The new carrier will fly primarily to cities on the East Coast
using single-aisle Boeing 757 jets and will be called National
Airlines, reviving a name that effectively disappeared in 1980,
when the old National Airlines merged with Pan American World
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The new National is the brainchild of Michael Conway, one of the
founders of American West Airlines, who was ousted as its chief
executive in 1994 as the airline was struggling to emerge from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The resort companies Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and Rio Hotel
and Casino Inc. have put up $30 million of the initial $50 million
investment in the airline, according to two people involved in the
new carrier. Both Harrah's and Rio declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Several million more has been invested by Wexford Capital
Management, an investment firm based Greenwich, Conn., that is run
by Chuck Davidson, who previously worked with Michael Steinhardt,
the successful hedge-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Conway declined comment, but several executives who requested
anonymity and two Las Vegas officials confirmed the plans, which
Conway has long been forming.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference to announce the airline was scheduled for
Thursday morning at McCarran International Airport, the city's main
gateway. But last-minute details, including securing the rights to
the name National Airlines, which was famous in the 1970s for its
suggestive ``Fly Me'' ads, were still being ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in negotiations, and we are close to reaching an
agreement,'' said Jeff Kriendler, spokesman for Pan Am Liquidating
Corp., which holds the rights to National.
</P>
<P>
   Many casino owners are nervous because the number of new Las
Vegas hotel rooms is expected to rise 20 percent by the year 2000,
while the number of airline seats for visitors to the city has been
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Several carriers, including Southwest Airlines and America West
serve Las Vegas, but it is the only major city in the country that
no major carrier uses as a hub. The reason, airline analysts say,
is that mostly tourists, not higher-paying business travelers visit
Las Vegas, giving it the lowest per passenger revenues of any major
city.
</P>
<P>
   Airline traffic is at a high, and Samuel Buttrick, an analyst
with Paine Webber in New York, said, ``In the last year or so, we
have seen major carriers cut back Las Vegas service as they
reallocate limited supply to more profitable markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with his plans say that Conway plans to fly to
New York, Boston, Atlanta and other cities on the East Coast that
have spotty service to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The airline will start with four 200-seat 757s, a plane that is
relatively inexpensive to operate on medium- and long-range
flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is designing an airline that takes into account the
unusual characteristics of the market,'' said Davidson, who also
controls Chautauqua Airlines Inc., a regional carrier based in
Indianapolis. His investment gives Wexford the right to form an
exclusive regional express carrier for the new airline.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts were skeptical of the new carrier's chances
given the large number of inexpensive charter flights that bring
gamblers into Las Vegas. ``I don't think anybody has ever made any
money in Las Vegas from an airline point of view,'' said one
analyst who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The new airline cannot begin flying until it receives approval
from federal regulators, a process that will take a minimum of six
months and probably longer. With the delay comes a risk that by the
time the new carrier gets off the ground, the red-hot airline
industry may be cooling.
</P>
<P>
   For Conway, the new airline is a chance to rehabilitate his
reputation and show up Phoenix-based America West, which he founded
with others in 1981. The airline expanded too quickly in the late
1980s and was forced into bankruptcy in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Conway was discharged after clashing with
Chairman William Francke, who was brought in to turn around the
airline. While some people at America West remained loyal to the
Conway, others blamed him for the airline's troubles. &QL;

TOUGH-TALKING ACTRESS BINNIE BARNES DIES AT 95 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (jw) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Binnie Barnes, an English actress who was lured to Hollywood
after her role as Catherine Howard in ``The Private Life of Henry
VIII,'' a 1933 film starring Charles Laughton, died Monday at her
home in Beverly Hills. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as a milkmaid at 15, the auburn-haired beauty, who
was born in London, flitted through a series of jobs _ nurse,
chorus girl, dance hostess _ before becoming a partner of Tex
McLeod, a rope-spinning vaudeville entertainer of the Will Rogers
school, eventually assuming the name ``Texas Binnie Barnes,''
though she had never met an American cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, she made her stage debut in ``Silver Tassie,'' which
featured Laughton. After a year of dramatic training, she made her
film debut in the 1931 English movie ``Night in Montmartre,''
starring Heather Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a series of 26 Stanley Lupino comedy shorts, she
played vampish character roles. Producer Alexander Korda then
signed her to a contract to appear in his films, including ``The
Private Life of Henry VIII'' and ``The Private Life of Don Juan,''
opposite Douglas Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing her in ``Henry VIII,'' Carl Laemmle Jr., son of the
founder of Universal Studios, brought Miss Barnes to Hollywood in
1934 to star opposite Frank Morgan in ``There's Always Tomorrow.''
More than 75 movies followed, including ``Diamond Jim'' with Edward
Arnold, ``The Adventures of Marco Polo'' with Gary Cooper and ``The
Three Musketeers'' with Don Ameche, in which she typically played a
tart-tongued ``man's woman'' _ an image she often maintained in
public in her earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no Sarah Bernhardt,'' she once said. ``One picture is just
like another to me,'' as long as ``I don't have to be a sweet
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she married Mike Frankovich, a Columbia studio
executive and former football star at the University of California
at Los Angeles. He died in 1992. At the end of World War II they
moved to Italy, where she made several films, including ``Fugitive
Lady'' with Janis Paige and Eduardo Cianelli.
</P>
<P>
   She resurrected her career in the 1960s for a role on ``The
Donna Reed Show.'' She appeared in ``The Trouble With Angels,''
starring Rosalind Russell, in 1966 and in the sequel two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Miss Barnes appeared in her last film, ``40 Carats,''
with Liv Ullmann and Gene Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two sons, a daughter and seven grandchildren.

`THE CIDER HOUSE RULES': IRVING NOVEL BECOMES A PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(rm) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forceps, curette, speculum: The use of tools for
both obstetrics and abortions is described in unblinking detail in
``The Cider House Rules,'' the earnest and whimsical stage
adaptation, now at the Mark Taper Forum, of John Irving's earnest
and whimsical novel from 1985. To perform a resurrection, however,
it takes nothing less (or more) than a typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   This heartening use of the machine occurs somewhere in the
fourth of the six hours in this recounting of Irving's sprawling
and eminently topical story of abortion, sex and the American
family, which is centered on the virtuous and eccentric head of an
orphanage, Dr. Wilbur Larch. In the scene, Wilbur (played by
Michael Winters) has decided, for purposes of plot too Byzantine to
explain, to write a series of letters to invent an epistolary,
grown-up identity for a sickly orphan named Fuzzy Stone (Tom Beyer)
who died as a child years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner does the doctor begin tapping on his typewriter
(invisible, since most props in the production are pantomimed) than
Fuzzy materializes. At first, he is as feeble as he was in life,
but he draws strength from the new words that Wilbur has invented
for him. Suddenly, he's a vital, straight-backed creature of fire
and eloquence, not to mention a nifty tap dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tap dancer? Yes, the rhythms of the doctor's typewriter have
found their way into Fuzzy's feet. The word has not only been made
flesh; it dances like a Busby Berkeley boy.
</P>
<P>
   This delightful convergence of literature and show business
embodies what's best in ``Cider House,'' which was conceived by Tom
Hulce and Jane Jones, who have also directed Peter Parnell's
adaptation of Irving's book. The scene is both a tribute to and a
sendup of the various arts of fiction, the ability to summon whole
characters and whole worlds out of air. And while the scene is
executed with a precision that bespeaks long rehearsals, it also
feels happily, headily drunk on the powers of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   So does much of this two-part production, which runs through
Sept. 27 at the Taper, and the feeling generates a buzz of good
will among the audience that goes far in sustaining attention.
``The Cider House Rules'' has been long aborning, with its earliest
workshop productions beginning in 1993 and an eight-hour version
performed at the Seattle Repertory Theater. The years of care and
affection show in every gesture onstage here. This is undoubtedly a
tale told by enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, you may discover a slight, nagging
dissatisfaction that grows louder as the show goes on. It's not
that the invention of the performers flags. But there is a sense
that if you're going to commit this much time to a play, you expect
it to take you places that ``Cider House'' doesn't often venture.
</P>
<P>
   The experience can be like listening to a love-struck friend
describe the object of his affections. His excitement is
infectious, but you also can't help wondering if his beloved really
warrants it. The form is more beguiling than the content of ``Cider
House,'' and that is not to say that the content isn't meaty. The
play, like Irving's book, which is also being adapted for the
movies, is a heartfelt moral argument for a woman's right to have
an abortion, a topic that obviously remains overwhelmingly fraught,
and for the unorthodox forms that families take in a world where
children are often born unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the didacticism and the manipulative sentiment evident in
the novel become even more apparent onstage. The show's creators
have done wonders in telescoping the breadth of ``Cider House,''
which spans the first half of this century. What they haven't been
able to do is link the book's message to convincing developments in
character. This leads to the impression that however charming the
actors are, they are also, to some degree, lecturers, a bit like
characters in Soviet films about a man and his tractor.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical form of ``Cider House'' was inspired by the Royal
Shakespeare Company's beloved adaptation of Charles Dickens'
``Nicholas Nickleby.'' As in that play, seen on Broadway in 1981,
most of the 22 actors in ``Cider House'' play multiple roles,
including animals and inanimate things like filing cabinets.
Everyone speaks the work's third-person narrative as well as
dialogue. And while John Arnone's handsome tiered wooden set
conjures an appropriate atmosphere of New England rusticity (nicely
enhanced by James F. Ingalls' lighting and David Zinn's costumes),
it is up to the performers to create the specific sense of place
and changing times.
</P>
<P>
   This is all managed with appealing dexterity, including a
high-speed recap of everything that happened in the first half at
the beginning of the second. There is, remarkably, never any
confusion about the plot, which follows the fortunes, with various
detours, of two pivotal figures. There is Dr. Larch, who has turned
an orphanage in the remote, bleak Maine town of St. Cloud's into a
place where women can come either to have their babies delivered or
to receive abortions, an illegal practice at the time in which the
play is set. (His loyal nurses are wittily portrayed by Jane Carr
and Brenda Wehle.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of equal significance is Homer Wells (Josh Hamilton), a resident
of the orphanage whose adoptions somehow never work out and who
comes of age as Wilbur Larch's apprentice. His unorthodox but
thorough studies in obstetrics lead him to feel that he cannot take
the life of a fetus, a conclusion that prompts Wilbur to tell
Homer, in what might be the play's motto, ``You may disapprove, but
you may not be ignorant or look away.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, both the social and the medical facts surrounding
unwanted pregnancies and their terminations are presented in a
series of vignettes notable for their explicit anatomical language.
These scenes range from flashbacks that show Wilbur's tragic,
life-changing encounter as a young man with a prostitute to Homer's
life-changing encounter with a dead fetus. There is a lively
assortment of supporting characters, including the golden couple
(Myra Platt and Patrick Wilson) with whom the grown-up Homer forms
a menage a trois American-style. But the play's central course is
built on Homer's gradual conversion, after finding this provisional
family and fathering his own son, back to his mentor's point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem in that Homer, both in the book and the play,
isn't much more than a tabula rasa. The winning Hamilton, whose
face here has an appropriate question-mark quality, does an
excellent job in physically taking Homer from childhood to the edge
of middle age. But he is crippled by a passive part without a
personality, and the emotional journey Homer takes exists largely
on the surface alone.
</P>
<P>
   Winters, who played the ether-addicted Wilbur in Seattle, has
more to work with, and his performance is beautifully modulated.
One wishes, however, that his persona were a little more distant
from the gruff but loving fathers of sentimental sitcoms and
midcentury movies. (His voice and inflections bring to mind Tom
Bosley in ``Happy Days.'') This is a play, after all, that features
a scene in which Wilbur and Homer, their backs to each other, rasp
out the previously unspoken words, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pure John Irving, a writer who combines the mind of a
progressive liberal with the heart of someone who sheds silent
tears at Andy Hardy pictures. This novelist uses his purely
American authorial voice, laconic leaning toward cute, to spin
labyrinthine, self-delighted and ambitious plots of tremendous
narrative drive. It should be pointed out that the concerns of
``Cider House'' go beyond the issue of abortion to the shifting,
contingent rules that people create to survive, both literally and
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wilbur, several other characters in ``Cider
House'' very much make their own rules, and they have been invested
with first-rate performances that tear through their thematic
skins. Kevin Jackson and Casey Lluberes, as a black migrant worker
and his teen-age daughter, give haunting, intriguingly shaded
interpretations of a pair governed by a system that a white man
like Homer Wells can never fully comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   The production is also blessed with the pulsating presence of
Jillian Armenante, who plays the rambunctious, vengeful Melony, an
orphan propelled to acts of destruction by unfathomable anger. A
rectangular woman with a megaphone voice, Ms. Armenante brings an
astonishing physical intensity to her part that hits the production
like a concentrated jolt of caffeine. Like many Dickens characters,
she's a gargoyle, all right, but one made up of magnified,
ineffably human traits.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens' ``Great Expectations'' and ``David Copperfield,'' as
well as Charlotte Bronte's ``Jane Eyre,'' figure in ``Cider House''
as bedtime reading at St. Cloud's. As tales of orphans' coming of
age, they are also, of course, antecedents to ``Cider House.'' But
these parentless children from Victorian England have complicated,
stormy souls that transcend formula and what Homer describes as the
``too sweet'' parts of their books. ``Cider House'' still needs
richer intimations of this kind of interior life to make something
truly grand of its likable exterior.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton agreed on Wednesday to submit to
questioning at the White House by federal prosecutors in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation after independent counsel Kenneth Starr
withdrew an unprecedented subpoena to compel his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president's attorney, David Kendall, sought to delay the
testimony, scheduled for Aug. 17, until late September. But the
federal judge supervising the case, Norma Holloway Johnson,
admonished both sides to schedule it sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be permitted the unusual courtesy of having his
lawyers at his side, unlike other grand jury witnesses. Starr was
willing to agree to many of Clinton's conditions in exchange for
the president's decision not to challenge the subpoena on
constitutional grounds and further delay the lengthy investigation,
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrangement to secure Clinton's testimony was announced,
new details emerged of the testimony and evidence that Ms. Lewinsky
is prepared to provide to grand jurors under the broad immunity
deal she reached with prosecutors on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Ms. Lewinsky turned over a dress and several taped
phone messages from Clinton on Wednesday to the office of the
independent counsel, according to lawyers familiar with Ms.
Lewinsky's case. They said the dress had been sought under subpoena
since late last year, and that Ms. Lewinsky had shipped it to her
mother for safekeeping. The dress became a bargaining chip used by
prosecutors to wield pressure against her mother, Marcia Lewis, and
ultimately was part of the reason Ms. Lewis was granted immunity
along with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's account said that the
25-year-old former White House intern told prosecutors on Monday
that she had expressed concern to Clinton in December about a
number of gifts he had given her, including a T-shirt, a brooch and
a hat pin, that had been subpoenaed by lawyers for Paula Jones in
connection with her sexual misconduct suit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president had made the hypothetical
suggestion to her that ``If you don't have them you can't turn them
over'' to Mrs. Jones' lawyers. Clinton's personal secretary, Betty
Currie, retrieved the gifts and gave them to investigators last
winter, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   That account closely tracks with Ms. Lewinsky's original
proposed testimony, or ``proffer,'' given to investigators last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's agreement to testify allows him to avoid the
humiliating spectacle of being led under subpoena into a federal
courthouse to appear personally before the 23-member grand jury
that has heard scores of witnesses, from high government officials
to uniformed Secret Service officers, over the past seven months.
But it gives Starr something important as well _ the chance to
confront the president in person and question him extensively on
matters ranging from his relationship to Ms. Lewinsky to alleged
efforts to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has now secured the testimony of the two central and final
witnesses in the Lewinsky inquiry, after Ms. Lewinsky accepted an
immunity agreement that requires her to provide ``full and
truthful'' testimony about what she says was an 18-month
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky scheduled to tell their stories in
the next few weeks, the independent counsel will soon have the
final pieces of a complex mosaic that may or may not constitute
crimes or impeachable offenses. Starr is expected to quickly
conclude the Lewinsky investigation and prepare a report for
Congress on his findings.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor has said he is investigating allegations of
perjury, witness tampering and obstruction of justice arising from
charges that Clinton carried on a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and directed a conspiracy to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   The final judgment on Clinton will be rendered by the House of
Representatives, should it choose to pursue impeachment hearings,
not by Starr or a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, announced the
arrangement for the president's testimony in a brief statement in
the White House driveway on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to achieve a prompt resolution of this entire
matter the president will voluntarily provide his testimony on Aug.
17, 1998, to the Office of Independent Counsel as he has on prior
occasions,'' Kendall said. ``The president's testimony will be
videotaped at the White House with lawyers present. No further
statement will be issued.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in a week of negotiations over Clinton's
testimony came Tuesday, when Starr agreed to withdraw the subpoena
that he issued on July 17, allowing Kendall to characterize the
President's prospective testimony as ``voluntary.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials acknowledged for the first time on
Wednesday that a subpoena had in fact been issued and served on
Kendall last week.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that when Clinton learned
of the subpoena he instructed Kendall to quickly find ``a way to
get the grand jury the information it needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, ``The president is
obviously looking forward to a prompt resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to the subpoena was the subject of intense debate
within the White House and among the president's official and
private attorneys. Several of the president's political and media
advisers wanted Clinton to comply quickly to avoid the appearance
of stonewalling, but some members of the president's legal team
believed the subpoena was unenforceable and an affront to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the decision was made to make the president available
for questioning, but only under favorable conditions and not under
compulsion of a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the odd twists that have marked this investigation
since it began in January, Linda Tripp emerged from the federal
courthouse 10 blocks from the White House a few minutes after
Kendall spoke and read a statement of her own. She had just
completed her eighth and final day before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp brought her former friend, Ms. Lewinsky, to the
attention of Starr's office on Jan. 12, saying that Ms. Lewinsky
had confided in her details of a long-running sexual relationship
with the president. She provided tape recordings of their
conversations and documents that appeared to point to a conspiracy
to obstruct justice involving the president and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation has never been, quote, `just about sex,'''
Mrs. Tripp said in a breaking voice under a sweltering sun. ``It
has been about telling the truth, and the truth matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the Judiciary Committee,
welcomed news of the president's impending testimony as a sign that
Starr's inquiry was in its ``closing throes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be more than just alleged sexual peccadilloes in
the White House, and frankly all of us would like to get this over
with,'' Hatch said at a news conference. ``I'd be surprised if Ken
Starr would allow this to go well into September.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, was more blunt, calling on Starr to conclude his
investigation and ``give us a report on what he's done to date. Let
the American people, let the Congress do it and let the Congress
act whichever way they want. But wrap this sucker up.''

GONZALEZ EXPECTED TO SIT THREE TO FIVE GAMES WITH HAMSTRING INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers expect right fielder Juan Gonzalez, the
major leagues' most prolific run producer, to be sidelined three to
five games with a strain in his right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who last night missed his second consecutive game at
Toronto's SkyDome, expects to return to the lineup sometime during
the Rangers' series this weekend against the Chicago White Sox at
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those hamstring things are tough to predict,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``We wouldn't hold anyone to three to five
days.''
</P>
<P>
   That merits cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder Roberto Kelly strained his left hamstring
while running the bases during the Rangers' 11-4 victory April 26
against the Royals at Kauffman Stadium. Kelly went on the 15-day
disabled list and did not return until June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who entered last night's games leading the major
leagues with 116 runs batted in, remains in pursuit of the
single-season record of 190 RBI established by Cubs outfielder Hack
Wilson during 1930. Gonzalez is on pace for 177, but the injury
diminishes his chances.
</P>
<P>
   The injury snapped Gonzalez's streak of 138 consecutive games
played, which represented the seventh-longest among active players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's a DL situation,'' Oates said. ``It's a
little worse than what we thought it was. It went from being tight
(Tuesday) night to being tender'' yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who continues to receive treatment, reported progress
after last night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a little bit better,'' he said. ``I don't know how
many days it will be, though.''

THE JOY OF JEROME ROBBINS: IN THE MOMENT, AND FOR ALWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By OCTAVIO ROCA  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America has lost its greatest dancemaker.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too soon to contemplate the magnitude of the loss of
Jerome Robbins, who died Wednesday in New York at 79.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult enough to think of him as old: His recent works
for New York City Ballet, major revivals of familiar Robbins dances
at San Francisco Ballet and even a national tour of his immortal
``West Side Story'' not long ago suggested to all who saw them that
Robbins boasted a youthfulness as eternal as that of dance itself.
</P>
<P>
   No other choreographer in our history touched our hearts in
quite so many ways. A gifted dancer and brilliant stage director,
classical purist, romantic innovator, play doctor and Broadway baby
_ uniquely American in everything he touched _ Robbins changed our
worlds of dance and theater forever.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was just 25 when he created the ballet ``Fancy Free,'`
following it within months with his choreography for ``On the
Town,'` the hit Broadway musical about three sailors on leave in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   As did his friend and frequent collaborator Leonard Bernstein,
Robbins refused to be tied to the usual provinces of either
classical ballet or musical comedy. His work on the musicals ``The
King and I,'' ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''
and ``Fiddler on the Roof'' burst on the scene alongside his
ballets, such as ``Dances at a Gathering'' and ``Goldberg
Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   He directed Anne Bancroft in ``Mother Courage'' and made Mary
Martin fly in ``Peter Pan'' and Ethel Merman soar in ``Gypsy.''
Mixing jazz and ballet while creating pieces for Broadway troupers
and demanding ballerinas alike, Robbins' choreography made every
gesture tell, every step mirror an emotion.
</P>
<P>
   There is an intensity to a Robbins ballet that can seem at odds
with the jazzy ease of his musicality. He could make singers and
actors seem like dancers, dancers seem like gods.
</P>
<P>
   More miraculous still was the illusion Robbins created again and
again: that whatever intricate combination of gestures and steps
materialized on stage or on film, it seemed to be happening
spontaneously. Drama coaches are fond of advising actors to be in
the moment, and the best way to explain what they mean by that is
to watch a Robbins dance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no better way to demonstrate all that is best
about the arts in the United States: the optimism, daringness,
urbanity and impossibly youthful innocence at the heart of American
culture that finds their most ravishing expression in Robbins'
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Rhapsodic or lyrical, eerie or witty, clear, musical or
mysterious _ if the depth and variety of the Robbins oeuvre was
staggering, his humanism remained constant. There is no such thing
as an abstract Robbins piece _ the man loved life too much, and
there is real life in a Robbins dance.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that our warmest memories of beautiful
dancers picture them in a beautiful Robbins dance. Think of Helgi
Tomasson in ``Goldberg Variations,'' ``Dances at a Gathering'' or _
earlier this year _ in ``Circus Polka.'' Think of Natalia Makarova
and Mikhail Baryshnikov in ``Other Dances,'' Fernando Bujones in
``Fancy Free,'' George de la Pe &LR; n &LR; a in ``Les Noces,'' of Luc &LR; i &LR; a
Lacarra in ``The Cage'' or of generations of Jets and Sharks in
``West Side Story'' and Tevyes in ``Fiddler.'' The memories are
many, and they are sweet.
</P>
<P>
   What proved to be his last seasons with New York City Ballet,
Robbins' home company since 1949, showed the master happily at the
peak of his choreographic powers. San Francisco Ballet's
celebration of Robbins' work this year honored him with a fitting
retrospective of ballets that were created originally for the
company that nurtured both Robbins and Tomasson, perhaps preparing
the way for more Robbins dances in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In ballet troupes throughout the world, in touring musicals, in
the influence he exerted on those who followed _ from Bob Fosse in
``Chicago'' and ``Pippin'' to Tomasson in ``Pandora'' and Michael
Jackson in ``Thriller'' _ the spirit of Robbins will live on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is tough to accept that the man will not be there
himself. American dance was defined by giants: George Balanchine,
Antony Tudor, Martha Graham and Robbins. We have just lost the last
of them. He was the easiest to love, and the one we will miss the
most.

GINGERLY, URMANOV RETURNS TO THE ICE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ For the first time in 16 months, Aleksei
Urmanov of Russia returned to Olympic-style figure skating
Wednesday night at the Goodwill Games. The 1994 Olympic champion
was not trying to reclaim his past as much as he was seeking
confirmation of the possibilities for a healthy future.
</P>
<P>
   A severe groin injury forced him to withdraw from the 1997 world
championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, in March that year, and he
watched the 1998 Winter Olympics not on site in Nagano, Japan, but
in his apartment in St. Petersburg. The men's Olympic champion is
still a Russian, but his name is Ilya Kulik.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult,'' said Urmanov, who at 24 has grown
comfortable with English. ``But it was my injury that destroyed me,
not the skaters competing in the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished second in Wednesday night's short program to Todd
Eldredge, the five-time U.S. champion and former world champion.
Eldredge skated flawlessly after a disappointing Olympic season,
while the rusty Urmanov struggled to land his triple-axel,
triple-toe combination, spun slowly and seemed to run out of gas
after two minutes. Evgeny Plushenko of Russia finished third.
</P>
<P>
   For Urmanov, the important thing was to skate competitively. He
cannot yet rely on his quadruple jump for Friday's long program,
but that is also beside the point. The idea here is not to win but
to test his body and see whether it will hold up under the strain
of competition. He does not know whether he will attempt an Olympic
comeback for 2002 or turn professional. It is victory enough now to
skate without debilitating pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in Olympic form,'' Urmanov said. ``This is just a
check. I don't feel real pain now, but I feel that there was an
injury there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he feared surgery before the Olympics because the groin
is a delicate area.
</P>
<P>
   So Urmanov continued skating the way people learn to drive;
starting and stopping, nervously applying the brakes when he felt
himself in danger. Perhaps he did not take enough rest and tried to
come back too quickly, he now believes. Ballet dancers told him
that he would need at least a year to recover, and then, one day he
would wake up and the injury would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe them,'' Urmanov said. ``Now I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   When his luck went bad, it went bad full-time. In January, his
Olympic dreams shattered, Urmanov went to Colorado to have an
American doctor check his injured groin, only to fall during a
workout and open a gash on his knee that required 12 stitches. In
the spring, he competed in a pro-am event called the Ultimate Four
in Binghamton, N.Y., and finished last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I was last,'' he said. ``But it was good for me. I
hadn't competed in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The original injury was more than a physical setback for
Urmanov. By 1997, he finally seemed to be coming to terms with the
pressure and expectation that come with an Olympic gold medal.
After the 1994 Winter Games, he struggled emotionally, believing
that he now had to win every event, land every jump perfectly,
leaving himself no room for error. He failed to win a medal at the
1994, 1995 or 1996 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard after the Olympics,'' Urmanov said. ``It was a
mind problem. My stupid mind. You are the Olympic champion. Nothing
happens. Everyone falls. Everyone makes mistakes. It's not possible
to do everything right. We are not Robocops. We are normal
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when he realized it was OK to be fallible, Urmanov got
injured. Once again, he is trying to rebuild the blocks of security
in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love it when everything is fine,'' he said. ``But if I
come to practice and my triple axel or some other jump is not so
good, I'm real close to hating myself. I know this is crazy. I
don't understand why I feel this. If I can't do it today, I can do
it tomorrow. Nothing happens. Life still goes forward.''  &QL;

PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATING ACCIDENT AT TOWER IN TIMES SQUARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ill., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau
announced Wednesday that his office was investigating possible
criminal misconduct in connection with the scaffolding accident at
the Conde Nast building in Times Square. The accident killed an
85-year-old woman and prompted authorities to close off several
blocks around the accidents for much of last week.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been investigating the accident since it
occurred, Morgenthau said, noting that the inquiry was ``quite
complex and it could take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that city officials were also
investigating the collapse of the temporary elevator tower and
that, depending on the findings, the city could file a civil
lawsuit. He said the city would coordinate its investigation with
the district attorney's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of investigations we're trying to
coordinate as carefully as possible with the district attorney, who
would ultimately have to determine whether there is criminal
liability,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, senior vice president of Tishman Realty and
Construction Co., said the construction manager, Tishman
Construction Corp., and the developer, the Durst Organization, were
cooperating with the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our understanding that an investigation of this nature
is normal procedure when a fatality occurs,'' Kielar said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the district attorney's office cautioned that their
investigation was in a preliminary stage and they refused to give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said a worker or a supervisor would have to engage
in a ``gross deviation'' from standard safety procedures to be
charged with criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The City Buildings Department hired an engineering firm, Wiss,
Janney, Elstner Associates, of Northbrook, Ill., to investigate the
cause of the collapse, said Ted Birkhahn, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Osborn, manager of the firm's branch in Princeton, N.J.,
said four engineers would carry out the investigation, beginning
Thursday, but he did not know how long it might take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to gather whatever data we need from the existing
scaffolding structure before it is destroyed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kielar said Tishman had also hired an engineering firm to
investigate the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   As work on securing the construction site continued, more of the
Times Square area returned to a state approaching normal Wednesday.
Both Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street were opened to traffic
by midmorning, but West 44th and West 43rd streets between Broadway
and Avenue of the Americas remained closed.

JEROME ROBBINS, GIANT OF AMERICAN DANCE, DIES AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
   By OCTAVIO ROCA  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins, one of the giants of 20th century ballet and a
major figure in the American musical theater, died yesterday at his
home in Manhattan. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a stroke Saturday, said Jeffrey Peterson of the New
York City Ballet, the company that was Robbins' home since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was acclaimed throughout the world for ballets he
created for the American Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet and
Ballets USA, many of which are now considered to be among the
classics of the repertory.
</P>
<P>
   He was equally celebrated _ and often emulated _ for his work in
the theater, where his dances are the stuff of Broadway legend:
``On the Town,'' ``Gypsy,'' ``West Side Story,'' ``The King and
I,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and others that helped define the feel
of musical comedy and continue to exert considerable influence to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome Robbins' death truly represents the end of an era and
leaves us in deepest grief,'' said Peter Martins, New York City
Ballet's artistic director and Robbins' colleague and student. ``He
was one of the last titans in the world of dance. (George)
Balanchine is gone. So are (Sir Frederick) Ashton, (Antony) Tudor
and (Martha) Graham. And now, Jerry. Today is a very sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the true geniuses of our century,'' said Helgi
Tomasson, artistic director of San Francisco Ballet and one of the
leading interpreters of Robbins' choreography. ``He will live on,
of course, in his own dances and in the incredible influence he has
had not just on ballet choreographers but also in the musical
theater. But his death is a great tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I can say that I would not be director of San
Francisco Ballet today if it had not been for Jerry, that without
him I would not have had the career I had or been the choreographer
I am. He was the one who brought me to this country in 1960, who
asked me to join New York City Ballet, who gave me so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions elsewhere in the dance world echoed the grief of his
two star pupils. Michael Smuin, who danced the Robbins repertory at
ABT and today heads his own Smuin Ballets/SF, said, ``The last of
the big ones is gone now, and frankly the one who had the richest
palette. Balanchine tried Broadway too, but he was never as
successful as Jerry was. Robbins could do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not be duplicated,'' said Melissa Hayden, the great
American ballerina and teacher. ``And he will be remembered as an
original.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Jerry,'' said Alicia Alonso, Robbins' former
Broadway and ABT colleague who is today director of the Ballet
Nacional de Cuba, ``is that he always made you happy that there was
such a thing as American dance. No one ever has been more American,
or so full of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Wilson Rabinowitz was born Oct. 11, 1918, the son of
Russian Jews who emigrated to New York. His father ran a
delicatessen, his mother was a housewife who made sure that young
Jerome and his sister, Sonya, took dance and music lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The future choreographer studied briefly at New York University
in 1935, but the Depression was rough on the Rabinowitz family, and
he dropped out of college to take several jobs. Still, he found a
way to take dance lessons, at Works Progress Administration
studios, at summer camp and eventually at the Yiddish Art Theater,
where he landed a small role in ``The Brothers Ashkenazy.''
</P>
<P>
   His first Broadway musical followed: ``Great Lady'' in 1938,
choreographed by George Balanchine, where Robbins kicked it up in
the chorus line with fellow hoofers Alonso and Nora Kaye. By 1940,
all three had joined the corps of the newly formed American Ballet
Theatre. ``This is the most old-fashioned bilge,'' he told Kaye and
Alonso at the time about the company's classical repertory. ``This
is an American company. Why do we have to keep on dancing about
wheat sheaves and Russian Gypsies?'' Robbins recalled the incident
when he received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry was a better dancer than he always thought,'' Alonso
recalled about her colleague, who indeed rose at ABT not only in
the classics but also in new ballets by Tudor, Massine, Lichine and
de Mille. ``But what he always wanted to do was something of his
own culture, his own country. He did, and after all these years,
whenever I think of American dance, I think of Jerry. Balanchine
was universal, but Jerry was and always will be the most American
of choreographers.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' all-American credentials came early when he worked with
Leonard Bernstein on ``Fancy Free'' in 1944. He and Bernstein would
team again, with spectacular success each time: ``On the Town'' and
``West Side Story'' on Broadway, ``The Dybbuk'' for New York City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bernstein, Robbins kept his hand in culture both high and
low, but it was Robbins who may have enjoyed the easier passage
back and forth. He could create ``The Cage'' the same season as
``The King and I,'' make ballet history with the monumental music
of Bach and at the same time make Zero Mostel shimmy in
``Fiddler.'' His musical tastes were voracious but always knowing:
The immortal trio of strippers in ``Gypsy'' rang true, but so did
the elegiac lines of ``Dances at a Gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be impossible to choose what constituted Robbins in his
prime; he was always, it seemed, at the height of his glorious
powers. He created his last new work, ``Brandenburg,'' in 1997, for
New York City Ballet. It was as inventive as ``Goldberg
Variations,'' as exuberant as ``Fancy Free,'' sheer joy, wit and
pleasure in motion. It was just another Robbins ballet, which is to
say, it was a work of genius.

CLARENCE THOMAS RESPONDS ANGRILY TO HIS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ In an explosion of pent-up resentment, Justice
Clarence Thomas on Wednesday vigorously attacked his critics, both
black and white, saying they had racist views because they had been
unable to accept the notion that he was able to think for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to have my ideas assigned to me because I am black,''
Thomas told an audience of black judges and lawyers. His critics,
he said, have subjected him to particularly ``bilious and venomous
assaults'' because his conservative views and judicial opinions
since he joined the Supreme Court in 1991 do not conform to what is
expected of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, Thomas said, have engaged in what he called silly
speculation that he must be taking his cues and ideas from other
conservative justices who are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could be the explanation when I fail to follow their
ideology or anti-intellectual prescription,'' he said. ``The stench
of racial inferiority still confounds my olfactory nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that such views were racist because they were based
on the idea that he would be unable to formulate such views for
himself and that he did not have a right to such opinions, because
he is black.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' deeply complicated and troubled relationship with his
fellow black Americans was on vivid public display in his
appearance before the annual convention of the National Bar
Association, the nation's largest group of black lawyers. It was an
event to which he had been invited months ago, only to have a large
and prominent group of members try to have the invitation
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   In the end he accepted the invitation with alacrity, even though
he knew he would confront an audience with many critics.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Thomas generally confined his public speeches
to small and friendly audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience of nearly 2,000 that it had become a
wearisome ritual that when he is invited to speak publicly, people
seek to deny him that opportunity. But he suggested his acceptance
of Wednesday's invitation was like when he was younger and ``tired
of turning the other cheek.'' As for those who have said he has
forgotten his black roots, he said they were engaging in
``psychosilliness'' and probably had too much time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although his delivery was calm, his words Wednesday were harsher
than ever before. At one point he said his critics were
``illiterate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Thomas said, ``Despite some of the
nonsense that has been said about me, I am a man, I am a black man,
I am an American.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Isn't it time to move on? To be angry with me solves
no problems.'' About half of the audience applauded, some standing,
while the other half remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the speech, several hundred lawyers and judges
went into an adjoining room to hear Thomas' critics analyze his
work and compare him unfavorably to the man he replaced on the
court, Thurgood Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, former chief judge of the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Philadelphia, and one of Thomas' most
consistent critics, said Thomas was deceptive in his speech
Wednesday. He had said his critics purposely misinterpreted his
dissent in a 1992 case in which he wrote that it was not a
violation of the Constitution's proscription against ``cruel and
unusual punishment'' when a black prisoner was beaten by guards. He
described the injuries as minor, but Higginbotham said the shackled
prisoner was beaten so badly his dental plate was broken, his lips
were burst and some teeth were loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham had argued before Wednesday's event that it was a
mistake to have Thomas be the bar association's keynote speaker
because that would bestow an undeserved honor on someone whose
rulings on the court ``have done more to turn back the clock of
racial progress than any other African-American public official in
the history of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Bernette Johnson, a member of the Louisiana Supreme
Court and chairwoman of the association's judicial council, who had
first invited Thomas, said she knew the selection would be
controversial. But Ms. Johnson said she did not view extending the
invitation as an honor to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she said, ``it gives us a chance to interact with a
Supreme Court justice and dialogue is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   But like most of those who supported the invitation, Ms. Johnson
said she disagreed strongly with Thomas' views and his writings on
the Supreme Court. ``I'm not an apologist for him,'' she said.
``I'm just saying he has a right to say what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Bar Association opposed Thomas' confirmation to the
court when he was nominated in 1991, largely over his conservative
views and outspoken opposition to affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas offered a fervent defense of his views against
affirmative action programs Wednesday, saying such programs are
inevitably based on black inferiority and are ``non-starters in my
view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe kneeling is a position of strength,'' he
said, ``and I do not believe that begging is an effective tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' opponents have said his views on affirmative action are
particularly galling since he was a major beneficiary of such
programs, including his admission to Yale Law School under a
program in which a number of places were set aside for minority
students. Keith Watters, a Washington lawyer and a former president
of the National Bar Association, said he decided at the last minute
to picket the speech outside the hotel because he found Thomas'
views so hypocritical.

OFFICER SHOT IN NEW YORK TAKES A TURN FOR THE WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As anguished family members, friends and fellow
police officers continued a vigil around his hospital bed, the
police officer who was shot in the head on Staten Island on Sunday
night took a turn for the worse Wednesday with severe swelling
around the wound.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the officer, Gerard Carter, 28, who had been
showing some signs of improvement on Tuesday, was downgraded to
extremely critical. Carter was shot in the head at close range
while sitting in a police van in a housing project. He had been
approaching a 17-year-old ex-convict who was wanted for questioning
in a recent killing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edwin Chang, a neurosurgeon who operated on Carter at the
St. Vincent's Campus of the Sisters of Charity Medical Center on
Staten Island, said he was concerned that the swelling around the
bullet wound was restricting the flow of blood to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something you want to have happen,'' he said, ``but
how it translates into a future prognosis we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous efforts to stem and contain the swelling, doctors
removed portions of Carter's brain tissue, inserted a catheter into
his skull to drain excess fluid and gave him anti-swelling
medicine, said Bill McCann, hospital spokesman. The bullet is still
lodged in the officer's brain.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow officers were shaken by the fact that Carter _ well known
for going out of his way to help children as a counselor at local
youth programs and as a volunteer at softball games and barbecues _
had been shot and critically wounded by a youth from the projects
he patrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect in the case, Shatiek Johnson, 17, had already been
convicted of manslaughter for beating a homeless man to death when
he was 15. Johnson was charged Tuesday with attempted murder in the
shooting of Carter and with murder in the July 16 shooting death of
Eric Trotman. Before he was shot, police said, Carter had been
approaching Johnson, whom he recognized as someone detectives
wanted to question in the Trotman case.

METROSTARS BEAT FATIGUE AND KANSAS CITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.J., Mo., Kan.)  (jw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Major League Soccer's All-Star Game on
Sunday could not have come at a better time for the MetroStars.
Playing their fourth game in 10 days, the MetroStars scored a 3-2
shootout victory Wednesday night over the Kansas City Wizards at
Giants Stadium, but it seemed they were ready for a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is tired,'' said coach Alfonso Mondelo, although the
MetroStars improved their record to 12-9 and went three games over
the .500-mark for the first time in their history. ``The level of
our play came down a little tonight because of fatigue,'' he said
Wednesday night. ``We played without any crispness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tab Ramos played with his usual gusto again and scored the
first goal in the shootout after Preki had given the Wizards (9-12)
the lead. Giovanni Savarese scored the deciding goal in the
shootout to give the MetroStars their second victory in as many
shootout games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars showed limited movement away from the ball. They
also allowed the visitors plenty of room to operate around their
penalty area and paid the price for their loose marking by yielding
goals to Preki and Paul Wright, both in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   A player the caliber of Preki, the playmaker and scorer for the
Wizards, demands close marking, even if he is far from the danger
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Preki has a lethal left foot and is most dangerous when he
attacks from right to left. He spread the field with accurate
passes that way and he scored Kansas City's first-ever goal at
Giants Stadium by cutting into the middle from the right side and
beating Tony Meola with a curling shot.
</P>
<P>
   Preki's goal, his fourth of the season, came in the 28th minute
and tied the game after Matt McKeon of the Wizards had accidentally
kicked the ball in his own goal in the 13th minute to give the
MetroStars the lead.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's gaffe came when he tried to clear Mike Dunaney's low
cross from the left side while under pressure from Miles Joseph of
the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   A header by Savarese that barely missed the goal after a cross
by Diego Sonora on the right was the only thing the MetroStars did
of note for a long period after the goal. As a result, they fell
behind on the goal by Wright with two minutes before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars picked up the tempo a little after Eduardo
Hurtado entered the game in the 58th minute in place of Marcelo
Vega, tying the game on Savarese's 10th of the season. Hurtado
started the goal with a back-heel pass to Brian Kelly on the left
and Savarese converted Kelly's pass from close range to force the
shootout.

ACT NETWORKS TO CUT STAFF 25%
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ ACT Networks Inc. announced it will lay off
one-fourth of its 265 employees as part of a strategy to focus on
its core products for voice and data transmission over
telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   The company based in Camarillo, northwest of Los Angeles, said
in an announcement after the stock market closed Wednesday that it
will eliminate or sell less promising product lines, reorganize its
structure and cut annual costs by more than $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come a month after company founder Martin Shum stepped
down as president and chief executive officer, and was replaced by
veteran ACT marketing executive Andre de Fusco.
</P>
<P>
   ACT made the disclosures as part of reporting a loss of $13.1
million, or $1.43 a diluted share, for its fourth quarter ended
June 30 compared with profits of $113,000 in the year-ago period as
sales edged up to $13.6 million from $13.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The results are likely to knock down shares of ACT, which closed
off 18.75 cents at $7.0625 on Wednesday, since the consensus
analyst forecast was for a loss of 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ACT blamed the loss on slower-than-expected sales; unspecified
restructuring costs and reserves for bad debt and slow-moving
inventories; and $7 million in charges to revalue assets and write
down inventory values.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call, de Fusco also said the downbeat
results stemmed from competition from new entrants to the $4billion
networking-equipment market, the Asian economic crisis and ACT's
problems in integrating acquired technologies into its operations.
</P>
<P>
   ACT also said it will take additional charges of $2 million to
$3 million in fiscal 1999 to cover costs of completing the
restructuring. Its balance sheet shows $80.9 million in assets and
$8.3 million in liabilities as of June 30.
</P>
<P>
   De Fusco said he was ``pleased'' with order rates in the current
quarter and the enthusiasm of ACT employees. The short-term goal
will be to return ACT to profitability while the long-term aim will
be to boost its lagging share price, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ACT was founded in 1987 and went public in 1995 at $13 a share
and soared past $36 in late 1996 before declining last year to the
$7 to $15 range.

FRANCO SAVES WHAT ROJAS NEARLY FRITTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time the public address announcer could
hurriedly ask the Shea Stadium crowd to stand for the
seventh-inning stretch, it was too late. The crowd was already on
its feet, lustily booing Mel Rojas as he made the long walk from
the mound to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday night, at least, Rojas would get a small bit of
satisfaction even through the boos. After squandering a lead for
the starter Al Leiter, Rojas was bailed out by the timely hitting
of the Mets as they took their second consecutive game from the
Western Division-leading San Diego Padres. After seeing a four-run
lead disappear, Rojas earned the victory as the Mets pushed in a
run on a sacrifice fly by Luis Lopez in the bottom of the seventh
inning and held on for a 7-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And this time the bullpen held the lead with Bill Pulsipher
doing a credible job and John Franco earning the save.
</P>
<P>
   Franco ended the game after a brief scare, fielding a hard
grounder back through the box and firing to Lopez, who had
committed an error to put runners on first and second. Lopez
acrobatically threw to first for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets piled six runs on the Padres starter Joey Hamilton, who
had won his previous four starts, thanks to the work of Brian
McRae, who continued his torrid pace. McRae was 4 for 5 with a pair
of doubles and two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has just come,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``He's progressively gotten to the point where he has a real
comfortable swing that he uses every day. The telltale sign about
Brian was about a month ago. If you look at his stats, he was
leading the team in extra base hits and he had struck out only as
many times as he had walked. I think that means that he was seeing
the ball well. He was taking pitches out of the zone and the
pitches in the zone, he was doing damage with them. Now he's built
on that and he's getting singles, also, and he's gotten his average
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, along with Greg McMichael, turned another solid start by
Leiter into another frustrating evening for the crowd, and also for
Leiter. The Mets ace walked off the mound to a mild ovation with
one out in the seventh inning with a 6-2 lead and runners on first
and second. McMichael, who blew Leiter's chance for a victory in
Leiter's previous start, did little to help him again, allowing a
ground single to Greg Vaughn and then walking Jim Leyritz to load
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas then came on, drawing boos before his name was even
announced to the crowd. He had had one significant appearance since
being ripped for five runs without retiring a batter in Toronto on
July 1, retiring the side with no damage in Chicago on July 24. But
Wednesday night, that positive experience was quickly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   After missing on his first three pitches, Rojas finally threw a
strike and drew mock cheers. After another strike got the crowd
momentarily on his side, Rojas walked Wally Joyner, pushing across
a run to cut the lead to 6-4, and the response was mild
resignation. Rojas then got Chuck Finley on a popout for the second
out of the inning, but on a 2-0 count, pinch-hitter Greg Myers
drilled a double down the line, scoring two runs and tying the
score. Rojas finally ended the inning and was serenaded with a loud
chorus of boos as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   For Leiter, it marked the second straight game in which he left
the field with only two runs allowed and the team holding a lead.
And for the second straight time, he had to watch from the dugout
as he earned another no decision.
</P>
<P>
   With Leiter pitching well, the Mets worked quickly to provide
him with support. Brian McRae led off by bouncing a double down the
right field line past Joyner. He moved to third on an Edgardo
Alfonzo grounder to second base and scored on a sacrifice fly to
center by John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza added a run in the fourth inning, blasting his 17th
home run of the season beyond the bleachers in left-center. Todd
Hundley gave the Mets a 3-0 lead in the fifth inning, driving a
two-out, run-scoring single to right after Piazza was intentionally
walked to get to him.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES
</P>
<P>
   REY ORDONEZ, who strained his abdominal muscle on Saturday,
played late in the game after taking batting practice with the team
and fielding balls at shortstop. Manager BOBBY VALENTINE believes
he will be able to start soon. ``Rey looked terrific,'' Valentine
said before Wednesday night's game. ``He took grounders, hit, and
soft-tossed. He felt so good that he took batting practice. He's
close.'' ... BERNARD GILKEY did make his return to the starting
lineup for the first time in eight games Wednesday night with BUTCH
HUSKEY getting the night off in right field.

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A 10-year-old boy from Orange, N.J., was charged
Wednesday with murder and aggravated sexual assault in the brutal
beating death of a 4-month-old girl who had been left in his care
Saturday night while the baby's mother went to a local restaurant,
Essex County prosecutors and investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Rhakida Daniels, 18, has also been arrested
and charged with child endangerment, prosecutors said.
Investigators said Ms. Daniels left her daughter, Aljaneer Caraway,
and her 1-year-old son alone with the 10-year-old boy in a friend's
home while she went to a White Castle at 11 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say how long Ms. Daniels was away from the
apartment, at 108 Parrow St. But at a news conference Wednesday
afternoon, Essex County Prosecutor Patricia Hurt described an
extraordinarily gruesome crime, which she said had occurred at the
hands of one of the youngest children ever to be charged with
murder in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt and other officials said Ms. Daniels returned to her
apartment to find Aljaneer unconscious in a crib. The baby was
brain dead when she arrived at University Hospital in Newark, Ms.
Hurt said, with a fractured skull, a punctured liver and bruises.
Ms. Hurt said there were signs of sexual assault.

<P>
   Officials would not describe what, if any, relationship there
had been between the 10-year-old suspect and the victim and her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey state law, the boy is too young to be charged
as an adult. Because he is under the age of 14, the minimum
required for prosecutors to seek adult charges, the boy has been
charged with juvenile murder, which carries a maximum penalty of 20
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, was
initially charged with attempted murder and aggravated sexual
assault. The charges were changed to include murder after the baby
died at University Hospital on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator, who discussed the case on the condition of
anonymity, said there were conflicting reports describing the boy,
ranging from a good student to ``neurologically impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   At a closed detention hearing on Monday at Essex County Family
Court in Newark, a judge ordered the boy held at the Essex County
Youth Detention Center pending further judicial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniels pleaded not guilty to the child endangerment charge
at an arraignment in Central Judicial Processing Court on Monday.
Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's office,
said that a public defender had been appointed to handle the
arraignment but that Ms. Daniels did not yet have a lawyer
officially representing her.
</P>
<P>
   At the arraignment, Judge Chester Morrison ordered Ms. Daniels
held in $10,000 bail, and officials said she was still detained
Wednesday afternoon.

Tennessee to change nickname
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
For more than a year, Bud Adams has been under fire from Tennessee
politicians, businessmen, fans and media to change the nickname he
selected for his team in 1959 when the Houston Oilers became a
charter member of the American Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Adams has finally surrendered. In a news conference
Wednesday in Nashville, Tenn., Adams and NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue announced the team will have a new nickname, logo,
uniform and colors for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Adams finally relented is because Tagliabue
guaranteed him that no NFL team will ever be allowed to use the
Oilers name again. They used it for 37 years in Houston before
moving to Tennessee for the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much like a jersey, the Oilers name will be retired,''
Tagliabue said. ``The team's history and tradition stays where it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob McNair, who is trying to get the 32nd NFL franchise for
Houston, has never been interested in Oilers as a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that if we get a team, we want to start
with a clean slate,'' McNair said. ``The Oilers name belongs to
Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   When Adams explained to the media that the team will still be
called the Oilers this season, he slipped and said, ``We'll play
the 1998 season as the Hou eh, Tennessee Oilers. But as we start
1999 in our new stadium, our team will have a new name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans support it. They demonstrated to me that they wanted
this to be a Tennessee team. Now, it'll truly be Tennessee's
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who plans to have an Oilers museum at his new stadium,
chose Oilers as the nickname of his franchise because his father,
Boots Adams, was an oil man whose amateur basketball team, the
Phillips 66 Oilers, was a national powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotional part is all over now,'' Adams said. ``I'm
looking forward to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL Properties' normal deadline for picking a new nickname,
logo, colors and uniform is Feb. 1 for marketing purposes, but
Adams said he wants to announce the new package by the end of the
regular season. The Oilers' last game is Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to include the fans in the process, Adams is going
to form an advisory council of 10 to 12 prominent Tennesseans from
across the state. They will listen to the fans in their areas and
suggest nicknames. Ultimately, NFL Properties will give Adams about
a half-dozen choices. He will make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans have been asking for this for a long time,'' Oilers
coach Jeff Fisher said. ``A day doesn't go by when I don't run into
somebody who asks that question first. Now, we've put that to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers unveiled a poster Wednesday that says, ``The Winning
Tradition Continues.'' Color pictures of Fisher, guard Bruce
Matthews, running back Eddie George and quarterback Steve McNair
are paired with black-and-white photos of former Houston greats
Earl Campbell, Bum Phillips, Mike Munchak and George Blanda.
</P>
<P>
   The poster says ``Tennessee'' with a question mark after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to identify with where you play,'' said Matthews, who
joined the franchise in 1983 and is the senior member of the team.
``This is no shock. If it helps get more fans excited, then it's
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Tennessee Oilers still sounds strange. Once we identify
with our new name, it will become as commonplace as Houston Oilers
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvin Bethea, who played 16 seasons at defensive end and was one
of the greatest players in franchise history, may have spoken for
all the players who spent their entire careers as Houston Oilers.
Bethea chuckled at the idea that changing the nickname will ignite
sluggish ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Bud wants to put some new sheets on the bed,'' Bethea
said. ``A name change is not going to change the product inside of
a can.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing the last two seasons in the Astrodome and the
Liberty Bowl in Memphis, respectively, the Oilers are playing this
season in 41,000-seat Vanderbilt Stadium, where no game has been
sold out. Team officials said 30 season tickets and 800 single-game
tickets were sold in the first hours after the news conference.

BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT IS DISSOLVED
</HEADLINE>
   ( rm ) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a year of mounting acrimony between Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and several of Manhattan's business improvement
districts, senior city officials said Wednesday they were putting
the Grand Central Partnership, one of the largest and by far the
most combative of the districts, out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Business Services, which is responsible for
monitoring the affairs of the city's 34 districts, said in a formal
statement that the city would not renew the Grand Central
district's contract, which expires Friday. Without its municipal
contract, the district cannot collect the fees that property owners
are assessed for services, including garbage pickup, security and
street beautification.
</P>
<P>
   The department cited ``a pattern of noncompliance with
regulations and noncooperation with officials'' by the board of the
district. It singled out the district's president, Daniel
Biederman, who holds the same salaried position at two other
business improvement districts in midtown Manhattan, for failing to
respond to a City Hall directive in May that he no longer head more
than one of the business improvement groups. The city said his
combined salary is $335,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, city officials said, Biederman and his staff failed
to respond to city requests for financial information, failed to
abide by city rules that require competitive bidding in awarding
contracts, and did not allow sufficient city oversight into the
district's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said in an
interview that the city might have moved to disband another of
Biederman's districts, the 34th Street Partnership, if its contract
were up for renewal. The city contract with that district, like
Bryant Park Restoration Corp., also headed by Biederman, does not
expire until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Grand Central and 34th Street districts stick out
like a sore thumb,'' said Lhota, adding that the city's move
against Biederman's groups did not reflect widespread problems with
the other districts, which were formed in early 1980s to supplement
city services with contributions by property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Biederman and other officials of the Grand Central district
declined to be interviewed, instead offering a terse prepared
statement saying that they were ``surprised'' by the city's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of the Grand Central Partnership has been
negotiating in good faith on its contract with the city's Law
Department and will continue to do so until this matter is amicably
resolved,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Lhota and other senior aides to the mayor, such
a resolution seemed unlikely Wednesday, because of what they termed
the district's continuing resistance to governmental oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Weeks, commissioner of the Department of Business
Services, said Wednesday that the district had failed to meet
repeated city demands to change its practices in areas ranging from
``late audits to ignoring oversight regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Central district apparently has viewed itself as a
private organization rather than an entity spending public money,''
said Andrew Schwartz, a spokesman for the department. Although the
city did not have evidence of criminal activity by anyone involved
in the district, he said it had received ``many complaints from
merchants and other people that told us the district was not
responding to their requests for information about its
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement goes to the heart of the unusual place
that business improvement districts have occupied in New York
City's civic structure. In one sense, they act as an arm of
government, augmenting services like police protection and
sanitation, while at the same time acting as a direct extension of
the businesses that finance them.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also highlights the debate over the money they
spend. The districts contend that the fees they receive from
property owners are private funds. But Giuliani contends that since
the city collects the fees on behalf of the districts, they are, in
essence, public funds, and the city should have a say in how the
money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the mayor angered people involved in several of the
districts by ordering that their daily operations _ including
private security patrols, the installation of planters and street
signs, and garbage pickup _ be submitted to greater oversight by
the Department of Business Services.
</P>
<P>
   But other changes in the city rules have been directed squarely
at Biederman and the districts he heads.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any of the other groups, the Grand Central and 34th
Street districts have sold bonds to raise huge sums to pay for
their projects, like the installation of spotlights that illuminate
the facade of Grand Central Station on 42nd Street, and planters,
street benches and signs that have been installed in both
districts. Since first selling bonds in the late 1980s, the Grand
Central district has accumulated a debt to its bondholders of $32
million, according to city records.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Giuliani forbad the districts to use use bond
financing, saying the city could be liable for the debt if a
district encountered financial problems or disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks said Wednesday that property owners in the Grand Central
district would continue to be assessed fees, and that the money
would be held by the city ``to ensure that the holders of bonds are
fully protected.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials and business people who control other business
improvement districts said the directive raised unresolved
questions. Lhota, who acknowledged that the current level of
assessments being paid by property owners in the Grand Central
District would exceed the amount necessary to pay off its bond
debt, said that the city would return some portion of the
assessments to the property owners after they are collected by the
Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the city would ensure that ``level of service to
property owners and tenants in the Grand Central area is not
reduced.'' But he declined to speculate on whether providing such
service would require the city to assign additional police and
sanitation workers to replace those who are now on the payroll of
the district.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Executives at other districts, citing their fears of angering
City Hall, declined to comment publicly on the mayor's action. But
privately, some said that the move raised difficult legal and
financial questions. One was whether the Grand Central group could
continue to operate, at least temporarily, relying on bank accounts
that it had already filled through its bond sales and prior
assessments on property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned whether Biederman and other directors of the
district might challenge the city in court, arguing that it was
denying them their right to operate what was designed to be a
public-spirited, nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although city officials declined to provide details, they said
the decision to deny a contract to the Grand Central group came
after months of abortive negotiations. Although the group's
five-year contract with the city had expired at the end of June,
they said Biederman and his board had been granted a one-month
extension.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, ``BID officials were unresponsive to city
officials,'' said the statement from the Department of Business
Services. After the district's contract expires Wednesday, the
statement said, Biederman and his board had been ordered to provide
the city with a ``full financial accounting of its assets and
liabilities and deliver all books, records and accounts'' to the
city within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota said one possible way to sustain the neighborhood services
that have been performed by the Grand Central group would be to
reconstitute it under new management. ``We would look favorably if
someone stepped forward who was accountable,'' he said, but added
that he knew of no one who was prepared to do so.
</P>
<P>
   One detail of the Grand Central group's finances that has long
been a source of controversy among business people and city
officials is Biederman's salary, which the city's formal statement
Wednesday listed at a combined total of $335,000, plus $30,000 a
year in health benefits, from the three districts he heads.
</P>
<P>
   One executive involved in another district, who agreed to speak
on the condition of anonymity, said the reason for the apparent
collapse in negotiations between the Grand Central group and the
city was that an extension of the group's contract would have
required Biederman to step down.

WESTFIELD QUARTERLY REPORT FULL OF PLUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Westfield America Inc., the real estate investment
trust that owns Topanga Plaza and recently bought the neighboring
Promenade mall in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, has reported strong
second-quarter earnings on the strength of tenant growth,
acquisitions and redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based owner of shopping centers across the
United States also announced Wednesday it paid $33.5 million in
cash for The Promenade at Woodland Hills, whose purchase was first
reported by the Los Angeles Daily News in May. The sale closed in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield's funds from operations _ that is, net income
excluding depreciation _ totaled $32.2 million, or 40 cents per
share, on $77 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're effectively meeting our expectations,'' said Randall
Smith, vice president of marketing for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for the comparable period last year were not available
because the company went public in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of total revenue, $68.7 million comes from wholly owned
properties or properties in which Westfield has more than a 50
percent stake. The rest is from properties in which it holds a
smaller share.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield bought the Promenade from Indianapolis-based Simon
DeBartolo Group Inc., which in turn had purchased the
600,000-square-foot mall in September as part of a portfolio of
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said it was too early to say what Westfield's plans are
for the Promenade, which is only two blocks south of Topanga Plaza,
in Woodland Hills. Westfield has owned Topanga Plaza since February
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's a really good opportunity for us to maximize the
retail market for the area,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   William Acheson, a senior analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York City, said the $33.5 million price was a good value for
Westfield, which has ``a very good track record'' for beefing up
occupancy at its malls.
</P>
<P>
   The Promenade, which has 75 retailers including the AMC 16 movie
theater and two Macy's stores, is about 56 percent occupied, the
company said, compared with an average 93 percent occupancy rate
for the 26 shopping centers in which Westfield has an interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no worries that Westfield would buy a property that
they didn't think they would make a significant amount of money
on,'' Acheson said.
