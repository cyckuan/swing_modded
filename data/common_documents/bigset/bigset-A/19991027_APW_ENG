<HEADLINE> U.N. Prosecutor: Arrest Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- The new chief prosecutor of the  
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Wednesday her top priority was 
the arrest and trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
two Bosnian Serb warlords. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Del Ponte, a former Swiss federal prosecutor, was on her  
first tour of the Balkans since she succeeded Louise Arbour of 
Canada last month at the international court in The Hague, 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public indictments against war criminals my office already  
made are my top priority,'' Del Ponte said at a news conference in 
the Macedonian capital, Skopje. She planned to travel to Kosovo on 
Thursday, and then to Bosnia and Croatia later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal has indicted dozens of Serbs, Croats and Muslims  
for war crimes committed during the conflicts in Bosnia, Croatia 
and Kosovo. Many of those suspects, including Milosevic and Bosnian 
Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, remain at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic, Karadzic and Mladic must be arrested and brought  
for trial,'' Del Ponte declared. ``Please write it down, so it 
might help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Del Ponte said more than 400 forensic experts had completed  
investigations at a quarter of the 450 alleged mass graves and war 
crimes sites in the Serbian province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now our forensic investigative work will slow down during the  
winter months,'' she said. ``But we will return to Kosovo next 
spring because we have a lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic and four top associates were indicted for war crimes  
in connection with Yugoslavia's crackdown against Kosovar Albanians 
earlier this year. The crackdown led to NATO's bombing of 
Yugoslavia, which forced the Serb army and police out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of ethnic Albanians are believed to have been killed  
by Serb forces. Del Ponte said the tribunal was also looking into 
possible crimes by ethnic Albanians against non-Albanians in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an armed conflict we found responsibility on both  
sides,'' Del Ponte said. ``We are concerned especially about high 
level responsibility in the military and political section.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Netherlands, the tribunal accused Serbia and Croatia  
Wednesday of hampering efforts to bring suspected criminals to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In its sixth annual report, the tribunal said 35 people named in  
public indictments remained at large, mostly in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Serbia ``persists in its disregard for the rule of law,''  
refusing to extradite suspects or allow investigators access to 
potential crime scenes, the report said. Croatia, it said, was 
stalling on extraditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Croatia protested in a letter to the tribunal's president,  
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, that said Zagreb had surrendered one 
suspect in August and approved the extradition of another, though 
the suspect's transfer was suspended because of illness.

<HEADLINE> Congress Nears Crucial Budget Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders readying for a crucial budget  
vote searched for support Wednesday as both parties vied to define 
the GOP's spending plans. Republicans said their proposed 
across-the-board cuts were prudent while Democrats called them 
destructive. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders tried putting the finishing touches on their  
effort to pare federal agencies' spending by about 1 percent across 
the board. At the same time, they lashed out at critics who said 
the GOP effort was drastic. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, they attacked Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the  
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee 
on Tuesday that the across-the-board reductions would have a 
``devastating'' effect on the military. Even with the cuts, they 
noted, the Pentagon spending bill that President Clinton signed 
Monday would be about $265 billion -- nearly $2 billion higher than 
the amount Clinton requested in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was political rhetoric coming out of the Pentagon,'' said  
GOP Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee. ``I've got to tell you, this has gone too 
far now for us to not remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said accusations the  
cuts would hurt defense were ``nothing but hogwash.'' He said the 
criticism was coming from ``the same officials who have sat by idly 
as the president has hollowed out the armed forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP comments came as party leaders hunted for votes for a  
massive bill that includes the cuts, about $314 billion for labor, 
health and education programs, plus money for the District of 
Columbia's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans leaders want Congress to vote Thursday on the  
measure, which would let them say they have sent Clinton all 13 
spending bills for the new fiscal year. But they continued to find 
resistance from lawmakers reluctant to expose highway projects, 
defense or other programs to the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the measure because of the spending  
cuts and the bill's failure to provide $1.4 billion he wants to 
hire teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are even set to enact an across-the-board spending cut  
that would have a destructive impact on our efforts to educate our 
children, protect our environment, and modernize our military,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the across-the-board savings could come from  
federal waste. Their plan is designed to let them claim they are 
not dipping into Social Security surpluses to pay for government 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats criticized other GOP proposals for saving money as  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health's budget for fiscal 2000 would  
be $17.9 billion, $2.3 billion more than this year. But Republicans 
would require that $7.5 billion of it not be spent until next Sept. 
27, just four days from the end of the fiscal year, preventing most 
of it from being charged to fiscal 2000's books. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're doing is destroying the continuity of research in  
this country over a political fiction,'' said Rep. David Obey of 
Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the delayed spending would have little effect  
on scientists, who could maneuver around it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also were claiming $877 million in savings by using  
a computer database of newly hired workers to track down people who 
defaulted on student loans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office says the idea would only save $130 million, but Republicans 
are using a more generous estimate used by Clinton's White House 
budget office. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have pledged to leave Social Security surpluses  
alone to position themselves as defenders of the pension system, 
even though both have routinely spent the money for decades without 
weakening the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, congressional leaders prepared to vote Thursday or  
Friday on another week-long extension of the authority many 
agencies need to keep functioning through the budget impasse. 
Clinton is expected to sign it.	   The most recent extension, the second so far this year, expires 
Friday night.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Stock Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co.'s stock fell sharply  
Wednesday after it told analysts it was uncomfortable with current 
estimates for fourth-quarter earnings, prompting several to sharply 
reduce their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard fell $6.25 to $70.37 1/2 a share and was the third  
biggest declining issue on the New York Stock Exchange. In after 
hours trading, the shares fell to $67. 
</P>
<P>
	Company chief executive Carly Fiorina in early October warned  
the massive 7.6 magnitude earthquake last month in Taiwan would 
affect sales and result in earnings at the low end of expectations, 
prompting Wall Street at the time to lower its earnings and revenue 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But in calls made to analysts this week, company executives said  
even those lowered expectations were too high. Hewlett-Packard did 
not make a formal announcement of its earnings expectations for the 
fiscal quarter that ends Oct. 31, and a spokesman did not 
immediately return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich said Wednesday in a  
daily report that ``HP appears less comfortable with analyst 
estimates for (the fourth-quarter), based on our conversations with 
the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed its problems on weaker-than-expected sales of  
its Unix servers line, a problem that also is likely to affect 
sales of storage devices. The company just weeks ago announced it 
was realigning its servers sales force to make them more 
accountable for shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Milunovich slashed the company's per share earnings prospects by  
5 cents, to 73 cents a share. He cut the company's prospects for 
revenue growth to 6 percent, or $10.8 billion, from its earlier 
projection of 10 percent growth, or $11.3 billion, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts who follow the company lowered their per-share  
expectations within a range of 70 cents to 73 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is a major maker of  
computers, printers and imaging products.

<HEADLINE> Wyo. Judge Rips 'Gay Panic' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The judge in the Matthew Shepard murder  
case threatened on Wednesday to bar the man on trial from employing 
a ``gay panic'' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Barton Voigt told Aaron McKinney's lawyers that  
he is not sure such a defense is allowed under Wyoming law and 
criticized the defense for invoking it without consulting him 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned about this and where it is going,'' Voigt said  
outside the presence of the jury. ``We do not have a gay panic 
defense. I don't know if I'm going to allow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is charged with murder in the beating death of the gay  
University of Wyoming student. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``gay panic'' or ``homosexual panic'' defense is built on a  
theory that a person with latent homosexual tendencies will have an 
uncontrollable, violent reaction when propositioned by a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's lawyers have argued that McKinney snapped during a  
drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance by Shepard 
triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. The lawyers 
are trying to save McKinney's life by convincing the jury he is 
guilty only of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Voigt said the closest defense he could find in Wyoming law is  
the ``battered woman'' defense, for those who kill a spouse in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dion Custis denied he was using a ``gay panic''  
defense. But he said: ``The fact that Matthew Shepard made a sexual 
advance has a relevance in this case. It's something Aaron McKinney 
responded to.'' He added that Shepard's behavior helps explain 
McKinney's state of mind, ``which is a defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered Custis to provide a legal basis for his  
arguments and said he would make a decision later. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's accomplice, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to  
kidnapping and felony murder in April and received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights activists praised the judge, saying it is wrong to  
try to blame Shepard for McKinney's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person at risk here was Matthew Shepard,'' said Wayne  
Besem, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay lobbying 
group in Washington. ``If Aaron McKinney felt threatened, all he 
had to do was walk away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no state has adopted a gay panic defense, it has been  
used by defense attorneys in some cases involving gay victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts warned that employing the defense is perilous since it  
can amount to blaming the victim. Brian Levin, director of the 
California-based Center on Hate and Extremism, also said the 
strategy hasn't worked recently because Americans have become more 
tolerant of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we've turned a very big corner in that nearly everyone  
agrees that violence against them is completely wrong,'' he said. 
``I don't think you had the same type of atmosphere 20 or 30 years 
ago.''

<HEADLINE> Petula Clark Stars in Sunset Blvd. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A fading diva sliding precipitously into  
delusion and despair. Not even close to anyone Petula Clark knows 
in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diva, goddess, I find those amusing terms. I've never met a  
goddess before, please,'' said the 66-year-old British 
singer/actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark is a former child star who has spent half a century in  
show business. She has sold more than 30 million records worldwide 
including the popular 1960s anthems ``Downtown,'' ``Don't Sleep in 
the Subway'' and ``I Know a Place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has revised the role of silent screen diva Norma Desmond for  
a touring production of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Sunset 
Boulevard.'' Clark recently headlined a five-night stand at the 
Pantages. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950 movie, directed by Billy Wilder, starred Gloria  
Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lloyd Webber musical was a consistent sellout on Broadway  
with its original star Glenn Close. The Broadway production opened 
Nov. 17, 1994. But grosses faltered after Betty Buckley and later 
Elaine Paige took over the role, and the show closed on March 22, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark saw the Broadway production when Close was in the starring  
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it magnificent, but I was strangely unmoved by it,''  
Clark said, adding she was more overwhelmed and awed with the set 
design. 
</P>
<P>
	When British stage director Trevor Nunn asked her to appear in  
the touring version, Clark wasn't convinced she could get into 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been asked to play someone so different from me,''  
Clark said. ``How does one get to grips with someone like Gloria 
Swanson? The character was just not sympathetic. She's neurotic 
with self-centered deluded emotions, emotions I've never been asked 
to express before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn persuaded Clark to take the role.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was going on an extended holiday when I got a call from him  
and we met for three hours,'' she said. ``So it was goodbye 
holiday, hello `Sunset Boulevard.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Patti LuPone opened the show in London in July 1993. Clark took  
over in September 1995 and stayed until the West End run ended in 
April 1997. The current 47-city U.S. tour began in Pittsburgh last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark remembers meeting Swanson in London. ``I remember that she  
was a formidable, very little lady,'' she said. ``I also saw 
`Sunset Boulevard' when I was a kid. It was a very spooky kind of 
movie. I didn't understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark wanted her depiction to be multidimensional. ``What I'm  
bringing to her is humor and vulnerability, two things I never 
would have associated with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She does say some ridiculously funny things. I want to play  
her so that the audience is laughing sort of at her but not in an 
unkind way. Then they become a little more comfortable with her. 
She's more approachable. We pull back the curtain a little here and 
there. It's a bit of a tightrope, but it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has her own personal way of doing the ending.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a delicate balance,'' Clark said. ``She has to be Norma  
Desmond. She is monstrous and rude and misbehaves and treats people 
like dirt. But if you had seen her at 17: She was delightful, 
beautiful, a good actress and a great star. Then she has all these 
truths thrown at her. Well, the Norma we have come to know and the 
persona that she was. She goes crazy and goes back to being 17.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A special edition of Clark's new CD ``Here With You'' includes  
three songs from the musical. The CD is sold at theaters where 
``Sunset Boulevard'' tours. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clark is working with Cirque du Soleil director Guy  
Caron on a one-woman musical. She is writing the script for the 
show, which will include her memories of growing up in England 
during World War II and her later experiences in show business. The 
show will have songs from the '60s and some French jazz mixed in.

<HEADLINE> Irvin's Return to Game Clouded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Irvin's return to the Dallas Cowboys from  
a spinal injury earlier this month was clouded as the team 
announced that Irvin was born with a spinal condition that 
increases his risk of further injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike was born with a different-looking spine,'' Cowboys owner  
Jerry Jones said on Tuesday. ``How does that impact any decision he 
might make? To me, I've heard more discussed about what he was born 
with than I have about any damage'' incurred from the spinal 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition, known as cervical stenosis, is basically a  
narrowing of the spinal canal. The congenital defect is relatively 
safe, team officials said, but the condition puts Irvin's spinal 
cord at greater risk because serious trauma can increase pressure 
and damage to the injured area. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Green Bay cornerback Tim Lewis and Houston Oilers  
linebacker Frank Bush retired finding out they had narrow spinal 
canals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm concerned,'' Jones said. ``They're addressing  
everything. I don't see this as necessarily totally decided by 
whether or not the swelling goes down. Right now, I don't know if 
that's the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cervical stenosis was initially revealed along with the  
spinal swelling when Irvin had a MRI exam after being knocked out 
of the game against Philadelphia on Oct. 10. Jones refused to say 
if the 33-year-old all-time leading receiver will return. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are still more questions that need to be answered over  
the next several weeks,'' Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days after the injury, Maurer said Irvin had been cleared  
to ride a stationary bicycle and do other conditioning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin is scheduled for another MRI tomorrow. X-rays taken Monday  
showed nothing new in terms of Irvin's genetic condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones told reporters surgery is not an option for Irvin.  
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year veteran said said last week that no one had advised  
him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin's injury occurred when he awkwardly fell headfirst into  
the Veterans Stadium artificial turf as he was being tackled. He 
immediately lost feeling in his extremities and couldn't move his 
hands or legs for more than 15 minutes.

jammed -- a victim of huge worldwide demand and inadequate hardware 
and software. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten million hits a day have overloaded the free Web site since  
its Oct. 19 debut. Only 100,000 people have reached the first page. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third apology that greeted Web users trying to reach the  
site Wednesday, the company said it is working around the clock to 
fix the glitches and increase the system's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	More users should be able to get in by next week, said Jorge  
Cauz, senior vice president for sales and marketing. But he 
admitted it likely will take weeks to ensure the Web site can 
handle millions of users at once looking up everything from a-ak 
(an ancient East Asian music) to Zywiec (a town in Poland). 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in his right mind would have built an infrastructure  
capable of handling the initial demand we had,'' Cauz said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts like Emily Meehan of Boston-based Yankee Group said  
Britannica should have learned from other Internet companies that 
failed to anticipate high demand and found their systems 
overloaded, like America Online and auction site eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said, ``I think consumers will give (Britannica) a  
few more chances than they would some nameless, unheard-of Internet 
startup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britannica is counting on advertising, sponsorship and  
e-commerce to make its online venture pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	It also plans to keep its first Web site, where people can  
access the encyclopedia for $5 per month without advertising, and 
its printed volumes, which sell for $1,250 per set. Printed sales 
have fallen an estimated 80 percent since 1990 as less expensive 
computer versions have taken over the market.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 92.76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By EILEEN GLANTON    	
</P>

                         *AP Business Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A late rally in the bond market carried over to  
Wall Street Wednesday, lifting financial stocks and pulling the Dow 
industrials out of the narrow range where they had traded most of 
the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.76 to close at  
10,394.89. Much of the Dow's gains came in the final hour of 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 14.80 to 1,296.71, but the Nasdaq composite index fell 8.95 to 
2,802.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose for the first time in a week after a report in  
Europe suggested the European Central Bank may raise interest rates 
on Nov. 4, making its own effort to hold off inflation before it 
endangers economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are signs that the falling inflation rate has begun to  
turn higher in some countries,'' said Thomas M. McManus, equity 
portfolio strategist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. 
``Clearly, it's happening in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while fears of inflation have pounded bond and stock prices  
in recent months, analysts said bonds benefited Wednesday from the 
sense that central bankers around the world are working to hold off 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.33 percent,  
from 6.37 percent late Tuesday. Rising yields can make bonds more 
attractive than stocks, so the drop Wednesday heartened Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest  
rates for the third time this year when its Open Market Committee 
meets Nov. 16. Speculation that Europe will move first on interest 
rates fostered hopes that resolution of the inflation problem is 
drawing near, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks rose solidly. J.P. Morgan soared 7 1/8 to 128 1/2,  
Citigroup gained 2 13/16 to 51 5/16 and Chase Manhattan rose 4 
15/16 to 82 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks have really been laggards'' due to fears of  
rising rates, McManus said. ``It finally appears that it's time for 
them to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a modest lift from a Commerce Department report that  
showed orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods 
fell 1.3 percent in September, the first decline in five months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was sharper than many analysts had expected, and  
offered some indication that the pace of U.S. economic growth may 
be tapering off. But analysts said Thursday's reports on the 
employment cost index and the gross domestic product will provide a 
clearer indication of the nation's economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mostly lower. Hewlett-Packard, a Dow  
component, fell 6 1/4 to 70 3/8 after a Merrill Lynch analyst raised 
concerns about sales and earnings in the company's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel fell 2 to 69 7/16 after Salomon Smith Barney cut its  
earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay fell 13 5/16 to 138 11/16. The company  
said after the close of trading Tuesday its quarterly operating 
profits rose, beating analysts' expectations, after it signed up a 
record number of new users. But the company's profit margin fell, 
which caught some investors by surprise. EBay also recorded fewer 
transactions for new users, raising concerns about future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed, online retailer Amazon.com reported a  
third-quarter loss that was narrower than most analysts had 
expected. Amazon shares, which lost 5 5/16 to 75 15/16 during the 
regular session, rose to 77 1/8 in after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two weeks, corporate earnings reports have given the  
market some sporadic relief from the lingering worries about 
inflation. But as the profit reports end and are no longer a 
distraction, the market may remain in a relatively narrow range, 
said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum 
&AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``With most of the third-quarter earnings news out, stocks will  
likely return to an interest rate and Fed-watch stance over the 
next several days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered 
advancers by a 10-to-9 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 1.12 billion shares, compared with  
1.06 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.98 to 416.77.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.6 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 
0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Germany To Share Stasi Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has agreed to share with  
Germany CIA-held files of the former East German intelligence 
agency Stasi on German cases as long as they do not compromise U.S. 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. spy agency for the first time is publicly acknowledging  
it has the files believed to contain information about thousands of 
former East German spies and informants. But neither government 
provided much detail Wednesday on the transfer of data to Germany 
that is expected early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA possession of the files and the agreement to share them was  
first acknowledged by the agency's director, George Tenet, when he 
answered questions after a speech last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have promised the German government that we will provide  
them with as much information as possible about all the German 
cases in these files in a form that does not compromise sources and 
methods from our perspective,'' Tenet said at Georgetown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	He said German agents have had some access to the files since  
1994. The CIA has not disclosed how it got them. They were obtained 
by American agents sometime after reunification of East and West 
Germany in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA spokesman Tom Crispell said the agency is not releasing any  
information from the documents or discussing their content or 
details of what will be handed over to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the German Embassy, Claudius Fishbach, referred  
questions to the German agency in Berlin that would get the 
documents, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Calls 
to the agency went unanswered late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A German government spokesman said last week that the CIA had  
agreed to return copies of the Stasi records but he provided no 
more details. Officials had said previously the documents were 
believed to contain both code names and real names of former Stasi 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records in Virginia show that the files, even before the  
CIA said it had them, were used to help convict two former leftist 
student activists -- Theresa Marie Squillacote and Kurt Alan Stand -- 
of espionage. Squillacote, a former Pentagon lawyer, was sentenced 
to 21 years in prison. Stand, her husband, was sentenced to 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has been seeking the documents since at least last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents is a masterlist of 320,000 ``identities,''  
including real names, code names and pseudonyms of East and West 
Germans, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. It quoted 
German sources as saying most names on the list likely were people 
under surveillance rather than spies. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in data collected by East Germany runs high in Germany,  
with the agency in charge of Stasi files reporting hundreds of 
daily requests to look at the documents it now has. German 
officials estimate that 174,000 East Germans and possibly 30,000 
West Germans worked as Stasi informants. 
</P>
<P>
	The political careers of several prominent former East Germans  
have been tarnished or ruined by revelations from Stasi files and 
several lower-level government employees have lost their jobs, 
bringing allegations of a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a German government spokesman told reporters that the  
government gained leverage for a deal with the United States after 
Stasi files' administrators in Berlin cracked codes on East German 
magnetic tapes, revealing details of which spy turned over what 
information between 1969 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes identify the spies only by code names. Germany hopes  
the CIA-held files will reveal their true identities. In return, 
Germany would agree to share with the United States the codes it 
has cracked, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> 77 Pitches One Too Many for Glavine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As each inning went by, Atlanta manager Bobby  
Cox and pitching coach Leo Mazzone marveled at their good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Glavine, who spent the weekend in bed with the flu, was  
cruising by the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the World Series, 
using remarkably few pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, taking a conservative position, had hoped for seven innings  
from the left-hander, and he got that with very little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he pressed for one more, and that got him in very big  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven innings, Glavine threw just 73 pitches. He was leading  
5-3 and looked extremely comfortable, even after surrendering home 
runs to Chad Curtis and Tino Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``The home run by Martinez was a hanging slider,'' Glavine said.  
``It was the only mistake I made all night,'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout as the Braves batted in the eighth, the manager  
and his pitcher talked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was discussion, yes,'' Glavine said. ``I felt fine. I  
went back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, though, Cox had closer John Rocker warming up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tommy Glavine was throwing great,'' the manager said. ``Didn't  
want to come out of the game. I asked him if he was tired, and he 
said no. We all thought he was throwing great. Tommy thought he was 
throwing great himself and I thought he was throwing good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With all precincts agreeing, Rocker stayed in the bullpen and  
Glavine went to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The first batter in the eighth was Joe Girardi, and he lined  
Glavine's first pitch, No. 74 of the game, into right field for a 
single. Glavine never flinched and Cox never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up was Chuck Knoblauch.  
</P>
<P>
	Pitch No. 75 was outside and so was No. 76, putting the pitcher  
in a 2-0 hole, the kind of count hitters love. Still, Cox sat stone 
still in the dugout. This was obviously Glavine's game. He was six 
outs away from a win, three outs away from Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Tommy could get at least a couple of outs,'' Cox  
said. ``He was throwing real good. There was no reason to take him 
out, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Knoblauch provided a reason.  
</P>
<P>
	He hit Glavine's 77th pitch to right field. Brian Jordan went  
back as far as he could and jumped as high as he could. The ball 
hit his glove and caromed over the wall for the two-run homer that 
tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine was flabbergasted.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was down and away, pretty much where I wanted it,'' he said  
of the turning-point pitch. ``A pop fly to right field turns out to 
be a two-run homer. Here, it's a home run. Everywhere else, it's an 
out. The game was played here. It counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox came and got Glavine at that point, bewildered at what he  
said was a 315-foot home run, convinced that his pitcher really got 
the out the manager thought he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an out in my book,'' Cox said. ``But here, it's not.''  
</P>
<P>
	After that, it seemed just a matter of time. Curtis' second home  
run of the game settled the issue in the 10th inning against 
reliever Mike Remlinger, giving the Yankees a 6-5 victory and 
positioning them for their second straight World Series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got beat by two pop flies to right field that carried,'' he  
said. ``It was bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the only kind the Braves have had in this World Series.

<HEADLINE> 2 Men Charged in Tenn. Arson Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOKEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Two men were arrested on charges of  
tossing matches out of their car and igniting 100 brush fires 
across four counties in central Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester Clouse, 36, and Michael Carter, 18, were charged with  
arson for flicking the matches Tuesday, said Sheriff Jerry Abston. 
Clouse threatened deputies with a knife and also was charged with 
assault and resisting arrest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just driving the roads and I guess they were having  
a good time,'' Abston said. 
</P>
<P>
	A smoky haze lingered Wednesday after authorities snuffed out  
the last of the fires. Damage was limited to woodlands and 
grasslands as firefighters kept flames away from homes or barns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this kind of work for 15 years and I've never  
seen anything like it,'' said Fire Chief Daryl Blair. ``Some of the 
fires were the size of a football; others were two or three times 
the size of a football field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 citizens helped 100 mostly volunteer firefighters  
tackle the blazes in Smith, DeKalb, Putnam and White counties.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deadlocks in Hirschfeld Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A mistrial was declared Tuesday after a jury was  
unable to reach a verdict on whether real estate developer Abe 
Hirschfeld tried to hire a hitman to kill his business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	State Supreme Court Justice Harold Beeler declared the mistrial,  
the second in a Hirschfeld trial this year, on the sixth day after 
deliberations began. Jurors said the final vote was six for 
conviction, six to acquit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschfeld, 79, did not comment. Prosecutors said a retrial is  
likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Beeler allowed the parking garage magnate to remain free on $1  
million bail pending a hearing Friday on whether he violated a 
court order against commenting publicly about the case during the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschfeld, former owner of the New York Post, was charged with  
second-degree criminal solicitation. He allegedly gave Joseph 
Veltri, one of his building contractors, $75,000 in 1996 as a down 
payment to a hit man to kill his real estate investment partner of 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 2, a jury was unable to reach a verdict on whether  
Hirschfeld evaded millions of dollars in state and city personal 
and corporate income taxes. Prosecutors say that case will be 
retried.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus Sweeten El Al Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing and its  
European competitor Airbus have improved their bids to replace part 
of the Israeli airline El Al's passenger fleet, a spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bids came as El Al continues to delay deciding whether  
to buy the Boeing 777 airliner or the Airbus A330, a tactic that 
Israel's transportation minister recommended to induce 
manufacturers to sweeten their offers. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al's decision was originally to have been taken by early  
spring but has been postponed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus is battling to break Boeing's hold on the Israeli market.  
El Al's present fleet consists entirely of Boeing aircraft, and 
Israel is under strong pressure from the U.S. to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	If Israel -- which receives $3 billion annually in U.S. foreign  
aid -- were to buy the less expensive Airbus jets, it could pave the 
way for other countries that receive substantial U.S. aid to grant 
more military contracts to non-U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al executives were to have convened Tuesday evening to make  
the choice. On Monday, however, the two manufacturers made new, 
more favorable offers verbally, El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman 
said. The bids were submitted in writing Tuesday, Klieman said, and 
the meeting was postponed to give the executives time to analyze 
the new figures. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al executives were to meet again Wednesday evening, Klieman  
said, though a decision may not come until later. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al has said the four Airbus planes will cost $350  
million-$400 million. However Airbus was offering to subcontract 35 
percent of the contract value to Israel Aircraft Industries, the 
European consortium's commercial director John Leahy said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Airbus bid offered to direct 50 percent of the contract  
value to IAI, the Israeli daily Haaretz said. Neither Klieman nor 
officials from either company would release details of the new 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy has said Airbus is prepared to take a loss to break the  
Boeing monopoly.

<HEADLINE> Petula Clark Stars in Sunset Blvd. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A fading diva sliding precipitously into  
delusion and despair. Not even close to anyone Petula Clark knows 
in real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diva, goddess, I find those amusing terms. I've never met a  
goddess before, please,'' said the 66-year-old British 
singer/actress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark is a former child star who has spent half a century in  
show business. She has sold more than 30 million records worldwide 
including the popular 1960s anthems ``Downtown,'' ``Don't Sleep in 
the Subway'' and ``I Know a Place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has revised the role of silent screen diva Norma Desmond for  
a touring production of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Sunset 
Boulevard.'' Clark recently headlined a five-night stand at the 
Pantages. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1950 movie, directed by Billy Wilder, starred Gloria  
Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lloyd Webber musical was a consistent sellout on Broadway  
with its original star Glenn Close. The Broadway production opened 
Nov. 17, 1994. But grosses faltered after Betty Buckley and later 
Elaine Paige took over the role, and the show closed on March 22, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark saw the Broadway production when Close was in the starring  
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found it magnificent, but I was strangely unmoved by it,''  
Clark said, adding she was more overwhelmed and awed with the set 
design. 
</P>
<P>
	When British stage director Trevor Nunn asked her to appear in  
the touring version, Clark wasn't convinced she could get into 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been asked to play someone so different from me,''  
Clark said. ``How does one get to grips with someone like Gloria 
Swanson? The character was just not sympathetic. She's neurotic 
with self-centered deluded emotions, emotions I've never been asked 
to express before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn persuaded Clark to take the role.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was going on an extended holiday when I got a call from him  
and we met for three hours,'' she said. ``So it was goodbye 
holiday, hello `Sunset Boulevard.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Patti LuPone opened the show in London in July 1993. Clark took  
over in September 1995 and stayed until the West End run ended in 
April 1997. The current 47-city U.S. tour began in Pittsburgh last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark remembers meeting Swanson in London. ``I remember that she  
was a formidable, very little lady,'' she said. ``I also saw 
`Sunset Boulevard' when I was a kid. It was a very spooky kind of 
movie. I didn't understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark wanted her depiction to be multidimensional. ``What I'm  
bringing to her is humor and vulnerability, two things I never 
would have associated with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She does say some ridiculously funny things. I want to play  
her so that the audience is laughing sort of at her but not in an 
unkind way. Then they become a little more comfortable with her. 
She's more approachable. We pull back the curtain a little here and 
there. It's a bit of a tightrope, but it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark has her own personal way of doing the ending.

	``It's a delicate balance,'' Clark said. ``She has to be Norma  
Desmond. She is monstrous and rude and misbehaves and treats people 
like dirt. But if you had seen her at 17: She was delightful, 
beautiful, a good actress and a great star. Then she has all these 
truths thrown at her. Well, the Norma we have come to know and the 
persona that she was. She goes crazy and goes back to being 17.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise on U.S. Export Talk / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures rose Wednesday, buoyed by talk  
that China may be buying several shipments of U.S. soybeans. Grains 
were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance in soybeans came a day after the price fell to an  
eight-week low. But gains were limited by welcome rains in Brazil 
and Argentina that soaked dry growing areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said China was reported to have bought one cargo of  
American soybeans and may purchase three or four more by week's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The corn futures market was stagnant again, with prices stuck on  
about $2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was little changed, halting the slide of the day  
before with relatively light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.56 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 1/4 cent to $2.00 1/2 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.10 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 cent to 
$4.69 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle fell .37 cent to 67.90 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell .48 cent to 79.52 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell 1.85 cents to 46.40 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell 2.33 cents to 62.02 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Windows 2000 Shipment Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s long awaited update to  
Windows NT won't ship to users until next February. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000, Microsoft's next generation network operating  
system for business and corporate use, has already been delayed for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond software giant has been saying recently that Windows  
2000 would ship before the end of 1999, but said yesterday it would 
not actually be available until Feb. 17. Microsoft announced the 
release date at a marketing event in Las Vegas for its software and 
hardware partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000 offers improved Web application services, increased  
security and enhanced network growth capabilities, the company said 
in a statement. The software is mainly used on servers, which help 
run centrally managed computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The mid-February 2000 release date is contingent upon initial  
quality assessments, the company said. No price has yet been set.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Casino, Union Agree to Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIEJAS INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif. (AP) -- Tribal and union  
leaders have signed the first collective bargaining contract 
covering workers at an Indian casino in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal sovereignty exempts Indian tribes from the National Labor  
Relations Act, which gives U.S. workers the right to unionize. 
Tribal officials had resisted allowing unions to talk to casino 
workers, saying it would forfeit the tribes' right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But gambling compacts Gov. Gray Davis recently signed with 57  
California tribes include a provision allowing workers to petition 
for a union vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The compacts were signed to legalize Indian gambling and allow  
the expansion of slot machines on tribal lands. The compacts came 
after U.S. attorneys threatened to enforce a federal court order to 
shut down tribal casinos that followed a successful court challenge 
to a voter-approved ballot measure that legalized gambling in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, Anthony  
Pico, on Wednesday signed the collective bargaining contract with 
the Communications Workers of America Local 9400. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year contract, which goes into effect Nov. 25, calls for  
a salary increase and benefits equaling a 15 percent pay hike for 
nearly 700 service and maintenance employees at the Viejas Casino &AMP; 
Turf Club, about 30 miles east of San Diego. Pay increases range 
from 42 cents per hour to $1.40 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Micheal Hartigan, executive vice president of the CWA local,  
said he believes the deal paves the way for other tribes to agree 
to similar contracts.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. said Wednesday its  
third-quarter earnings rose 13 percent on strong growth in domestic 
beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob and other beers  
earned $462 million, or 97 cents per share, on sales of $3.22 
billion. That was up from earnings of $408 million, or 84 cents per 
share, on sales of $3.12 billion in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were 2 cents above the average estimate of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. But the company's stock 
fell $1.50 a share to $67.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Domestic beer industry fundamentals are the best we have seen  
in this decade,'' chairman August A. Busch III said. ``Improving 
demographics, high capacity utilization and an improved pricing 
environment are creating opportunities for margin enhancement and 
earnings growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busch said the company expects earnings to be strong again in  
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Anheuser-Busch reported  
earnings of $1.21 billion, or $2.53 per share, compared with income 
of $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per share in 1998. Sales for the nine 
months were $8.99 billion, up from $8.64 billion in the year 
earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweiser is the nation's best-selling beer, and Bud Light is  
tops among light beers. The company's domestic market share for the 
nine months, excluding exports, was 47.2 percent, up from 46.3 
percent a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> House Takes Assisted Suicide Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By JOHN HUGHES    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House stepped into the emotional debate of  
physician-assisted suicide Wednesday, voting to bar doctors from 
using federally controlled drugs to help patients die. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 271-156 for a bill sponsored by House Judiciary  
Chairman Henry Hyde that penalizes doctors who aid in a suicide but 
encourages them to treat the pain of dying patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the bill would discourage pain treatment for  
millions of Americans. Doctors will be so worried about losing 
their licenses to prescribe drugs, and spending at least 20 years 
in jail for aiding in a suicide, that they will decline to dispense 
needed medication, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time we've got law enforcement making medical  
decisions,'' said Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, R-Ill., dismissed suggestions that his bill would create a  
medical ``Gestapo,'' saying federal drug agents already review 
prescriptions. He said the bill adequately protects doctors who 
treat pain, while authorizing $5 million for more training and 
education to improve end-of-life care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suicide is the ultimate act of despair and facilitating the  
intentional killing of a human life is the opposite of healing,'' 
said Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is a major setback for Oregon, the only state that  
has legalized physician-assisted suicide for patients with less 
than six months to live. All 15 patients who died under the law 
during its first full year in 1998 used controlled substances to 
end their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House debate, some members spoke of the debate in  
personal terms -- a child who died of leukemia, a parent who died 
from cancer -- but used those experiences to draw opposite 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Hyde supporters compared physician-assisted suicide to  
euthanasia and abortion and invoked the name of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregonians painstakingly tried to point out the protections in  
their law that limit the circumstances when people can take their 
lives. ``Please read the Oregon statute before you vote,'' pleaded 
Rep. David Wu, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	With the House passage, attention now turns to the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., has not yet  
cleared a committee, but Nickles said he hopes to pass the bill 
this year. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has pledged a filibuster 
if the bill reaches the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate action, previously thought by many to be unlikely in  
1999, becomes more of a possibility because of a federal budget 
fight that is expected to keep lawmakers in the nation's capital 
into next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said he faces a ``very uphill'' battle, citing Nickles No.  
2 position as the majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide opponents have been pressing for legislation  
since June 1998, when Attorney General Janet Reno ruled that 
federal drug agents cannot move against doctors who help terminally 
ill patients die under Oregon's Death With Dignity Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But while last year's version of Hyde-Nickles fell flat, this  
year's bill has won more support from medical groups because it 
encourages pain treatment and gives doctors some assurances they 
wouldn't be prosecuted if a patients died accidentally from pain 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and National Hospice  
Organization are among the groups that support the measure after 
opposing last year's bill, although several other medical groups 
and several state medical societies oppose this year's Hyde-Nickles 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon House Democrats were pleased they garnered more than the  
146 votes that would be needed to sustain a veto -- although 
President Clinton has not yet said whether he would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben wrote Oct. 19 that the  
administration supports the part of the bill that encourages pain 
treatment but opposes the section that would make 
physician-assisted suicide a federal crime with ``harsh mandatory 
penalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Imposing such penalties would also effectively block state  
policy-making at a time when ... the states are still engaged in an 
earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality and 
practicality of physician-assisted suicide,'' Raben wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House defeated two amendments by bill opponents before the  
final vote. One amendment, defeated 268-160, would have deleted the 
part of the bill that prohibits the use of controlled substances 
for assisted suicides. The other, defeated 239-188, would have 
allowed terminal patients to take life-ending, federally controlled 
drugs in states that have legalized the practice.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Gets OK To Operate Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest life  
and health insurers, has won permission from federal regulators to 
operate a savings bank offering trust services to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval was announced Wednesday by the Office of Thrift  
Supervision, a day after mutual fund giant Fidelity was granted the 
same powers. They are the latest in a string of companies to get 
new federal savings and loan charters in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come as Congress edges toward passage of sweeping  
legislation to rewrite the financial services laws and allow banks, 
insurance companies and securities firms such as Fidelity to merge 
and sell each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Thrift Supervision, part of the Treasury  
Department, has reviewed and approved applications from a number of 
insurance companies, securities firms and other businesses outside 
the banking industry seeking to open federal thrifts. In granting 
the requests, the regulators have chipped away at the 
Depression-era laws separating the financial services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna plans to use the new savings bank,  
to be called Aetna Trust Co., to offer trustee, custodian and 
recordkeeping services to employee retirement plans and individuals 
with IRA plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of Aetna Trust Co. ... is an ideal complement to  
our business, enhancing our ability to deliver products and 
services that help our customers live the lives they want to 
lead,'' Catherine Smith, chief financial officer of Aetna Financial 
Services, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal thrift agency required that at least 40 percent of  
the new savings bank's directors be individuals who are not 
officials or employees of Aetna Inc. or its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies receiving new savings and loan charters recently  
include agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., 
long-distance telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and 
coffin manufacturer Hillenbrand Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrift charter applications are pending from, among others, Ford  
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and department store chains 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-financial companies such as these would not be able to  
acquire federal thrifts under the current financial overhaul 
legislation now before Congress, however, as legislators seek to 
avoid the mixing of commerce and banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would not affect non-financial companies which  
have already had their applications approved.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Reports Record Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak rolled out a package of upbeat results  
Wednesday, reporting that it took in record revenue over the past 
year and for the first time recorded increased ridership for three 
straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger rail corporation took in $1.84 billion in fiscal  
year 1999, up 7 percent from the previous year. That is the highest 
revenue total in Amtrak's 28-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridership for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was  
21,508,700, up 2 percent from last year and nearly 10 percent since 
it began rebounding in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 1999, Amtrak increased the number of trains operating in  
nine states and introduced service to Oklahoma for the first time 
in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak reported that it is on course to wean itself from  
government subsidies by 2003. A 1997 law prohibits Amtrak from 
using any federal funds for operating expenses after fiscal 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's growth in revenue, implementation of initiatives  
to improve efficiency, and America's demand for passenger rail, 
demonstrate the increasing fiscal strength of Amtrak and bring the 
goal of operational self-sufficiency well within our sights,'' said 
Gov. Tommy Thompson, Amtrak's chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridership records were set on the New York-Washington, D.C.,  
Metroliner, which carried 2,134,671 riders; the Pacific Northwest 
corridor, which carried 450,000 riders in Washington State and 
Oregon; the Keystone Service between Harrisburg, Pa., and New York 
City, which reached 1 million riders; and the California Capitols 
route (Oakland-Sacramento-Colfax), with 540,000 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's system-wide on-time performance remained steady at 78  
percent, the corporation reported.

<HEADLINE> Extremists Target Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Six Harvard University scientists have  
received threatening letters booby-trapped with razor blades and 
allegedly sent by a group of animal rights extremists. Scientists 
working elsewhere across the country also have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	A communique posted on a Web site belonging to an organization  
calling itself the ``Justice Department'' was forwarded during the 
weekend by a group that monitors such extremists, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	It contained a list of about 80 researchers scattered across the  
country who do work with primates, police said. The targeted 
scientists work at schools that include Emory University in 
Atlanta, the University of California, the University of Washington 
and Tulane University in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 12 Harvard researchers on the list, and all were  
alerted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The six Harvard scientists who received the letters Tuesday  
turned them over to campus police. Only one opened his letter, and 
he was not cut by the blade inside, said Harvard Medical School 
spokesman Don Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
	At Emory University, researchers have received ``several  
packages'' similar to those received at Harvard, said Kate Egan, 
spokeswoman for the Yerkes Primate Research Center. She would not 
give a specific number. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters refer to the use of primates for laboratory tests  
and disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been targeted and you have until autumn of 2000 to  
release all your primate captives and get out of the vivisection 
industry,'' one letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the scientists who received the notes work at the  
Harvard-owned New England Regional Primate Research Center in 
Southboro, and one works at an affiliated hospital, Gibbons said. 
The university added security equipment at the Southboro center 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Justice Department'' organization has carried out similar  
mail attacks in Britain and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Young Not Ready To Call it Quits </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young will be sidelined for the  
foreseeable future, but he's not ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to (play again) if it's appropriate,'' the San  
Francisco 49ers quarterback said at a news conference today. ``Yet 
it very well might not happen this season. If time runs out on the 
season, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg said Tuesday he doesn't think Young, still  
bothered by post-concussion symptoms, will play again this year. 
The team and Young's doctors appear to feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking this thing to the end of the season,'' the two-time  
NFL MVP said. ``My focus right now clearly is on my health, but I 
am also focusing on my team. That's all I'm going to think about 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the possibility was raised earlier that he would go on  
injured reserve today, that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined he not risk anything more this year,''  
Steinberg said Tuesday. ``He's probably going to end up on injured 
reserve. This is a football injury. He was hurt on the field and 
that's where those players go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said there would be no decision on retirement until  
after the season. But he added that Young will abide by the final 
medical consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come to the right decision, but this will take a  
little time,'' the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Young's primary neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg,  
no relation to the agent, made a long-term recommendation about 
whether Young should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was the first time since then that the 38-year-old  
quarterback has spoken with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dr. Steinberg's opinion hasn't been disclosed, Young has  
conceded the report was ``discouraging.'' His agent has said the 
opinion has been reaffirmed by other specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Young continued to refuse to discuss his doctor's long-term  
recommendations, but said, ``He's telling me I can't play right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like any injury,'' he added. ``You have to give it time  
to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to speak with contemporaries who were forced out  
of the game by repeated concussions, including Al Toon and Merrill 
Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also gathering more medical advice and may see another  
specialist this week. But coach Steve Mariucci and general manager 
Bill Walsh have both said that they would give greatest weight to 
Dr. Steinberg's conclusions, and they are in no hurry to see Young 
back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Young could be at risk for permanent brain damage from another  
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Monday the team, which has a bye this week, hopes  
to resolve Young's status in the next week or two and said injured 
reserve was a possibility. It would allow Young an extended period 
away from football while not shutting the door on a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Young has no real hope of receiving medical clearance to  
play any time soon, he remains optimistic that his condition will 
clear, leaving at least a possibility of a return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Young feels strong responsibility to the team, especially now  
that it's struggling without him. 
</P>
<P>
	By going on injured reserve, though, he could get treatment  
while remaining with the team as a locker room and sideline 
presence and mentor to his replacement, Jeff Garcia.

<HEADLINE> Stockbrokers Found Shot to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Two stockbrokers were found shot to  
death at the estate where one lived with his girlfriend, and 
authorities had few leads in what they consider an ``execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a definite `whodunit.' In the majority of homicides we  
have a pretty clear-cut idea, even if we can't prove who did it 
right away, we at least have a pretty good idea who did it,'' 
Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said. ``This is very 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police called to the house early Tuesday found Alan Chalem, 41,  
and Mayir Lehmann, 37, shot to death in the foyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem lived on the 16-acre property with his girlfriend,  
Kimberly Scarola, and her 13-year-old son. Lehmann lived in 
Woodmere, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were stockbrokers and dealt in penny stocks, but Kaye  
didn't know whether their profession had anything to do with their

	``I don't know, but there was no burglary involved,'' Kaye said.  
``That was never a thought. This was an execution. Reasons, we're 
not certain yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kay said two workmen made the emergency call to police in this  
community of 8,500 about 10 miles northwest of Asbury Park. The men 
had arranged to pick up some molding at the house at 1 a.m., Kaye 
said, adding that both were friends of Chalem's. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehmann had been shot once in the back of the head, while Chalem  
had been shot repeatedly, Kaye said.

	Ms. Scarola was in Florida, where she had gone several days  
earlier. Her son was with her ex-husband.

<HEADLINE> Conoco Earnings Rise 39 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Conoco Inc. said its third-quarter earnings rose  
39 percent on gains in its exploration and production business. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco, whose spinoff from DuPont Co. was completed during the  
quarter, said it had earnings before one-time items of $261 
million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $188 million, or 30 
cents a share, in 1998 on what's called a pro forma basis. That 
assumes that Conoco was publicly-owned in the third quarter of 
1998, and provides a basis for measuring the company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco's results in the latest quarter exceeded the consensus  
estimate of 39 cents from analysts polled by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income, which reflects $38 million in charges related in  
part to the company's separation from DuPont, totaled $223 million 
for the latest quarter, up 19 percent from $118 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 24 percent to $7.49 billion from $6.02 billion a  
year ago on a pro forma basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco faced a situation similar to that at other oil companies  
during the quarter -- higher crude oil prices gave it increased 
exploration and production earnings, but competitive pricing 
pressures in the market for refined products held back earnings in 
that side of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported a 114 percent increase in exploration and  
production earnings, to $252 million from $118 million last year. 
International results were especially strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Refining and marketing profits fell 16 percent to $96 million  
from $114 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco's stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $27 Wednesday on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Conoco had earnings  
before one-time items of $458 million, or 72 cents a share, down 
from $584 million, or 92 cents a share, on a pro forma basis for 
the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings came to $420 million, or 66 cents a share, down  
from $610 million, or 96 cents a share, on a pro forma basis for 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $19.15 billion, up from $17.46 billion.

<HEADLINE> Players Deal With Stewart's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The courtesy car set aside for Payne Stewart is  
parked in his spot at Champions Golf Club in front nine bouquets 
and a pair of red roses tied to his nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh came to the end of a long and strangely silent day  
at a tournament that usually is one of the most festive on the PGA 
Tour. He put his clubs in a car parked next to the unused vehicle 
belonging to Stewart, then stared at some of the messages attached 
to the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a word, Singh seemed to echo what Tiger Woods quietly  
said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe he's not going to be here,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's memory was a driving force Tuesday. Walking the  
fairways while playing with four amateurs, Woods said he saw 
flashes of Stewart. Phil Mickelson saw a picture of the U.S. Open 
champion on a Jumbotron next to the driving range and stopped to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after Stewart was among five people killed when a Lear  
jet soared uncontrolled across the heartland of America before 
crashing in South Dakota, the 22 players who showed up at Champions 
tried to seek therapy by playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, this would have been a glorious day.  
The sun was shining bright in a blue sky, the breeze barely a 
trace. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dreary day,'' said John Huston, summing up a somber mood as  
the players tried to cope with the shocking death of the 
42-year-old Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags were at half-staff. Smiles were hard to find.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods felt a void when he watched the developments unfold on  
television Monday. It hit him even harder when he flew to Houston 
that night and picked up the pro-am pairing. 
</P>
<P>
	His tee time was 9 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	The slot below, which once held Stewart's name, was blank.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was a rude awakening,'' Woods said. ``You think that  
hopefully it was a bad dream, a nightmare ... but unfortunately, it 
came true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service for Stewart will be at 11 a.m. Friday at the  
First Baptist Church of Orlando, Fla. The PGA Tour altered the 
schedule to give players a chance to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship will begin with 27 holes on Thursday, have  
another 27 holes on Saturday and conclude Sunday with an 18-hole 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament should go on,'' Woods said. ``But obviously,  
it's not going to be an easy week. It's going to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It clearly wasn't an easy day.  
</P>
<P>
	While the pro-am was canceled, 22 players kept their date with  
four amateur partners. It was a form of therapy for some, although 
they played with no emotion and even less focus. Stewart, his quick 
wit, loose swing and colorful knickers, was never far from their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just a matter of dealing with it and coming to the peace  
and understand that he is in a better place right now,'' Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship is one of the best events of the year, a  
festive atmosphere for the top 30 players on the money list. While 
Champions is only a mile from one of the busiest thoroughfares in 
Houston, the silence was spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was really asking for autographs or clamoring for  
pictures,'' Woods said. ``Nobody was talking. It was very eerie. 
This golf tournament ... it doesn't have the same emphasis as it 
once did, and rightfully so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who hadn't arrived was Davis Love III, whose father  
was killed in a plane crash in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our entire family knows the grief the Stewart family is  
enduring,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, who finished one stroke behind Stewart in the U.S.  
Open, showed up before dawn for morning television shows and 
returned to the course in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this to happen at the height of his career, and really the  
height of his life, is difficult to accept,'' Mickelson said. ``I 
haven't really thought about the tournament this week or playing. 
It's just a real somber mood here. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as golf is concerned, it really takes a seat on the  
back burner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will not be replaced in the field.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who won for the sixth time this year at Disney World on  
Sunday, has a chance to surpass $6 million if he wins the next two 
tournaments, although that was not even a consideration on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be paired with David Duval, No. 2 on the money list, for  
the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Big deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be difficult to be focused on what you're  
doing,'' Duval said. ``I don't know how spectacular the golf will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was among a dozen or so players at Champions on Monday for  
a practice round. Mike Hicks, Stewart's caddie, was stepping off 
the yardage on the course when he was summoned to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think today was any easier, but yesterday was the  
worst part about it all,'' Duval said. ``I think today was just 
trying to get a grasp of it being real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flags were a constant reminder how real it was. If that  
wasn't enough, PGA Tour officials were making black ribbons for 
players and caddies to wear as a tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to think about playing a tournament,'' Huston said.  
``It doesn't seem worth it.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Fights Raging on Capitol Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders are bowing to pressure and  
including congressional salaries in their proposed across-the-board 
budget cuts. But they are still hunting the votes they need to push 
the plan through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders decided Tuesday to include lawmakers' pay in the  
reductions after rank-and-file Republicans, President Clinton and 
radio talk-show hosts chided them for not doing so. They now want 
agencies' budgets cut 1 percent, savings they say can come from 
paring federal waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican members of Congress believe that the government can  
find a penny on the dollar in waste, fraud and abuse'' to avoid 
spending Social Security surpluses, said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. ``They also believe that they can set an example by 
shaving back their own pay by the same percentage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers decided last summer to boost their pay next January by  
3.4 percent to $141,300, a $4,600 raise. With the 1 percent 
reduction, their salary would rise to $139,900. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear, however, whether legislators' salaries will ever  
be affected. President Clinton has promised to reject the GOP's 
across-the-board spending reduction, arguing it would be too 
damaging to defense, education and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will veto the across-the-board cut they've  
proposed,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Applying the reduction to lawmakers' pay would save less than $1  
million, a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars in dispute 
between Clinton and Congress in their budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Republicans arguing that federal agencies could afford  
to trim waste from their budgets, their initial exclusion of 
lawmakers' pay had caused them a public relations headache. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry was that unless legislators' salaries were included,  
labor unions might run advertisements contrasting that with the 
GOP's reluctance so far this year to raise the minimum wage, said 
John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had been pushing a 1.4 percent reduction in federal  
agencies' spending, a cut that would not affect automatic benefits 
such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On Tuesday, they 
were planning to drop that to a 1 percent cut in hopes of picking 
up support from lawmakers unhappy over reductions to defense and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said they had not originally included lawmakers' pay  
in the across-the-board cut because money for their salaries is not 
controlled by the spending bills that finance agency budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders were having other problems in the struggle to  
push their plan through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., was  
demanding that the across-the-board cut not apply to highway 
programs, and other lawmakers were said to be seeking exemptions 
for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working it, just like anything else,'' said House  
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House GOP's top vote counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to attach the cuts to a $314 billion measure  
financing labor, health and education programs, the biggest and 
last of the 13 annual spending bills for the new fiscal year, which 
began Oct. 1. Also affixed to the bill will be the District of 
Columbia's budget after Clinton vetoed an earlier version. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the bill exceeds Clinton's overall demands for education  
spending, the president plans to veto it because of the 
across-the-board cuts and because it provides little of the $1.4 
billion he wants for hiring new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, eight of the 13 spending bills for fiscal 2000 have  
become law. Clinton has vetoed three and has yet to act on two 
others.

<HEADLINE> Les Nubians Bring Afropean Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's no sibling rivalry between Helene and  
Celia Faussart, who perform as the African-French duo Les Nubians. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview, younger sister Celia can't get the lid off  
a bottle of ketchup. She doesn't stop talking, she just hands the 
bottle to Helene, who opens it and hands it back. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters talk to one another as much as to the questioner,  
reaching out to touch each other's arms when making a point. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean these ``no quibbling'' siblings don't have  
an occasional disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sisters, of course,'' Helene explained.  
</P>
<P>
	But ``we're pretty similar, that's why we manage to do an album  
together and to have a group,'' said Celia. ``If we were always 
fighting for everything, it would be impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They began performing professionally about five years ago and  
have gained a dedicated following in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Les Nubians combine the hip-hop soul sensibilities of Lauryn  
Hill and Erykah Badu with the world rhythms that reflect their 
international upbringing in Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	They are currently on tour, playing to capacity audiences at  
clubs across the United States. It doesn't seem to matter to their 
American fans that most of the songs on their album, ``Princesses 
Nubiennes,'' are sung in French. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are saying that `We don't know what they're  
saying but we can feel what they're saying,''' Helene, 25, said. 
``They can definitely love the music, the voices, the 
arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second album is under way. The English-language version of  
``Makeda,'' the first single off their album, didn't sell well, so 
they don't feel any push to sing in English. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we are in a position where we can be competitive  
in front of Lauryn, Erykah or whatever,'' Helene said of recording 
in English. ``It's their language. I can't write in English as 
easily as I'm going to do it in French.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helene and Celia, 21, were born in France. Their father is  
French and their mother is Cameroonian. The family moved to Chad 
when Helene was 10 and Celia was 6. When they returned to France 
several years later, they were shocked by the level of ignorance 
people showed about Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were asking me, `In Africa you were living in a  
tree?''' Helene recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The racism toward people of color in France was hurtful to the  
sisters. When reminiscing about France, their father had always 
described his homeland as a country of equality and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say in France, `People are educated, people are  
civilized,' and when I see how they are `civilized,' it makes me 
wonder `where are we going?''' Celia said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Makeda'' is about the Queen of Sheba. It deals with the  
misrepresentation of history, especially the history of the African 
continent. Other songs on the album touch on their mother's village 
in Africa, dealing with the aftermath of an abortion, and there's 
even a remake of Sade's ``Sweetest Taboo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to do music that really looks like us, with our  
personalities, our influences, our experiences. ... We wanted to do 
music that was really moving our souls and our hearts,'' Helene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helene does much of the composing and Celia does much of the  
vocal arrangements. They write their songs either separately or as 
a duo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty (much) in symbiosis,'' said Helene when asked if  
she pulled rank when musical disputes arose. She started to 
elaborate, but stopped when she saw the look on Celia's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``What?'' she asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saying it's true, that sometimes being an older sister,  
you do that,'' Celia responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Does she listen to what her sister has to say?  
</P>
<P>
	``It really depends, sometimes,'' Celia said. ``Sometimes we  
discuss a lot and then I realize I was wrong. ... She cannot be 
right every time, I must be right sometimes, but sometimes I'm 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being together on the road helps them deal with the pressures of  
the music industry and avoid getting caught up in their hype, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are never alone,'' Helene said. ``If your head gets  
bigger, the other one is here to say `calm down.''' 
</P>
<P>
	After this current schedule of shows ends, the sisters will  
return to Europe for more performances and then perhaps tour 
Africa. They plan to be back in the United States by the end of the 
year.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 11.71 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as the  
continuing watch over inflation kept most investors from making any 
big commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 11.71 at 10,313.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 0.43 at 1,282.34, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 25.90 at 2,785.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a short-lived lift from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured 
goods fell 1.3 percent in September, the first decline in five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was sharper than many analysts had expected, and  
offered some indication that the pace of U.S. economic growth may 
be tapering off. Stocks have stumbled in recent weeks amid worries 
that the economy is growing fast enough to convince the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates would slow economic growth by making it more  
expensive to borrow money to finance growth. They could also hurt 
stocks, however, by cutting into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks hovered in a narrow range as investors awaited two pieces  
of economic data viewed as better gauges of inflation. On Thursday, 
the government will report on the employment cost index and the 
gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay fell 11 9/16 to 140 7/16. The company  
said after the close of trading Tuesday its quarterly operating 
profits rose, beating analysts' expectations, after it signed up a 
record number of new users and expanded its offerings. But the 
company's profit margin slipped, which caught some investors by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer rose 5/8 to 20 1/8 after reporting earnings of $117  
million, or 7 cents a share in the recent quarter. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected Compaq to earn 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 108.48 million 
shares, behind Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.22 to 415.57.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.6 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.3 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> McCain Gaining in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Told that a New Hampshire voter had just  
attended his fifth John McCain town meeting, the Republican 
presidential candidate said: ``There is one thing about New 
Hampshire that I've always believed and now I'm totally sure: They 
want to see you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, chuckling, ``Although it may also be testimony to my  
inability to close the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laughing aside, McCain's attention to the nation's first primary  
state appears to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	A Research 2000 survey released last weekend by the Concord  
Monitor showed Texas Gov. George W. Bush retaining his front-runner 
status with 39 percent of the vote, but McCain in a solid second 
place with 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll confirmed a steady upward creep since August, when Bush  
had 45 percent of the vote and McCain had just 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Hampshire poll released last Thursday showed Bush with 42  
percent of the vote and McCain with 26 percent. That was virtually 
unchanged for Bush since August, but a 10-point improvement for 
McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark Hubbard, a political science professor at the University  
of New Hampshire, said would-be voters undoubtedly like the Arizona 
senator's personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got an image of being a Republican iconoclast, a party  
maverick. That's the kind of politician that the voters want to 
hear from,'' Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Vavreck, an assistant government professor at Dartmouth  
College, said McCain's numbers have crept upward simply because 
more people have gotten to know him. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator, the descendant of Navy admirals and a former  
prisoner of war, has been riding a wave of publicity since the 
release of his memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is just a natural thing,'' Vavreck said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, McCain's improvement has set off alarm bells within  
the Bush organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers concede privately there is a perception that the  
governor is being handled too much and needs to get out in public 
more, especially in early voting states like New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has decided to skip the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 and  
focus on the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary. Bush aides are concerned 
that a strong showing by McCain there, coupled with a strong finish 
South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary, where McCain also is 
concentrating, could propel him into a slugfest with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also concern that Bush has been distracted by  
fund-raising as he has generated $57 million for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the governor visited Massachusetts Sept 26 to  
attend the Ryder Cup golf tournament -- and a fund-raiser. On Sept. 
29, he visited Riverside, Calif. -- and attended a fund-raiser. 
Neither state holds its primary until March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's lack of attention to New Hampshire has been publicly  
criticized state Republican party activists and would-be voters 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like so far the publicity is selling him to us,'' said  
Volker Bradley, 62, a doctor from Newport, N.H., as he waited for 
Bush to appear last week at a town diner called the Country 
Kitchen.

	Bush's visit to Newport and Keene, N.H., was just his fifth trip  
to the state this year. He has spent less time campaigning in New 
Hampshire than all his rivals except Sen. Orrin Hatch, who recently 
scored a zero in a public opinion poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's opponents lambasted him for leaving New Hampshire last  
Friday just hours before they gathered for their first debate in 
Durham, N.H. He also will miss a debate Thursday in Manchester, 
N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with reporters after visiting the restaurant and  
shaking hands for over an hour at the Newport fire house, Bush 
explained that he was missing the debates because of prior 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's debate conflicted with a party fund-raiser in  
Vermont; this week's conflicts with a ceremony in which Bush's 
wife, Laura, will receive an alumni award from Southern Methodist 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he should be judged on the quality of his visits, not  
the quantity. He spoke about the size of his crowds and the 
personal attention he paid to everyone attending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that frequency of visits are important,  
and I'll be here a lot, but as importantly is, how many people have 
I seen and what kind of organization do we have, and we're really 
well organized,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a state that sends messages all the time, and I'm  
going to work hard to make sure it doesn't send a message to me,'' 
Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Letters Threaten Primate Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Dozens of researchers working on monkeys  
at universities across the country received threatening letters 
booby-trapped with razor blades, and an animal rights group claimed 
responsibility on an Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no reports of injuries Wednesday, but FBI  
investigators were warning scientists to take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	The group ``Justice Department,'' believed to be based in  
Britain, claimed it sent letters to more than 80 scientists at 
schools including Tulane University in New Orleans, Emory 
University in Atlanta and state universities in California, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A typewritten letter sent to one Harvard University researcher  
said: ``You have been targeted and you have until autumn of 2000 to 
release all your primate captives and get out of the vivisection 
industry. If you do not heed our warning, your violence will be 
turned back upon you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A list of its intended targets was discovered on the Web site  
over the weekend by a watchdog group, which notified the targeted 
schools. It was unclear how many letters were opened. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six Harvard researchers received booby-trapped letters,  
as did six at Emory, four at the University of Wisconsin, four at 
the University of Washington, four in the state of Oregon, and 
three at the University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's immoral, it's uncivilized,'' said Kevin Smith, vice  
chancellor of research at the University of California at Davis. 
``It's terrorism from people who say, `We value life -- but if you 
don't stop, we'll kill you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The blades were concealed in plain white envelopes bearing Las  
Vegas postmarks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The razor blades were inside the top flap so that if you were  
to run your finger through the envelope the way most people do, you 
would have been cut,'' said Dr. Peter Gerone of the Delta Regional 
Primate Center in Covington, La., whose secretary used a letter 
opener to open the rigged envelope Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of what they've (scientists) accomplished is very good,''  
said psychology professor Gene Sackett, who does behavioral 
research with macaque monkeys at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the treatment of animals in labs had improved and with  
the advent of genetic medicine, primate research will become even 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
	``With genetic approaches to everything from cancer to behavior,  
the safety of these things have got to be tested on primates,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fact sheet on an animal rights Web site claims the group has  
carried out attacks in Britain, Canada and British Columbia, 
including sending out envelopes with ``rat poison covered razor 
blades'' to hunting guides.

<HEADLINE> Galapagos Film Shows Islands in 3-D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new look at the exotic Galapagos Islands  
brings viewers face to face with wildlife and lets them swim with 
the fishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Galapagos,'' an IMAX giant-screen movie in 3-D, opens today at  
the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-produced by the Smithsonian and the IMAX Corp., the film uses  
real scientists on screen -- showing their joy of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	And discover they did, squeezing in enough research to identify  
more than a dozen new marine species during the 14 weeks of 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 3-D technology places viewers in a school of fish,  
brings them face to face with a moray eel and close to hammerhead 
sharks. And on land, lizards leer at the camera while tortoises 
ramble on past, seeming oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a fish scooped up by researchers with an  
underwater vacuum opens its mouth wide in seeming surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Star of the film is marine biologist Carole Baldwin, the camera  
following her first visit to the strange islands that inspired 
Charles Darwin to develop his theory of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was chosen because I had never been there, and they  
wanted a scientist with fresh eyes, someone the audience could 
follow,'' she said in an interview. ``It was fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing missing in the theater is the cold and wet,''  
she said. ``Otherwise, you're there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Baldwin didn't settle for just making a movie.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was science,'' she said. ``The filmmaker's goal was  
certainly to make a film. The film was being funded by the 
Smithsonian Institution and IMAX, so the idea was to make the film 
about research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists, now back at the museum, must take each of their  
new finds and compare it with thousands of others in the 
Smithsonian collection to verify it was not previously known. 
Baldwin estimated that there were ``dozens'' of new finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used a submersible vessel to study the largely  
unexplored waters 200 feet to 1,000 feet deep. The area is too deep 
for scuba diving, and previous studies using submersibles 
concentrated on deeper waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and film crews stayed 14 weeks in the Galapagos with  
the only two IMAX 3-D cameras in the world. They visited more than 
80 locations, including dives in the four-person submersible. 
</P>
<P>
	The new species found, including a new cat shark, several new  
scorpion fish, new types of bass and new types of sponges, urchins 
and gastropod mollusks, will be added to the Natural History 
Museum's 8 million-specimen collection of preserved fish. They also 
will be added to the collections of the Charles Darwin Research 
Station in the Galapagos, the California Academy of Sciences and 
the Ecuadorian Navy Oceanographic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Located on the equator 600 miles west of South America, the  
Galapagos have been called the laboratory of evolution because of 
its strange plants and animals. The islands are owned by Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	The new film will alternate with other films at the museum's  
IMAX theater. Admission is free. Later, it will tour other IMAX 
theaters around the world.

<HEADLINE> Burn 3, Fire 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Burn overcame a two-goal deficit  
Wednesday night and advanced to the Western Conference finals with 
a 3-2 victory over the defending MLS champion Chicago Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burn won the final game of the best-of-3 series and advance  
to the best-of-3 conference finals at Los Angeles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire took a 2-0 lead in the game's opening five minutes on  
goals by Ante Razov and Jesse Marsch. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas finally got on the board in the 55th minute on a header  
by Chad Deering. The Burn tied it in the 84th minute on a penalty 
kick goal by Jorge Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Striker Ariel Graziani got the game-winner two minutes later  
when he converted a penalty kick after Chicago defender C.J. Brown 
was called for handling the ball inside the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Zach Thornton made eight saves while Mark Dodd had  
four. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 10 games this season the Burn won after  
allowing the first goal of the game, but they improved to 16-0 when 
scoring at least two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the third straight year the Burn and Galaxy have  
met in the playoffs. Dallas swept in 1997 and Los Angeles returned 
the favor last year.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Plan Falls Apart in Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves had a plan to make this a  
competitive World Series. The hitters had to be more patient. Tom 
Glavine had to come through with seven solid innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything was going just as they hoped in Game 3 Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Until it all fell apart.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Braves find themselves all but buried in a 3-0 hole, as  
the New York Yankees rallied from a 5-1 deficit to beat Atlanta 6-5 
on Chad Curtis' 10th-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game was ours to win,'' Glavine moaned.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Braves are one loss from spending the offseason  
trying to figure out how they came up short once again, a decade of 
excellence impaired by only one World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a big one to lose,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``We  
were going to get back in this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a lost weekend at Turner Field, in which Atlanta managed  
only seven hits and three runs in two dreary losses, the Braves 
spent their day off taking some extra batting practice at Yankee 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It paid off. Every starter had at least one hit, including three  
straight doubles by Bret Boone, who just happened to be one of 
three players benched for Game 2 in a futile attempt to jumpstart 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a page from New York, the Braves kept working the count  
to three balls and hitting toward the opposite field. By the fourth 
inning, they had knocked out New York starter Andy Pettitte. At the 
end, they had 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were patient and driving the ball the other way,'' Brian  
Jordan said. ``That's what you have to do with Andy Pettitte.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves left eight runners on base through the first five  
innings, but it didn't seem all that important with Glavine 
producing a gutsy effort that belied his fragile health. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander was supposed to start Game 1, but wound up  
watching from bed with a debilitating case of stomach flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The bug knocked seven pounds off Glavine's slender frame, and he  
was still a few pounds short when he walked to the mound three days 
later than expected. At least some of the color had returned to his 
face, a ghastly shade of pale just a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt fine,'' Glavine said. ``I felt better than I probably  
anticipated and felt sharper than I anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Cox expressed confidence that his pitcher  
could come through with seven solid innings. Then, presumably, the 
game would be turned over to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine walked off the mound at the prescribed moment with a 5-3  
lead. Unfortunately for the Braves, Cox sent his starter back to 
the mound for the eighth, convinced he could last one more inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Two batters later, the two-run cushion was gone, wiped out by  
Joe Girardi's single and Chuck Knoblauch's two-run homer that 
barely cleared the 314-foot sign down the right-field line and 
deflected off the glove of leaping Brian Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tommy Glavine was throwing great tonight,'' Cox said,  
defending his decision. ``I know everybody's going to ask why I 
left him in, this and that, but Tommy was throwing great. He didn't 
want to come out of the game. I asked him if he was tired and he 
said no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine threw only 77 pitches, which turned out to be one too  
many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight was bad luck,'' he said. ``A 315-foot pop-up turns  
into a home run. That ball is not a home run anywhere but here. 
They took advantage of it and we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two innings later, Curtis put the Braves out of their misery  
with his second homer of the game, a mammoth shot on the third 
pitch from reliever Mike Remlinger. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing a couple of fastballs, Remlinger tried to fool  
Curtis with a changeup. But the pitch hung over the plate and 
didn't come down until it landed in the Atlanta bullpen, more than 
430 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no better situation to throw a changeup,'' Remlinger  
said. ``But it didn't have the down action I wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis was carried off on the shoulders of his teammates, while  
the Braves trudged off the field with Frank Sinatra's rendition of 
``New York, New York'' and chants of ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!'' 
ringing in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't part of the plan. No team has ever rallied from an  
0-3 deficit in a best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, do we want to go home or do we want to face the  
challenge,'' Remlinger asked. ``Do we want to fight or fold? Do we 
want to lose four in a row or do we want to put up a fight? It's a 
similar situation to where the Mets were, and they showed a lot of 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to the NL Championship Series, when New York's  
other team lost the first three games to Atlanta, then rallied for 
two thrilling victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it must be noted that the Mets lost the series in  
Game 6. Still, the Braves would gladly take their chances if they 
could get back to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cites Iraqi Rights Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department cited nine ``major''  
instances of severe rights abuses by Iraqi authorities Wednesday 
and said individual responsibility is shared by President Saddam 
Hussein and his two sons, among others. The department is trying to 
gain support for bringing charges against Iraq before an 
international war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saddam's internal war against his political opponents is of a  
character that begs for description as crimes against humanity,'' 
said David Scheffer, the State Department's ambassador-at-large for 
war crimes issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a gathering at the Carnegie Endowment for  
International Peace, Scheffer acknowledged that some key countries 
seem more interested in broadening relationships with Baghdad than 
holding Saddam and his allies accountable for ``nine major criminal 
episodes'' that have occurred under his rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Scheffer did not identify any countries by name,  
France, Russia and China, all U.N. Security Council members, have 
been at odds for years with U.S. efforts to tame the Iraqi regime. 
Britain is the only council member to stand with the United States 
on the Iraq issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before any government entertains further thoughts about deeper  
relations with the Iraqi regime, the factual record of this 
criminal enterprise needs to be fully appreciated,'' Scheffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the activities worthy of an international tribunal's  
attention, Scheffer cited the alleged crimes against the Iraqi Kurd 
population in the north and the Iraqi Shiites in the south since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the atrocities against the Shiites are being carried out  
``with a ferocity that is as widespread, albeit over a longer 
period of time, as that waged by (Yugoslav President Slobodan) 
Milosevic's goons against the Kosovar Albanians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the nine alleged abuses, Scheffer cited Iraq's use of  
poison gas against Iraqi Kurds in 1988 and against Iran during the 
1980-88 Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a ``small number of associates'' share with Saddam  
responsibility for Iraq's criminal activities for the better part 
of two decades. He cited Ali Hassan-al-Majid, who became known as 
``Chemical Ali'' for his use of poison gas against Iraqis and 
Iranians toward the end of the 1980s, Scheffer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer also mentioned as accomplices Saddam's sons, Qusay,  
head of the Special Security Organization; and Uday, commander of a 
paramilitary organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reagan administration paid little heed to Iraq's use of  
poison gas against Iraqi Kurds living in Halabja in 1988, an attack 
that killed an estimated 5,000 people. At the time, the 
administration was backing Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War because Iraq 
was considered the lesser of two evils. Washington had full 
diplomatic relations with Baghdad and also maintained a food aid 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin took issue  
with statements by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said the 
United States is blocking delivery to Iraq of goods that could help 
ease the suffering of ordinary Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the U.N. Security Council circulated Monday, he  
said the number of holds on contracts has continued to increase in 
the past two months -- to 572 contracts worth about $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said 95 percent of all contracts have been approved. As  
for the remainder, Rubin said U.S. officials had questions about 
whether the items sought by the Iraqis were in the category of 
humanitarian relief -- as is required by the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than criticize Annan directly, Rubin said he was ``badly  
advised'' by his staff.

<HEADLINE> Smith Makes Overtures Toward GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who bid the  
Republican Party a scathing farewell last July, has made numerous 
overtures about returning to the GOP fold after barely 100 days as 
an independent, congressional officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
Smith's gestures include attendance at a party fund-raising dinner 
and conversations with senior Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	These overtures began well before Sen. John Chafee's unexpected  
death Sunday, these officials say. But the process appears to be 
accelerating because the Rhode Island Republican's death created a 
vacancy at the head of the Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee -- a chairmanship Smith is eager to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith declined comment on his plans earlier in the week, telling  
a reporter it was ``not appropriate'' to discuss political issues 
until after Chafee's funeral this weekend. However, he did not deny 
considering a return to the GOP, saying, ``I'm just not going to 
say anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma is currently in line to ascend to  
the chairmanship, holding the greatest seniority among the panel's 
GOP members. But several sources, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Smith wants to retain his seniority rights if he 
returns to the GOP, a move that would allow him to take the 
chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans have publicly maintained that the issue won't  
be addressed until after Chafee's funeral services, sources said 
Smith and Inhofe participated in a discussion of the chairmanship 
issue at a closed-door meeting of several conservative Republican 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, an unflinching conservative who had been seeking the GOP  
presidential nomination, quit the party in July with a blast of 
vitriol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the revolution on issues. We won the revolution on  
principle,'' he said in a Senate speech that retraced Ronald 
Reagan's rise to power and the GOP takeover of the House and Senate 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the desire to stay in power caused us to start listening  
to the pollsters and the consultants again, who were telling us for 
some inexplicable reason that we need to walk away from issues.... 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my party to stand for something,'' he said, contending  
that Republicans routinely ignored their own party platform on 
issues as diverse as abortion, foreign policy and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said then that he would seek the presidential nomination  
of a third party. But shortly thereafter, his wife became ill. His 
presidential campaign has been invisible for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading up to Smith's announcement, a string of GOP  
leaders criticized him. Jim Nicholson, the Republican National 
Committee chairman, wrote Smith a letter that called the defection 
a ``serious mistake for you personally, with only a marginal 
political impact -- and a counterproductive one at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's petty and it's vindictive and it's insulting,'' Smith  
said of Nicholson's missive when he announced his switch in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, though, Republican officials have said Smith  
has talked with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi 
and other senior GOP lawmakers about a return to the Republican 
Party. He also has spoken with Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he attended GOP fund-raising events in his home  
state and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Derrick Coleman Arrested for DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets power forward Derrick  
Coleman was arrested early today for driving while under the 
influence after the car he was driving collided with a 
tractor-trailer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, Hornets backup guard Eldridge Recasner and a third  
passenger in Coleman's vehicle, Ebony Kimbrough, were injured in 
the accident which occurred at 12:51 a.m. and taken to Carolinas 
Medical Center, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police spokesman Tom Barry 
said. The truck driver was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	After being booked at the Charlotte jail for DWI, Coleman was  
taken to the medical center, where Recasner also was a patient. 
Officials at the center referred calls on the players' conditions 
to the Hornets, where a spokesman said he would release information 
later today. Kimbrough was in fair condition, center spokesman 
Scott White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, a nine-year pro signed by the Hornets last year, has  
averaged 12.2 points, 6.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists in six 
exhibition games. Last season, he was limited to 37 games because 
of foot and ankle problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, Coleman was accused of urinating in front of patrons  
at a downtown Detroit restaurant and charged with disorderly 
conduct. Coleman denied any wrongdoing, saying he spilled a drink 
on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He also faces a civil lawsuit in Michigan in which he is accused  
of trespassing and battery at a Detroit woman's home in 1997. 
Coleman's attorney in that case has said the allegation is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Coleman was arrested and charged with refusing to move  
his truck and swearing at a police officer in Detroit. The jury 
failed to reach a verdict and the case ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Recasner was signed by the Hornets as a free agent last January.

<P>
	Nebraska's whining, Alabama and Texas A&AMP;M are wincing and  
Michigan is still wondering what happened. Such is the state of 
last week's high-profile losers as they prepare to rebound on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth-ranked Cornhuskers (6-1), their coach Frank Solich  
yapping over poor officiating after his team's 24-20 loss at Texas, 
should have an easy time winning again when they visit Kansas 
(3-5). The Huskers have won 30 in a row against the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather not comment on officiating,'' Solich said a few  
days after using the words ``horrendous'' and ``ridiculous'' to 
describe two decisions that went against his team. ``It appears 
I've done quite a bit in the last two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 14th-ranked Crimson Tide (5-2), 21-7 losers to Tennessee  
last week, play No. 20 Southern Mississippi (5-2), but their two 
stars, running back Shaun Alexander and quarterback Andrew Zow, 
have sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike DuBose listed both players as doubtful, but both have  
been running in practice and said they expect to play. Alexander 
leads the nation in all-purpose yards with 198 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M (5-2) is not only trying to wipe out memories  
of a 51-6 loss to Oklahoma when it plays host to Oklahoma State 
(3-3), but quarterback Randy McCown might miss the game with a 
separated left shoulder (non-throwing arm). McCown has thrown for 
1,659 yards and 10 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	His backup is Mark Farris, a 24-year-old freshman who played  
minor league baseball in the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization. 
Farris is 6-of-16 for 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's No. 15 Michigan, 5-2 after consecutive losses  
to Michigan State and Illinois. The Wolverines are at Indiana (4-4) 
following their shocking 35-29 loss to the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was a heavy hit for Michigan.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have people around your team in leadership roles who  
have great pride in who they are and what they want to achieve,'' 
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said, ``I think that's the key to being 
able to bounce back from adversity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, HokieHysteria is back on Saturday, when No. 3 Virginia  
Tech visits Pittsburgh 4-3). The Hokies (6-0) did not play last 
week, and have had two weeks to watch and read about how good they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers are coming off a 38-15 win over Rutgers, a game in  
which David Priestley threw for 375 yards and four TDs.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Skip Over Some Realities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore declared Wednesday that  
he has high standards in campaign fund-raising but neglected to 
mention the controversy he got into over money and politics in the 
1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, rival Bill Bradley projected ``enormous savings''  
in administrative costs from his health care plan -- savings that 
analysts say he may be hard-pressed to find. 
</P>
<P>
	The rivals for the Democratic nomination did not appear to make  
any major mistakes in their Wednesday night debate in Hanover, N.H. 
But they skipped over some uncomfortable realities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore attacked Bradley for supporting school vouchers that would  
use tax money to send children to private schools. ``That's one 
area where we disagree,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley has not endorsed school vouchers. He says he doesn't  
think they are the answer to the problems of public education, but 
is awaiting results from a few experimental voucher programs. He 
had voted in the Senate for some pilot projects using school 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator, under attack from Gore for his  
plan to expand health insurance to all children and many more 
adults, estimated the cost at $65 billion a year, to come largely 
from the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said huge savings would be achieved by program  
efficiencies and transferring paperwork to the Internet. He 
estimated administrative costs in health care at $250 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implication that there is a lot of that to save is one  
that is questionable,'' said Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the 
Annenberg School of Communication, who is tracking the candidates 
on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Health reformers often talk of saving money by cutting waste,  
she said. ``But when people start looking at that, they don't find 
(that much) waste, fraud and abuse to eliminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley used the $250 billion figure before -- in a Sept. 28  
health care speech, but said then that figure included more than 
just administrative overhead, such as redundant tests and 
unnecessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamieson also found rhetorical excess in Gore's accusation that  
Bradley would ``shred the safety net'' by using up the budget 
surplus with his social spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's overstatement,'' she said. Bradley's programs -- for  
health care, anti-poverty and more -- by definition are part of a 
safety net, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You haven't shredded the safety net. You've created an  
alternative safety net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used an Emory University report to suggest Bradley has  
underestimated his $65 billion-a-year health plan. Gore said the 
report showed Bradley's plan over 10 years would cost closer to 
$1.2 trillion and eat up the entire projected federal budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't mention the study was written by a former Clinton  
administration health-policy analyst, Kenneth Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, when his turn rolled around again, rose to dispute  
Gore's figure, saying he had his own analysts who put the costs of 
his plan much lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Gore said, ``I follow a higher standard in my  
campaign'' by refusing political action committee donations from 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	But he made no mention of his own fund-raising troubles during  
the 1996 election, when he played a key role raising Democratic 
money for Clinton's re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was forced to admit that he made fund-raising calls from  
his White House office despite federal laws barring fund-raising on 
federal property. He said his lawyers had advised him there was no 
illegality in his calls but said in hindsight he wished he hadn't 
made them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also was forced to belatedly acknowledge that he knew an  
event he attended at a Buddhist temple was a fund-raiser. He 
originally tried to portray it as a ``community outreach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors concluded that donations made at the event were  
illegal, but Gore was accused of no wrongdoing in either the temple 
event or the fund-raising calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the bottom line got lost in the proposals of both  
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley touted the likely effects of their health care  
reforms, often failing to note the improvements would be phased in 
over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Gore said his plan ``gives coverage to 100 percent  
of all children.'' He didn't note that universal access wouldn't be 
reached until 2005.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Refuse To Talk To NBC's Gray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC reporter Jim Gray apologized to baseball  
fans Tuesday night for his contentious interview with Pete Rose 
before Game 2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yankees weren't in a forgiving mood, refusing to talk to  
Gray after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans Sunday night after  
Gray's interview with Rose at Turner Field in Atlanta. It centered 
on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and came 
minutes after he returned to a major league field for the first 
time in 10 years as a member of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	During NBC's pregame show Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium, Gray  
spoke about the Rose interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of  
many baseball fans,'' Gray said. ``I thought that it was important 
to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment for him to make an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in doing so, the interview went on too long and took out  
some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to baseball 
fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gray approached Chad Curtis after the game to ask him about  
his game-winning home run in the 10th, the Yankees' left fielder 
made the team's feelings plain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of what happened with Pete, we decided not to say  
anything,'' Curtis told Gray on live television, adding a greeting 
for his grandmother before walking away. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray shouted after Curtis, ``Don't you want to talk about your  
home run?'' but Curtis did not turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a personal thing with me and Jim Gray,'' Curtis said  
later. ``It's a thing that the team decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what Pete did, I don't know whether he should be  
in the Hall of Fame or shouldn't be. All I know was that was a 
special day for Pete and some other people. He probably should have 
been able to just have an enjoyment of that celebration and not 
have to answer questions about other things, and it really upset 
some people. 
</P>
<P>
	``So as a team we decided to boycott talking to him on the  
field,'' Curtis said. ``If my teammates decide that, I'm going to 
honor it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its postgame report on CNBC, reporter Craig Sager, who had  
been covering the Braves' dugout, moved over to the Yankees' side 
of the field to ask the questions instead of Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC does not plan any changes in its coverage despite the  
boycott, said spokesman Ed Markey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Gray will be back tomorrow night in the Yankee dugout --  
same assignment as tonight,'' Markey said after Tuesday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey added that the network expected the Yankees will talk to  
Gray for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans seem willing to forgive Rose, speaking out in polls in  
favor of his reinstatement to baseball. He received the longest 
ovation of any baseball hero introduced Sunday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like this  
on such a festive occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Gray said his questions shouldn't have  
surprised Rose since other reporters asked the same things at a 
news conference shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, backed Gray by calling him  
``the best TV sports reporter of his generation.'' However, Ebersol 
said he thought the interview ``probably went too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his record 4,256 
hits for the hometown Reds.

<HEADLINE> Sony Profits Rise in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics powerhouse Sony Corp.'s profit  
rose 3.1 percent in the second fiscal quarter but plunged nearly 25 
percent for the first half, depressed by the strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The results disclosed today come as Sony faces a sluggish  
economy at home and a surging yen that threatens to damage exports 
by making Japanese products more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony earned 46.5 billion yen, or $445 million, in the three  
months ended Sept. 30 compared with 45.1 billion yen a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales and operating revenue fell 6.8 percent to 1.6 trillion  
yen, or $15.3 billion, for the quarter from 1.7 trillion yen a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong yen not only hurts exports, it also means that  
dollars and other currencies earned overseas are worth less when 
converted into the home currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the July-September quarter, for example, the yen averaged  
112.7 to the U.S. dollar -- 23.3 percent stronger than the same 
quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony estimated that if the yen had held steady, sales would have  
increased 9 percent and sales would have risen 25 percent in the 
July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This rise in the yen had a significant negative impact on the  
reported financial results translated into yen,'' Sony said in its 
earnings statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that sales in Sony's movie business decreased 19  
percent in the quarter. The second quarter got a boost from the Box 
Office success of ``Big Daddy' and ``Blue Streak'' but was hurt by 
``Muppets From Space'' and ``Jakob the Liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income from Sony's TV business, which is part of Sony  
Pictures, fell because of the loss of the sundication sales of 
``Seinfeld'' from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Sony Pictures would have been flat if the currency  
rate had remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, consolidated net profits plunged 24.5  
percent to 64.9 billion yen, or $607 million, compared to 86.1 
billion yen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales and operating revenue fell 7.6 percent to 3.1 trillion  
yen, or $29.1 billion in the first half from 3.4 trillion a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony is moving through a major transition. It announced in March  
that it would lay off 17,000 of its 170,000 workers and cut 
manufacturing plants from 70 to 55 during the next four years. Sony 
is trying to make computers and video games a bigger part of its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony expects group operating profit for the full year to be less  
than previously forecast. The company did not release an updated 
forecast on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong yen has prompted calls for the government to  
intervene, since many fear it could stifle Japan's recovery from 
its worst economic downturn in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar figures provided by Sony were based on a calculation  
from yen using an average dollar-yen exchange rate for the period.

<HEADLINE> Somber Mood at Southern Farm Bureau  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- While heavy hearts remain, there is still  
a job to do and plenty at stake for golfers in the Southern Farm 
Bureau Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's Billy Mayfair with a chance to make the World  
Championships next week, injured Skip Kendall trying to ensure a 
spot in next year's Masters or numerous players just trying to keep 
their Tour playing privileges, their attention Thursday will have 
to be focused on the opening round at Annandale Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe that Payne Stewart, the U.S. Open champion killed  
in a plane accident Monday, would want it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we get out there, you get into the grind and go,''  
Mayfair said Wednesday. ``Off the golf course, you are constantly 
reminded, you see the flag at half-mast, see it on television. But 
I know that Payne would want everything this week to continue and 
to run as smoothly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Tour Championship in Houston, the Southern Farm Bureau  
will begin play as scheduled Thursday and then suspend all 
activities Friday, the day Stewart's funeral will be held in 
Orlando, Fla. The Southern Farm will then be shortened to 54 holes 
in order for the event to end on Sunday as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfair is 49th in the World Golf Ranking, and likely needs a  
solid showing at Annandale to remain in the top 50 and be part of 
the field at Valderrama in Spain next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's obviously one of my goals being here,'' Mayfair said.  
``There are two or three guys here, two or three guys in Houston 
and a couple of guys in Europe who can knock me out. All I can do 
is just play the best I can here and hopefully be on a plane to 
Spain on Sunday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfair has had an up-and-down year, as evidenced by his last  
seven tournaments. He missed three cuts, but had four top-20 
finishes, including the last two weeks in Las Vegas and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mayfair is looking at more immediate goals, Kendall is  
hoping his sore back will heal enough for him to play Thursday. He 
withdrew from Wednesday's pro-am. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, a 12th-year pro who is 38th on the PGA Tour money list,  
wants to protect the top 40 ranking that will guarantee his first 
Masters tournament invitation next year. A victory in the Southern 
Farm Bureau Classic could even boost him into the top 30 and earn 
him spots in the other three majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Masters wasn't involved, I don't think I'd be here,''  
Kendall said. ``The top 30 is also a big incentive. That was a goal 
of mine at the beginning of the year, and I wanted to see if I 
could accomplish that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Magee, 41st on the money list, said the chance to qualify  
for the Masters is the only reason he is at Annandale. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why I'm here, the only reason,'' Magee said. ``It's a  
long year and I'd rather be home with my family, but I want that 
invitation to the Masters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For others, the goal is to avoid another trip to PGA Tour  
qualifying and be able to play in tournaments next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 131 golfers on the money list, based on a soft 125 that  
takes into account non-PGA Tour members such as Jose Maria Olazabal 
on the list, will retain their cards. Those between 132 and 150 on 
the list will have only limited playing privileges for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There definitely is added pressure, but you can only do the  
best you can,'' said Eric Booker, who is 125th on the money list. 
``I'm not out here just to keep my card, I'm preparing to win the 
tournament. If I win, everything else takes care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Booker, who played at Mississippi State, is among 31 players in  
the Southern Farm Bureau Classic currently ranked between 110 and 
150 on the money list. Thirty-five of the next 50 are also entered.

<HEADLINE> Business Leaders Back WTO Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite protests over the upcoming World Trade  
Organization meeting, labor leaders have joined with their 
corporate counterparts on a presidential advisory board to support 
the administration's trade agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of the 35 panelists declined to sign a letter backing  
Clinton's WTO strategy. But administration officials said the 
expression of support by the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy 
and Negotiations as a ``conceptual breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of compromise and acknowledgment of mutual interest  
has been long sought after,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky said in an interview Wednesday. ``This is the first time 
in six and one-half years that labor has not dissented from an 
ACTPN initiative, or that the business community has not 
dissented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, President Clinton and the leader of the European  
Commission met to discuss the trade talks. Officials said progress 
was made on areas of dispute such as the U.S. export of genetically 
altered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the commission president, Romano Prodi, agreed to  
high-level talks before year's end on biotechnology, and the United 
States is assisting the Europeans in creating an agency similar to 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sensitive subject,'' Prodi said. ``We need to  
give guarantees to our constituents that the scientific controls 
will be of the highest level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, led administration  
efforts to forge a strategy for the WTO ministerial talks, set to 
begin in late November in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders were pleased by the administration's call for a  
working group within the WTO to deal with issues such as worker 
rights and protections, which business leaders traditionally have 
tried to keep separate from trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Four groups, including the Consumers Union of America and the  
American Farm Bureau Federation, declined to sign the letter. But 
that did not dampen the administration's enthusiasm over the 
compromise between labor and business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where the most serious degree of conflict has existed  
over a marketization agenda,'' Barshefsky said. ``That gap has been 
bridged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, written by Procter &AMP; Gamble's John E. Pepper,  
chairman of the commission established by Congress and named by 
Clinton, was signed by, among others, Robert Shapiro of Monsanto 
Co., Curtis H. Barnette of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Thomas J. Donahue 
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and 
Jay Mazur, president of UNITE!, a New York-based labor union. 
</P>
<P>
	``While, not surprisingly, all of our members are not in  
agreement on every element of this agenda, a strong majority ... 
believe that the U.S. negotiating agenda as a whole is bold and 
appropriately comprehensive,'' said the letter, obtained by The 
Associated Press. ``We believe that if achieved, it will result in 
better jobs, higher living standards and increased economic 
opportunities for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thea Lee, a trade expert at the AFL-CIO, said that labor's  
endorsement of the administration's negotiating strategy should not 
be seen as an abandonment of labor's concerns about the WTO and its 
historical lack of consideration for labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of the ACTPN letter was broad support for many of  
the U.S. goals, including putting forward a working group on trade 
and labor,'' Lee said. ``We have a lot of other issues and we have 
a lot of critiques of the WTO that aren't changed by our signing 
onto the ACTPN letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with Prodi also yielded what Barshefsky said were  
``encouraging'' signs in the standoff between the United States and 
Europe over exports of beef and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be cautious here because we know these two issues  
are difficult for European policy,'' Barshefsky said. ``But there 
seems to be renewed vigor on the part of Europe to reach mutually 
agreeable solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has imposed punitive tariffs on more than $300  
million of European products in retaliation for the 15-nation 
European Union's refusal to abide by WTO decisions involving 
American beef and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodi and Clinton also agreed to coordinate efforts to get  
developing countries committed to the new round of international 
trade negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Priest Has TV Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Father Alberto Cutie seems like a  
normal Catholic priest. He loves his congregation, counsels young 
people, marries couples and baptizes babies. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also has lots in common with Jerry Springer, Oprah  
Winfrey and Ricki Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask the fans who mob him after he wraps up filming a  
segment of Telemundo's new TV talk show ``Padre Alberto.'' Cutie's 
a star in the making, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``A priest can give you a spirituality a psychologist can't,''  
said 58-year-old Carmen Torres, as she waits outside the studio of 
the Spanish-language network to get a photo snapped with the talk 
show priest. ``He is so cute, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cutie, who was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, of Cuban parents  
30 years ago, said he was minding his own business when a network 
producer asked him to audition for the job. Cutie (pronounced 
Coo'-Tee'-AY), a priest at St. Patrick's Church on Miami Beach, 
beat 500 others who tried out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never pictured myself to be involved in television,'' he  
said, laughing. ``God surprises you all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one-hour show is a round-table discussion between Cutie and  
his guests on subjects ranging from domestic abuse and racism to 
youth violence and family relations. Guests include kids, mothers, 
psychologists, Latin celebrities and victims of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is part confessional, part entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
	On a recent segment about teen violence, Alida Miranda brought  
her 17-year-old son, Jose, and asked Cutie for help. She said she 
was feeling desperate because she couldn't control her son. She 
feared he was a danger to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutie asked Jose why his mother felt this way. Jose admitted he  
stole things with his friends and sometimes carried a handgun. He 
said at times he felt like killing people. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we do in a case like this?'' a startled Cutie asked  
clinical sociologist Gloria Rodriguez, a guest expert on 
relationships between parents and kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The expert urged Jose to stop hanging around friends or  
acquaintances who were a bad influence. She encouraged Jose to try 
to work on his relationship with his mother by talking and 
listening instead of arguing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he is a good kid,'' Cutie told Jose's mother. ``If he  
really tries he can change his ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose promised Cutie he would try to be a better son and turn his  
life around. He started to cry. 
</P>
<P>
	Nely Galan, Telemundo's president of entertainment, was  
vacationing in Mexico last year when she got the idea to have a 
priest as host of a talk show about common issues and problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept thinking, 'What would I want to watch on TV? What would  
make me feel good?''' she said. ``I thought if I can find a priest 
to host a show it would be really great because they can guide you 
spiritually. It was not easy to convince people that a priest would 
work for a show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show airs Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. EDT and, according  
to Telemundo, can be seen in at least 240,000 households in 63 U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Galan said Telemundo tapped Cutie because he was young, funny,  
energetic and in touch with young people. 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent taping, Cutie was a lively host, getting the  
audience of about 100 pumped up by dancing the hokeypokey and 
telling them jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a talk show host, Cutie said he's not out to offend  
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the one thing that I am afraid of,'' he said. ``I am  
not going to sit down with someone and exploit their problems. We 
want to solve them. The program is about the human heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving the studio, Cutie walks across the studio floor  
and praises crew members. Outside, dozens of fans wait to greet 
him. After listening patiently, he heads to his church to prepare 
for a busy weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't half as busy as I am in the parish,'' said Cutie.  
``This is like the sideshow. The parish is the big show.'' 
</P>
<P>

	REAGAN ON `BIOGRAPHY': Anchor Harry Smith will interview Edmund  
Morris, the author of the controversial biography ``Dutch: A Memoir 
of Ronald Reagan,'' for Friday's ``Biography'' repeat of ``Ronald

his working-class childhood in Illinois, through his career as a 
Hollywood actor, to his two-term Presidency that helped define the 
legacy of the 1980s. The program, which includes interviews with Ed 
Meese, George Schultz, Michael Reagan and others, airs on A&AMP;E at 8

<HEADLINE> No Surprises for These Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Coaching in the NFL these days is  
sometimes like a poker game in which every player can see the 
others' cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaching lineage that extends from Bill Walsh's San  
Francisco 49ers staffs of the 1980s and early 1990s has become 
crisscrossed and tangled throughout the league. Coaches who worked 
together in San Francisco before going on to larger 
responsibilities run into each other on the field almost every week 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Holmgren, Ray Rhodes, Sherman Lewis, Steve Mariucci, Jon  
Gruden, George Seifert, Mike Shanahan and many others have taken 
the gospel of the West Coast offense and fanatical attention to 
detail throughout the nation in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes and Lewis, the Green Bay Packers' coach and offensive  
coordinator, realize they can't show Holmgren much he hasn't seen 
when the Packers play host to the Seattle Seahawks on Monday night. 
But they also know their former boss and colleague won't have that 
many cards up his own sleeve, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to trick each other,'' said Lewis,  
the Packers offensive coordinator under both Holmgren -- who left 
last January after seven seasons to become the Seahawks coach and 
GM -- and Rhodes, who was Holmgren's defensive coordinator for two 
seasons before head coaching stops in Philadelphia and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to come down to what team executes the best,''  
Lewis said. ``They know what we do and we know what they do. We'll 
just try and disguise it a little bit with formations, (but) I'm 
sure they know that, and I know it, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many coaches also have moved on since working under Holmgren in  
Green Bay, where they turned a perennially mediocre franchise into 
a Super Bowl champion. When something works, coaches tend to stick 
with it -- and now variations of the same offense that worked so 
well for the 49ers and the Packers are being used throughout the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at (the Seahawks) offense, it's a mirror of our  
offense,'' Rhodes said. ``You're dealing with a different cast, but 
it's a mirror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their preparations for Monday night's game, the Packers  
aren't trying to reinvent themselves. They simply hope better 
execution and quarterback Brett Favre make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got to win this football game,'' Favre said. ``I  
can't care less who's coming back. I love Mike to death, but that's 
the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers might have a slight edge in preparing for the  
Seahawks defense. Seattle defensive coordinator Jim Lind -- and the 
late Fritz Shurmur -- installed a system similar to the one they 
used while coaching under Holmgren in Green Bay, while the Packers 
have a largely new defense under coordinator Emmitt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren has spent twice as much time in the film room in  
Seattle this week, trying to help Lind devise a scheme to stop 
Lewis' offense. He also has been working on a game plan against 
Thomas' defense, which stopped the San Diego Chargers cold in Green 
Bay's 31-3 win last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a lot of talent on that coaching staff, and it's  
people who I know and respect very much,'' Holmgren said. ``It's 
going to be difficult to find ways of doing things that they 
haven't already thought of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And though the bonds of friendship also run deep through this  
coaching lineage, it won't affect what happens on the field. Rhodes 
and Gruden didn't take any hard feelings away from the Packers' 
victory over the Raiders earlier this season, and Rhodes and 
Holmgren will treat this game the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows each other very well, and when you know each  
other this way, it makes for an interesting ballgame,'' Rhodes 
said.

<HEADLINE> Doubts Arise in S.C. Death Row Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A woman's confession that she killed a  
state trooper has come days before a man is to be executed for that 
crime, but South Carolina's attorney general said Wednesday that 
the execution should go forward because the woman has a history of 
mental illness and is not credible. 
</P>
<P>
	The trooper's mother, however, said Richard Charles Johnson  
should not die Friday as scheduled while there were questions about 
his guilt and the state's Roman Catholic bishop joined Johnson's 
clemency plea to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper Bruce K. Smalls was shot in 1985 after pulling over a  
motor home on Interstate 95 that Johnson and the woman were in. 
Johnson's first conviction in 1986 was overturned by the state 
Supreme Court. He was sentenced again to die after a 1988 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 36, was convicted with the help of statements from  
Connie Sue Hess at his first trial, and her statement that he 
killed Smalls was used against Johnson at his second trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a sworn statement last week against the advice of a  
lawyer, Hess, now of Norfolk, Neb., said she killed Smalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, who was 17 at the time, said she confessed now to ease her  
conscience. She said she lied originally ``because I did not want 
to die. The solicitor told me I would fry if I had anything to do 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Charlie Condon said, however, that Hess lacked  
credibility because of a history of mental illness. She currently 
lives in supervised housing for the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two juries have considered a mountain of evidence against  
Johnson and found him guilty,'' he said as he asked the state 
Supreme Court to reject a stay of execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess' statement prompted Bishop Robert J. Baker and Smalls'  
mother to ask for Gov. Jim Hodges for clemency for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges' spokeswoman said he would not comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's lawyer questioned why Hess' testimony at the 1986  
trial was considered credible, but her latest statement was not. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have it both ways,'' lawyer John Blume said.

<HEADLINE> Blackmun Honored at Court Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The late Supreme Court Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun was praised for his ``decency, modesty and civility'' 
Wednesday in a ceremonial session of the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno and Solicitor General Seth Waxman,  
representing lawyers who practice before the court, said the 
Supreme Court bar was saddened by Blackmun's death at age 90 last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	They presented to the court a formal resolution conveying that  
sentiment, a tradition after a justice's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun had retired from the court in 1994 after a 24-year  
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He epitomized the highest ideals of public service,'' Reno  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waxman, recalling Blackmun's ``passion for hard work,'' said the  
justice is remembered ``with deep respect and affection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun is best remembered as author of the court's 1973  
decision in Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide and 
touched off a still-raging moral and political debate. That ruling 
was prominently mentioned Wednesday, but so were Blackmun's 
opinions on immigrants' rights, commercial speech and race 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist grinned broadly when Waxman  
recalled Blackmun's practice of referring to himself as ``Old No. 
3.'' He was President Nixon's third choice for the court in 1970, 
nominated after the Senate rejected two other nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist called his former colleague ``a pensive and  
compassionate man,'' adding, ``He was the personification of 
decency, modesty and civility.''

<HEADLINE> Former Bengal Player Faces Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- James Brooks, the Cincinnati Bengals' career  
rushing leader, was found guilty Wednesday of failing to pay more 
than $107,000 in child support. He could be sentenced to two years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, 41, pleaded no contest to the two charges. He was  
returned to the Hamilton County jail after Common Pleas Judge 
Steven Martin scheduled sentencing for Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks admitted that he owes at least $107,704 in unpaid child  
support. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges involve two of his three children -- a 6-year-old son  
and a 4-year-old daughter. He fathered them by two women, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	He could be sentenced to as much as two years in prison and a  
$5,000 fine. Hamilton County Prosecutor Michael Allen wants to see 
Brooks behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope and expect some prison time,'' Allen said. ``I  
think it's appropriate under the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' annual salary was $1 million at the height of his pro  
football career. 
</P>
<P>
	He played 11 seasons in the NFL, three in San Diego and eight  
with the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	He holds Cincinnati's career rushing record with 6,447 yards.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens shut down the Atlanta Braves 4-1  
Wednesday night, pitching the New York Yankees to their second 
straight World Series sweep. The Yankees won their record 25th 
championship. Mariano Rivera who had two saves and a win in the 
Series was selected as MVP. At 37, Clemens won his first 
championship -- John Elway was the same age when he won his first 
Super Bowl. Showing the form that earned him five Cy Young Awards 
and 247 wins in 16 seasons, Clemens shut out Atlanta into the

Bill Bradley pledged their support to an overhaul of campaign 
finance laws, and agreed, in general terms, about the need to 
expand health care coverage. On military involvement overseas, 
Bradley advocated a United States role -- but not ``full 
responsibility'' -- in multilateral groups like the United Nations 
and NATO. Asked to describe the characteristics of effective 
leadership, Gore said a president must have a ``vision of the 
future'' and feel compelled to strive towards it. Bradley said 
``absolute integrity'' is essential.

the arrest and trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
two Bosnian Serb warlords. Carla Del Ponte was on her first tour of 
the Balkans since she succeeded Louise Arbour last month at the 
international court. She planned to travel to Kosovo Thursday, and 
then to Bosnia and Croatia later this week. Many of those suspects 
indicted for war crimes by the tribunal, including Milosevic and 
Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic,

said Wednesday. The Army plans to pay an additional $640 per 
trailer to correct the flaw, said the General Accounting Office, 
the auditing and investigative arm of Congress. ``This isn't rocket 
science, these are simple trailers. If the Army couldn't properly 
manage this contract, how can we expect them to handle high-tech 
missiles and other weapons,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who

Illinois' governor to the United States Wednesday, after leaders on 
both sides briefly dropped their differences to help the child. 
Raudel Medina Alfonso suffers from portal hypertension, a 
potentially fatal disease. Cuban doctors don't have the facilities 
to treat him. On his arrival back in Chicago, Gov. George Ryan said 
his trip was ``more than a success.'' But Clinton administration 
officials criticized Ryan's trip, the first visit by a U.S. 
governor since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution.

	Marilyn Monroe Dress Fetches $1.2M  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dress Marilyn Monroe wore in 1962 to  
serenade President Kennedy sold Wednesday night for a record 
$1,267,500. The dress was the highest-priced item at the first 
session of a two-day Manhattan auction. The winning bid was made by 
the Manhattan-based Gotta Have It! Collectibles. It set a new 
record for an auctioned dress, obliterating the $222,500 paid for 
an ink blue Princess Diana gown sold in 1997. Meanwhile, a platinum 
eternity ring, encrusted with 34 diamonds, given to Monroe by 
ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, sold for $772,500.

<HEADLINE> Stock Promoters Found Dead in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Two men who promoted penny stocks via  
the Internet were shot to death gangland-style inside a mansion in 
a crime that has baffled investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an execution. Reasons, we're not certain yet,''  
Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends found Alain Chalem, 41, and Mayir Lehmann, 37, face down  
early Tuesday on the marble floor of the estate Chalem shared with 
his girlfriend and her 13-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem had been shot in the chest and five times in the head,  
while Lehmann, who lived in Woodmere, N.Y., was shot in the leg and 
once in the back of the head. Their cellular telephones were inches 
from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The men promoted stocks for investors on a Web site operated  
from the mansion. Investigators said they had no idea if the 
trading had anything to do with their slayings. And Kaye said there 
was no sign of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said he had no suspects and no murder weapon.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this county, there are about a dozen homicides a year and  
they are not `whodunits,''' Kaye said. ``This is an unusual 
killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem had lived on the 16-acre estate for seven or eight months  
with Kimberly Scarola, 39, and her son. Ms. Scarola had gone to 
Florida, several days before the shootings, and her son was with 
her ex-husband, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends found the wrought-iron gates to the home open, the front  
door unlocked and no signs of forced entry. The white brick home 
with a towering fountain is in a wealthy community of 8,500 about 
an hour from New York City.

<HEADLINE> Treadmill May Be Better Heart Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An often-ignored measurement taken during routine treadmill  
``stress tests'' can predict a heart patient's risk of early death 
even better than many expensive, high-tech approaches, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland Clinic researchers found that the heart's recovery  
rate -- how much the heartbeat slows after someone exercises to 
exhaustion and stops -- can help doctors spot those patients needing 
aggressive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, could save health care dollars by sparing  
healthier patients risky follow-up tests and procedures for heart 
disease, the nation's biggest killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have so many sophisticated tests to do that we sometimes  
overlook the obvious,'' said Dr. Gerald F. Fletcher, a professor at 
the Mayo Medical School in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is reported in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's already changed my clinical practice,'' said Dr. Michael  
S. Lauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic's exercise laboratory. 
``It's terrific news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise stress tests, used since the 1960s, involve having a  
patient walk on a treadmill while his or her heart rate, blood 
pressure and the heart's electrical currents are monitored. The 
test costs about $600. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the mid-1980s and early '90s, however, doctors have used  
more sophisticated tests also involving a treadmill: stress 
echocardiograms, or ultrasound images of the heart pumping, costing 
around $1,500; a nuclear imaging technique called thallium 
scintigraphy, costing about $2,400; and a nuclear ``video'' showing 
sections of the heart that are not pumping properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, when someone exercises to exhaustion and then stops,  
the heart rate drops 15 to 25 beats per minute. Lauer and 
colleagues found that for patients whose heart rate fell less than 
12 beats one minute after exercising, the risk of dying within six 
years was four times greater than for those above the cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the number that best discriminated between people who  
were going to live and people who were going to die,'' Lauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally doctors focus on other results from a treadmill test:  
how the patient feels, his endurance, how much his heart rate 
increases, and changes in the heart's electrical currents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher said the study convinced him doctors should add  
heart-rate recovery to those four factors to get the best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied records from standard treadmill stress  
tests of 2,428 adults treated at the clinic for suspected heart 
problems from 1990 through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found 19 percent of patients whose heart slowed  
less than 12 beats per minute in the first minute after exercise 
were dead within six years. Of those with a normal heart-rate 
recovery, only 5 percent died in that time. 
</P>
<P>
	After adjusting for the patients' age, medication use, heart  
rate during exercise and at rest, and other factors, the patients 
with abnormally low heart-rate recovery still were twice as likely 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may throw a flag up that maybe this person's at greater  
risk and they need to be watched closely,'' said John M. Jakicic, a 
professor at Brown University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer said the recovery rate as measured by a treadmill test was  
twice as good as thallium scintigraphy at predicting death. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who are thought to have heart problems during initial  
testing sometimes undergo heart bypass operations or angioplasty, 
in which a tiny balloon is threaded into an artery to clear away a 
clog. These procedures can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and 
the complications can include bleeding, heart attack, stroke and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart-rate recovery could be an indicator of some other risk  
factor, given that scientists don't fully understand how hormones 
and electrical signals from the brain tell the heart when to speed 
up or slow down, said Dr. Edward M. Dwyer, chief of cardiology at 
New Jersey Medical School in Newark, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Running Backs Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- No one ever thought it would be easy  
replacing Barry Sanders. Many thought it would be downright 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, how do you replace one of the best ever?  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't,'' Detroit Lions coach Bobby Ross said. ``We have  
never tried to replace Barry. He's not here. You play with the 
people you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So the Lions have had to go on without Sanders. So far, it's  
working. 
</P>
<P>
	Things aren't the same without Sanders, of course. But nobody  
expected they would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first six games last season, Sanders was averaging  
just over 100 yards per game. He had rushed for 638 yards and four 
touchdowns. The Lions were 2-4, on their way to a 5-11 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he quit. Sanders, needing only 1,458 yards to pass Walter  
Payton as the NFL's all-time rushing leader, retired on the eve of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial reaction was shock. After that wore off, however,  
the next reaction on the part of the players was anger. Many of 
them didn't like the fact that Sanders would turn his back on them 
without warning. They also didn't like the fact they were being 
written off as having no chance without their superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Rivers, who had been the backup to Sanders for four years,  
was suddenly thrust into the starter's role. The Lions, who had 
drafted Sedrick Irvin almost as an afterthought in the fourth 
round, traded for Greg Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	It became tailback by committee, with fullback Cory Schlesinger  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first six games without Sanders, the committee is  
averaging just over 100 yards per game, the same as Sanders did. 
The Lions have rushed for 604 yards and have three rushing 
touchdowns -- two by Irvin and one by quarterback Charlie Batch. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, the Lions are 4-2. That means they have 10  
games to match their win total for all of 1998, a season in which 
Sanders rushed for 1,491 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are going to get a little tougher from now on, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, leading the team with 289 yards rushing on 71 carries,  
fractured his right ankle last Sunday at Carolina. He's probably 
out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rivers gone, Hill will take over the starter's role. This  
is something Hill has lobbied for all along. Now, he has to 
produce. He has rushed for 137 yards in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have more depth,'' Ross said. ``We wouldn't be surviving  
if we didn't. Some of that is simply the fact that some young guys 
have made a commitment and stepped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin also should see more action with Rivers out. His best  
statistical game came Sept. 26 at Kansas City where he carried 
three times for 20 yards and caught a pass for 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross has been using Irvin to return punts, too. But that's a  
risky job. Now that he's down to two healthy running backs, Ross is 
looking for someone else to play on the punt-return unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlesinger, used mostly as a blocker, has 20 carries for 55  
yards. He also has caught five passes for 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody likes what happened to Ron Rivers,'' Hill said.  
``Nobody wants to get the starting job that way. But football is a 
team game and when one guy goes down, the rest of us have to step 
up and fill in the best way we know how.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, it seems to be working.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's always a chance you might think you're better than you  
are, or the other way around,'' Ross said. ``Right now, I think 
we're getting better.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley To Meet in Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By WALTER R. MEARS    	
</P>
<P>
                      *AP Special Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is getting one of  
the debates he's been demanding against Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley. But Gore's ranking supporter in the leadoff primary state 
said it wasn't likely to change many minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't usually find a smoking gun in a debate,'' Gov.  
Jeanne Shaheen said in an interview Tuesday. ``Not very often are 
they the thing that changes somebody's mind ... particularly this 
early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley meet for an hour tonight at Dartmouth College  
in something short of the head-on debates the vice president wants 
weekly. This one is a televised town hall forum, with the 
candidates answering questions from an audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gore said in advance that the format takes the edge  
off, he didn't scrimp on preparation. He discussed likely questions 
with a team of New Hampshire advisers on Tuesday and was devoting 
much of today to warm-ups. One aim was to get Gore's answers down 
to 90 seconds each. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was preparing, too, after a campaign walk this morning  
in Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
	As he shook hands along Main Street, a handful of sign-toting  
supporters yelled: ``Two. Four. Six. Eight. Who are we going to 
nominate? Bradley!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking briefly with reporters, Bradley played down the  
importance of the debate. ``Every day is an important day when 
you're campaigning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore issued his debate challenge -- usually the tactic of a  
candidate trying to catch the leader -- during a campaign makeover 
after Bradley began carving into his once overwhelming lead. ``I'm 
campaigning like I'm behind,'' Gore said. ``I'm campaigning like an 
underdog all over the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's making headway in national polls, widening his lead over  
Bradley and narrowing his deficit against Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the prime Republican candidate for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's advisers credit that in part to a more relaxed, less  
rigid campaign style. Outside the State House in Concord on 
Tuesday, he lingered after an anti-drug rally to shake hands, chat 
and slap hands with youngsters as aides tried to usher him to the 
motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen said the constraints of the vice presidency have been a  
problem for Gore, but that he is getting around them now. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hampshire polls rate Bradley even or narrowly ahead, and  
the vice president said Friday that he probably is behind here in 
the state that will hold the first presidential primary on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got three months left -- that's an eternity,'' Shaheen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there's been a favorable initial reaction to Bradley  
``because he's a new face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little too early to see whether that translates into  
real votes,'' the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Style isn't Gore's only campaign change; he has sharpened his  
line against Bradley, saying the former New Jersey senator is 
running as a ``left-of-center'' insurgent and criticizing him for 
once hinting at running for president as an independent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, attacking is a strategy,'' said Eric Hauser,  
Bradley's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gore has the advantage of experience in campaign  
debates, but Bradley is ready to counter him. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Democrats, five of the six Republican candidates --  
absent the front-running Bush -- will have another turn at debating 
Thursday night. They met last Friday without drawing sharp lines on 
major issues, save for a push on campaign finance reform by Sen. 
John McCain of Arizona, on which he'd just lost in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch  
of Utah and radio commentator Alan Keyes round out the lineup for 
the 90-minute GOP forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush skipped those debates, citing schedule conflicts, but as  
the front-runner he also is unwilling to let the others have at him 
so soon. He has agreed to a debate in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Bans Team From Postseason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- University of Minnesota president Mark Yudof  
said school officials has to show the NCAA they are serious about 
cleaning up a men's basketball program rocked by academic cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	And he hopes a one-year, self-imposed ban on postseason play  
will impress the athletic governing body when it completes its own 
investigation months from now and hands out its own sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must demonstrate good faith and take meaningful action to  
repair the damage that has been done by others,'' Yudof said 
Tuesday in announcing his decision to ban postseason play. ``It's 
the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university also is placing the program on probation for an  
unspecified length of time. That will mean higher levels of 
reporting to the NCAA, such as periodic self-studies and compliance 
checks, Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation into the men's basketball program began in  
March after former tutor Jan Gangelhoff claimed she did more than 
400 pieces of course work for at least 20 basketball players from 
1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said earlier that the investigation revealed ``numerous,  
maybe even massive'' instances of academic fraud. It has since 
widened to include accusations of improper payments and travel 
irregularities, and alleged sexual and other misconduct in the 
men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the university and the NCAA could impose more  
sanctions after the final university report is completed, probably 
by Nov. 10. The report is expected to be made public about 10 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the organization would not  
comment specifically on the sanctions. But she said it is 
appropriate and common for schools to come up with their own 
punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities do frequently hand down their own penalties, and  
our (infractions) committee considers that and can adopt those 
sanctions, as well as add other penalties,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is supposed to have an infraction hearing next spring  
and could issue sanctions then or wait until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he realized some basketball team members may feel the  
sanctions are unfair since no current players were involved in the 
cheating. But he added, ``The NCAA has to worry about deterrents. I 
have to worry about deterrents in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postseason ban includes The National Invitation Tournament  
and the NCAA tournament, but not the Big Ten tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, the woman who sparked the investigation, left her  
job at a casino in Danbury, Wis., to listen to the university's 
news conference on her car radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just the beginning,'' Gangelhoff said.  
``President Yudof must have enough information to realize these two 
things (sanctions) were going to happen regardless of whether or 
not he has the complete report in hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof did not say whether jobs might be lost because of the  
findings in the investigation. ``I don't want to presage what might 
come out in the report,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins resigned under pressure in June and accepted  
a $1.5 million buyout of his contract. He has said he had no 
knowledge of any academic cheating in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Monson of Gonzaga University was hired to replace Haskins.  
</P>
<P>
	One reason to come out with sanctions now was to improve team  
morale, Yudof said. Monson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the staff and our team, it's the beginning of the end,''  
Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson said he would be open with prospective players about the  
sanctions, which both he and Yudof acknowledged would hurt 
recruiting. However, if they end after one year, they may not have 
as great an impact, Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA holds a 64-team tournament at the end of every regular  
season to determine a national champion. The NIT is held for 32 
teams that don't qualify for the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota has won the NIT twice and qualified for the NCAA Final  
Four in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Montana Among 71 Nominated for Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Joe Montana, who led the San Francisco 49ers  
to four Super Bowl titles, is among the 71 former NFL players, 
coaches and contributors nominated for induction into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana spent 13 seasons with the 49ers and two with the Kansas  
City Chiefs before retiring in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Others on the list include defensive back Ronnie Lott, wide  
receiver Sterling Sharpe, defensive linemen Charles Mann, Leonard 
Marshall and Steve McMichael, and linebacker Karl Mecklenburg. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of 15 finalists will be announced in mid-January, with  
the 2000 inductees announced on Jan. 29, the day before the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Football Hall of Fame's board of selectors vote for 12  
modern-era finalists. Defensive end Howie Long and wide receiver 
Lynn Swann will be added to the list because they finished in the 
top six in last year's voting for induction. The 15th finalist is 
former 49ers linebacker Dave Wilcox, the recommended candidate of a 
seniors committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Players must have been retired at least five years to be  
considered for the Hall of Fame. Any player selected for a major 
All-NFL, All-AFC, All-NFC or Pro Bowl team automatically is 
included on the list of nominees.

<HEADLINE> Army Taps National Guard for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army has scheduled three National Guard  
divisions to rotate with active duty divisions in commanding U.S. 
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement is designed to make more use of reserve forces  
and increase their combat readiness while easing some of the 
peacekeeping burden on the active duty force. Army forces have been 
on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia since 1995 and there is no end in 
sight to the NATO-led mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservists have been on duty in Bosnia from the start. But now,  
for the first time, the Army is putting a National Guard division 
in charge of a combined ``team'' of active and reserve units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army had announced it would send Texas' 49th Armored  
Division in March 2000 to command a combined team of active duty 
and reserve forces in Bosnia in March 2000. On Wednesday, it 
announced a longer-term schedule that added two other National 
Guard divisions for command duty. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 2000, the 3rd Infantry Division, an active duty unit  
from Fort Stewart, Ga., will command U.S. peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia, including a battalion task force composed of companies from 
the 30th Infantry Brigade of the North Carolina National Guard and 
the 45th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma guard. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 2001, the 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland and  
Virginia National Guard will take over the command. It will be 
teamed with companies from the 10th Mountain Division from Fort 
Drum, N.Y., and the 155th Armor Brigade of the Mississippi National 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky., will take  
over as the active-duty headquarters in charge in April 2002, and 
will be teamed with companies from two National Guard units from 
Idaho, the 116th Armor Brigade and the 76th Infantry Brigade. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Moves To Protect Domain Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has voted to ban ``cybersquatting,''  
the pre-empting of Internet domain names with the aim of selling 
those names to companies or people with trademark associations to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed by voice vote on Tuesday, would bar the  
bad faith registration or trafficking in domain names that are 
identical to or confusingly similar to a distinctive trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also allow trademark owners to seek cancellation of an  
infringing domain name if they can prove they attempted but were 
unable to locate the owner of the name. 
</P>
<P>
	Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to access a  
particular Web site. They come between ``www'' and ``com,'' ``net'' 
or ``org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate in August approved a similar bill. The administration  
opposes the legislation, saying courts have been friendly to the 
victims of cybersquatting and it would be better to allow courts to 
develop a body of case law in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 3028.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley To Debate in N.H. Campaign%xhl) </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley, locked in a  
neck-and-neck race in New Hampshire's early primary, each sought 
the advantage Wednesday in their first debate of the Democratic 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes were highest for the vice president, who has watched  
a commanding lead in national and state polls dwindle in the face 
of Bradley's surprisingly strong campaign. The former New Jersey 
senator is rated even or slightly ahead in New Hampshire, where the 
nation's first primary is scheduled for Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day is an important day when you're campaigning,''  
Bradley said, playing down the significance of the televised forum, 
even as dozens of journalists and supporters crowded around him 
during a tour of Main Street on the Dartmouth College campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore shook hands at the same spot later in the day, stopping to  
read to youngsters at a local bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who are we going to nominate?  
Bradley!'' the former New Jersey senator's supporters yelled, 
drowning out Gore backers during both strolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaigns converged for a 60-minute televised forum in which  
audience members furnished the questions. The format allowed little 
chance of back-and-forth between the two Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is trying to rejuvenate his presidential bid with a more  
relaxed, less rigid style on the campaign trail. At the same time, 
he has sharpened his criticism of Bradley, calling him a ``left of 
center'' insurgent who would build an enormous federal deficit with 
his health care and anti-poverty plans. 
</P>
<P>
	All but ignoring the barbs, Bradley is sticking to a months-old  
strategy to portray himself as the candidate of big ideas and Gore 
the timid practitioner of ``trifling things.'' While Gore jazzes up 
his performances, Bradley still wear reading glasses on the stump 
and avoids sound bites; his style is a lack of style. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers cautioned him before the debate to avoid appearing  
too negative, though he was poised to seize on any question that 
gave him an opening to question Bradley's proposals or his rival's 
commitment to the party. Bradley's team had the former senator 
ready to respond if Gore went on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to just let him mischaracterize us,'' said  
Bradley's communications director, Anita Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate was held in the context of new Democratic polling  
that underscored Bradley's surge. A Quinnipac College survey 
released Tuesday showed him leading Gore 47 percent to 39 percent 
in New Hampshire, just outside the margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has pulled even in New York and has narrowed the vice  
president's lead in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Two polls released Wednesday showed that Bradley trails Gore  
nationally, though he has gained ground since July and April, 
respectively. Other polls suggest that Gore has slowed his slide in 
national polls this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president had expressed no interest in debating until  
Bradley dashed his hopes for an easy primary contest. Gore now says 
he wants to debate weekly, though the campaigns have agreed on only 
a handful of dates before the first votes are cast in Iowa's 
late-January caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore brought three Cabinet secretaries to New Hampshire to  
praise his performance in post-debate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Democrats, five of the six Republican candidates --  
absent the front-running George W. Bush -- will have another turn at 
debating Thursday night. They met last Friday without drawing sharp 
lines on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush skipped the debates, citing schedule conflicts, but as the  
front-runner he also is unwilling to let the others at him so soon. 
He has agreed to a debate in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2.

<HEADLINE> Free Encyclopedia Site Still Jammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For 10 million Internet surfers a day, a free  
Encyclopaedia Britannica apparently is worth waiting for. But for 
how long? 
</P>
<P>
	One of the year's most-touted Internet sites remains clogged  
nine days after the debut of free online encyclopedias -- brought to 
a virtual standstill by huge worldwide demand and insufficient 
hardware and software. 
</P>
<P>
	Britannica.com Inc., hoping to assuage the roughly 10 million  
people who have been trying daily to get into www.britannica.com, 
posted its third apology at the entrance to the blocked site 
Wednesday. The Chicago publisher promised to make it accessible 
``soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our teams have been busy unpacking crates, installing  
hardware, configuring software and boosting capacity worldwide,'' 
said the statement, describing a round-the-clock repair effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But an executive acknowledged the problems will take weeks to  
fully fix. While many users should be able to get in by next week, 
redesigning the system to increase capacity several-fold will take 
longer, said Jorge Cauz, senior vice president for sales and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyber troubles, at nine days and counting, have marred an  
innovation that had succeeded in drawing attention to the 
struggling publisher as it tries to shake its stodgy image and get 
with the electronic program. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which says only 100,000 people have managed to  
reach the site's first page, admits it underestimated the early 
public response. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in his right mind would have built an infrastructure  
capable of handling the initial demand we had,'' Cauz said. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say the bottom line is poor planning.  
</P>
<P>
	``For this to be your core site, you can't make a mistake like  
this,'' said Rob Enderle, a consultant for the Giga Information 
Group in Santa Clara, Calif. ``If they were a startup company, we'd 
probably be talking about them going out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the rocky debut may not be harmful over the long haul  
because of Britannica's prestigious brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think consumers will give them a few more chances than they  
would some nameless, unheard-of Internet startup with a premature 
product launch,'' said Emily Meehan, analyst for the Boston-based 
Yankee Group. ``There are too many educational institutions out 
there that want to get their hands on a free Encyclopaedia 
Britannica that are willing to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longer the tie-up lasts, the greater the chances that some  
would-be customers will vanish for good, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Britannica's printed sets have fallen off by an  
estimated 80 percent since peaking at about $650 million in 1990 as 
knowledge-seekers turn to computer versions, mostly Microsoft's 
Encarta. Chicago-based Britannica is counting on advertising, 
sponsorship and e-commerce to make the venture pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still available in the printed version, at $1,250 per set,  
as well as on CD-ROM.

<HEADLINE> SBC, Global Crossing Top Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Profits rose 22.5 percent at SBC Communications in the third  
quarter -- just before the merger with Ameritech, a fellow Baby 
Bell, and its crowning as the biggest U.S. phone company and one of 
four new stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications International, the long-distance company  
that's acquiring another Baby Bell, U S West, met most Wall Street 
forecasts for the third-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, the company that Qwest outbid to purchase U S  
West, posted a smaller loss than expected. 

</P>
<P>
                        *SBC Communications    	
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC, which completed its $74 billion purchase  
of Chicago-based Ameritech on Oct. 8, earned $1.28 billion, or 64 
cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with a profit of 1.04 billion, or 53 cents a  
share, SBC earned in the third quarter of 1998, excluding a 
one-time gain of $219 million from the sale of certain businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected  
operating earnings of 61 cents a share from SBC, the local phone 
company for most of the Southwest and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC's revenues rose 7.6 percent to $7.77 billion, up from $7.22  
billion in last year's third quarter, driven by the rapid growth of 
the company's Internet, wireless and international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	To provide a sense of how SBC and Ameritech might have fared in  
the third quarter as a single company, SBC said the companies 
earned a combined $1.97 billion, or 57 cents a share, excluding 
one-time factors. That's 17.4 percent better than the combined 
operating profit of $1.68 billion, or 49 cents a share, the 
companies reported in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined revenues for the companies totaled $12.45 billion in  
the third quarter, up 9.4 percent from $11.38 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results confirm our confidence that by bringing SBC and  
Ameritech together, we have joined two strong businesses capable of 
performing very well for our customers and shareowners,'' said SBC 
chairman and chief executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC rose $2.43 3/4 to $48 in Wednesday's trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange, extending Tuesday's rally on news the stock will be 
added to the Dow Jones industrial average beginning next week. 

</P>
<P>
                 *Qwest Communications International    	
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications International earned $19.8 million, or 3  
cents a share, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That excludes one-time costs of $25 million related to the U S  
West buyout that left the Denver-based company with a net loss of 
$1.8 million -- almost break-even in per-share terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, before the acquisitions of the  
long-distance company LCI and other companies, Qwest lost $6.9 
million, or 1 cent per share. If LCI and the other companies had 
already been acquired, the net loss in last year's third quarter 
would have totaled $11.4 million, or 2 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the just-ended quarter totaled $1.02 billion, a 26  
percent increase over the combined $807 million generated by the 
same operations in last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications services revenue grew by 69 percent. Internet and  
data services operations remained the fastest-growing segment, more 
than tripling from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of the quarter, however, was Qwest's victory in a  
bidding war with Global Crossing for U S West, the Baby Bell phone 
company for most of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading, Qwest's fell 56 1/4 cents a share to  
$33.87 1/2. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Global Crossing Ltd.    	
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda-based Global Crossing lost $34.1 million, or 4 cents a  
share, in the third quarter, weighed down by heavy spending on the 
company's bid to build a global fiber optic network for high-speed 
Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures are adjusted to include a full-quarter of results  
from Frontier Corp. and Global Marine Systems, both of which were 
acquired after the three-month period began. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the combined operations to show a loss of  
10 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Global Crossing would have had a  
profit of $11.7 million, or 2 cents a share, when combined with 
1998's third-quarter results from Frontier and Global Marine. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the combined operations totaled $929 million in the  
just-ended quarter, up from $863 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading, shares of Global Crossing rose  
$1.06 1/4 to $35.18 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Sports Memorabilia Dealer Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A sports memorabilia dealer was charged with mail  
fraud in a federal investigation of the alleged selling of jerseys, 
shoes and other items containing the forged signatures of Michael 
Jordan and other former and current sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Ryan, also known as Steven Levine, 41, is the 13th  
defendant to be charged in federal court in Chicago as part of the 
nationwide Operation Foul Ball investigation. The other 12 have 
been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities estimate that forgeries make up as much as 70  
percent of the sports memorabilia market and generate millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Wheeling, was to appear  
in federal court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities allege that Ryan, who does business as  
Northbrook-based North Shore Sports, auctioned items purported to 
be autographed by Jordan. Authorities said four pairs of shoes 
purportedly worn by Jordan in games and autographed by him weren't 
even the same size worn by the ex-Bulls superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan continued to sell hundreds of allegedly forged items even  
though he has known for more than two years that he was under 
investigation by the FBI, and despite repeated warnings to cease 
and desist by Jordan's representatives and the Bulls, according to 
the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	A jersey worn by Jordan in a game can fetch more than $20,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's lawyer, George Pappas, said his client is innocent,  
adding the auction items were ``100 percent authentic.''

<HEADLINE> Dayton Won't Dispute NCAA Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The University of Dayton expects the NCAA to  
rule that the school committed four rules infractions, including 
$32,000 in loans a university trustee made to the father of a 
basketball recruit, a school official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investigators concluded that basketball player Brooks  
Hall is eligible to play because he did not know about the loans or 
directly benefit from them, Ted Kissell, director of athletics, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university will not contest the findings and awaits  
sanctions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we had concluded differently, we decided there was  
not a great likelihood that our position would prevail in front of 
the infractions committee,'' Kissell said. ``We decided it was in 
our best interests to put this behind us, to accept the enforcement 
staff's conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for a major violation can include a two-year  
probation, cuts in the number of expenses-paid recruiting visits to 
the school or a reduction in the number of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Committee on Infractions meets Nov. 5-7.  
</P>
<P>
	University officials declined to say what penalties they  
recommended to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we put forth a very good set of recommendations,''  
Brother Raymond Fitz, the university's president, said. ``We're 
hopeful that they'll accept them as they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, the university learned that the NCAA would  
not accept their characterization of the violations as 
``inadvertent and secondary.'' The NCAA concluded that one major 
infraction and three secondary infractions occurred: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In August and September 1998, Clayton Mathile made personal  
loans totaling $32,000 to Chuck Hall, father of Brooks Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mathile made impermissible contacts with Hall's family; he made  
impermissible contact with another unnamed recruit; and the radio 
station that carries Flyers basketball games posted a sign at the 
Troy Strawberry Festival in June 1998, associating Hall's name with 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules prohibit schools from publicizing an unsigned  
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Renfro, director of public relations for the NCAA, said  
the NCAA cannot comment on any case. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Hall declined to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian Prime Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Lithuania's prime minister resigned  
today, taking his government with him, after a controlling share in 
a state-owned oil company was sold to American investors over his 
objection. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-member Cabinet automatically disbanded with Prime  
Minister Rolandas Paksas' resignation, prompting President Valdas 
Adamkus to cut short a visit to Canada to deal with the government 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The president immediately named outgoing Labor Minister Irena  
Degutiene as the acting prime minister of the tiny Baltic country. 
</P>
<P>
	Paksas, 43, sparked a political revolt last week when he  
rejected the $650 million sale of a majority stake in the 
state-owned Mazeikiai Oil to the U.S.-based Williams International. 
</P>
<P>
	Degutiene was one of 13 ministers who backed the sale. Despite  
Paksas' objections to the deal, only 3 voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Paksas said he didn't oppose the sale in principle, but that the  
country could not afford it. Struggling with a budget deficit, the 
government would be hit harder by the loss of the oil company -- a 
cornerstone of the Lithuanian economy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the sale said Williams' investment would revitalize  
the loss-making Mazeikiai Oil. The American connection also would 
lessen what they said was a dangerous dependence on Russia, which 
provides most of the former Soviet republic's crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
	But many nationalists opposed, demanding that key industries  
remain in state hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Paksas, a professional stunt pilot, was mayor of Vilnius before  
becoming prime minister five months ago, and some doubted whether 
he had the experience to run the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But others have praised his performance. His popularity, already  
high in polls, was expected to increase as a result of his 
outspoken opposition to the Mazeikiai Oil deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was scheduled to be signed October 29.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear when Degutiene would announce a new  
Cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Italian-Americans Recall W.W. II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are urging the government to  
acknowledge that Italian-Americans were jailed, driven from their 
jobs and placed under travel restrictions during World War II 
because of suspicions about their allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a little-known chapter of U.S. history, the government  
classified 600,000 residents of Italian descent as enemy aliens 
from late 1941 until Italy surrendered to the Allies in 1943. They 
had to carry special identification and were forbidden from 
traveling more than five miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
	Those affected ranged from anonymous residents of small coastal  
towns to celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ezio Pinza, the late opera singer at the Metropolitan Opera in  
New York, was imprisoned at Ellis Island for nearly three months 
starting March 12, 1942. His widow, Doris Pinza, said she was 
shocked that he could be locked up and his house searched without 
being told charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never suspected this could happen in the United States,''  
Mrs. Pinza, her voice quavering, told members of the House 
Judiciary Constitution subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinza eventually won his release after two hearings and later  
sang the national anthem at the welcoming home ceremonies for Gen. 
George Patton in 1945, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 Italian-Americans were imprisoned in Montana and New  
York, similar to the incarceration of thousands of ethnic Japanese 
in internment camps during the war. In contrast to the Japanese, 
who won reparations, the plight of Italian-Americans has gone 
largely unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, 52,000 were confined to their homes under an 8  
p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. And in ports from Monterey. Calif., to 
Boston, fishermen were grounded and had their boats impounded by 
the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill from New York Reps. Rick Lazio, a Republican, and Eliot  
Engel, a Democrat, would force the president to acknowledge 
violations of civil rights and order a Justice Department report 
about the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of reparations or looking for money,'' said  
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee chairman, who described 
himself as ``dumbfounded'' when he heard about the treatment. ``The 
truth has been obscured. The truth ought to be told.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Davidian Plaintiffs' Gun Test Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has brushed aside a  
challenge by lawyers for survivors of the 1993 Branch Davidian 
siege to participate in a demonstration that the lawyers contend 
would prove federal agents fired shots during the standoff's final 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting the offer, a legal team representing the government  
in a massive wrongful-death lawsuit headed to trial next May cited 
that litigation and uncertainty over the validity of the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Branch Davidians contend that infrared aerial  
surveillance footage shot by the FBI on April 19, 1993, proves that 
shots were fired by government agents into the compound near Waco, 
Texas -- a contention bureau officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers offered last week to put their theory to  
the test. They proposed a demonstration in which weapons similar to 
those carried by Davidians and federal agents alike would be fired 
at a Dallas-area firing range while a plane mounted with an 
infrared camera similar to the one used by the FBI would record the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have long insisted that no shots were fired  
into the Branch Davidians' retreat by government agents during the 
final hours of the 51-day siege. They also deny that their actions 
sparked the inferno that consumed the compound. Cult leader David 
Koresh and some 80 followers died during the blaze, some from the 
fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by the government's refusal to provide information  
about the infrared videotaping performed at Waco, the plaintiffs 
last week invited investigators for the government, Congress and 
the special counsel investigating Waco to witness the proposed 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	That offer was rejected Monday by Justice Department attorney  
Marie Louise Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and your experts are free to conduct whatever test you  
desire, based on whatever information you choose to believe to be 
accurate,'' she wrote Houston lawyer Michael Caddell, who 
represents most of the surviving Davidians and relatives of the 
dead in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it does appear from your letter that several of your  
assumptions about the facts, the science and the experts are in 
error, and may render useless any conclusions reached, it is your 
choice to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials cautioned last week that it would be ``near  
impossible'' to duplicate conditions, particularly since they say 
the plaintiffs lack crucial information about the altitude of the 
FBI plane that flew over the compound, the infrared camera's design 
specifications and film speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell, in an interview, said his experts know the film speed  
and altitude of the FBI ``Nightstalker'' plane, lacking only 
confirmation of the type of infrared camera used. The government 
has rejected several requests for that information, saying it is 
classified. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell wrote Ms. Hagen on Tuesday that he was ``disappointed''  
by the Justice Department's refusal to join in the test. ``You and 
your superiors at the Department of Justice continue to treat this 
matter as some sort of game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> SBC, Global Crossing Top Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Profits rose 22.5 percent at SBC Communications in the third  
quarter -- just before the merger with Ameritech, a fellow Baby 
Bell, and its crowning as the biggest U.S. phone company and one of 
four new stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications International, the long-distance company  
that's acquiring another Baby Bell, U S West, met most Wall Street 
forecasts for the third-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, the company that Qwest outbid to purchase U S  
West, posted a smaller loss than expected. 

</P>
<P>
                        *SBC Communications    	
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC, which completed its $74 billion purchase  
of Chicago-based Ameritech on Oct. 8, earned $1.28 billion, or 64 
cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with a profit of 1.04 billion, or 53 cents a  
share, SBC earned in the third quarter of 1998, excluding a 
one-time gain of $219 million from the sale of certain businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected  
operating earnings of 61 cents a share from SBC, the local phone 
company for most of the Southwest and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC's revenues rose 7.6 percent to $7.77 billion, up from $7.22  
billion in last year's third quarter, driven by the rapid growth of 
the company's Internet, wireless and international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	To provide a sense of how SBC and Ameritech might have fared in  
the third quarter as a single company, SBC said the companies 
earned a combined $1.97 billion, or 57 cents a share, excluding 
one-time factors. That's 17.4 percent better than the combined 
operating profit of $1.68 billion, or 49 cents a share, the 
companies reported in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined revenues for the companies totaled $12.45 billion in  
the third quarter, up 9.4 percent from $11.38 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results confirm our confidence that by bringing SBC and  
Ameritech together, we have joined two strong businesses capable of 
performing very well for our customers and shareowners,'' said SBC 
chairman and chief executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC rose $2.43 3/4 to $48 in Wednesday's trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange, extending Tuesday's rally on news the stock will be 
added to the Dow Jones industrial average beginning next week. 

</P>
<P>
                 *Qwest Communications International    	
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications International earned $19.8 million, or 3  
cents a share, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	That excludes one-time costs of $25 million related to the U S  
West buyout that left the Denver-based company with a net loss of 
$1.8 million -- almost break-even in per-share terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, before the acquisitions of the  
long-distance company LCI and other companies, Qwest lost $6.9 
million, or 1 cent per share. If LCI and the other companies had 
already been acquired, the net loss in last year's third quarter 
would have totaled $11.4 million, or 2 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the just-ended quarter totaled $1.02 billion, a 26  
percent increase over the combined $807 million generated by the 
same operations in last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications services revenue grew by 69 percent. Internet and  
data services operations remained the fastest-growing segment, more 
than tripling from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of the quarter, however, was Qwest's victory in a  
bidding war with Global Crossing for U S West, the Baby Bell phone 
company for most of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading, Qwest's fell 56 1/4 cents a share to  
$33.87 1/2. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Global Crossing Ltd.    	
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda-based Global Crossing lost $34.1 million, or 4 cents a  
share, in the third quarter, weighed down by heavy spending on the 
company's bid to build a global fiber optic network for high-speed 
Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures are adjusted to include a full-quarter of results  
from Frontier Corp. and Global Marine Systems, both of which were 
acquired after the three-month period began. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected the combined operations to show a loss of  
10 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Global Crossing would have had a  
profit of $11.7 million, or 2 cents a share, when combined with 
1998's third-quarter results from Frontier and Global Marine. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the combined operations totaled $929 million in the  
just-ended quarter, up from $863 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's Nasdaq trading, shares of Global Crossing rose  
$1.06 1/4 to $35.18 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Cope With Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What happens to a small business when mom and  
pop go their separate ways and need to sell the company, or when 
it's time to pass the reins over to the next generation? 
</P>
<P>
	How about when a privately held company needs to raise capital  
or address a lawsuit? 
</P>
<P>
	To deal with these issues, owners must first determine just how  
much their businesses are worth -- and that's not an easy task to 
take on alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Many small business owners don't know where to begin. There may  
be too many assets to value, too many changes within their industry 
during years of operation, or their emotional attachment may bring 
a distorted view of the company's worth. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where an independent business appraiser can come in  
handy. There are numerous certified public accountants, valuation 
firms and investment banking companies that specialize in this 
area. The cost: around $10,000 for an average small business. The 
time to complete: between one and two months on average. 
</P>
<P>
	For a separate commission, some business appraisers may even be  
able to broker a deal. (The American Society of Appraisers, based 
in Washington, D.C., can provide names of business appraisers 
accredited through the trade group at its Web site, 
www.appraisers.org, or by calling 1-800-ASA-VALU.) 
</P>
<P>
	Business valuation is a mix of art and science. Appraisers  
provide an estimate or opinion of value based on prevailing market 
conditions, income and assets of a company, although many factors 
in between come into play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, the goal is to arrive at the fair market value of  
the business ... which is basically what a buyer is willing to pay 
after both sides have had reasonable access to all the available 
information,'' said Martin D. Hanan, president of Business 
Valuation Services Inc. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	There are three basic approaches taken by valuation  
professionals: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Market. What comparable companies, public and private, in the  
same industry have sold for. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Income. Both current income and projected income of a company  
over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Assets. That includes assets which are tangible -- inventory,  
real estate, receivables or equipment -- and intangible -- employees, 
customer loyalty or a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to use all three ... whenever we can, although in  
different industries, we may weigh them differently,'' said Robert 
F. Reilly, managing director of Willamette Management Associates in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``income'' approach may be favored more for service  
businesses, like financial consultants or medical professionals, 
while the ``asset'' approach better geared toward asset-intensive 
businesses, like construction companies or real estate developers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most valuations are done because owners want to sell or merge  
with another company, business appraisers say. Both sells and 
buyers often will request independent valuations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a period of another merger and acquisition frenzy as  
we were in the mid-80s,'' Hanan said, attributing to the trend to 
the strong economy and rising stock market, both of which have 
helped increase the value of many businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanan said many mom-and-pop operations are being bought by  
larger public companies. The small business owners are receiving 
cash and stock in the public company. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other reasons to seek a formal valuation.  
</P>
<P>
	It's crucial for estate planning purposes or if owners ever  
intend to go public to raise more capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Business owners who are buying insurance coverage also may need  
to establish current market value to cover operating expenses in 
the event of an extraordinary loss or to replace a key employee in 
the even of death for example. 
</P>
<P>
	If a business has been sued, a valuation can help determine  
economic damage or resolve bankruptcy issues or partner disputes.

<HEADLINE> Freed Immigrant Angered at U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- On his first day of freedom in 19 months, a  
Palestinian emigrant once suspected of plotting to kill Attorney 
General Janet Reno criticized the government's reliance on secret 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe that such allegations were being pointed at  
me,'' Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen said Tuesday. ``Such a use of secret 
evidence really astonished me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, 31, said he would probably try to force the  
government to provide him copies of the evidence. He and his 
lawyers haven't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be skeptical of government claims of national  
security,'' said David Cole, a Georgetown law professor who worked 
for Kiareldeen and others jailed on secret evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-classified summaries of evidence collected by the FBI  
alleged Kiareldeen was a member of a terrorist group who made a 
``credible threat'' to murder Reno because of her role in 
prosecuting the bombers of the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen has testified that he does not know any of the men  
convicted in the bombing and did not know who Reno was until he was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration judges this month found that secret evidence  
``unreliable'' and a federal judge ruled last week that his 
detention was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, who managed an electronics shop before his detention  
on charges he overstayed his student visa, was never charged with a 
terrorist act. The FBI closed its investigation in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his supporters said the suspicions stemmed from false  
claims made by his ex-wife. Her charges of domestic abuse during a 
continuing battle over visitation were dismissed by judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen conceded that he overstayed his visa. An immigration  
judge this spring found that was not reason to deport him, since 
Kiareldeen was now married to a U.S. citizen and others in similar 
circumstances are often not punished. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiareldeen, who was born on the Gaza Strip and came to the  
United States in 1990, said he hopes to become a citizen, ``Because 
I am proud of America. I like America because it is a free 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was freed about midnight Monday from the Hudson County Jail  
just after the Justice Department announced it had dropped efforts 
to deport him. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say Kiareldeen is the first of about two dozen people,  
nearly all Arab or Muslim, detained by secret evidence to win 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time after time, secret evidence is being revealed as evidence  
that isn't sensitive, but weak,'' said Hussein Ibish, a spokesman 
for the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington, 
who called it a ``highly abusive and totally un-American 
practice.''

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Indians reliever Steve Karsay had  
arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow, the club said Wednesday.

	Stewart Crash Jet Recently Repaired  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A valve in the cabin-pressurization system was  
replaced two days before golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet slammed 
into a South Dakota pasture, but the system worked fine during a 
short flight after the replacement, the chief government 
investigator said today. Government officials have said one 
possible explanation for the crash is that the jet lost cabin 
pressure soon after taking off from Florida, causing everyone 
aboard to die or lose consciousness. For four hours on Monday, the 
jet flew 1,400 miles across the country, apparently on autopilot, 
before running out of fuel and spiraling into a field.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Jets Are Less Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aviation experts say that if Payne Stewart's  
Learjet depressurized, those aboard the small plane likely perished 
quickly. Commercial jet passengers would face a lesser risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A loss of pressurization could almost instantly drain safe  
breathing air out of the relatively small cabin of a 10-seat jet 
like the Lear 35 carrying Stewart and presumably five others 
Monday. It crashed in South Dakota, killing all aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	A pressure leak would take more time to suck the air out of the  
bigger cabin in a commercial plane carrying as many as 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	During that time, oxygen masks for passengers would fall from  
the aircraft ceiling, and the flight crew would have a chance to 
don pressure masks and make an emergency dive below 10,000 feet -- 
where the air is safe to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	While the outside air at an airplane's cruising altitude is too  
thin and cold to support human life, jets are pressurized to fly at 
that height because they can get better fuel economy and a smoother 
ride.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Flu Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flu sufferers won their first effective pill  
against both types A and B flu Wednesday as the Food and Drug 
Administration approved Tamiflu. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill, manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche, helped reduce the  
duration and severity of flu symptoms in unvaccinated adults who 
agreed to be infected with influenza to test the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision means flu sufferers this year have two new  
treatment choices. The FDA earlier approved an inhaled flu drug 
called Relenza that also works against both A and B flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Older flu medicines worked against only the type A flu, which  
accounts for about two-thirds of the estimated 20 million U.S. flu 
cases yearly, and doctors have said those medicines didn't work 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu is not a cure-all, the FDA warned. Studies showed taking  
the drug helped patients recover only about a day earlier than flu 
patients who took a dummy pill, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	To get that benefit, patients took Tamiflu within 40 hours of  
the first flu symptom -- meaning patients would have to recognize 
flu symptoms and get to the doctor to get the prescription-only 
drug rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects included nausea, vomiting, bronchitis, trouble  
sleeping and dizziness, FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts stress that neither Tamiflu nor the competing  
Relenza flu treatments are a substitute for a flu vaccine. The flu 
kills about 20,000 Americans a year, a toll the government says 
could be decreased if more people got their flu shots in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu vaccination is most recommended for people over 64 --  
although one doctors' group now recommends the shots starting at 
age 50 -- as well as anyone with chronic heart or lung problems or a 
weak immune system, and anyone in close contact with high-risk 
patients, including relatives and caregivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have welcomed more treatment choices because so many  
Americans don't get vaccinated. In addition, flu vaccine isn't 
always perfect, so treatments like Tamiflu or Relenza might be 
useful during flu outbreaks in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said Tamiflu has not yet been proved to prevent flu.  
</P>
<P>
	But a study published in Thursday's edition of the New England  
Journal of Medicine suggested it might reduce the chances of 
catching flu if unvaccinated people took it daily during flu 
season, which runs from November through April. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, was given to 520  
people for the first six weeks of the 1997-98 flu season. Just 1 
percent of them got the flu, compared with nearly 5 percent of a 
comparison group that took dummy pills, concluded University of 
Virginia researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman Charles Alfaro said the drug would  
be available to customers within a month. A retail price has not 
been set.

<HEADLINE> White House Maintains Sudan Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said Wednesday that President  
Clinton's national security advisers have not second-guessed the 
decision to bomb a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan in retaliation 
for terrorist bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's national security team  
recommended unanimously last year to proceed with plans for a 
missile attack on the factory, which was supposedly linked to Osama 
bin Laden, the suspected mastermind behind the embassy attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's national security team felt very strongly at  
the time that there was a real and imminent threat to our national 
security interests. They believe the same today,'' Lockhart said. 
``I believe very strongly that we took the right steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plant's owner, Salah Idris, is thinking of suing the United  
States to recover the $30 million cost of rebuilding the plant. He 
has denied any connection to bin Laden or terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has freed $25 million of Idris'  
assets that were previously frozen, but also says its soil samples 
have proven the plant was manufacturing a chemical used to make VX 
nerve gas. Idris has said the plant made medicines, including 
treatments for malaria and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, as well as an alleged terrorist stronghold in  
Afghanistan, were destroyed Aug. 20, 1998 in response two weeks 
earlier of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 
people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Remembered at Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- His eyes glassy as he stared into space, Davis  
Love III talked about the legacy Payne Stewart left behind and the 
devastation a family feels when a father and friend is killed in a 
plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Love knows.  
</P>
<P>
	His father, a golf pro and respected teacher, died in a plane  
crash 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who has lost a loved one in any type of accident knows  
a little bit how they are feeling,'' he said. ``It is very, very 
difficult to understand all those emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he heard news of Stewart's death on Monday, Love returned  
home to Georgia to be with his family, explaining to his two young 
children that ``we put a lot of faith in machines, and they break 
sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last place he wanted to be was at Champions Golf Club. The  
last thing he wanted to do was to play golf, no matter now much 
money was at stake in the Tour Championship. The last people he 
wanted to see were reporters or well-wishers, which made him dread 
returning to the tour after his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Love came to a different conclusion.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to show our support out here better than we would  
all fractioned off at home,'' he said. ``We can shed a lot of light 
on Payne Stewart by playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship will start a little early on Thursday. The  
29 players in the field, PGA Tour officials and hundreds of fans 
will gather around the first tee at 7:45 a.m. for a memorial 
service for Stewart. Tom Lehman will offer a prayer. A lone 
bagpiper will walk down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	The first shot will be struck at 8:39 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will still be the focus from the first round through the  
trophy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not playing golf, I don't know how else we can honor  
him,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``There's not much 
of a forum to remind people about Payne. This provides us a way to 
tell what he was all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first day will feature 27 holes, followed by a day off to  
honor Stewart, whose memorial service will be at 11 a.m. in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad we're taking the day off so we can go to the  
services,'' said Hal Sutton, the defending champion. ``He deserves 
his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said a collection of private planes will take whoever  
wants to go to the service Friday morning. A larger jet has been 
chartered for players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in 
Mississippi to go to the services. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Stewart's wife, Tracey, ``was very pleased that we were  
creating a situation where the players had an opportunity to attend 
the service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether all 29 players from the Tour  
Championship would attend. Love said he has had trouble going to 
such services ever since his father died, and would advise players 
not to go if they didn't feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to leave Thursday night and spend time with Mark  
O'Meara in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to hug the guys that want to be hugged and  
cry with the guys that want to cry,'' Love said. ``Go ahead and get 
your grieving process started. I think that's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love played nine holes with three of his teammates from the  
Ryder Cup -- David Duval, Phil Mickelson and Justin Leonard. Ryder 
Cup captain Ben Crenshaw showed up Wednesday to spend time with 
some of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his two U.S. Opens or the PGA Championship, memories of  
Stewart usually start with his passion for the Ryder Cup. Love was 
paired with him in the first alternate-shot match on opening day, a 
halve against Padraig Harrington and Miguel Angel Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mystified why Ben Crenshaw would ever pair me with Payne  
Stewart,'' he said. ``After four or five holes I said, `Now I know. 
You want to teach me a lesson on how to take my excitement and my 
passion and my nervousness and my desire to win, and put it into my 
game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thanked Payne twice that day for what he taught me during  
that match,'' Love said. ``I said, `I'm sorry we didn't win, but 
it's going to help me in the future.' It did. It helped me on 
Sunday (a decisive victory over Jean Van de Velde). We all will 
remember the Ryder Cup for a lot of reasons, but now I think it 
will be even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship, the final PGA Tour event of the year, has  
a $5 million purse with $900,000 going to the winner. Finchem said 
the $80,000 for last place would be given to Stewart's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the first-tee service at Champions, a service is  
scheduled Thursday night after the first round of the PGA Tour 
event in Mississippi. In Europe, players in the Volvo Masters in 
Spain said they would observe a moment of silence on the 18th green 
after Friday's round. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some talk players in the Tour Championship would wear  
knickers, the clothing that made Stewart the most recognizable 
player in golf, during the final round on Sunday, although Finchem 
said that likely would not be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	More important to him, and to Love, was long-range plans to  
commemorate Stewart. One possibility was the tour naming an award 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Love's thoughts primarily were with Stewart's two children,  
13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron, and with the families of 
the other five victims in the crash. He remembers what it was like 
to lose a father in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing I'm going to watch out for over the next few  
years is how we can help those children remember their father,'' he 
said. ``Hopefully, we can help Aaron and Chelsea understand that 
eventually the memories of their father will be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will still live on -- definitely in golf, but he will live  
on as a great father.''

<HEADLINE> Letters Threaten Primate Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Dozens of researchers working on monkeys  
at universities across the country received threatening letters 
booby-trapped with razor blades, and an animal rights group claimed 
responsibility on an Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been no reports of injuries Wednesday, but FBI  
investigators were warning scientists to take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	The group ``Justice Department,'' believed to be based in  
Britain, claimed it sent letters to more than 80 scientists at 
schools including Tulane University in New Orleans, Emory 
University in Atlanta and state universities in California, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	A typewritten letter sent to one Harvard University researcher  
said: ``You have been targeted and you have until autumn of 2000 to 
release all your primate captives and get out of the vivisection 
industry. If you do not heed our warning, your violence will be 
turned back upon you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A list of its intended targets was discovered on the Web site  
over the weekend by a watchdog group, which notified the targeted 
schools. It was unclear how many letters were opened. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six Harvard researchers received booby-trapped letters,  
as did six at Emory, four at the University of Wisconsin, six at 
the University of Washington, four in the state of Oregon, and 
three at the University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's immoral, it's uncivilized,'' said Kevin Smith, vice  
chancellor of research at the University of California at Davis. 
``It's terrorism from people who say, `We value life -- but if you 
don't stop, we'll kill you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The blades were concealed in plain white envelopes bearing Las  
Vegas postmarks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The razor blades were inside the top flap so that if you were  
to run your finger through the envelope the way most people do, you 
would have been cut,'' said Dr. Peter Gerone of the Delta Regional 
Primate Center in Covington, La., whose secretary used a letter 
opener to open the rigged envelope Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of what they've (scientists) accomplished is very good,''  
said psychology professor Gene Sackett, who does behavioral 
research with macaque monkeys at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the treatment of animals in labs had improved and with  
the advent of genetic medicine, primate research will become even 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
	``With genetic approaches to everything from cancer to behavior,  
the safety of these things have got to be tested on primates,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fact sheet on an animal rights Web site claims the group has  
carried out attacks in Britain, Canada and British Columbia, 
including sending out envelopes with ``rat poison covered razor 
blades'' to hunting guides.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Flu Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *By LAURAN NEERGAARD    	
</P>
<P>
                         *AP Medical Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flu sufferers are about to get a second new  
drug that promises to ease miserable influenza symptoms a little 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Tamiflu,  
the first pill effective against both types A and B flu. Tamiflu 
joins a competing but inhaled drug, Relenza, that the FDA approved 
earlier to also fight both flu types. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts say neither drug should replace flu vaccines --  
the shots clearly offer people a better chance at staying flu-free 
all winter. The flu kills 20,000 Americans a year, a toll doctors 
say would drop if more people got vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	But doctors also welcome the new treatments because so many  
Americans forgo vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
	Older flu medicines worked against only the type A flu, which  
accounts for about two-thirds of the estimated 20 million U.S. flu 
cases yearly, and doctors have said those medicines didn't work 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu, manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche, helped reduce the  
duration and severity of flu symptoms in unvaccinated adults who 
agreed to be infected with influenza to test the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu is not a cure-all, the FDA warned. Studies showed taking  
the drug helped patients recover only about a day faster than flu 
patients who took a dummy pill, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	To get that benefit, patients took Tamiflu within 40 hours of  
the first flu symptom -- meaning patients would have to recognize 
flu symptoms and get to the doctor to get the prescription-only 
pill rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects included nausea, vomiting, bronchitis, trouble  
sleeping and dizziness, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said Tamiflu has not yet been proved to prevent flu.  
</P>
<P>
	But a study published in today's edition of the New England  
Journal of Medicine suggests it might reduce the chances of 
catching flu if unvaccinated people took it daily during flu 
season. 
</P>

	Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, was given to 520  
people for the first six weeks of the 1997-98 flu season. Just 1 
percent of them got the flu, compared with nearly 5 percent of a 
comparison group that took dummy pills, concluded University of

<HEADLINE> Davidian Plaintiffs' Gun Test Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has brushed aside a  
challenge by lawyers for survivors of the 1993 Branch Davidian 
siege to participate in a demonstration that the lawyers contend 
would prove federal agents fired shots during the standoff's final 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting the offer, a legal team representing the government  
in a massive wrongful-death lawsuit headed to trial next May cited 
that litigation and uncertainty over the validity of the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Branch Davidians contend that infrared aerial  
surveillance footage shot by the FBI on April 19, 1993, proves that 
shots were fired by government agents into the compound near Waco, 
Texas -- a contention bureau officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers offered last week to put their theory to  
the test. They proposed a demonstration in which weapons similar to 
those carried by Davidians and federal agents alike would be fired 
at a Dallas-area firing range while a plane mounted with an 
infrared camera similar to the one used by the FBI would record the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have long insisted that no shots were fired  
into the Branch Davidians' retreat by government agents during the 
final hours of the 51-day siege. They also deny that their actions 
sparked the inferno that consumed the compound. Cult leader David 
Koresh and some 80 followers died during the blaze, some from the 
fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by the government's refusal to provide information  
about the infrared videotaping performed at Waco, the plaintiffs 
last week invited investigators for the government, Congress and 
the special counsel investigating Waco to witness the proposed 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	That offer was rejected Monday by Justice Department attorney  
Marie Louise Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and your experts are free to conduct whatever test you  
desire, based on whatever information you choose to believe to be 
accurate,'' she wrote Houston lawyer Michael Caddell, who 
represents most of the surviving Davidians and relatives of the 
dead in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it does appear from your letter that several of your  
assumptions about the facts, the science and the experts are in 
error, and may render useless any conclusions reached, it is your 
choice to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials cautioned last week that it would be ``near  
impossible'' to duplicate conditions, particularly since they say 
the plaintiffs lack crucial information about the altitude of the 
FBI plane that flew over the compound, the infrared camera's design 
specifications and film speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell, in an interview, said his experts know the film speed  
and altitude of the FBI ``Nightstalker'' plane, lacking only 
confirmation of the type of infrared camera used. The government 
has rejected several requests for that information, saying it is 
classified. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell wrote Ms. Hagen on Tuesday that he was ``disappointed''  
by the Justice Department's refusal to join in the test. ``You and 
your superiors at the Department of Justice continue to treat this 
matter as some sort of game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push Anti-Hate Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the father of a shooting victim  
supporting them, Democrats on Wednesday took up President Clinton's 
call for anti-hate crime legislation, calling the Republicans 
blocking it ``racially insensitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who leveled the charge, was  
joined by Democrats, religious leaders and Alan Stepakoff of Los 
Angeles, whose 6-year-old son Joshua was injured Aug. 10 by a 
gunman who raked the North Valley Jewish Community Center with 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers must ``send a clear message that our society is too  
mature a country, too great, to tolerate these kinds of crimes no 
matter where in the United States people live or travel,'' 
Stepakoff told reporters after noting that Joshua has recovered 
enough to play soccer again. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Republicans, Kennedy said: ``I don't think that  
there is any question that this leadership is racially insensitive 
to what is happening out across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The racism charge flared earlier this month when the Senate  
rejected the nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie 
White to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of 
Missouri. Democrats from Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of 
South Dakota to Rep. Maxine Waters of California accused 
Republicans of rejecting him because he is black; Republicans cited 
his record on the death penalty and drug enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, against the backdrop of an escalating budget  
fight, Democrats leveled the charge again as they pushed for 
Congress to take another look at legislation that would add crimes 
motivated by sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list 
of hate crimes -- race, religion, color or national origin -- already 
covered by federal law. Inclusion in the law means higher penalties 
for violators and gives federal prosecutors the option of stepping 
in if local authorities decline to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, however, say such legislation is repetitive  
and refuse to include it in spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``A crime is a crime,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey of  
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate included two versions of the legislation in a $39  
billion spending bill to fund the commerce, state and justice 
departments, but the House omitted it. Negotiators who reconciled 
the two ultimately left the hate crimes measure out of the final 
version Congress sent to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed the spending bill, in part because the hate  
crimes legislation was missing, and has demanded that Congress 
restore it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they were just rejecting a bad bill.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we have a policy dispute they decide to call us  
names,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. ``There's a general agreement among Republicans and 
a lot of other people that any crime is a hate crime and once you 
start classifying by group, you give special significance to which 
group is included and which is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have accused Republicans of being racist for refusing  
to protect specific groups from hate crimes in a year that saw mass 
shootings and murders of members of those groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were real compassionate conservatism, then hate  
crimes would be in the'' spending bill, said Sen. Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y. ``We cannot just talk about being compassionate and then say 
that it's okay to beat up someone ... because of their race or 
their creed or their color or their sexual orientation.''

	Demirchian was prominent in politics during two strongly  
contrasting periods. He was Armenia's Communist Party chief for 14 
years when it was part of the Soviet Union. He then returned to 
politics in 1998, becoming parliament speaker after losing his bid 
to become independent Armenia's president. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, he directed a semi-privatized electrical  
equipment factory. The factory stayed open even as Armenia's 
economy collapsed, and Demirchian's supporters saw that as evidence 
of business acumen. 
</P>
<P>
	Demirchian also represented stability to them: he was the  
Communist boss from 1974 to 1988, a period when life was relatively 
predictable, when pensions and wages were paid on time.

<HEADLINE> Purchase of King Papers Negotiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress and the family of Martin  
Luther King Jr. are negotiating a multimillion dollar deal that 
could make the Library of Congress the repository for the slain 
civil rights leader's most recent papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional Black  
Caucus, said Tuesday that Sotheby's auction house in New York has 
appraised the 80,000 pages of documents from King's last six years 
at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn said King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and sons Dexter  
King and Martin Luther King III have indicated in discussions with 
him a willingness to sell the papers to the library for $10 million 
below that appraisal. Clyburn introduced legislation last month 
authorizing the acquisition of the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All three seem willing to pursue that course,'' he said. ``We  
are still in negotiation but I feel relatively sure that if we can 
get the authorization done, we can move forward and get a number we 
can ask Congress for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-violent  
Social Change did not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking 
comment on the negotiations, the existence of which was first 
reported this week by Roll Call, a biweekly newspaper that covers 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorizing legislation is co-sponsored by Rep. J.C. Watts,  
R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican Conference; Rep. John 
Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights leader who was an associate of King; 
and Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn said both Republican and Democratic leaders in the House  
support the idea. He said he's hopeful Congress can complete the 
legislative work for the purchase before it leaves for the year in 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have asked Library of Congress officials to inspect  
the papers this week and ``stipulate to Congress that this $30 
million is what they're worth,'' Clyburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal Clyburn envisioned is completed, it would be far  
more than Congress has ever paid for a manuscript collection for 
the Library of Congress. The largest previous such outlay, said 
library spokeswoman Jill Brett, was $1.5 million in the early 1930s 
for the Vollbehr Collection of about 3,000 books from the 15th 
century, including one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg 
Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	With inflation, that $1.5 million would be about $14.6 million  
in today's dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Most documents in the library's manuscripts collection have been  
donated, Ms. Brett said, including the papers of 23 presidents, 38 
Supreme Court justices, and famous Americans such as Susan B. 
Anthony and Frederick Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manuscript collection is probably unparalleled in the  
world,'' she said. ``Martin Luther King was one of century's great 
figures, and certainly his papers would enhance our collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brett said the library first expressed an interest in  
acquiring King's papers two years before his assassination in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	King gave thousands of documents from the early years of his  
career to his alma mater, Boston University, which has housed them 
since 1964. The King family lost a lawsuit in 1993 to gain 
possession of those papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Emory University in Atlanta and Stanford University in Palo  
Alto, Calif., tried in 1997 to negotiate a deal with the King 
family for the 80,000 documents from the final six years of King's 
life, but neither school could close the deal.

<HEADLINE> Assante Acquires Steinberg's Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Leigh Steinberg, arguably the most  
powerful sports agent in America, sold his business Wednesday to a 
Canadian firm but will remain with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, whose marquee list of clients includes NFL  
quarterbacks Steve Young, Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe, Jake Plummer 
and Warren Moon, was named chief executive officer of Assante 
Sports Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
	He will continue to run the business he founded.  
</P>
<P>
	Assante Corp., which is based in Winnipeg and provides a variety  
of investment, marketing and personal services for its clients, is 
paying $120 million for Steinberg Moorad &AMP; Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newport Beach-based firm represents more than 150 football,  
baseball and basketball players, plus boxers, Olympic champions and 
retired athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Steinberg's company continues a trend of  
consolidation in the business, with the focus on marketing the 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX Entertainment Inc. earlier bought out agent Arn Tellem,  
whose client list included Albert Belle and Nomar Garciaparra; and 
bought out agent David Falk, whose clients included Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I started with (quarterback) Steve Bartkowski in 1975,  
there have been massive changes in our industry, with 150 TV 
stations on 24 hours a day, the development of the internet, and 
other opportunities such as videotape and video games,'' Steinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked with Warren, Drew, Steve and Troy, and they're  
excited about this, about it opening new doors for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move is Assante's first into the sports field, and chairman  
and CEO Marty Weinberg said the acquisition is ``consistent with 
our approach to partnering with preeminent firms in each of our 
chosen lines of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assante has more than 2,500 employees in 150 offices across  
North America and administers $22.3 billion in assets.

<HEADLINE> Domain Names Protection Bill Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to crack down on  
``cybersquatting,'' the pre-empting of Internet domain names with 
the aim of selling those names to companies or people with 
trademark associations to them. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed by voice, would bar the bad faith  
registration or trafficking in domain names that are identical to 
or confusingly similar to a distinctive trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also allow trademark owners to seek cancellation of an  
infringing domain name if they can prove they attempted but were 
unable to locate the owner of the name. 
</P>
<P>
	Domain names are the addresses computer users enter to access a  
particular Web site. They come between ``www'' and ``com,'' ``net'' 
or ``org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Current law is opening the commerce-rich Internet to pirates,  
crippling legitimate businesses and fattening the wallets of 
cyber-frauds,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., sponsor of the 
bill with Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would shore up consumer confidence in legitimate  
brand names and discourage fraudulent electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate in August approved a similar bill. The administration  
opposes the legislation, saying courts have been friendly to the 
victims of cybersquatting and it would be better to allow courts to 
develop a body of case law in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also expressed concern that the legislation  
could invite other countries to enact their own laws, leading to 
uncertainty and additional expense for trademark owners seeking to 
protect the value of their trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>

	The bill is H.R. 3028.

<HEADLINE> Britain Extends Modified Food Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain said Wednesday that it wants to extend  
planting trials of genetically modified food for another three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The government-sponsored trials are designed to test whether the  
crops pose any threat to the environment. None of the food may be 
grown commercially until all testing is complete and the government 
is satisfied the crops are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do this kind of work in a laboratory. We need a  
proper picture of what is going on in the countryside,'' said a 
spokesman for the government's genetic modification unit, speaking 
with customary anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetically modified, or GM, crops are plants whose genes are  
manipulated to produce characteristics such as resistance to pests. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States already has approved 50 varieties of  
genetically modified crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, which has yet to approve one, oversaw a test growing of  
crops in 10 large-scale fields across the country this year to 
gather information about their safety. Smaller trials also were 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Wednesday that plans for the continued  
testing call for 75 large-scale trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Each will be around 25 acres in size. Planting is likely to  
start next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	GM food has been a contentious subject in Britain. The British  
press, unlike that in the United States and much of the rest of 
Europe, has campaigned against genetic modification, with tabloids 
carrying banner headlines about ``Frankenstein Foods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many major supermarkets and food manufacturers have banned GM  
ingredients.

<HEADLINE>  Gunmen Murder Armenian Lawmakers </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Gunmen seized Armenia's parliament in a  
torrent of automatic weapons fire Wednesday, killing the prime 
minister and at least six other people before holing up in the 
building with dozens of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the captives were released early Thursday,  
nearly 10 hours after the siege began. The attackers didn't explain 
the release. 
</P>
<P>
	With the bodies of Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian and  
Parliament Speaker Karen Demirchian still on the podium where they 
fell, the attackers demanded to see the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it was a coup and called on the journalists to  
inform people about it. They said they were going to punish the 
authorities for what they did to the nation,'' said one reporter 
who was in the chamber during the afternoon attack. 
</P>
<P>
	As day turned to night, police said up to five gunmen held  
dozens of hostages in the main chamber of the parliament building. 
A man identified as the gunmen's leader, Nairi Unanian, spoke in a 
telephone interview with a local television station. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a patriotic action,'' he said. ``This shake-up is  
needed for the nation to regain its senses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the deaths were unintended except for Sarkisian, who he  
claimed had failed to serve the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The country is in a catastrophic situation, people are hungry  
and the government doesn't offer any way out,'' Unanian said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armenian television broadcast footage of the stunning attack,  
showing at least two men in long coats firing automatic weapons in 
the parliament chamber. Some lawmakers dove under their desks, 
others fled into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the attackers approached the prime minister and said:  
``Enough of drinking our blood,'' according to reporters present 
during the attack. The premier calmly responded, ``Everything is 
being done for you and the future of your children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attacker -- identified by reporters as Unanian, an extreme  
nationalist and former journalist -- opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The other gunmen included Unanian's brother and uncle, the  
reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack was likely to plunge Armenia into a major political  
crisis. The country, which became independent following the 1991 
Soviet collapse, has been plagued by political and economic turmoil 
for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he was shocked and saddened by the  
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I condemn the senseless act against individuals actively  
engaged in building democracy in their country,'' Clinton said in a 
statement. ``The victims and their families are in our thoughts and 
prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police and soldiers ringed the parliament building  
in central Yerevan. Two armored personnel carriers took up 
positions in the grounds and President Robert Kocharian was 
personally directing security operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen were demanding talks with Kocharian, the country's  
top leader, but officials did not say if any other demands had been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	A TV cameraman, Gagik Saratikian, who was allowed inside the  
chamber after the attack, said the gunmen appeared calm, directing 
him to film scenes in the wrecked hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not terrorists, be calm,'' he said one of the assailants  
told him. 
</P>
<P>
	His footage showed the bodies of Sarkisian and Demirchian  
sprawled on the podium, where they had been gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the attack was not clear, although speculation  
centered on the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has 
dominated Armenian politics for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The enclave was under the control of the neighboring Soviet  
republic of Azerbaijan, whose territory surrounded it. The enclave 
declared independence in early 1988 and drove Azerbaijani troops 
out with Armenia's help. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armenian government, although composed of nationalists such  
as Sarkisian who made their political careers by championing the 
enclave, has been seeking a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was in Yerevan on  
Wednesday as part of efforts to secure a deal, leaving just hours 
before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Unanian reportedly had been a member of the Armenian  
Revolutionary Federation, known as Dashnak, the country's oldest 
political grouping, founded as a secret nationalist organization in 
1890. The government has tried to suppress the group. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dashnak said Unanian had been expelled several years  
ago and the party had nothing to do with the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Sarkisian and Demirchian, the gunmen killed  
deputy speaker Yuri Bakhshian, Energy Minister Leonard Petrosian 
and senior economic official Mikhail Kotanian, according to Ararat 
Zurabian, a city spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruben Miroian, another deputy speaker, and Genrikh Abramian,  
another member of parliament, were also killed, said lawmaker Agvan 
Vardanian. He was being held hostage inside the parliament, and 
spoke to a local television network over his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other lawmakers were wounded in the attack, Health Minister  
Gike Nikogosian said. There were reports that some other people had 
been wounded, but officials could not confirm this. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Cabinet was attending a question-and-answer session in  
the parliament chamber at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarkisian, a 40-year-old former athletic instructor and Soviet  
propaganda official, was appointed premier by Kocharian last June. 
He was an ally of Demirchian, who was Armenia's Soviet-era leader. 
The two headed the hard-line Unity party. 
</P>
<P>
	Armenia's prime minister is appointed by the president.  
Sarkisian's death will not require the government to hold new 
elections.

<HEADLINE> A Look Back at Black Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The economy was on a tear.  
</P>
<P>
	Americans, earning more than they ever had before, filled their  
homes with the latest gadgets and machines. People stopped socking 
away money in savings accounts, betting instead that they could 
multiply their gains in the stock market. Companies that 
capitalized on the latest technology saw their stock prices 
quadruple in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
	If this sounds familiar, it's not surprising -- the same economic  
conditions apply today. But the year was 1929, the economy was on 
its way to a devastating reversal of fortune and on Oct. 29, the 
stock market collapsed, launching the Great Depression and creating 
a legacy that haunted Americans for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market watchers are quick to caution that for every  
similarity between the economy in the 1920s and the 1990s, there 
are plenty of differences that narrow the odds of a catastrophic 
market decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not likely to happen again,'' said William C. Freund,  
director of the Center for the Study of Equity Markets at Pace 
University in New York. ``The economy has become more and more 
stable, we know how to use fiscal policy, and there are whole new 
industries that contribute substantially to economic growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popular images of the 1929 crash suggest that the market  
collapsed entirely on Oct. 29, the day that became known as Black 
Tuesday. In truth, the market had been fragile since late summer. 
But in the last months of the Roaring Twenties, most Americans 
didn't notice, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1920s, technological advances had made it easier to  
mass produce automobiles and radios, bringing the newfangled goods 
within reach of more and more Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought they couldn't afford a new car or radio found  
they indeed could -- if they accepted a line of credit from the 
local bank. That transformed a generation of scrimpers and savers 
into increasingly acquisitive consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, more Americans were discovering the thrill and  
potentially high payoff of stock investing. Investors could buy 
stocks with credit, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buying on margin with borrowed money could make the profits  
even more astounding,'' said Robert S. McElvaine, chairman of the 
history department at Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. ``A lot of 
people got caught up in the stock market craze, cheering on the Dow 
like a baseball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1920s even had an equivalent of today's highflying Internet  
stocks. Shares of RCA, maker of radios and phonographs, soared 400 
percent in 1928 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the middle of 1929, many investors had borrowed so much  
money that the only way to repay loans was to sell stocks. Prices 
began to fall, and volume began to escalate as brokers demanded 
cash to cover their potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
	After steep selloffs during the week of Oct. 21, 1929, the  
market calmed down on Friday, Oct. 25, and traders dared to hope 
the damage was done. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a series of panicky days that proved to be  
prophetic,'' said Roy Neuberger, the 96-year-old founder of money 
management firm Neuberger &AMP; Berman. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Oct. 28, 1929, the Dow lost 38.33 points, which  
equaled 12.82 percent. And on Black Tuesday, the Dow dropped 
another 30.57 points, or 11.73 percent. A then-record 16.4 million 
shares changed hands, causing bedlam on the floor of the New York 
Stock Exchange as investors sent in orders faster than traders 
could possibly fill them. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and brokerages went out of business. The broader economy  
completely collapsed, putting many Americans out of work for years. 
Even once the economy revived after World War II, the stock market 
remained in a funk for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were averse to risk for a long time,'' said McElvaine.  
Throughout the 1950s, only the wealthiest Americans put their money 
in the market. But the years blurred memories, and in time, stocks 
attracted a wave of buyers who hadn't been scarred by the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The generation that really suffered through the greatest  
trauma is gone or on its way out,'' Freund said. ``It no longer 
affects investor psyche, although it did for a very great while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts won't say the market will never again crash as it did  
back then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything can happen,'' said Peter L. Bernstein, president of  
an economic consulting firm that bears his name. ``But the whole 
economic structure is so very different that I don't think we'll 
ever see anything like 1929.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, analysts say, the Federal Reserve has proven  
committed to stabilizing the economy before it falls too far, or 
soars too high. For another, structural changes at the nation's 
stock exchanges guarantee a more orderly market. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors' lengthening love affair with stocks could also guard  
against a downfall, argued Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no promise from God,'' he said. ``But investors have  
learned that over time, you can't lose by staying in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freund said the market would do well to hold on to waning  
memories of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a whole generation of money managers that have never  
even seen a downturn in the economy,'' Freund said. ``It's a 
sobering experience to go through hard times. It makes you 
appreciate the risk.''

<HEADLINE> British Minister Urges Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Failure to enact Northern  
Ireland's peace accord would be an ``unforgivable crime,'' 
Britain's senior minister here warned today. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson told political  
leaders that their failure to compromise now -- after two months of 
mediation by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell -- would mean 
``betrayal of another generation. It would be an absolutely 
unforgivable crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should underestimate just how important are the next  
few days for Northern Ireland,'' said Mandelson, whom Prime 
Minister Tony Blair appointed earlier this month to oversee policy 
in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	All eight parties that back last year's Good Friday accord  
gathered today for what they expect will be Mitchell's last few 
days trying to resolve bitter arguments about what the peace 
document actually means. 
</P>
<P>
	They were expecting Mitchell to put his own written suggestions  
on the table and to achieve a final verdict by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell primarily is trying to resolve the polarized positions  
of the Ulster Unionists, who represent most of Northern Ireland's 
British Protestant majority, and Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican 
Army-linked party rooted in the province's most hard-line Catholic 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past year, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble has  
refused to form the new Protestant-Catholic government upon which 
so much of the accord depends. It would have 12 Cabinet posts, 
including two for Sinn Fein, and gradually receive powers from the 
British government. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble insists the IRA must first start to disarm in  
cooperation with international weapons experts, which is another 
goal contained in the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein's negotiators insist they should receive government  
positions regardless of the IRA's rejection of the accord's section 
on disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord also expected the disarmament of Northern Ireland's  
two major outlawed pro-British groups -- the Ulster Defense 
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, who are jointly observing a 
1994 cease-fire. Both say they won't start disarming until the IRA 
does.

<HEADLINE> Howard Said Probing NCAA Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Howard University is conducting an  
investigation into possible NCAA rules violations in its men's 
basketball and baseball programs, The Washington Post reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA sent Howard an official letter of inquiry concerning  
the baseball program, university spokeswoman Donna Brock said. 
Sources told the Post the investigation concerns the use of 
ineligible players several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible violations in the men's basketball program came to  
light more recently and would have occurred since Kirk Saulny 
became coach last season, the sources said. The areas of inquiry 
are academics, recruiting and extra benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The university hired Robert L. Clayton, a New Orleans-based  
attorney, to conduct the investigation into the basketball program. 
The inquiry is in such early stages and Clayton and Howard 
officials are uncertain about the seriousness or scope of any 
possible violations, the sources said. Clayton confirmed he was 
retained by the university to conduct the internal investigation, 
but did not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	University President H. Patrick Swygert and athletic director  
Hank Ford did not respond to phone messages.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- DreamWorks SKG, Steven Spielberg's studio,  
has signed up to develop four additional films with British 
producer Aardman Animations, DreamWorks' partner on next year's 
animated movie ``Chicken Run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DreamWorks announced the agreement Wednesday. Aardman, based in  
Bristol, England, specializes in stop-motion clay animation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicken Run,'' due in theaters next June 23, features the  
voices of Mel Gibson and Miranda Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	The next animated film under discussion between DreamWorks and  
Aardman is ``The Tortoise and the Hare,'' based on Aesop's fable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not be more thrilled about this new creative  
partnership and am very excited about exploring the many 
storytelling possibilities of this unique art form with a company 
that is quite simply the best in the business,'' said Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, who founded DreamWorks with Spielberg and David Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
	Aardman, founded in 1976, has won three Academy Awards for the  
short animated films ``Creature Comforts,'' ``The Wrong Trousers'' 
and ``A Close Shave.''

<HEADLINE> Three Americans Kidnapped in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- Tribesmen in Yemen kidnapped three Americans  
and are demanding the release of 25 suspects detained in an attack 
on an oil pipeline, a security official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans -- a teacher based in the Yemeni capital and her  
visiting parents -- were abducted by gunmen as they returned to 
San`a from a trip to the south Tuesday, the official said. He spoke 
on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government ordered troops and tanks to encircle the  
suspected hideout of the kidnappers, who belong to the Bani Jabr 
tribe of the Habab Valley in Marib province, east of San`a, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, Marta R. Colburn, teaches at the American Institute  
for Yemeni Studies in San`a, said an institute employee who also 
spoke on condition of anonymity. Colburn is from Portland, Ore., 
where she was formerly deputy director Middle East studies at 
Portland State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy confirmed the hostages were Americans but  
refused to give their identities or other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The security official said the kidnappers were demanding the  
release of 25 fellow tribesmen who were detained in connection with 
the blowing up an oil pipeline on Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The abductions came nine days after the government executed Zein  
Al-Abidine al-Mihdar, an Islamic leader who was convicted of 
abducting 16 Western tourists, four of whom died in a botched 
rescue attempt in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemeni tribesmen often kidnap foreigners to pressure the  
government into providing money or better services, such as new 
roads, for their impoverished areas. The kidnappers usually release 
the hostages unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Spokesman Moves to Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's presidential campaign hired two  
aides away from the White House today as the vice president 
continued to fill out his new Tennessee headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Lehane, official spokesman to the vice president, moves to  
the campaign full time to replace press secretary Kiki Moore, who 
decided earlier this month not to move to Nashville, Tenn., for 
personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Harvard Law School, Lehane had served the  
administration as special assistant counsel to President Clinton 
and special counsel for Secretary Andrew Cuomo at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Marabeti, the White House's associate director of  
presidential personnel, will serve as Gore's director of human 
resources, overseeing Tennessee volunteer programs and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Also joining the campaign, according to a statement from  
campaign chairman Tony Coelho, is Donnie Fowler, Gore's new 
national field director. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler was New Hampshire field director for President Clinton's  
1996 re-election campaign. He is the son of Don Fowler, former 
chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

defeated the Chunichi Dragons 3-0 Wednesday, moving within one 
victory of winning their first Japan Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who won the Pacific League pennant for the first time

Chihiro Hamana and Kokubo singled home the second run in the third 
inning for the Hawks. In the sixth, Kokubo hit his first homer of 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoshino was relieved by Takayuki Shinohara in the seventh. In

<HEADLINE> Eagles' QB Questions 'Getting Old' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Donovan McNabb practically guffaws every  
time he hears it. Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid twitches his 
mustache, scrunches his chin and composes what seems like his 
1,000th answer to the same question. 
</P>
<P>
	When will McNabb play?  
</P>
<P>
	Even McNabb, the No. 2 draft pick who wants to play more than  
anything, seems tired of the quarterback quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my call,'' McNabb said Wednesday, repeating himself  
for the umpteenth time. ``If it happens, it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the day's mental calisthenics were done, an  
ever-so-miniscule bit of news emerged: Though Doug Pederson will 
start at quarterback against the New York Giants on Sunday, Reid is 
not averse to giving McNabb more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be out of place for him to play in the first half  
if I feel that the time's right and the situation's right for 
him,'' Reid said. ``That's why it virtually becomes a game-day 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is either unsure of how he wants to work McNabb into the  
rotation, or he's merely giving the Giants something extra to worry 
about. Given Reid's strict attention to detail and meticulous 
planning, the latter is the obvious answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm truly not opposed to putting Donovan in the game, giving  
him a little time and then replacing him with Doug,'' Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Every week, Reid's vague answers open the door to a laundry list  
of questions. How will he decide? Is McNabb ready? Is he a slow 
learner? Is there a chance he won't start a single game this 
season? 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, there is,'' Reid said flatly, further fueling the debate.  
</P>
<P>
	McNabb clearly isn't holding his breath for an extended chance.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whether you play a quarter, play a half, play a series, it's  
just getting out there,'' McNabb said. ``You want to play more, but 
if you don't play at all you've just got to get ready for next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch, the quarterback picked ahead of McNabb, is starting  
for Cleveland. Akili Smith, the quarterback picked after McNabb, is 
starting for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see that and not be part of that, it might hit you hard,''  
McNabb said. ``But they're in a different situation than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York (4-3) and Philadelphia (2-5) meet for the second time  
in less than a month. The Giants won the first game 16-15 at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson had a terrible game, going 6-for-15 for 75 yards and  
two interceptions. He all but benched himself after the game, 
saying he would understand if Reid made a quarterback change. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid didn't, and the Eagles won two straight before losing to  
Miami 16-13 on Sunday. The loss, and a mediocre performance by 
Pederson, led to more quarterback questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be shocked if there weren't a quarterback  
controversy,'' center Steve Everitt said. ``I've been playing seven 
years, and I've always been involved in one. It's just different 
characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Pederson, ``You lose on Sunday, all that stuff creeps back  
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Reid had to admit that the speculation about who plays  
quarterback ``gets old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterbacks couldn't agree more.

<HEADLINE> Florida State Senator Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A state senator pleaded guilty to conspiracy in a  
Medicare fraud case and must resign from the Legislature, where he 
has served for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Alberto Gutman and his wife, Marci, were charged last  
year as the secret owners of companies that billed Medicare for 
health care services that were not performed, sometimes for clients 
who did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Republican maintained his innocence until his plea  
deal was announced Tuesday in the second week of his federal trial. 
Prosecutors said Gutman and his wife collected at least $2 million 
from fraudulent billings while he served in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutman, 40, declined comment Tuesday. He is expected to be given  
a two-year prison term at his sentencing Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	As a convicted felon, Gutman must relinquish his Senate seat.  
Gov. Jeb Bush will set a special election once Gutman's resignation 
letter is received, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gutman, 40, pleaded guilty last month to a misdemeanor  
Medicare fraud charge and was sentenced to three years' probation 
and six months' home confinement. She also agreed to pay $15,000 in 
restitution. The Gutmans have two children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gutmans were indicted along with 23 other defendants in the  
investigation of Mederi of Dade County Inc., a home health care 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they found no legitimate billings among $15  
million worth of Mederi claims. The company and its owner were 
acquitted in May; a physical therapist was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Gutman used voter lists from his district to  
telemarket his home health-care companies and that checks from the 
enterprise were deposited in his personal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said key witnesses were trying to protect  
themselves by testifying against an innocent public official. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutman was elected to the state House in 1984 and moved on to  
the state Senate in 1992. He narrowly won another four-year term 
while under indictment last November.

<HEADLINE> Texas Monk Convicted of Indecency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSON CITY, Texas (AP) -- A monk was found guilty of indecency  
with a child on Wednesday for his relationship with a boy at a 
monastery in east Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan I. Hitt, 38, known as Father Jeremiah, was convicted on  
eight counts stemming from incidents at the Christ of the HIlls 
Monastery in the summer of 1997. The monastery is near Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
	He could face up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of  
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old victim, who was a novice monk studying at the  
monastery, testified during the weeklong trial that he had several 
sexual encounters with Hitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite feeling awkward about the episodes, the youth testified  
he didn't object on the advice of Sam A. Greene Jr., the spiritual 
leader of the religious enclave. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, 54, known as Father Benedict, also was charged with  
indecency with a child. He hasn't yet gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother testified he had struggled in public school and  
that she had hoped the monks would provide individualized lessons 
and serve as father figures for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Orthodox Church recently broke ties with the  
monastery. 
</P>
<P>
	Christ of the Hills opened near Blanco in 1980 and is best known  
for its icon of the Virgin Mary that is said to weep tears of 
myrrh.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Spar in N.H. Debate </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
                        *AP Political Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Pressed in campaign debate about President  
Clinton's personal behavior, Al Gore said Wednesday night he shared 
the public's disappointment and anger over the Monica Lewinsky 
affair and sought to provide ``as much continuity and stability'' 
as possible during the impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend,'' the vice president said of Clinton, fielding  
the first question from a voter in the first debate with 
presidential campaign rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, too, was pressed on a potential campaign softspot,  
Gore's criticism of his Senate retirement in 1996 at a time when 
Republicans had taken control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things I wanted to do I couldn't do in the Senate,'' he  
said, referring to stops at Stanford, in the private sector and at 
Notre Dame. In a gentle jab at Gore, who has been in government 
continuously since 1976, Bradley said that by leaving office, he 
had been able to ``encounter people where they live their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a followup poke, he added, ``If you're going to do this, you  
ought to deal with the big problems and you ought to have big 
solutions to big problems.'' Clinton often has been criticized for 
advocating bite-size solutions to problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley sat on stools in a Dartmouth College auditorium  
for the 60-minute debate, co-sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV. The 
first primary election ballots of the 2000 campaign will be cast in 
New Hampshire in February, and the polls show Bradley with a lead, 
having overcome Gore's enormous early advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore sought to take the offensive 15 minutes before the  
television cameras were switched on -- and again as the scheduled 
hour was wrapping up, when he said he would gladly remain to answer 
any remaining questions. 
</P>
<P>
	He took questions for more 90 minutes after the TV lights dimmed  
and Bradley departed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage for introductions, the vice president turned to the  
audience and said: ``What do we do now? ... Why don't you start 
asking some question while we're waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, members of the audience did.  
</P>
<P>
	The first question was about bipartisanship, and both pledged to  
work with Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few moments into the debate, Gore was asked about  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward  
President Clinton, and I felt it myself. I also feel that the 
American people want to move on and turn the page and focus on the 
future and not the past,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend. I took an oath under the Constitution to serve  
my country through thick and thin, and I interpreted that oath to 
mean that I ought to try to provide some -- as much continuity and 
stability during the time that you're referring to as I possibly 
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also noted there were ``some real hard fights'' on economic  
and other issues at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rivals pledged their support to an overhaul of campaign  
finance laws, to reduce the role of big money. And they agreed, in 
general terms, about the need to expand health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	On military involvement overseas, Bradley advocated a United  
States role -- but not ``full responsibility'' -- in multilateral 
groups like the United Nations and NATO. ``There is no way we have 
the resources or the wisdom to be involved in all 32 ethnic wars in 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to identify his biggest mistake, Gore replied sheepishly,  
``My choice of words when I claimed to have taken the lead in the 
Congress for inventing the Internet'' -- a comment that earned him 
ridicule from Republicans and standup comics alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe the characteristics of effective leadership,  
Gore said, a president must have a ``vision of the future'' and 
feel compelled to strive towards it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said ``absolute integrity'' is essential.  
</P>
<P>
	The debate rules weren't designed for the two men to address one  
another directly. 
</P>
<P>
	But at one point, Bradley took issue with a claim about his  
health insurance proposal that Gore had made. ``I dispute the cost 
figure that Al has used,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spoke emphatically about his support for gay rights.  
</P>
<P>
	``I support gays being able to serve openly in the military. If  
gays can serve openly in the White House, in Congress, in the 
courts, in the Treasury Department ... why can't they serve in the 
military?'' he asked. ``It just doesn't make any sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gore got a similar question, he said Bradley's answer had  
been eloquent, then followed up by saying he supports legal 
protection for same-sex domestic partnerships, but ``not the same 
sacrament, not the same name,'' as marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the television audience was problematic -- the show  
was aired at the same time as Game 4 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign put a full-court press on Bradley, providing  
itemized, written rebuttals to his answers during the debate and 
dispatching three Cabinet members to tout his performance to 
reporters afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Hauser, Bradley's press secretary, spoke for the former New  
Jersey senator, saying his candidate had been responsible and 
direct, and that the numbers Gore used in criticizing his health 
care proposal were suspect. ``On budget issues the vice president 
has no credibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers cautioned him before the debate to avoid appearing  
too negative, though he was poised to seize on any question that 
gave him an opening to question Bradley's proposals or commitment 
to the party. Bradley's team had him ready to respond if Gore went 
on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate was held in the context of new Democratic polling  
that underscored Bradley's surge. A Quinnipiac College survey 
released Tuesday showed him leading Gore 47 percent to 39 percent 
in New Hampshire, just outside the margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has pulled even in New York and has narrowed the vice  
president's lead in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Two polls released Wednesday showed that Bradley trails Gore  
nationally, though he has gained ground since July and April, 
respectively. Other polls suggest that Gore has slowed his slide in 
national polls this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president had expressed no interest in debating until  
Bradley dashed his hopes for an easy primary contest. Gore now says 
he wants to debate weekly, though the campaigns have agreed on only 
a handful of dates before the first votes are cast in Iowa's Jan. 
24 caucuses.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The last cattle auction in the Omaha  
Stockyards' 116-year history ended Wednesday morning with the sale 
of a pregnant Longhorn cow. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 people scattered around a horseshoe-shaped auction ring  
clapped, then began making plans for a goodbye toast to what was 
once the largest livestock market in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these people are here to party,'' said Gary Heuwinkel,  
a commission agent at the stockyards for 23 years. ``They wanted to 
be here for the last day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Omaha Livestock Market will move Monday to Red Oak, Iowa.  
The city of Omaha will tear down the stockyards' pens and barns to 
make way for a business park. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last live auction at the institution, 56 cows, bulls  
and feeder cattle were sold.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Explain Absence From Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush, who is skipping a debate Thursday night with his GOP rivals, 
has scheduled an interview with a local television station to 
explain his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to explain to the people of New Hampshire why he  
isn't going to be there and to answer questions that might have 
been asked at the debate,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will appear by satellite from Dallas on WMUR-TV at 6 p.m.  
EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
presidential nomination, is feeling the heat for missing GOP 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a schedule conflict kept him from the initial debate  
last week in New Hampshire, and he says can't attend Thursday's 
event because he wants to be with his wife when she receives an 
alumni award from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is scheduled to attend a GOP debate on Dec. 2.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of Bush's rivals branded his absence from last Friday's  
debate as an ``insult'' to the people of New Hampshire, and the 
criticism continued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is George Bush skipping a debate for the second  
consecutive time but he's thumbing his nose at the people of New 
Hampshire,'' said McCain spokesman Dan Schnur.

<HEADLINE> Purchase of King Papers Negotiated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The family of Martin Luther King Jr. has  
indicated a willingness to sell 80,000 pages of the slain civil 
rights leader's papers to the Library of Congress for $10 million 
below their appraised value, the chairman of the Congressional 
Black Caucus says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said Tuesday he's discussed the  
purchase of the papers from the final six years of King's life with 
his widow, Coretta Scott King, and his sons, Dexter King and Martin 
Luther King III. And he's introduced legislation authorizing the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``All three seem willing to pursue that course,'' he said. ``We  
are still in negotiation but I feel relatively sure that if we can 
get the authorization done, we can move forward and get a number we 
can ask Congress for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn said Sotheby's auction house in New York last week  
appraised the 80,000 pages of King documents at $30 million. He 
said lawmakers have asked officials from the Library of Congress to 
inspect the papers this week and tell Congress that they're worth 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent  
Social Change in Atlanta, where the documents now are housed, did 
not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking comment on the 
negotiations. The talks were first reported this week by Roll Call, 
a semiweekly newspaper that covers Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorizing legislation is co-sponsored by Rep. J.C. Watts,  
R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican Conference; Rep. John 
Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights leader who was an associate of King; 
and Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyburn said Republican and Democratic leaders in the House were  
supportive of the idea. He said he was hopeful that both the 
authorizing legislation and the actual appropriation to purchase 
the papers could be approved by Congress before it adjourned for 
the year in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal envisioned by Clyburn is completed, it would be by  
far the most Congress has ever paid for a manuscript collection for 
the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Brett, a spokeswoman for the library, said the largest  
previous outlay by Congress was $1.5 million in the early 1930s for 
the Vollbehr Collection of about 3,000 books from the 15th century, 
including one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible. 
Adjusted for inflation, that would amount to $14.6 million today. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the documents in the library's manuscripts collection  
have been donated to the library, Ms. Brett said, including the 
papers of 23 presidents, 38 Supreme Court justices, as well as 
famous Americans such as Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manuscript collection is probably unparalleled in the  
world,'' she said. ``Martin Luther King was one of century's great 
figures, and certainly his papers would enhance our collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brett said the library first expressed an interest in  
acquiring King's papers two years before his assassination in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	King donated thousands of documents from the early years of his  
career to his alma mater, Boston University, which has housed them 
since 1964. The King family lost a lawsuit in 1993 to gain 
possession of the papers at Boson University. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Emory University in Atlanta and Stanford University in  
California negotiated with the King family 1997 to become the 
repository for the 80,000 documents from the final six years of 
King's life, but neither school could close the deal.

<HEADLINE> Building To Be Named for Eisenhower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Eisenhower's name would grace  
Washington's most distinguished office building under legislation 
sent to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The ornate Old Executive Office Building -- now occupied by the  
vice president and White House branch staff -- would become the 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building under legislation 
passed Tuesday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed the bill last week.  
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower served in the building in the early 1930s as an aide  
to Gen. Douglas MacArthur and is credited with saving it from 
demolition during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenhower, an Army general and native of Denison, Texas, who  
grew up in Abilene, Kan., led the Allied invasion of Europe and 
became the nation's 34th president. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Kansas GOP Sen. Bob Dole lobbied for the change as  
``something that will touch the heart of every World War II 
veteran, indeed every American who remembers Dwight D. Eisenhower 
as one of America's greatest 20th century leaders in peace and 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is one of the final legislative accomplishments of  
longtime Rhode Island Sen. John Chafee, the Republican committee 
chairman with jurisdiction over the building. Chafee died Sunday 
night.

<HEADLINE> Racing Resumes in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- It was not smooth sailing Wednesday  
for the America's Cup challenger series. 
</P>
<P>
	America True and Nippon asked for delays because of gear  
failures, Young America turned up late, and the Swiss and French 
teams didn't show at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials voided the result of a race which would have completed  
Italy's Prada team's sweep of round-robin 1 of the regatta to 
decide who will face Team New Zealand for sailing's prized trophy 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada easily beat Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000, Italian skipper  
Francesco de Angelis' 10th win in 10 starts. But Abracadabra 
successfully protested, complaining it had not had enough time to 
prepare for the race after its morning race was postponed because 
of strong wind conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the same reason, officials also voided the result of the  
afternoon race between Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes and Young 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two races are scheduled to be rerun Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, Stars and Stripes easily defeated Young  
America, which missed the start after returning to port because of 
a gear failure and started the race a full leg behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada, the Spanish team and Japan's Nippon all received wins  
after the teams they were supposed to race -- the French and the 
Swiss -- forfeited by staying in port to work on their boats. 
</P>
<P>
	America One's final two races Tuesday were postponed until  
Thursday while the team repairs damage from a collision with Stars 
and Stripes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	America True and Nippon met in another morning race, and even  
that was delayed after gear failures on both boats. Nippon skipper 
Peter Gilmour beat Dawn Riley's America True in pre-start 
maneuvers, leaving the Americans stalled as the gun fired. Gilmour 
took the wind advantage and finished the first upwind leg 10 boat 
lengths in front.

<HEADLINE> Daiei Hawks Lead Japan Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGOYA, Japan (AP) -- Hiroki Kokubo drove in two runs and Junji  
Hoshino allowed three hits in 6 1/3 innings as the Daiei Hawks 
defeated the Chunichi Dragons 3-0 Wednesday, moving within one 
victory of winning their first Japan Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who won the Pacific League pennant for the first time  
in the team's 11-year history, lead the best-of-7 series 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	They could end the series in Game 5 Thursday at the Nagoya Dome,  
home of the Central League champion Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	Koji Akiyama doubled home the first run after an infield hit by  
Chihiro Hamana and Kokubo singled home the second run in the third 
inning for the Hawks. In the sixth, Kokubo hit his first homer of 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoshino was relieved by Takayuki Shinohara in the seventh. In  
the bottom of the ninth, reliever Rodney Pedraza got Leo Gomez to 
ground into a game-ending double play for his first save of the 
series.

<HEADLINE> Wild Horses Moved After Nev. Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Federal officials say they need to move about  
1,500 wild horses from their traditional rangeland because fires 
burned the wild grasses they live on, but animal rights activists 
say authorities are evicting the horses to help ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Stanley, a lawyer for the Animal Rights Defense Fund,  
said Wednesday that the Bureau of Land Management is violating the 
National Environmental Policy Act and the Wild Free Roaming Horse 
and Burros Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said the herds of up to 1,500 mustangs and wild  
burros being rounded up by helicopters could starve because fires 
burned up their food supply -- more than 1 million acres of grass 
and brush. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists said enough grass survived to feed the herds, and the  
BLM just wants to get rid of the horses because ranchers see them 
as competition for livestock grazing forage. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's director for Nevada, Bob Abbey, issued a statement  
taking ``exception to the questioning of BLM's motives .... Our 
goal is to have viable and healthy wild horse and burro herds on 
public lands in Nevada where resources can sustain them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said younger horses will be sent to the BLM's  
Palomino Valley adoption center near Reno, while older horses will 
end up at a BLM sanctuary in Bartlesville, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stanley said the agency failed to hold a required public  
hearing before using helicopters on the roundup, and also failed to 
prepare an environmental assessment of the roundups. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 40,000 wild horses roam the West, about half of  
them in Nevada. Roundups occur regularly to help guard against 
overpopulation and some mustangs are sold at auctions.

<HEADLINE> Women Golfers Win $2M Against Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Nine female golfers who said they were given  
terrible tee times and denied other country club benefits because 
of their gender were awarded nearly $2 million Wednesday by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the damages -- from a Superior Court jury of seven  
men and seven women -- even surprised attorneys for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a case which puts country clubs and other  
institutions on notice that women have a right to the same 
opportunities as men,'' said Assistant Attorney General Anthony 
Rodriguez, whose office represented the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Owens, the attorney for the Haverhill Country Club, said  
there was no discrimination at the club, called the damages 
excessive and promised to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The women claimed in their 1995 suit that they were denied the  
club's most sought-after memberships, called ``primary 
memberships,'' and the benefits that went with them. The club began 
offering such memberships to women in 1992, but the lawsuit said 
the directors manipulated the waiting list so only a few women 
received them. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens said the women who sued weren't willing to pay the higher  
fees for the primary memberships. Rodriguez said the club's board 
of directors did not adequately inform women how to become primary 
members, nor did they tell applicants they had to pay extra fees.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Worldwide Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. plans to race the clock around  
the globe Monday evening by putting an unusually lengthy two-minute 
commercial before a potential audience of a billion viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's second-biggest automaker has cobbled together a  
global collection of television networks that will carry the ad 
aimed at raising its corporate profile at about 9 p.m. local time 
in most markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial subtly showcases all seven of Ford's automobile  
brands, suggesting in a montage of emotional vignettes that its 
products fit seamlessly into people's lives around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it shows a war veteran riding in a Ford Mustang  
convertible in a homecoming parade, an Italian couple embracing in 
front of a Volvo, a well-dressed woman putting her sleek dogs in 
the back seat of a Jaguar and Japanese girls playing in cherry 
blossoms near a Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad, shot in nine countries by the agency J. Walter Thompson,  
carries the Ford logo near the start and at the end but there is no 
narrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The often disconnected images are held together by the song  
``Just Wave Hello,'' written expressly for Ford and sung by the 
14-year-old soprano Charlotte Church. Waving people appear in many 
scenes, their actions sometimes matching the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad is being shown two months ahead of the year 2000, and  
Ford officials said the timing signals their intent to make the 
company the global leader in automotive products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	James C. Schroer, vice president of global marketing for Ford,  
said Wednesday in an interview he hopes viewers ``come to the 
conclusion that Ford Motor Co. has a heart and soul and has the 
kind of people and products that people will want to get to know 
better and will trust us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroer declined to say how much it cost to run the ad globally  
but he said one published estimate of $10 million was conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grubbs, who oversees the ad agency BBDO's purchases of  
national commercial time for clients like Pepsi-Cola, Visa and 
Federal Express, said Ford's plans represented ``a pretty big 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most difficult things today is how to break through  
the clutter and get impact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday nights typically attract TV's biggest audiences  
of the week, and he said a two-minute commercial is bound to get 
attention simply because it is four times longer than the typical 
30-second ad. Announcing the plans in advance will also help. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may actually get some people to tune in for curiosity's  
sake to see what is up with this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will run on 38 different networks in the United States  
alone, including the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and WB. 
Due to the time differences across the U.S., viewers in the 
ZMidwest will see the ad at 8 p.m. local time while those on the 
West coast could see it on some cable networks as early as 6 p.m. 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroer said he expects the ad will reach 300 million households  
and one billion people globally the first night. 
</P>
<P>
	After its initial run, Ford plans to continue running one-minute  
versions of the ad through the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad wasn't designed to trigger an immediate sales surge,  
Schroer said. He intends to watch how many people go to Ford's Web 
sites for more information after the commercial runs and how many 
people mention the ad when they visit dealers selling Ford's brands 
which also include Lincoln, Mercury, and Aston Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hopes Ford moves up in the ranking of most-trusted  
companies around the world, which he said will be key to competing 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the first page'' of such listings, he said. ``We  
would like to be at the top.''

<HEADLINE> Economy Prompts Business Jet Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of business jets like Payne Stewart's  
have soared in recent years thanks to the nation's booming economy, 
corporate globalization and ever-increasing airline delays. 
</P>
<P>
	More companies and celebrities are jetting around in Learjets  
and Gulfstreams, also attracted by the ability to set their own 
schedules and travel with privacy, security and comforts like 
couches and wet bars. 
</P>
<P>
	While the planes can cost up to $45 million for the business  
version of the Boeing 737, sales have skyrocketed with an increase 
in ``fractional ownership'' plans. Under such arrangements, a group 
splits the cost and use of an airplane in exchange for an 
equivalent share of the tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, business aircraft -- jets and turboprops flown  
by professional crews -- have posted a safety record slightly better 
than that of the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for example, airlines had an accident rate of .291  
accidents per 100,000 hours. For business aircraft, the rate was 
.091 per 100,000 hours, according to the National Business Aviation 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	And before Stewart's Learjet 35 flew uncontrolled across the  
nation Monday and nosedived into a field in South Dakota, killing 
the golfer and five others presumed aboard, it had been two years 
since the last fatal business aircraft accident. That does not 
include private planes flown on business by part-time pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another business tool,'' said NBAA spokeswoman Cassandra  
Bosco. ``As more and more companies ... expect more and more from 
less people, it's about time management and efficiency. These 
aircraft operate on their own schedule and can fly to 10 times the 
number of airports as the scheduled carriers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not surprising that Stewart and his companions were on a  
Learjet. The needle-nosed, twin-engine aircraft was introduced in 
1963 and is considered the first true business jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, new models have been introduced, and Lears have  
now accumulated over 10.5 million flight hours, according to its 
manufacturer, Bombardier Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the world leader in business aircraft is Gulfstream  
Aerospace Corp. The company, based in Savannah, Ga., has delivered 
over 1,000 jets since 1958, including what is considered the Rolls 
Royce of the sky -- the new Gulfstream V. 
</P>
<P>
	It can fly nonstop from New York to Tokyo at altitudes up to  
51,000 feet. The company pitches it as indispensable to business as 
the pad and paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can be there in one hop compared to hop-scotching through  
hub airports around the world, I'm going to have more face time 
with the client and be on the way home with a signed contract 
before you even make it there,'' said Gulfstream spokesman Pat 
Coulter. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason corporate aviation is so safe is it can afford to  
skim the cream of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Fortune 500 companies hire only former military pilots,  
many of whom have flown military versions of corporate jets. Most 
companies have formal business plans, complete with contingencies 
for aircraft security, fleet maintenance and accident response. 
</P>
<P>
	Because many business aircraft have wealthy owners, they usually  
come stocked with the latest safety features. Among them are 
heads-up displays that project the proper flight path and critical 
instrument data onto a clear lens that folds down in front of the 
cockpit window. 
</P>
<P>
	Fractional ownership has only served to increase the number of  
people who can enjoy those benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, there were 32 such planes with 140 shareholders,  
according to AvData Inc. As of Sept. 1, there were 329 fractional 
ownership planes with 1,567 shareholders. Stewart was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a rising stock market and a surging economy,  
which has provided the money for business aircraft, the Gulfstream 
spokesman said the airlines have also helped fuel aircraft sales 
and fractional ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time they cancel flights, every time they treat people  
poorly, those people with options come looking to Gulfstream or a 
shares program,'' Coulter said.

<HEADLINE> Brunell, Taylor Probable for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell and  
running back Fred Taylor are both listed as probable for Sunday's 
game at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell has a strained muscle near his ribs that he aggravated  
two weeks ago while throwing a long pass against Cleveland. Taylor 
has been out since Oct. 3 with an aggravated hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell threw less than usual in practice Wednesday. He said he  
needs to know he can make all the throws if he's to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't make them all now,'' Brunell said. ``You make  
them as you get closer to the game. The long ball is certainly 
something I've got to be able to throw Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's injury has progressed steadily since he left in the  
middle of a game against the Steelers. Coach Tom Coughlin said some 
of Jacksonville's troubles on offense might be solved with Taylor 
back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he'll be ready to perform this weekend,'' Coughlin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said backup quarterback Jay Fiedler would get more  
repetitions than usual in practice this week. He said a final 
decision on Brunell's status would be made later in the week.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Flu Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *By LAURAN NEERGAARD    	
</P>
<P>
                         *AP Medical Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flu sufferers won their first effective pill  
against both types A and B flu Wednesday as the Food and Drug 
Administration approved Tamiflu. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill, manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche, helped reduce the  
duration and severity of flu symptoms in unvaccinated adults who 
agreed to be infected with influenza to test the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision means flu sufferers this year have two new  
treatment choices. The FDA earlier approved an inhaled flu drug 
called Relenza that also works against both A and B flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Older flu medicines worked against only the type A flu, which  
accounts for about two-thirds of the estimated 20 million U.S. flu 
cases yearly, and doctors have said those medicines didn't work 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu is not a cure-all, the FDA warned. Studies showed taking  
the drug helped patients recover only about a day earlier than flu 
patients who took a dummy pill, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	To get that benefit, patients took Tamiflu within 40 hours of  
the first flu symptom -- meaning patients would have to recognize 
flu symptoms and get to the doctor to get the prescription-only 
drug rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects included nausea, vomiting, bronchitis, trouble  
sleeping and dizziness, FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts stress that neither Tamiflu nor the competing  
Relenza flu treatments are a substitute for a flu vaccine. The flu 
kills about 20,000 Americans a year, a toll the government says 
could be decreased if more people got their flu shots in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu vaccination is most recommended for people over 64 --  
although one doctors' group now recommends the shots starting at 
age 50 -- as well as anyone with chronic heart or lung problems or a 
weak immune system, and anyone in close contact with high-risk 
patients, including relatives and caregivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have welcomed more treatment choices because so many  
Americans don't get vaccinated. In addition, flu vaccine isn't 
always perfect, so treatments like Tamiflu or Relenza might be 
useful during flu outbreaks in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said Tamiflu has not yet been proved to prevent flu.  
</P>
<P>
	But a study published in Thursday's edition of the New England  
Journal of Medicine suggested it might reduce the chances of 
catching flu if unvaccinated people took it daily during flu 
season, which runs from November through April. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, was given to 520  
people for the first six weeks of the 1997-98 flu season. Just 1 
percent of them got the flu, compared with nearly 5 percent of a 
comparison group that took dummy pills, concluded University of 
Virginia researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman Charles Alfaro said the drug would  
be available to customers within a month. A retail price has not 
been set.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three Latin-American reporters sent a letter  
Wednesday to commissioner Bud Selig ``to express the most fervent 
disappointment for the unjustifiable exclusion of Roberto 
Clemente'' from the All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying they were speaking for 21 Latin-American reporters who  
met and voted before Game 4 of the World Series, Jaime Jarrin, 
Billy Berroa and Manolo Hernandez-Douen included a Latin-American 
All-Century team with the letter they sent to Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	It has Orlando Cepeda and Andres Galarraga at first, Rod Carew  
and Roberto Alomar at second, Tony Perez and Vinny Castilla at 
third, Luis Aparacio, Dave Concepcion and Chico Carrasquel at 
shortstop and Ivan Rodriguez and Manny Sanguillen at catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The outfielders are Clemente, Sammy Sosa, Juan Gonzalez, Tony  
Oliva, Bernie Williams and Minnie Minoso. The pitchers are Juan 
Marichal, Luis Tiant, Fernando Valenzuela, Dennis Martinez, Pedro 
Martinez, Martin Dihigo, Mike Cueller, Mariano Rivera, Camilo 
Pascual and Roberto Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Manny Mota was picked a pinch-hitter, and Edgar Martinez and  
Jose Canseco as designated hitters. Clemente was voted Latin 
American player of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Cubs star Sammy Sosa, speaking before the game, recalled  
watching Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody knows who Roberto Clemente was,'' Sosa said.  
``Roberto Clemente would have been on that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AFTER THE HEROICS:* Chad Curtis said he didn't want to make too  
much of his game-winning homer in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the fun of the game is playing the game,'' he said,  
``not the trophies or the hype surrounding the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Hall of Fame wants the bat he used for his  
10th-inning drive off Mike Remlinger. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROCKET LAUNCH:* Roger Clemens didn't make his first World  
Series appearance in 13 years until starting Game 4 on Wednesday 
night. But he already has some fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, one of the 30 players picked for baseball's All-Century  
Team, was on the field for the celebration before Game 2 with Ted 
Williams, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax and other greats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at myself in that way by any means,'' Clemens  
said. ``It was fun talking to a lot of those guys. It was just a 
special evening. Every time I see Ted Williams, I get choked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing Williams brought back memories of one of their first  
meetings, when Williams was visiting Boston spring training in 1987 
and called Clemens in to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said point blank, `What would you throw me?' -- real loud  
with that booming voice. I had marbles in my mouth,'' Clemens 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Clemens could respond, Williams provided his own answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I would look for your slider, Kid, because I know I  
can hit your fastball.' I said, `Yes, sir, Mr. Williams.' I got my 
sanitary socks and went the other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HANK AARON AWARDS:* Baseball presented its inaugural Hank Aaron  
awards to Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Manny Ramirez of the 
Cleveland Indians. The awards, which are for hitting and are based 
on statistics, are given by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baseball Writers' Association of America will announce the  
traditional awards -- Rookie of the Year, Cy Young and MVP -- next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron repeated that he expects Ken Griffey Jr. will break his  
record of 755 home runs ``because of his age, and he's going to be 
around awhile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It really doesn't matter who breaks it,'' Aaron said. ``That  
just means progress in baseball and Sammy Sosa, (Mark) McGwire, Ken 
Griffey Jr., whoever break it, fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JOB HUNTING:* Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss got his  
chance to interview for the Milwaukee Brewers managing job 
Wednesday, one day after New York third base coach Willie Randolph 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me they'd get back to me after the season,''  
Chambliss said. ``I go through this every season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre is prepared to lose at least one of  
his coaches before next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a happy loss,'' Torre said. ``They're going on to  
something they always wanted to do. It's replacing them in a nice 
way, though, because they're going on to do things I feel they're 
both capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KERRY'S COMEBACK:* Kerry Ligtenberg was doing his best to enjoy  
the World Series, even though he can only watch from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's to say if I'll ever get another chance to be around the  
World Series,'' said Ligtenberg, who saved 30 games for the Braves 
in 1998 but missed this season with a torn ligament in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander threw on the side for the final six weeks of  
the regular season and was encouraged by how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It progressed rapidly, to the point where I felt like I was  
throwing 70 percent,'' Ligtenberg said. ``Honestly, I think if I 
wanted to play winter ball, I could pretty easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, his focus will be on getting ready for the start of  
spring training. Ligtenberg is willing to take whatever role is 
available, knowing that his successor, John Rocker, will be hard to 
unseat as the closer after saving 38 games, one short of the 
franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I just want to be healthy,'' Ligtenberg said. ``If  
I got to spring training at 100 percent and show them that 
everything is normal, that other stuff will take care of itself. 
I'm not worried about (his role) at all.''

<HEADLINE> New Probe of Suharto Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By GEOFF SPENCER    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's new attorney general said  
today he intends to reopen a corruption investigation into former 
President Suharto but said the aging autocrat might eventually end 
up with a pardon or amnesty even if wrongdoing is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Marzuki Darusman was named Indonesia's highest legal officer on  
Tuesday when President Abdurrahman Wahid announced his new Cabinet, 
which he touted as corruption-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Wahid said Suharto should be questioned again about his  
wealth and that Marzuki is entitled to pursue the case. However, 
the new head of state made it clear that his priority was to 
recover any ill-gotten gains from Suharto and use the money to help 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto was Indonesia's authoritarian ruler from 1966-98.  
Critics of his iron-fisted regime accuse him of abusing his power 
to enrich his family and of stashing away billions of dollars in 
foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, 78 and in poor health, has repeatedly denied any  
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the now-ousted government of ex-President  
B.J. Habibie, a Suharto protege, ended a probe into Suharto's 
wealth, citing lack of evidence. Habibie has denied allegations 
that he orchestrated a whitewash to protect his former boss and 
mentor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid's new government has pledged to crack down on graft.  
Today, Marzuki told reporters he intends to launch legal 
proceedings to convince Indonesians ``that justice has been done or 
seems to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said amnesty or a pardon for Habibie will eventually be an  
option if wrongdoing is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to that, legal proceedings will have to be undertaken,  
and it cannot be done by the government only. It will have to be 
done through the courts,'' Marzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marzuki also said he would examine documents on the separate  
Bank Bali corruption scandal and determine if legal action is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Bali was one of several troubled financial institutions  
that were closed down and broken up by Habibie's government as part 
of an economic reform program. About $80 million was allegedly 
transferred this year from Bank Bali to a private company 
controlled by a senior official in Habibie's ruling Golkar Party, 
allegedly to fund Habibie's failed election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian  
Development Bank and the Japanese government have shelved billions 
of dollars in loans to Indonesia because of concern over the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, major newspapers expressed satisfaction with the new  
Cabinet lineup. Analysts warned, however, that the poverty-stricken 
populace, impatient for immediate improvements, was unlikely to 
tolerate much of a honeymoon period. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid, whose election by parliament last week entrenched  
Indonesia's transition to democracy, filled his Cabinet with 
political neophytes, Islamic party politicians and fewer military 
officials than ever before. The 35 new ministers were likely to be 
sworn in on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq To Link to Online Brokerages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market's Web site will soon  
offer links to online brokerage firms that will allow investors to 
jump directly to their online trading account. 
</P>
<P>
	National Association of Securities Dealers Chairman Frank Zarb  
announced the Mybroker service Wednesday during a speech in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said no date has been set for when the service will begin.  
He said some online brokerage firms need time to get their 
technology connected to the Nasdaq's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokerage firms that participate in the service will  
benefit by getting the added exposure of being linked to the 
Nasdaq's site, which draws 23.5 million visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
	More information will be released in two or three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Zarb detailed a plan announced in June to open a  
Japanese version of the Nasdaq's computerized trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said the Internet-based system is being designed by  
Japanese banking giant Softbank. He said the move is intended to 
create a partnership with the Japanese, rather than compete with 
existing Japanese exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Nasdaq system will hopefully be the first step in  
creating an interconnected, 24-hour global exchange, Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, the Japanese Nasdaq system would be open to both  
Japanese and American companies that met similar standards 
established by both countries, Zarb said. ``That would allow 
investors to trade large, liquid stocks equally in both markets 
using the same system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a combined U.S. and Japanese Nasdaq would create  
more liquid markets -- meaning more money is circulating -- which 
would attract additional companies to list on the dual exchange, 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statements by Zarb on a Japanese Nasdaq came the same day  
The Wall Street Journal reported that the Nasdaq was also seeking 
to create a linked computerized trading market in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb acknowledged his desire to move into Europe and said he  
hoped all three continents -- the United States, Europe and Asia -- 
would one day be linked by a single computerized trading system.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Virginia Prison Guard Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A former guard at Virginia's largest prison  
for women has been indicted on a charge of exposing himself to an 
inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge of indecent exposure against Richard Keith Robinson  
is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail 
or a $2,500 fine, or both. Robinson, who was fired by the Fluvanna 
Correctional Center for Women, will appear in court Nov. 12, and a 
trial date may be set then. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Colin Guy said he received two other  
cases from the prison on Tuesday in which inmates allege sexual 
battery by guards. He said he has not determined whether he will 
prosecute the cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported Oct. 11 that there had been nearly  
a threefold increase in such complaints this year.

<HEADLINE> Dayton Won't Dispute NCAA Rulings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The University of Dayton expects the NCAA to  
rule that the school committed four rules infractions, including 
$32,000 in loans a university trustee made to the father of a 
basketball recruit, a school official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investigators concluded that basketball player Brooks  
Hall is eligible to play because he did not know about the loans or 
directly benefit from them, Ted Kissell, director of athletics, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university will not contest the findings and awaits  
sanctions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we had concluded differently, we decided there was  
not a great likelihood that our position would prevail in front of 
the infractions committee,'' Kissell said. ``We decided it was in 
our best interests to put this behind us, to accept the enforcement 
staff's conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties for a major violation can include a two-year  
probation, cuts in the number of expenses-paid recruiting visits to 
the school or a reduction in the number of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Committee on Infractions meets Nov. 5-7.  
</P>
<P>
	University officials declined to say what penalties they  
recommended to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we put forth a very good set of recommendations,''  
Brother Raymond Fitz, the university's president, said. ``We're 
hopeful that they'll accept them as they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, the university learned that the NCAA would  
not accept their characterization of the violations as 
``inadvertent and secondary.'' The NCAA concluded that one major 
infraction and three secondary infractions occurred: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In August and September 1998, Clayton Mathile made personal  
loans totaling $32,000 to Chuck Hall, father of Brooks Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mathile made impermissible contacts with Hall's family; he made  
impermissible contact with another unnamed recruit; and the radio 
station that carries Flyers basketball games posted a sign at the 
Troy Strawberry Festival in June 1998, associating Hall's name with 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules prohibit schools from publicizing an unsigned  
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Renfro, director of public relations for the NCAA, said  
the NCAA cannot comment on any case. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Hall declined to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> Thief Demands Ransom From Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A thief has demanded that Michael Jackson pay  
$100,000 for the return of several home videos of him playing with 
his children, a spokesman for the singer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The anonymous call came into the Los Angeles offices of  
Jackson's MJJ Productions this week, shortly before a tabloid 
contacted Jackson's office with word that pictures taken from the 
tape were for sale, said Jackson spokesman Howard Rubenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the two calls, Jackson was not aware that the tapes were  
missing. He plans to file a complaint with authorities in France, 
where the tapes were stolen from his hotel room, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tapes are not embarrassing at all,'' said Rubenstein.  
``But we're not going to buy the tapes back. He absolutely refuses 
to pay a ransom. He wants to prosecute whoever stole them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The videos were shot around the Christmas and New Year's  
holidays last year at Jackson's Neverland Ranch in California and 
during a summer visit to Euro Disney in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes showed Jackson, 41, cavorting with his two children,  
2-year-old Prince Michael Jackson Jr. and 1-year-old Paris Michael 
Katherine Jackson, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's mother, Deborah Rowe Jackson, filed for divorce  
from Jackson earlier this month, citing irreconcilable differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's attorneys, Lavely &AMP; Singer, threatened ``immediate  
action'' for copyright infringement against any media outlets that 
purchased either the video or photographs taken from the tapes.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Beats Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. reported flat third quarter  
operating profits that beat analysts' expectations, but revenue 
fell 2 percent from the second quarter as the company lost its U.S. 
leadership in personal computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, which is still the largest seller of PCs on a worldwide  
basis, reported net income Tuesday of $140 million, or 8 cents per 
share, compared to results in the year-ago quarter of $115 million, 
or 7 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	But not counting $868 million in charges related to a  
restructuring and a $1.2 billion one-time gain on the sale of its 
AltaVista Internet portal, Compaq earned $117 million, or 7 cents a 
share in the recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected  
Compaq to earn 5 cents per share in the July-September period. The 
results, which were released at the close of financial markets, 
mark a return to profitability after the company's stunning $184 
million in losses last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading this morning on the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq  
was up 2.6, or by 50 cents, at $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq reported revenue of $9.21 billion, up 5 percent from  
$8.79 billion a year ago but down slightly from $9.4 billion last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael D. Capellas, promoted to president and chief executive  
in July following the ouster of Eckhard Pfeiffer last spring, said 
he was disappointed in revenues but encouraged by a drop in 
operating costs from the second quarter to $1.97 billion from $2.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our revenue numbers were down sequentially, we achieved  
our earnings per share target, gross margin was up and operating 
expenses were down,'' Capellas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas added that he is satisfied the company, which has  
fallen behind Dell Computer Corp. in U.S. personal computer sales, 
is on track to further streamline its operations while staying 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, saw  
little upside in the earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the earnings are clearly a disappointment. The  
earnings are inflated by accounting,'' Kumar said. ``The key issues 
going forward are the company has completely lost traction in the 
commercial desktop line, the company does not have a strategy for 
its service division ... and because of the deep budget cuts, 
Europe is in complete disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is there's no catalyst that indicates any  
imminent turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have faulted in part Compaq's inability to emulate the  
efficient sales model of Dell and Gateway, which sell products 
directly to customers and avoid retailers and wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changes in the personal computer business are not just about  
sales and distribution models,'' Capellas said, adding that Compaq 
is banking on an array of upcoming computer models. ``We intend to 
drive a new generation of products, from desktops to palmtops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq earned $237 million, or 15 cents per share, in the nine  
months ended Sept. 30. Last year at that time, the company lost 
$3.5 billion, or $2.21 cents per share, stemming from its 
acquisition of Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $28.05 bill from $20.31 billion.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Line Coach Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Rams offensive line coach Jim Hanifan  
will be back on the sideline Friday after being hospitalized for 
chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan, 66, was in good condition Wednesday at Missouri Baptist  
Hospital after undergoing a coronary artery angiogram. The 
procedure showed a blockage in a small artery that was opened by 
balloon angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be released Thursday, the hospital said, and coach Dick  
Vermeil said Hanifan would make the trip for Sunday's game at 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back on Friday and he has to quit smoking,'' Vermeil  
said. ``It's good for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanifan joined the team two years ago when Vermeil became coach.  
Hanifan also was head coach of the St. Louis Cardinals from 
1980-85. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said Hanifan had chest pains Tuesday night. Later that  
night at the hospital, Hanifan continued to work on the game plan 
for the Tennessee game.

	Clemens Pitches Yankees to Series Sweep  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens pitched the New York Yankees to  
their second straight World Series sweep Wednesday night, shutting 
down the Atlanta Braves 4-1. The Yankees won their record 25th 
championship. Mariano Rivera who had two saves and a win in the 
Series was selected as MVP. At 37, Clemens won his first 
championship -- John Elway was the same age when he won his first 
Super Bowl. Showing the form that earned him five Cy Young Awards 
and 247 wins in 16 seasons, Clemens shut out Atlanta into the 
eighth to outduel John Smoltz.

	Congress Nears Crucial Budget Vote

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders prepared Wednesday for a crucial  
vote in their budget battle with President Clinton as both parties 
vied to define the GOP's spending plans. Republicans said their 
proposed across-the-board cuts were prudent; Democrats called them 
destructive. Republican leaders put the finishing touches on their 
effort to pay for spending bills without touching Social Security 
surpluses through reductions in agencies' budgets of just under 1 
percent. Republican leaders planned for the House to vote tomorrow 
on a massive bill that includes the cuts, $314 billion for labor, 
health and education programs, plus money for the District of 
Columbia's budget.

	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- In the first debate of the Democratic  
presidential campaign Wednesday night, Vice President Al Gore and 
Bill Bradley pledged their support to an overhaul of campaign 
finance laws, and agreed, in general terms, about the need to 
expand health care coverage. On military involvement overseas, 
Bradley advocated a United States role -- but not ``full 
responsibility'' -- in groups like the United Nations and NATO. 
Asked to describe the characteristics of effective leadership, Gore 
said a president must have a ``vision of the future'' and feel 
compelled to strive towards it. Bradley said ``absolute integrity'' 
is essential.

barricaded in the building with dozens of hostages shortly before 
dawn Thursday. During the night, the gunmen released three

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said Wednesday that President

decision to bomb a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan in retaliation 
for terrorist bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Spokesman 
Joe Lockhart said Clinton's national security team recommended 
unanimously last year to proceed with plans for a missile attack on 
the factory, which was supposedly linked to Osama bin Laden, the 
suspected mastermind behind the embassy attacks. The plant's owner 
is thinking of suing the United States to recover the $30 million 
cost of rebuilding the plant.

	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- The new chief prosecutor of the  
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said Wednesday her top priority was 
the arrest and trial of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and 
two Bosnian Serb warlords. Carla Del Ponte was on her first tour of 
the Balkans since she succeeded Louise Arbour last month at the 
international court. She planned to travel to Kosovo Thursday, and 
then to Bosnia and Croatia later this week. Many of those suspects 
indicted for war crimes by the tribunal, including Milosevic and 
Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic,

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early  
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the market 
struggling to break out of its recent price slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Rains forecast for soybean-growing areas of Brazil and Argentina  
weighed on the market, sending soybeans initially lower today 
before the price rebounded. Soybeans hit an eight-week low on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also was pressured by soybeans' slide.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures inched higher despite the overnight purchase by  
Algeria of 125,000 tons of German wheat, a slight to the U.S. 
export market. Analysts said U.S. wheat sales remain solid, with 
recent purchases by Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3/4 cent to $2.57 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 cent to $2.00 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1/2 
cent to $1.10 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1/4 cent to $4.68 1/2 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle fell .85 cent to 67.42 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell .58 cent to 79.42 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell 1.08 cent to 47.17 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell 1.75 cent to 62.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Montana City Debates `Living Wage' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- John Leathers makes $6.15 an hour as a  
cemetery groundskeeper for the city, a job that will last only 
until winter comes. He moonlights as a bowling alley mechanic at 
$6.75 an hour. He puts in 80 hours a week and still lives paycheck 
to paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm tired a lot,'' Leathers said. ``I'm 21 and I feel like I'm  
40.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leathers and others like him see some hope in a proposal on the  
Nov. 2 ballot that would set a ``living wage'' of $8 an hour for 
all Missoula municipal employees and workers whose employers get 
grants or other assistance from the city. The federal minimum wage 
is $5.15. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 other U.S. cities and counties have ``living wage''  
laws, including Minneapolis, Kankakee County, Ill., and Portland, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Missoula, population 52,000, is a liberal college town in one of  
the poorest states. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Montana stood 47th in per capita income at $20,172.  
Only New Mexico, Mississippi and West Virginia were lower. Montana 
was also second in the percentage of workers holding down more than 
one job: 10.6 percent, behind North Dakota at 10.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana People's Action, an activist group backing the living  
wage, says government grants and other incentives awarded to 
businesses to spur economic development should start yielding some 
benefit for people on the bottom rungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The living-wage movement is an alternative to the  
better-business climate that says we improve the business climate, 
we get rich and prosper and pass it on to you,'' said the 
organization's Jim Fleischmann. ``We've had two decades of 
business-climate improvement, and look where we stand now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents -- mostly businesses -- say the new minimum would throw  
people out of work as employers cut jobs to offset the higher pay. 
And they say that nonprofit organizations that get city assistance 
and help the poor would have to reduce programs because of higher 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, it is going to hurt the people they're trying to  
help,'' City Councilwoman Tracey Turek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wage plan would affect the equivalent of up to 30 full-time  
municipal jobs that are held by dozens of people and pay less than 
$8 an hour, said Brenda Camilli, city personnel director. Montana 
People's Action estimates the plan would also apply to 100 jobs 
with nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	To Leathers, the effect is obvious: Earning $8 an hour would  
allow him to work shorter hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be wonderful. It would be fair,'' he said. As  
it is now, he said, neither job provides health insurance. ``I pay 
for housing and food,'' he said. ``I can't afford dental care and 
other things that are important to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a plight shared by Nora Walsh, a 19-year-old single mother  
laid off this month as fall arrived in the Northern Rockies and 
ended her $6.15-an-hour job as a city park attendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Missoula's a great place,'' she said. ``I just wish I could  
afford to live here.''

<HEADLINE> National Geographic Goes High Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Combining more than a century of traditional  
mapping with modern technology, the National Geographic Society is 
issuing a massive new world atlas and making its maps available on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for maps,'' the society's chief cartographer,  
Allen Carroll, said in announcing the steps Wednesday at a news 
conference at 38 degrees 54 minutes 18 seconds north latitude, 77 
degrees 2 minutes 18 seconds west longitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not too many years ago, maps were pretty passive things. Back  
then, maps were kind of like nouns, now they've become active 
verbs,'' Carroll said of the book-Internet combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The new seventh edition of the atlas includes such changes as  
the breakup of Yugoslavia, the creation of the native territory 
Nunavut in Canada, new provincial boundaries in Poland and changing 
country names in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	It also marks the completion of a three-year $3 million effort  
to computerize all society maps -- a project that allows them to be 
put on the Internet at www.nationalgeographic.com/mapmachine. 
</P>
<P>
	The book costs $125 while the Internet is free -- supported by  
advertising and sponsors. But society officials are confident a 
market exists for both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think they are a perfect combination,'' Carroll said.  
``They are not redundant, they are complimentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book gives better resolution, looks better on a coffee  
table, is quicker and easier to use and makes a nice gift, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But any map book is out of date the minute it's printed, while  
the Internet can be kept up to date. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when there are changes that affect the printed atlas, people  
will be able to find the corrected map on the Web site, print it 
out at the correct scale, and paste it in their book, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it's already happened. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison,  
formerly a national monument, is now a national park. The printed 
correction can be pasted on plate 39 of the atlas. 
</P>
<P>
	Every map in the new atlas has been redone from the sixth  
edition, Carroll said, adding improved shaded relief. The volume 
also contains a new satellite mosaic map of the world, a 136-page 
index and an expanded section providing flags and descriptions of 
the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume will generate complaints, Carroll admitted, as have  
all the society's past atlases, because of the many disputed areas 
in the world. He said the society receives angry letters from 
people ``who want us to show the world as they think it should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The society's policy is to show the world as it is, listing  
which country is in actual control of an area, even if that control 
is disputed by some other country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor, for example, which recently voted for independence  
from Indonesia but has not yet become a recognized country, 
generated discussion, Carroll said. The atlas shows the island as 
part of Indonesia with a notation in red that, as of 1999, 
authorities were finalizing plans to give the island's eastern 
section political autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas generating the most letters, he said, are Cyprus, Taiwan,  
East Timor and Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Chargers To Stay With QB Kramer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Despite throwing seven interceptions in a span  
of five quarters -- something that not even Ryan Leaf has done -- 
Erik Kramer remains the San Diego Chargers' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	However, coach Mike Riley said Wednesday he'll have a faster  
hook if Kramer struggles again this Sunday when the Chargers visit 
the AFC West rival Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was intercepted three times in three quarters Sunday, all  
of them setting up touchdowns as the Green Bay Packers humbled the 
Chargers 31-3. The previous week, he threw four interceptions in 
the second half against Seattle before leading drives that John 
Carney capped with the tying and winning field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a team, we did not play very well at all this last week,  
which was fairly, painfully obvious,'' Riley said. ``I want to give 
Erik the chance to start in this next ballgame to remedy those 
problems with the rest of our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer threw his third interception midway through the third  
quarter. After Brett Favre led the Packers on a 99-yard drive to 
take a 28-3 lead, Jim Harbaugh came in and promptly threw an 
interception on his first play. He also finished with three 
pickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not anticipating anything bad happening,'' Riley said.  
``I'm looking forward to having a good, efficient ballgame, but I 
also think that if the situation arises, Jim should play earlier 
than he did in the last game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh hadn't played since cracking two ribs in the first  
quarter against the Chiefs in San Diego on Oct. 3. Kramer came in 
with the Chargers trailing 14-0 and led them to a 21-14 win. 
Starting the next two games, he helped them to a 4-1 record and 
sole possession of the division lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After the debacle against the Packers, San Diego dropped into a  
tie with Kansas City and Seattle at 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who signed with San Diego the night before training camp  
opened, appreciates the chance to redeem himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to get back to playing smart football,'' said  
Kramer, who hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in three games and has 
nine interceptions to just two TD passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer also fumbled two snaps against the Packers and made a  
costly error by letting the clock run out at the end of the first 
half by scrambling inside the Packers' 10-yard line instead of 
taking a shot into the end zone or throwing it away. Kramer said it 
was a poor decision on his part, probably because he was thinking 
of his two earlier pickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said he won't play as if there's a gun to his head and  
one mistake will get him pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think just the opposite. I have to play more relaxed,'' he  
said. ``I've got to just settle down and not press, not try to make 
more happen than what's there. I think I probably tried to do a 
little too much, tried to move things along a little faster and 
paid the price for trying to force a couple of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Harbaugh will get more practice time this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new week and I plan on playing better,'' said Harbaugh,  
who's thrown five interceptions and two TDs. ``That's not the way I 
want to think of myself as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, meanwhile, was in the Los Angeles area Wednesday getting a  
second opinion on his surgically repaired right shoulder from Dr. 
Lewis Yocum of the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers hoped to have Leaf practicing full-time by now, but  
he overdid a workout before the Seattle game on Oct. 17 and 
reported soreness. 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, Leaf said he hoped to be suited up by  
Sunday's game at Arrowhead Stadium. That was the site of Leaf's 
biggest meltdown during his troubled rookie season, when he 
completed just 1 of 15 passes for 4 yards, threw two interceptions 
and lost three fumbles in a 23-7 defeat.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell and  
running back Fred Taylor are both listed as probable for Sunday's 
game at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell has a strained muscle near his ribs that he aggravated  
two weeks ago while throwing a long pass against Cleveland. Taylor 
has been out since Oct. 3 with an aggravated hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell threw less than usual in practice Wednesday. He said he  
needs to know he can make all the throws if he's to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't make them all now,'' Brunell said. ``You make  
them as you get closer to the game. The long ball is certainly 
something I've got to be able to throw Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's injury has progressed steadily since he left in the  
middle of a game against the Steelers. Coach Tom Coughlin said some 
of Jacksonville's troubles on offense might be solved with Taylor 
back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he'll be ready to perform this weekend,'' Coughlin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said backup quarterback Jay Fiedler would get more  
repetitions than usual in practice this week. He said a final 
decision on Brunell's status would be made later in the week.

<HEADLINE> Drug Co. Uses Sesame St. To Educate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elmo, Big Bird and the other Sesame Street  
characters are teaming up with drugmaker Pfizer Inc. to educate 
parents about antibiotics and reduce kids' fears about going to the 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, maker of the blockbuster antibiotic Zithromax, and the  
Children's Television Workshop, which produces the famous kid's 
television show, are distributing ``Sesame Street Goes to the 
Doctor'' kits to pediatricians and child care providers. Parents 
will be able to order printed materials for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit includes a 15-minute video in which the Muppets learn to  
get through a visit to the doctor and about proper use of 
antibiotics. The story line revolves around Elmo's trip to the 
doctor to help treat an ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit also includes a special issue of Sesame Street Parents  
Magazine that gives advice on caring for young children with common 
respiratory infections. In addition, the kits includes a poster and 
a booklet that gives child care providers tips about how to work 
with families when a child is ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The information given to parents has two main messages: Parents  
should never insist on an antibiotic for a viral infection such as 
a cold, because antibiotics won't work. And when an antibiotic is 
prescribed, they should always make sure the child finishes all of 
the doses so the infection does not return. 
</P>
<P>
	The unnecessary use of antibiotics and patients not finishing  
their drug regimen are two reasons why bacteria have become 
increasingly resistant to antibiotics, rendering them less 
effective in treating bacterial illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The kits do not mention any of Pfizer's drugs by name. But  
reducing children's fears about going to the doctor and making sure 
they take antibiotics appropriately likely will indirectly help 
boost sales of Zithromax, which is used to help treat ear 
infections and pneumonia among other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical companies increasingly do not mention the name of  
their drugs in marketing campaigns, partly because if they did, 
federal rules would require them to detail side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Zithromax, which had $1 billion in sales last year, has steadily  
gained market share against its primary competitor, SmithKline 
Beachum's Augmentin, which had sales of $1.6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who better than the trusted and well-loved Muppets to help  
children feel better about doctor visits and help parents 
understand how to use antibiotics appropriately,'' said Pat Kelly, 
a Pfizer spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer has also agreed to help underwrite the production of  
Sesame Street shows during the first half of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Green, the workshop's vice president for outreach and  
strategic partnership, said her not-for-profit company has sought 
out opportunities to use their popular characters to educate young 
children on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer is not the first drug maker to work with Elmo and Big  
Bird. Merck &AMP; Co. published a special magazine a few years ago 
using the Muppets to help promote the importance of vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the workshop nor Pfizer would disclose how much the  
drugmaker is paying to support the project. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Derrick Coleman Arrested for DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Derrick Coleman was accused of driving  
drunk Wednesday after a collision with a tractor-trailer that sent 
him, teammate Eldridge Recasner and a woman to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Hornets power forward, who has had previous  
run-ins with the law, received stitches for cuts to his nose and 
forehead and was released from Carolinas Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Recasner, a reserve guard, had a partially collapsed lung and a  
badly bruised chest and shoulder and will remain hospitalized for a 
few days, team spokesman Harold Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other passenger, Ebony Kimbrough, 25, was being treated at  
the center for facial cuts and was listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman told Charlotte-Mecklenburg police he had the green light  
at an intersection and the truck struck him; the truck driver, 
Peter Roe, said Coleman turned left in front of him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Coleman on a charge of driving while under the  
influence. Information on his blood-alcohol level wasn't 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Two previous cases in Michigan still are pending against  
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, he was accused of urinating in front of patrons at a  
Detroit restaurant and charged with disorderly conduct. Coleman 
denied any wrongdoing, saying he spilled a drink on himself. He 
also faces a lawsuit in Michigan in which he is accused of 
trespassing and battery at a Detroit woman's home in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Coleman was arrested and charged with refusing to move  
his truck and swearing at a police officer in Detroit. The jury 
failed to reach a verdict and the case ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman is in the second year of a five-year, $40 million  
contract with the Hornets. He has averaged 12.2 points, 6.0 
rebounds and 2.3 assists in six exhibition games. Last season, he 
was limited to 37 games by foot and ankle problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Recasner was signed by the Hornets as a free agent last January.  
</P>
<P>
	Hornets officials said Coleman will return to practice Thursday  
and might play Friday night in Charlotte's final exhibition game 
against Chicago at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``If found guilty of anything, we will take appropriate  
action,'' coach Paul Silas said of Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen,'' teammate Eddie Jones said. ``It was an  
accident, and we need to let him get better.''

<HEADLINE> Military Readiness Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A smaller and busier U.S. military remains  
ready to fight in two major foreign battles at the same time, but 
with an increased risk in the potential second conflict, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take longer to respond to hostilities which, in turn,  
means territory lost and an increased potential for casualties,'' 
the chiefs' chairman, Army Gen. Henry Shelton, said Tuesday at a 
Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing on the readiness of the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, in three hours of testimony flanked by the chiefs of  
the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines, said officers rate the risks 
of fighting a single conflict as ``moderate,'' a second conflict as 
``high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not mean that U.S. forces would not prevail in  
either contingency,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascribed the increased risk to diminished readiness in both  
strength of U.S. forces and the condition of their equipment. 
Difficulties in recruiting and in getting personnel to stay in the 
military are major factors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent increases in outlays for the military should begin to  
solve the problems, Shelton said, but all five chiefs complained of 
budgets that fall billions of dollars short of needs to maintain a 
ready, modern force. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that the force is much smaller than it was a  
decade ago, and also much busier,'' Shelton said. The total force 
is down 40 percent, yet faces increased requirements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A major challenge cited by all four service chiefs is how to  
increase the number of soldiers and officers who make long-term 
commitments and step up recruitment at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said proposals in congressional budget negotiations for  
across-the-board budget cuts would be ``devastating'' for the 
military, and cuts in the number of personnel available it would be 
``disastrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the military is ``walking a personnel tightrope,'' but  
pay and retirement improvements are beginning to increase 
retention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we are better off today than we were last year,''  
Shelton said. But he said recruiting has been held back by a 
job-rich economy, larger numbers of high school students going to 
college and ``the smallest cohort of 18- to 23-year-olds to recruit 
from in the history of the all-volunteer force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. Jay L. Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said world  
events in the last few months ``should dispel any misconception 
that the demands on our Navy have diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our battle force is getting older, and there is no  
shock-absorbency left,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force chief, Gen. Michael E. Ryan, cited a ``slow but  
steady decline'' in Air Force readiness -- down 5 percent since last 
year, 23 percent since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, said there  
remains in his service ``a mismatch between what we are asked to 
do, and the troops we have to do it with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Commandant Gen. James L. Jones said the Marines face  
increased commitments with force reductions that have cut ``well 
into the muscle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, ``The cumulative effect of repeated  
short-notice deployments could result in continued degradation in 
overall readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite budget increases this year, the service chiefs each  
complained of shortfalls below needs to increase readiness: $2.6 
billion for the Navy, $2.5 billion for the Air Force, $2.4 billion 
for the Army, $1.4 billion for the Marines.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European share prices fell Wednesday, led down by  
banks and pharmaceuticals, over concerns about a possible interest 
rate rise from the European Central Bank next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology was the best performer of the day, rising 0.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the question isn't whether the ECB will lift rates  
next week, but by how much,'' said David Coleman, chief economist 
at CIBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks came under pressure because higher interest rates reduce  
borrowing demand. In London, Barclays fell 3.4 percent and NatWest 
Bank fell 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other banks that fell included Deutsche Bank and HypoVereinsbank  
in Frankfurt, Societe Generale and BNP in Paris, and UBS in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pharmaceutical sector, Glaxo Wellcome fell after the  
company said it withdrew its Raxar antibiotic because of emerging 
safety concerns. AstraZeneca lost 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 600 European companies fell 0.75  
points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 307.82, with the 
worst-performing sectors banks, down 0.8 percent, and 
pharmaceuticals, with the respective index down 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 0.60 points 
at 323.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 10.65 points to 3786.07,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 6.04 points at 3765.42. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange  
100-share index of leading blue-chip shares fell 0.8 percent to 
close at 6,045.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was down 0.5 percent; the  
Paris CAC-40 index was 0.2 percent lower to 4,695.05; Milan's 
MIBtel index fell 0.1 percent to 32,165; and Amsterdam's AEX Index 
rose 0.02 percent to 6,873.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Among technology shares, gains in Ericsson and Nokia helped make  
the sector the best performer of the day, with the respective index 
up 0.6 percent, despite declines in the U.S. technology market. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, ParisBourse said late Wednesday that shares of French  
defense aerospace group Aerospatiale Matra will replace those of 
oil group Elf Aquitaine in the CAC 40 benchmark index from Nov.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Aquitaine shares will be removed from the CAC 40 and also  
from the SBF120 and SBF250 indexes after Thursday's close. The 
decision was triggered by Total Fina's successful takeover bid for 
rival Elf Aquitaine.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. reported a 3 percent increase in  
operating income Wednesday as strong sales in household goods, body 
care products and apparel overcame a down quarter for its food 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first quarter of fiscal 2000, which ended Oct. 2,  
operating earnings from continuing operations were $423 million, up 
3 percent from $411 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter, which included a one-time $137  
million gain from the sale of Sara Lee's international tobacco 
business, came to $258 million, or 28 cents a share, down 24 
percent from $337 million, or 35 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings matched the 28 cents per share consensus forecast  
of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee stock rose $1.87 1/2 to $25.62 1/2 a share in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee Foods, which includes the company's packaged meats and  
bakery operations, posted an 8 percent decline in sales and a 6 
percent drop in income for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But branded apparel sales were up 6 percent, boosted by  
double-digit gains by Hanes underwear, Playtex bras and other 
apparel items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are especially pleased with the strong unit volume  
increases in our non-food operations,'' said John H. Bryan, 
chairman and chief executive officer. ``These gains are the direct 
result of targeted investments in marketing and new product 
development for our leading brands around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase that we reported in the first quarter gives us  
further confidence that our company will produce a low double-digit 
earnings per share gain for the full year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee's leading brands include Sara Lee, Douwe Egberts,  
Hillshire Farm, Hanes, Coach and Playtex.

<HEADLINE> Report: L.A. Shooting Within Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The police shooting of a mentally ill  
homeless woman did not violate department policy, although the 
officer used faulty tactics, Chief Bernard Parks has reportedly 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, reported by the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday,  
was met with outrage from Leo Terrell, a lawyer for the woman's 
family. He said Parks ``should quit right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, citing sources it did not identify, said Parks  
disapproved of Officer Edward Larrigan's tactics. But he determined 
the May 21 shooting of Margaret Mitchell, after she allegedly 
lunged at officers with a screwdriver, was within Los Angeles 
Police Department guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	A Police Department spokeswoman confirmed Parks made a  
recommendation to the Police Commission based on a report from his 
department's use-of-force review board, but she declined to reveal 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Times, Parks' findings are enough for Larrigan  
to face some sort of discipline if the Police Commission agrees 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting sparked protests over allegations of excessive  
force and caused critics to question why the 54-year-old, 
5-foot-1-inch, 102-pound woman wasn't subdued by nonlethal means.

<HEADLINE> Senator Questions Navy Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee will hold an emergency  
hearing if necessary to question whether a Navy battle group should 
be deployed to the Mediterranean if the ships are not allowed to 
undergo live-fire training in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress is not going to sit by'' while American military men  
and women head into the field unprepared for battle, Sen. John 
Warner, R-Va., told the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, the Joint Chiefs chairman, repeated the  
military's contention that the Puerto Rican island of Vieques is 
the only site available for Atlantic fleet combined training of 
air, sea and land forces with live bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	As the battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower  
undergoes other training in the region, the Pentagon is weighing a 
decision on whether to continue using Vieques over the protests of 
Puerto Rican authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress is not in session when a decision is made on  
deployment of the Eisenhower battle group, Warner told Shelton he 
would call a special hearing of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, which he chairs, to ``evaluate your professional 
judgment on the readiness of that battle group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy suspended training on its Vieques range after protests  
over the death of a civilian guard in a bombing accident on the 
island April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon-appointed panel concluded that the Navy should resume  
limited training but phase out use of the range over five years. 
Training remains suspended, however, pending a decision by Defense 
Secretary William Cohen and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said personnel with the Eisenhower, scheduled to be in  
the Mediterranean in December, could not be prepared with a high 
level of confidence unless they can conduct training that simulates 
real-life situations.

<HEADLINE> Wyo. Judge Rips 'Gay Panic' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The judge in the Matthew Shepard murder  
case threatened on Wednesday to bar the man on trial from employing 
a ``gay panic'' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Barton Voigt told Aaron McKinney's lawyers that  
he is not sure such a defense is allowed under Wyoming law and 
criticized the defense for invoking it without consulting him 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned about this and where it is going,'' Voigt said  
outside the presence of the jury. ``We do not have a gay panic 
defense. I don't know if I'm going to allow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney is charged with murder in the beating death of the gay  
University of Wyoming student. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``gay panic'' or ``homosexual panic'' defense is built on a  
theory that a person with latent homosexual tendencies will have an 
uncontrollable, violent reaction when propositioned by a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's lawyers have argued that McKinney snapped during a  
drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance by Shepard 
triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. The lawyers 
are trying to save McKinney's life by convincing the jury he is 
guilty only of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Voigt said the closest defense he could find in Wyoming law is  
the ``battered woman'' defense, for those who kill a spouse in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dion Custis denied he was using a ``gay panic''  
defense. But he said: ``The fact that Matthew Shepard made a sexual 
advance has a relevance in this case. It's something Aaron McKinney 
responded to.'' He added that Shepard's behavior helps explain 
McKinney's state of mind, ``which is a defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ordered Custis to provide a legal basis for his  
arguments and said he would make a decision later. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's accomplice, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to  
kidnapping and felony murder in April and received two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights activists praised the judge, saying it is wrong to  
try to blame Shepard for McKinney's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only person at risk here was Matthew Shepard,'' said Wayne  
Besen, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay lobbying 
group in Washington. ``If Aaron McKinney felt threatened, all he 
had to do was walk away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no state has adopted a gay panic defense, it has been  
used by defense attorneys in some cases involving gay victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts warned that employing the defense is perilous since it  
can amount to blaming the victim. Brian Levin, director of the 
California-based Center on Hate and Extremism, also said the 
strategy hasn't worked recently because Americans have become more 
tolerant of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we've turned a very big corner in that nearly everyone  
agrees that violence against them is completely wrong,'' he said. 
``I don't think you had the same type of atmosphere 20 or 30 years 
ago.''

<HEADLINE> A.H. Belo Earnings Up 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A.H. Belo Corp. reported Wednesday third quarter  
earnings from operations increased 21 percent, while revenue rose 5 
percent, compared to the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based media company, which owns 17 network-affiliated  
television stations and several large newspapers, said earnings 
from operations were $57.7 million, up from $47.8 million in the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased from $328.5 million to $345.3 million.  
After-tax cash flow, a measure widely used by financial analysts, 
increased from $109.9 million, or 39 cents a share, to $97.5 
million, or 50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo released its earnings report after the close of markets  
Wednesday. Belo's stock closed down 12 1/2 cents to $18.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from Belo's broadcasting division increased 3.7 percent,  
to $138.7 million, while the newspaper division's revenue increased 
5.9 percent, to $203.5 million from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Robert W. Decherd said the  
company's television revenue increase was ``at the top of the 
industry.'' On the publishing side, he said, there was double-digit 
cash-flow growth at the Providence (R.I.) Journal and Riverside 
(Calif.) Press-Enterprise and ``continued incremental improvement'' 
at The Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Decherd said advertising demand at the Dallas paper has improved  
since June, ``and our prospects going forward appear to be much 
improved.'' He also said he expects the television group to post 
strong sales in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo's third-quarter net earnings were $16.6 million, or 14  
cents a share, up from $9.7 million, or 8 cents a share in the 
third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said net earnings in the first nine months of the  
year were $108.9 million, 91 cents a share, up sharply from $53.2 
million or 42 cents a share in the same period last year. 
Year-to-date revenue has increased less than 2 percent, to $1.04 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Belo announced a deal with Geocast Network  
Systems to deliver programming to desktop computers. Belo said it 
will invest $10 million in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Belo  
senior unsecured debt. Moody's said it acted after Belo used debt 
financing to make stock repurchases and acquisitions over the past 
two years instead of cutting its debt load from the 1997 
acquisition of the Providence Journal Co.

<HEADLINE> Study: Schools Unprepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Students in thousands of schools may get  
unexpected extended winter vacations because their districts are 
not prepared for Y2K problems affecting heating, food service and 
teacher payrolls, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	An Education Department survey released Wednesday said 36  
percent of public elementary and secondary school districts are 
unprepared to fix date-sensitive computer systems. And 39 percent 
of colleges -- where tuition-aid records and longtime research could 
be threatened -- told the department survey they were not ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is disturbing,'' Marshall Smith, acting deputy secretary  
of education, said at a news conference. ``Once you're within a 
three-month span, a lot of things can go wrong. Schools and 
colleges ought to commit resources to have some independent 
verification of compliance if they haven't done so already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be done before we send our students back to those  
schools,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000, or Y2K, problem refers to concerns about possible  
computer breakdowns on Jan. 1, 2000, because some computers were 
originally programmed to recognize just the last two digits of a 
year and may misinterpret ``00'' as 1900. Many computers can be 
reprogrammed simply, but others have embedded microchips that must 
be replaced -- making the process of getting ready more complicated 
and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
	With New Year's Day falling on a Saturday, Smith said, school  
districts that haven't made the necessary repairs -- which at 
current count could be nearly 5,000 -- have extra days to make sure 
buildings are safe or otherwise ready for students. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials acknowledge that Y2K-related failures in schools would  
have little direct impact on classwork other than lessons involving 
information technology. Some failures could shut down heaters, 
possibly causing frozen pipes to burst, black out school security 
cameras, block access to student and payroll records or shut off 
cafeteria freezers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fairfax County School system in northern Virginia will bring  
in security, communication, building and technology experts to 
check its 200 schools on New Year's Day to ensure schools are ready 
to open on Jan. 3, the scheduled return date from the winter 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is based on plans we have in place all the time,'' said  
district spokeswoman Kitty Porterfield, who added that independent 
experts reviewed the plans. ``We had flooding when the hurricane 
came in, and pieces of those (emergency) plans went into effect. 
This is not solely uncharted territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With two months to go -- a tight deadline by industry standards --  
virtually every school surveyed pledged to be ready by Jan. 1. Even 
the ones that said they weren't ready when the survey was taken 
earlier this month felt they would be ready. The survey -- a 
follow-up to ones earlier this spring -- relied on self-reporting. 
The margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The best estimate -- just 4 percent of school districts say they  
won't meet the deadline -- could still affect 600 school systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people are skeptical, even angry at the delays. Parents are  
uncertain of school schedules. College students worry about getting 
their grants and loans on time. And teachers are wondering when 
they would get paid in the event of a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of our people feel school districts have not prepared for  
this problem,'' said Jamie Horowitz, spokesman for the 
million-member American Federation of Teachers' union. ``They had a 
lot of time to address this. This is one of those mistakes that 
shouldn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite optimistic predictions for overall preparations for Y2K,  
the Clinton administration has warned that schools, some cities, 
small hospitals and small businesses are foot-dragging on 
contingency plans for computer failures. Many schools -- often the 
largest public buildings in a community -- have a unique role as 
designated shelters and command centers in case of other 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, chairman of Clinton's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said that in the next two months, schools and colleges 
need to concentrate on fixing their systems, making sure they are 
independently tested and developing contingency plans in case of 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, schools looked at it as a software processing  
problem,'' said Koskinen, who sent warning letters to the nation's 
16,000 school districts this month. ``It has taken a long time for 
local educators to realize how much they rely on education 
technology for their operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money has been an issue for some systems; fixing Y2K has not  
come cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has spent $44.3 million; New York City, about $10  
million and Richmond, Va., $250,000, according to a report by the 
Council of Great City Schools, an association for the nation's 
largest school systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department has given schools and colleges over the  
last four years technical support such as guides, lectures and 
videos, but funding has been limited on a national level, Smith 
said.

<HEADLINE> Cowsills Come Back on the Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It wasn't a deal with the devil, but it felt  
that way to John, Paul, Bob and Susan Cowsill. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining active members of the singing siblings who were  
the real-life models for the Partridge Family sat in Dick Clark's 
office, ready to sign a contract to participate in one of his 
oldies package tours. 
</P>
<P>
	It was good money and easy work. Go on stage each night and sing  
their hits: ``The Rain, the Park and Other Things'' and ``Hair,'' 
both sweetly psychedelic, harmony-suffused relics from a long-ago 
era in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
	The price was abandoning any pretense they were contemporary  
musicians. Oldies tours may be lucrative, but they're generally a 
graveyard for anyone with musical ambition. That same conundrum was 
the subject of the late Ricky Nelson's 1972 hit, ``Garden Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowsills swallowed hard and walked away.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that we couldn't do this,'' Bob Cowsill recalled.  
``Susan is a great singer and a great artist. I had continued to 
write songs. We didn't view ourselves as this dinosaur band that 
had nothing left to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So seven years after that fateful decision, the Cowsills  
continue their comeback attempt. They recorded an album on their 
own, ``Global,'' and are peddling it on a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise is: The album isn't bad.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the Cowsills will never give the Backstreet Boys or  
Britney Spears any competition on the charts, nor are they pushing 
any artistic boundaries. But for people who fondly recall the Beach 
Boys or the Mamas and the Papas, it's a fun listen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Cowsills haven't quit their day jobs. Bob trains  
computer programmers, John is a carpenter and Paul is in 
construction. Susan is the more active musician, performing in the 
critically acclaimed Continental Drifters. 
</P>
<P>
	When your formative years are spent hearing your songs on the  
radio, giving concerts around the world and appearing on your own 
TV special, it's hard to accept the idea that your years of stardom 
are gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the Jacksons, Osmonds and Cowsills, the tail end of the  
1960s and early 1970s was a busy era for family acts. The Cowsills 
consisted of mom Barbara Cowsill, who died in 1985, and six of her 
seven children. They were originally approached for the TV series 
that became ``The Partridge Family,'' which instead went to a group 
of actors including Shirley Jones and David Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob's twin, Richard, was the only Cowsill not in the group, left  
behind by a domineering father who would not permit Richard to 
perform with the rest of the family because he said he wasn't good 
enough. Much bitterness ensued, and his influence dims the group's 
sunny public facade. Susan, now 40, joined the act when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have really excellent memories of that time,'' she said.  
``As far as I was concerned, we were having nothing but fun. I 
wasn't going to school, I was traveling all over the place, I had 
my own dog and we were out singing and laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end came in 1970 when their father caught the oldest  
brother, Bill, smoking pot and banished him. Bill and Bob were 
songwriting partners and the act's creative forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went on another couple of years, but it started downhill  
right there,'' Bob said. ``It was the beginning of the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changing times and tastes made the end inevitable, too. The act,  
and the family, splintered. The money disappeared and some siblings 
went years without talking to each other until they reunited for 
their mother's funeral. That's when they started talking, and 
singing, again. 
</P>
<P>
	The four reunited Cowsills began performing together partly  
because they had all settled in the southern California area. Bill, 
who is in Canada, and Barry, who is in New Orleans, didn't want to 
do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a semi-famous name in the music industry is more a  
hindrance than a help when it's tied to a particular era. 
</P>
<P>
	From his perspective, one thing he can offer to young musicians  
-- particularly a family act like the three Hanson brothers -- is 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enjoy it, embrace it and really cradle it,'' he said,  
``because it can be gone tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Gingrich To Be Fox News Commentator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
joined Fox News Channel as a political contributor on Wednesday, as 
the cable network beefs up its bench strength for the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Fox News announced it had signed former  
Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, who was 
once host of CNN's ``Crossfire,'' as another contributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich will appear frequently to discuss politics and  
government on various Fox News programs, said Chet Collier, senior 
vice president. Gingrich may even do some shows of his own as the 
election season heats up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make very broad use of him,'' Collier said.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, and  
ex-adviser to President Clinton, Dick Morris, are also political 
commentators at Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to build up for this presidential campaign and are  
going after people who will help us have a presence,'' Collier 
said.

<HEADLINE> EEOC Helps Undocumented Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illegal immigrants, long with little recourse  
against workplace discrimination or harassment, will no longer have 
abuse claims hampered by a lack of citizenship, federal officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you violate civil rights laws and you discriminate against  
undocumented workers, we will apply the full force of the law,'' 
Ida Castro, chairwoman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the commission's role was limited in cases of  
illegal workers. But EEOC officials announced the agency will no 
longer consider citizenship status in seeking redress from 
employers who discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rule, illegal workers could get back pay, be  
reinstated to their jobs if they were unfairly fired and ask the 
courts to force the employers to pay damages and attorney's fees if 
discrimination is proved. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro said undocumented workers ``are especially vulnerable to  
abuse and exploitation,'' and often have few resources when abused. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers are often paid below the minimum wage, see their  
paychecks withheld, and are discriminated against based on their 
ethnicity and language, according to immigrant rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage workers to come forward, the EEOC will not inform  
other government agencies if an immigrant is here illegally. Castro 
acknowledged that many undocumented workers will still be too 
intimidated to file complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	EEOC officials insisted the shift is not at cross-purposes with  
federal immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't enforce immigration laws; that's not our job,''  
said EEOC Vice Chairman Paul Igasaki. ``What we do is 
discrimination enforcement. The only way we can do that effectively 
is try to put that umbrella over everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Mueller, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, said the agency supports the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, anything that's going to protect workers' rights we're  
going to support,'' he said. ``Our public enemy are the smugglers 
and employers who exploit these people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary  
Committee's immigration subcommittee, said the policy would 
encourage illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing those who entered the U.S. illegally with special  
protections is absurd,'' Smith said. ``These rules would, for 
example, require employers to hire back individuals who had been 
fired when it is illegal to have hired them in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American  
Immigration Reform, a Washington-based lobbying group, said the new 
regulation undermines efforts to curb illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	``To give back pay to people who have no right to be here and no  
right to have a job makes no sense,'' Stein said. ``It totally 
undermines the principles of U.S. immigration law by throwing out 
illegal residents with one hand and encouraging their employment 
with the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrant rights groups said undocumented workers deserve the  
same protections as others who work legally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see heart-rending stories of workplace exploitation in  
which workers felt they had no recourse,'' said Sid Mohn, president 
of the Heartland Alliance for Human Needs and Human Rights, a 
Chicago-based immigrant rights group.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. reported a 3 percent increase in  
operating income Wednesday as strong sales in household goods, body 
care products and apparel overcame a down quarter for its food 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first quarter of fiscal 2000, which ended Oct. 2,  
operating earnings from continuing operations were $423 million, up 
3 percent from $411 million for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter, which included a one-time $137  
million gain from the sale of Sara Lee's international tobacco 
business, came to $258 million, or 28 cents a share, down 24 
percent from $337 million, or 35 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings matched the 28 cents per share consensus forecast  
of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $24.18 3/4 a share on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee Foods, which includes the company's packaged meats and  
bakery operations, posted an 8 percent decline in sales and a 6 
percent drop in income for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But branded apparel sales were up 6 percent, boosted by  
double-digit gains by Hanes underwear, Playtex bras and other 
apparel items. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are especially pleased with the strong unit volume  
increases in our non-food operations,'' said John H. Bryan, 
chairman and chief executive officer. ``These gains are the direct 
result of targeted investments in marketing and new product 
development for our leading brands around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase that we reported in the first quarter gives us  
further confidence that our company will produce a low double-digit 
earnings per share gain for the full year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee's leading brands include Sara Lee, Douwe Egberts,  
Hillshire Farm, Hanes, Coach and Playtex.

<HEADLINE> Sony Profits Plummet in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A surging yen sent profits at Sony Corp. tumbling  
for the first half of the fiscal year, though sales in its core 
electronics business would actually have risen by 11 percent in the 
second quarter if the yen had stayed steady. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Sony's group profits plunged 24.5 percent to  
64.9 billion yen ($622 million), compared to 86.1 billion yen ($825 
million) for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 7.6 percent, to 3.1 trillion yen ($29.7 billion) from  
3.4 trillion yen ($32.6 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the second-quarter rose 3.1 percent, however,  
rising to 46.5 billion yen ($445 million) from 45.1 billion yen 
($432 million) the previous year, the Japanese electronics giant 
said Wednesday. Revenue fell 6.8 percent, to 1.6 trillion yen 
($15.3 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30, down from 1.7 
trillion yen ($16.3 billion) in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the bad news was caused by the strengthening yen, which  
is devastating for exporters like Sony because it lowers the value 
of its overseas earnings when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In the July-September quarter, the yen averaged 112.7 yen to the  
U.S. dollar -- 23.3 percent higher than in the same quarter a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Sony's business remained healthy, especially  
considering the slowdown in the economy at home that has crimped 
consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results show that Sony's electronic business has truly  
recovered,'' said Hitoshi Kuriyama, an analyst for Merrill Lynch 
Japan in Tokyo. ``Sony outdid expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sony announced in March that it would reduce its work force of  
170,000 by 17,000 and cut manufacturing plants from 70 to 55 during 
the next four years. Sony is also trying to make computers and 
video games a bigger part of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of electronics remained strong, especially personal  
computers and video cameras, both in Japan and the United States, 
and would have been up by 11 percent if the yen hadn't jumped, Sony 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strong yen took its toll on all of Sony's main product  
lines except insurance, where revenue climbed by 11.7 percent on an 
increase in life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ending in September, electronics sales fell 5  
percent, to 1.18 trillion yen ($11 billion) on the rising yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Sony's movie business decreased 19 percent for the  
quarter. The second quarter got a boost from the box office success 
of ``Big Daddy' and ``Blue Streak'' but was hurt by ``Muppets From 
Space'' and ``Jakob the Liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Income from Sony's TV business fell because of the loss of the  
syndication sales of ``Seinfeld'' from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Sony Pictures, which includes the movie and TV  
businesses, would have been flat had the yen not risen. 
</P>
<P>
	Its music business reported a sales drop of 12.8 percent, but it  
would have had flat sales if the yen had stayed at the same level.

	Lower prices on game machines helped send sales in Sony's  
video-game business down by 4 percent for the latest quarter, even 
when keeping the currency constant.

<P>
	``We acknowledge some areas of our business had problems other  
than the strong yen,'' said Sony spokesman Tomohiko Maeda. ``But we

	U.S. shares of Sony fell 37 1/2 cents to $151.37 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Irvin's Return to Game Clouded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Irvin's return to the Dallas Cowboys from  
a spinal injury earlier this month was clouded as the team 
announced that Irvin was born with a spinal condition that 
increases his risk of further injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike was born with a different-looking spine,'' Cowboys owner  
Jerry Jones said on Tuesday. ``How does that impact any decision he 
might make? To me, I've heard more discussed about what he was born 
with than I have about any damage'' incurred from the spinal 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition, known as cervical stenosis, is basically a  
narrowing of the spinal canal. The congenital defect is relatively 
safe, team officials said, but the condition puts Irvin's spinal 
cord at greater risk because serious trauma can increase pressure 
and damage to the injured area. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Green Bay cornerback Tim Lewis and Houston Oilers  
linebacker Frank Bush retired finding out they had narrow spinal 
canals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm concerned,'' Jones said. ``They're addressing  
everything. I don't see this as necessarily totally decided by 
whether or not the swelling goes down. Right now, I don't know if 
that's the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cervical stenosis was initially revealed along with the  
spinal swelling when Irvin had a MRI exam after being knocked out 
of the game against Philadelphia on Oct. 10. Jones refused to say 
if the 33-year-old all-time leading receiver will return. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin was unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are still more questions that need to be answered over  
the next several weeks,'' Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days after the injury, Maurer said Irvin had been cleared  
to ride a stationary bicycle and do other conditioning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin is scheduled for another MRI tomorrow. X-rays taken Monday  
showed nothing new in terms of Irvin's genetic condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones told reporters surgery is not an option for Irvin.  
</P>
<P>
	The 12-year veteran said said last week that no one had advised  
him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin's injury occurred when he awkwardly fell headfirst into  
the Veterans Stadium artificial turf as he was being tackled. He 
immediately lost feeling in his extremities and couldn't move his 
hands or legs for more than 15 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Gerald and Betty Ford Receive Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deemed healers of Americans' bodies and souls,  
former President Ford and his wife, Betty, were awarded the 
Congressional Gold Medal on Wednesday, the highest civilian award 
given by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fitting that these partners in life are being honored  
jointly, for their partnership has enriched our democracy and our 
time,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just over 25 years ago -- on Aug. 9, 1974 -- that Ford was  
thrust into the presidency when President Nixon resigned in the 
wake of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford served out the final 2 1/2 years of Nixon's second term. His  
pardon of Nixon earned him harsh criticism at the time from 
Democrats and Republicans alike. However, many now credit that 
action and Ford's quiet resumption of the nation's business with 
helping the shocked country move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was easy for us to criticize you because we got caught up  
in the moment,'' President Clinton told Ford at Wednesday's 
ceremony on Capitol Hill. ``You didn't get caught up in the moment, 
and you were right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ford was recognized for her candor about personal  
frailties, which has been a source of comfort and enlightenment to 
many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Ford helped heal America's soul, Mrs. Ford helped  
heal our bodies,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The same year her husband became president, Mrs. Ford announced  
that she had breast cancer and would undergo a mastectomy, an 
illness and procedure not often openly discussed at that time. Her 
action is credited with encouraging many women to seek lifesaving 
early detection of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Ford shared with Americans how, after her husband lost  
his 1976 bid for re-election to Jimmy Carter, she had become 
addicted to alcohol and pills her doctor had prescribed to help her 
ease sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	After recovering, she became the founder and president of the  
Betty Ford Center for alcohol and substance abuse in California, 
where the Fords now live. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda was something  
of a homecoming for the Fords. The former president served in the 
House as representative for Michigan's 3rd District from 1949 and 
as minority leader from 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert recalled how Ford's congressional  
colleagues voted overwhelmingly for him assume his fateful vice 
presidency under Nixon in 1973, after Spiro Agnew resigned under 
the shadow of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gerald Ford did not become president because of polls, he did  
not become president because of campaign promises; he became 
president because of character,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ford said that in spite of their unexpected years at the  
other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, in the White House, ``this House, 
to Gerry and me, the People's House, will always be our home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers initially used the Congressional Gold Medal to honor  
military leaders but began using it during the 20th century to 
recognize excellence in a range of fields. More than 320 medals 
have been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorees in recent years have included civil rights pioneer Rosa  
Parks, singer Frank Sinatra, Mother Theresa and South African 
President Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Plays After Father Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul O'Neill's father died early Wednesday  
morning after a long struggle with heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder was in the lineup in his usual  
spot, batting third and playing right field in Game 4 of the World 
Series against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he showed up, I assumed he was going to play,'' manager  
Joe Torre said. ``That's why he was here. This can keep his mind 
off the grieving for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paulie does what he does. As George Steinbrenner likes to say,  
he's a warrior. He's here even though it is tough to concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles O'Neill, 79, died at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday at Lenox Hill  
Hospital in New York, about three hours after the Yankees beat the 
Braves 6-5 in 10 innings to take a 3-0 lead in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder O'Neill had come to New York from his Ohio home  
earlier this month for treatment for his heart. His son left the 
team for one day in June when his father underwent heart surgery in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul has been carrying a heavy heart for a while now,'' Torre  
said. ``His dad has been suffering. He was not surprised by his 
passing because he had been in tough shape. It's a very sorrowful 
time for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who did not want to talk about his father's death  
before the game, stretched and took batting practice with his 
teammates on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	It was uncertain when the funeral would be held and whether  
O'Neill would have to leave the team if the World Series extended 
beyond Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's obviously free to do what he has to do for his family,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill is the third Yankee whose father has died in the past  
two months. Scott Brosius' father died of colon cancer on Sept. 12. 
Luis Sojo missed the first two games of the Series after his father 
died last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play this game you try to eliminate the highs and  
lows,'' Torre said. ``That has been difficult. There is nothing 
higher than playing in the World Series and nothing lower than 
mourning the loss of a family member. There has been a lot of this 
going on. We just have to fight through it.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Fans Flood Online Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A $9.99 golf ball suddenly was bid up to  
$202.50. An autographed score card, initially priced at just $1, 
rocketed to $103. 
</P>
<P>
	As news spread of golf champion Payne Stewart's death in a  
bizarre plane crash Monday, asking prices for the golfer's 
memorabilia began soaring on online auction sites as adoring fans 
and macabre collectors logged on to place their bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auction sites such as eBay, Yahoo! and Amazon.com were  
swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	At eBay, an autographed photo of Stewart decked out in his  
signature knickers and tam-o'-shanter hat went on the block last 
Tuesday for $9.95. And it stayed at that price, with only one bid, 
until 1:30 p.m. Monday -- when the value of Stewart's memorabilia 
started going up and authorities confirmed his plane had gone down 
in a South Dakota field, killing everyone on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one bids and 27 hours later, frenzied fans had pushed the  
price for the photograph to $761.51. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past it took people some time to realize the changing  
value of a baseball card or such,'' said Tom Churchill, a producer 
at Yahoo! Auctions. ``But with the Internet, you can see those 
values change in real time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill said there was a surge in the number of searches for  
Payne Stewart at Yahoo! in the 24 hours following the plane crash 
and early indications showed a sudden increase in the number of 
Stewart's items being put up for sale immediately after the 
accident. He could not give specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction is a common one, said Sharon Greenspan, a  
spokeswoman for Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen a trend of this with John F. Kennedy Jr. and Lady  
Diana or any events associated with a tragedy,'' she said. ``It's 
people's way of showing how they grieve or how they remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's death was especially untimely. His plane was flying  
from Florida to Houston, where he was schedule to compete in the 
PGA Tour Championship. But shortly into the flight, it veered off 
course, hurtling pilotless 1,400 miles across the country and 
finally plummeting to earth after running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators speculate that the cabin suddenly lost pressure  
causing all aboard to lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was a popular golf figure. He won 18 tournaments,  
including two U.S. Open titles and was part of the team that helped 
the United States stage a historic comeback to beat Europe last 
month for the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's not always such fond memories of greatness that  
motivate collectors. According to the law of economics, the simple 
fact that no more autographs will ever be signed means the value of 
existing autographs naturally increases. 
</P>
<P>
	It's at that point, that something as sentimental as a baseball  
card or golf club can be transformed into a long-term investment, 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's kind of ghoulish to think that way,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Jordan Has Eventful Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brian Jordan dropped the first ball that came  
his way Tuesday night, and he couldn't quite hang onto the last 
one, either. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Atlanta Braves right fielder makes either catch, the  
Braves might have survived in Game 3 of the World Series. Instead, 
they lost 6-5 in 10 innings to the New York Yankees and are on the 
verge of being swept. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also made a spectacular catch on a drive by Joe Girardi  
in the third inning, crashing against the wall to prevent a sure 
double. But it's the two balls hit by Chuck Knoblauch that will 
remain etched in the outfielder's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves led 5-3 heading to the bottom of the eighth when  
Girardi led off with a single to right. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up was Knoblauch, who lofted a fly ball down the  
right-field line. Jordan cruised toward the wall for what would 
have been an easy catch in just about any other park, but not at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan ran out of room at the 314-foot sign, leaped high and  
stretched his glove over the top of the blue-padded wall. 
</P>
<P>
	At least he didn't have to contend with Jeffrey Maier, the boy  
who leaned over the wall the opposite way to create a Yankees' 
homer in the 1996 AL Championship Series. It didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball struck the outer webbing of Jordan's glove and fell  
into the jubilant crowd while the outfielder crashed back to the 
ground. He looked hopefully toward his left hand, but nothing was 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was going to get out,'' Jordan said. ``My  
glove went over and it hit the top of my glove. I was hoping it was 
in there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, I wish I could have leaped another inch higher. We  
felt like we had the game wrapped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading off the first, Knoblauch sliced a liner to Jordan's  
right. Running at full speed, the outfielder caught up to the ball 
but watched it deflect off his glove for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch wound up at second base and came in with an unearned  
run that tied the score at 1. The Braves bounced back with three 
runs in the third and another in the fourth to take a 5-1 lead, but 
the Yankees wouldn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Curtis homered in the fifth. Tino Martinez homered in the  
seventh. Knoblauch completed the comeback with his two-run, 
315-foot drive in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I hit it at Yankee Stadium,'' Knoblauch said. ``I was  
hoping to get it up far enough. Luckily, it bounced the right 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis finished off the Braves with his second homer of the  
night, a mammoth shot off Mike Remlinger in the 10th.

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Backs Off Retirement Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Hold off on that Dick Vermeil retirement talk.  
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams coach said Wednesday he would stay on the job  
indefinitely, backing off a statement earlier this week that he 
would likely quit after his five-year contract expires after the 
2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil, who will be 63 Saturday, is known for saying what he  
feels at that moment. He said his only plan is to keep getting his 
unbeaten team ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retirement statement that was made was blown out of  
proportion,'' Vermeil said. ``I hope I've put that to rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams, at 6-0 the only undefeated team in the NFL, play at  
Tennessee (5-1) Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil totaled nine victories in the first two years of his  
coaching comeback. So before the season, he said people only wanted 
to know what he was going to do when he got fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, they want to know what I'm going to do at the end of my  
contract,'' Vermeil said. ``I have no plans other than to get this 
team ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have a five-year contract and I just hoped to make it  
through the five years. And if we're going well and everything's 
going well and they want me to stay, then that'll be a decision 
I'll have to make at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said he feels well physically.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel strong other than having a cold,'' Vermeil said. ``So  
there's no reason to think about getting out of here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Vermeil said he would have no problem walking away if  
the program was successful at the end of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the program is running good, I'll feel I've accomplished  
something,'' Vermeil told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ``But that's 
a long ways away from now. I've seen playoff coaches get fired the 
next year.''

<HEADLINE> Sun Healthcare Makes Repayment deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- A nursing home company that filed for  
bankruptcy protection earlier this month has reached a tentative 
payment plan with holders of more than half of its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced yesterday between Sun Healthcare Group  
Inc. and most of its senior creditors represents a potential 
restructuring of $1.3 billion of its $2.1 billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, however, would not provide any money for common  
stockholders or lesser creditors, the company said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unfortunate aspect of the bankruptcy that our stock  
does lose its value,'' Sun spokeswoman Karen Gilliland said 
Tuesday. ``We have many employees, including our CEO, that are 
affected by this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, based in Albuquerque, provides care to about 40,000 people  
in 369 nursing homes nationwide. The company and its affiliate 
firms employ about 80,000 people worldwide, including the United 
Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun listed more than $1.8 billion in assets and $2.1 billion in  
debts in its bankruptcy petition. When the company filed it Oct. 14 
in Delaware, it said it was close to a reorganization plan. 
Tuesday's agreement is a major step toward such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reorganization is necessary for Sun to emerge from bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
	Sun said details of the agreement would not be available until a  
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Sun's release, senior creditors have agreed  
there won't be enough money to pay anything to lesser creditors, 
the holders of $400 million in subordinated bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	It appears that the ``senior-most creditors all got together  
with the debtor and cut out the subordinated bond holders out of 
the picture,'' said Peter Chapman, president of New Jersey-based 
Bankruptcy Creditors Service Inc. and editor of Sun Healthcare 
Bankruptcy News. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts pointed out that the agreement also fails to mention  
what will happen to the real estate investment trust companies from 
which Sun leases nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement still needs to be approved by a bankruptcy  
creditors committee and bankruptcy judge as part of Sun's 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, it would provide Sun's banks and senior bondholders  
with a combination of cash, new senior long-term debt, new 
preferred stock and new common stock.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Talking About Minn. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- With his controversial comments on  
organized religion and a tell-all autobiography, Gov. Jesse 
Ventura's national image as a loudmouthed diversion has grown since 
his election a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But back home in Minnesota, he's been talking mostly about  
policy lately. His major project is government reform, and the 
centerpiece is an idea only Nebraska has embraced: a single-house 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura says the issue should be a priority when state lawmakers  
reconvene in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``My point is let's get it on the ballot,'' Ventura said. ``The  
people have a right to choose and if I lose, I'll live with it. But 
at least we got it out there and at least the right people made the 
decision on what our government should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue will go to the voters on the November 2000 ballot only  
if approved by both legislative chambers in the coming session. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, a Reform Party member, says a change would save  
the state money and make the system more accountable, accessible 
and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	He argues bills would follow a shorter, more understandable path  
if conference committees -- which work out differences between the 
chambers -- are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Such committees give a handful of lawmakers too much power,  
Ventura believes. He also dislikes the gamesmanship he sees in the 
two-chamber system, which can let lawmakers cast politically 
correct votes secure in the knowledge a bill will die elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts say the single-house idea is hardly innovative, and  
could merely be Ventura's search for a reform agenda in a state 
with little need for one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did seem to come from nowhere,'' said Steven Smith, a  
University of Minnesota political science professor. ``There wasn't 
a public discussion of this idea. There wasn't a fiscal meltdown in 
the state from deadlock. To the contrary, things went smoothly'' in 
the 1999 Legislature, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska voters approved a one-House Legislature in 1934 after  
years of effort by George Norris, a populist who served in the U.S. 
House and Senate for a combined 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent poll showed Minnesotans almost evenly divided on the  
issue. And while a switch is a long shot, supporters say the idea 
might be lost for certain without a strong push from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has acknowledged the challenge of asking lawmakers  
to allow a vote that could eliminate some of their jobs, but says 
they should put that aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Ventura's own controversies have made lawmakers  
less afraid of his bully pulpit. And with no fellow Reform Party 
members in the Legislature, he has no natural allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly he's made it easier during the past few weeks for  
elected officials in both of the major parties to oppose him,'' 
Smith said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Netscape Pioneer Forms New Startup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Web pioneer Marc Andreessen is launching a  
startup that will help other companies build Internet businesses, 
his first major venture since leaving America Online last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, the 28-year old co-founder of Netscape  
Communications, formed the new company, called Loudcloud Inc., with 
a group of other Internet professionals from Netscape, Cisco 
Systems Inc., InfoSeek and other Web-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen, who helped build the world's first commercial  
Internet browser, had joined AOL when it bought Netscape 
Communications for $10 billion early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture was vague about what it would sell. Loudcloud will  
supply ``technology and services high-growth Internet companies 
need to compete and win,'' Andreesseen said in a statement released 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., planned to disclose  
more details early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreessen is chairman of Loudcloud. Ben Horowitz, another  
Loudcloud co-founder who also was a Netscape and AOL executive, is 
chief executive officer.

	Market Ends Mixed; Dow Up 92.76  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rally in the bond market carried over to  
stocks today, lifting financial shares and pulling the Dow 
industrials out of a narrow trading range. At the close of trading 
on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 92.76 at 
10,394.89. Much of the rally came in the final hour of trading. 
Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the Nasdaq composite 
index down 8.95 at 2,802.52. Bond prices rose for the first time in 
a week today after a report in Europe suggested the European 
Central Bank may raise interest rates on Nov. 4, making its own 
effort to hold off inflation before it endangers economic growth.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weaker demand for airplanes and cars led  
orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured goods down 1.3 
percent in September. The slide was about three times what analysts

	TORONTO (AP) -- Air Canada disclosed today that it would face  
stiff penalties -- as much as $169 million in the first year alone -- 
if it leaves the Star Alliance of United Airlines and Lufthansa for 
rival Oneworld of American Airlines. The penalty provision was part 
of a 10-year deal Air Canada signed last week with the Star 
Alliance to help fight off a hostile takeover bid by Onex Corp., 
one of Canada's largest companies. Onex, which is backed by 
American Airlines, insists the penalties are a ``poison pill'' 
designed to thwart its offer to merge Air Canada with Canadian 
Airlines to create a single national airline linked with the 
Oneworld alliance.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Friday will be the anniversary of the stock  
market crash of 1929, which brought a halt to a a period of free 
spending and widespread optimism that stocks would keep going up 
and up. Many similar conditions prevail these days, but market 
watchers point out that for every similarity, there are also 
differences narrowing the odds of another catastrophic market 
decline. William C. Freund, director of the Center for the Study of 
Equity Markets at Pace University in New York says: ``The economy 
has become more and more stable, we know how to use fiscal policy, 
and there are whole new industries that contribute substantially to 
economic growth.''

<HEADLINE> Aetna Gets OK To Operate Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest life  
and health insurers, has won permission from federal regulators to 
operate a savings bank offering trust services to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval was announced Wednesday by the Office of Thrift  
Supervision, a day after mutual fund giant Fidelity was granted the 
same powers. They are the latest in a string of companies to get 
new federal savings and loan charters in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come as Congress edges toward passage of sweeping  
legislation to rewrite the financial services laws and allow banks, 
insurance companies and securities firms such as Fidelity to merge 
and sell each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Thrift Supervision, part of the Treasury  
Department, has reviewed and approved applications from a number of 
insurance companies, securities firms and other businesses outside 
the banking industry seeking to open federal thrifts. In granting 
the requests, the regulators have chipped away at the 
Depression-era laws separating the financial services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna plans to use the new savings bank,  
to be called Aetna Trust Co., to offer trustee, custodian and 
recordkeeping services to employee retirement plans and individuals 
with IRA plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of Aetna Trust Co. ... is an ideal complement to  
our business, enhancing our ability to deliver products and 
services that help our customers live the lives they want to 
lead,'' Catherine Smith, chief financial officer of Aetna Financial 
Services, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal thrift agency required that at least 40 percent of  
the new savings bank's directors be individuals who are not 
officials or employees of Aetna Inc. or its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies receiving new savings and loan charters recently  
include agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., 
long-distance telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and 
coffin manufacturer Hillenbrand Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrift charter applications are pending from, among others, Ford  
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and department store chains 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-financial companies such as these would not be able to  
acquire federal thrifts under the current financial overhaul 
legislation now before Congress, however, as legislators seek to 
avoid the mixing of commerce and banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would not affect non-financial companies which  
have already had their applications approved.

<HEADLINE> Hemingway's Son Shares Dad's Poetry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Admirers of Ernest Hemingway rarely think of  
him as a poet -- just not that kind of guy -- but his eldest son John 
was at the Library of Congress on Wednesday to present the author's 
first book: ``Three Stories and Ten Poems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was published in Paris in 1923 when Hemingway, later to win  
the Nobel prize for his novels, was 24. This copy is dedicated to 
his first wife, Hadley -- John's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	John, 76, was born the same year. Now he wears a rounded white  
beard, much like Ernest Hemingway's in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
	John told a news conference that his father had never spoken to  
him about his verses. ``But you know that a great deal of his early 
work was in poetry,'' he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Six poems were published in ``Poetry: A Magazine of Verse,'' and  
editor Harriet Monroe described the author then as ``a young 
Chicago poet now abroad who will soon issue in Paris his first book 
of verse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, many were written to Mary, Hemingway's fourth and last  
wife. One threatens jokingly to ``hang myself from your Christmas 
tree'' if she doesn't accept him as a Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Another poem, written earlier, is clouded with thoughts of  
death. It includes the lines: 
</P>
<P>
	``Eternity is scarcely found  
</P>
<P>
	``Until we're underneath the ground  
</P>
<P>
	``Where thudding hooves will never sound.  
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway killed himself at 61.  
</P>
<P>
	At age 12 he was rhyming about baseball:  
</P>
<P>
	``With Chance on first and Evers on third,  
</P>
<P>
	``Great things from the Cubs will soon be heard.''  
</P>
<P>
	He was bitter about World War I, in which he was wounded on the  
Italian front. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``Soldiers never do die well;  
</P>
<P>
	``Crosses mark the places,  
</P>
<P>
	``Wooden crosses where they fell;  
</P>
<P>
	``Stuck above their faces.  
</P>
<P>
	John said his father also wrote many poems about World War II,  
when he was a correspondent, ``mostly about separation from his 
girl friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A. E. Hotchner, a close friend for the last 14 years of  
Hemingway's life, also gave the library a large collection of 
photos, manuscripts, home movies and 15 spools of magnetized wire 
recordings. He was not sure of the contents of the recordings, he 
said, but knew they included Hemingway reciting two long poems to 
Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the wires have not yet been transcribed.  
</P>
<P>
	Alice Birney, an historian of American literature at the  
library, said that Hemingway's poems have no claim to be considered 
great verse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are pretty raunchy,'' she pointed out.  
</P>
<P>
	According to ``Advice to a Son:''  
</P>
<P>
	``Always put paper on the seat,  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't believe in wars,  
</P>
<P>
	``Keep yourself both clean and neat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never marry whores.''

<HEADLINE> Bethlehem Steel Reports Net Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Competition from steel imports and costs of  
modernization combined to give Bethlehem Steel a net loss of $90 
million, or 77 cents per share, for the third quarter of 1999, the 
company reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Bethlehem reported net income of $37 million, 21  
cents a share, for the third quarter. Wednesday's results were 
below the 63 cents-per-share loss forecast by analysts surveyed by 
First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very disappointed with our third quarter financial  
results,'' said Curtis H. Barnette, Bethlehem's chairman and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our shipment levels and prices were depressed because of  
unfairly traded steel imports, and we incurred substantial 
additional costs in connection with extensive and planned 
modernization and other outages,'' Barnette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the third quarter of 1999 were $958 million, compared  
to $1.14 billion for the third quarter of 1998. According to the 
company, average steel prices for domestic companies in 1999 are 
down seven percent from average 1998 prices, the largest such 
decline in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the company has been hurt by the very aggressive  
imports of steel into the U.S. However, they are generally looking 
for higher steel prices,'' said Todd A. Hinrichs, an analyst with 
ABN AMRO North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general consensus is that the market for steel is  
turning,'' Hinrichs said. ``The problem is, how quickly can it 
turn?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bethlehem's stock fell 25 cents to $6.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethlehem, based in Bethlehem, Pa., said its third-quarter  
results included about $50 million in additional operating costs 
associated with relining a blast furnace at Sparrows Point, Md.; 
with a temporary shutdown at a majority-owned iron ore operation in 
Hibbing, Minn., and other modernization and maintenance outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hibbing operation was idled because of high iron ore  
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Bethlehem's net loss was $145  
million, or $1.35 per share, on sales of $2.90 billion, compared to 
a profit of $143 million, or 92 cents per share, on sales of $3.47 
billion for the first three quarters of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, Bethlehem said it expects competition to remain  
intense in its markets, because of excess global steel capacity, 
new domestic supply and continuing high inventories of steel plate. 
But it predicted the combination of current orders and better 
market demand will allow some restoration of prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Production has been resumed at Hibbing and most of the work at  
Sparrows Point has finished. Modernized facilities should result in 
improved competitiveness and profitability for the long term, 
provided fair trade in steel is restored, Bethlehem said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would continue its strategy of concentrating  
on steel and rebuilding its financial strength, taking all steps 
needed to reduce costs and improve competitiveness.

	Governor Leaving Cuba With Sick Boy  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Concern over a sick child's welfare triumphed over  
political differences today, as Fidel Castro granted Illinois' 
visiting governor permission to take an ailing 7-year-old boy back 
to the United States with him for treatment. The boy, Raudel 
Alfonso Garcia, suffers from portal hypertension, a potentially 
fatal disease that produces high pressure in blood flowing from 
several organs to the liver. Cuban doctors don't have the 
facilities to treat him. Castro ``has agreed to let him go back, 
and we are going to take him back with us tomorrow,'' Gov. George 
Ryan told an impromptu news conference early today after a meeting 
with the Cuban president.

three days of low-key protests by members of the banned spiritual 
movement Falun Gong. Group members staged no overt demonstrations 
and were not easily distinguished from the hordes of Chinese 
tourists normally wandering the square, China's symbolic political 
heart. But their presence there in defiance of a three-month 
crackdown against Falun Gong assured that they would be arrested,

	Supreme Court To Review Electrocutions

<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to  
consider whether electrocution amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment, using a Florida case in its first evaluation of the 
controversial procedure in more than a century. The decision, 
announced yesterday, comes four months after the third botched 
electrocution in Florida this decade. It effectively shut down

	Rising River Threatens Mexican City  
</P>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- The bloated Grijalva River, one of  
Mexico's largest, rose to dangerously high levels yesterday and was 
threatening to wipe out the heart of this already badly flooded 
city, the capital of Tabasco state. More than 22 miles of sandbags 
were the only thing holding it back. The crisis began three days 
ago, when authorities opened the floodgates of Las Penitas dam 
upstream in the neighboring state of Chiapas, releasing four times 
the amount of water normally discharged. The dam was beyond 
capacity and in danger of breaking.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third of the households with children in  
Cleveland and Oakland, Calif., are unhappy with their neighborhood 
elementary schools, and one-fifth of those families in those cities 
are so dissatisfied they want to move because of their schools, a 
survey found. Generally, however, parents across the nation view 
their schools favorably, according to a survey being released today 
by the Educational Testing Service. It said that in more than 
three-fourths of the cities surveyed, fewer than 10 percent of 
households indicated they wanted to move because of poor school 
quality.

<HEADLINE> Fidelity Allowed To Operate Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mutual fund giant Fidelity is getting deeper  
into the personal trust side of the banking business, having won 
permission from federal regulators to operate a savings bank 
offering trust services to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval announced Tuesday by the Office of Thrift  
Supervision makes Boston-based Fidelity the latest in a string of 
companies to get new federal savings and loan charters in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as Congress edges toward passage of sweeping  
legislation to rewrite the financial services laws and allow banks, 
insurance companies and securities firms such as Fidelity to merge 
and sell each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Thrift Supervision, part of the Treasury  
Department, has reviewed and approved applications from a number of 
insurance companies, securities firms and other businesses outside 
the banking industry seeking to open federal thrifts. In granting 
the requests, the regulators have chipped away at the 
Depression-era laws separating the financial services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fidelity, the nation's biggest mutual fund company, already  
engages in corporate and personal trust business through a 
subsidiary, Fidelity Management Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The new savings bank, to be called Fidelity Personal Trust Co.,  
will be based in Boston. It will offer services nationwide that 
include acting as an investment adviser or custodian of trust funds 
or property held in trust, executing wills and acting as guardian 
of an estate or trustee of an IRA account. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency required that at least 40 percent of the savings  
bank's directors be individuals who are not officials or employees 
of Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Fidelity didn't return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies receiving new savings and loan charters recently  
include agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., 
long-distance telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and 
coffin manufacturer Hillenbrand Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrift charter applications are pending from, among others, Ford  
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and department store chains 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-financial companies such as these would not be able to  
acquire federal thrifts under the current financial overhaul 
legislation now before Congress, however, as legislators seek to 
avoid the mixing of commerce and banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would not affect non-financial companies which  
have already had their applications approved.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 17.41 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as the continuing watch  
over inflation kept most investors from making any big commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	With an hour remaining in trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 17.41 at 10,284.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 0.70 at 1,282.61, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 34.89 at 2,776.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a short-lived lift from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured 
goods fell 1.3 percent in September, the first decline in five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was sharper than many analysts had expected, and  
offered some indication that the pace of U.S. economic growth may 
be tapering off. Stocks have stumbled in recent weeks amid worries 
that the economy is growing fast enough to persuade the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates would slow economic growth by making it more  
expensive to borrow money to finance growth. They could also hurt 
stocks, however, by cutting into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks hovered in a narrow range as investors awaited two pieces  
of economic data viewed as better gauges of inflation. On Thursday, 
the government will report on the employment cost index and the 
gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay fell 13 15/16 to 138 1/16. The company  
said after the close of trading Tuesday its quarterly operating 
profits rose, beating analysts' expectations, after it signed up a 
record number of new users and expanded its offerings. But the 
company's profit margin fell, which caught some investors by 
surprise. EBay also recorded fewer transactions for new users, 
raising concerns about future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer slipped 7/16 to 19 1/16 after reporting earnings  
of $117 million, or 7 cents a share in the recent quarter. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected Compaq to earn 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two weeks, corporate earnings reports have given the  
market some sporadic relief from the lingering worries about 
inflation. But as the profit reports end and are no longer a 
distraction, the market may remain stuck in a relatively narrow 
range, said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George 
K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``With most of the third-quarter earnings news out, stocks will  
likely return to an interest rate and Fed-watch stance over the 
next several days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks were mostly higher today. Thomas M. McManus, equity  
portfolio strategist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, said the 
sector was benefiting from a sense that resolution on interest 
rates is drawing near. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those stocks have really been laggards'' due to fears of  
rising rates, he said. ``It finally appears that it's time for them 
to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citigroup rose 1 3/4 to 50 1/4, and Chase Manhattan rose 2 3/16 to 80.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 664.68 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.02 to 414.77.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Won't Open Ramsey Probe New Evidence%xhl) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By JUDITH KOHLER 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens said Wednesday he has decided not  
to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the JonBenet Ramsey 
slaying, saying police are working with new evidence and headed in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also had strong words for the little girl's parents, John  
and Patsy Ramsey, asking them to ``stop hiding behind their 
attorneys'' and return to Colorado to help authorities solve the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the killers, let me say this: You only think you have  
gotten away with murder. There is strong evidence to suggest who 
you are,'' Owens said. ``I think investigators are moving closer to 
proving their case. They will keep pursuing you. You will reap what 
you have sown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who moved to the Atlanta area after the killing,  
have insisted they are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said the governor's references  
to the killers was the strongest accusation yet against the 
Ramseys. He called it a ``cheap shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone, even a governor, should be allowed to  
accuse people of doing something, which they have a constitutional 
right to do, which is hide behind their lawyers,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, a Boulder County grand jury completed a 13-month  
investigation of the 1996 slaying without issuing any indictments. 
District Attorney Alex Hunter said there was not enough evidence to 
charge anyone, although he and police said the Ramseys remain under 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also asked a seven-member task force to recommend whether  
a special prosecutor should be appointed. The group was made up of 
a former Colorado Supreme Court chief justice; Owens' chief legal 
counsel; a deputy attorney general and four district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Owens said he had decided that investigators were on  
the right track and were analyzing ``substantial new evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens acknowledged that initial mistakes harmed the probe.  
Critics have claimed the investigation was compromised when 
detectives allowed the Ramseys and friends to roam through their 
mansion in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the initial Ramsey investigation was far from  
perfect,'' Owens acknowledged. ``There can be little doubt that the 
Ramsey case will be harder to prove in court because of the initial 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``The killers in the case made some very serious  
mistakes, but they're also very smart. They have stonewalled very 
effectively and they have covered their tracks well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor declined comment on whether the Ramseys had a role  
in their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could speak to John and Patsy Ramsey,'' he said, ``I  
would tell them to quit hiding behind their attorneys, come back to 
Colorado and work with investigators in this case, no matter where 
that trail will lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hal Haddon, the Ramseys' Boulder-based attorney, was in a  
conference and not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Texas Reports 25 Cases of Dengue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas has recorded 25 cases of dengue fever since  
July, including the only cases of the tropical disease acquired in 
the United States this year, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least five cases were acquired in the United States, while  
some were believed caught in Mexico and Brazil. Others are still 
being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the state's largest outbreak since 1995, when 29 people  
caught the disease, seven acquired in the state, the officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is the only state that has reported locally acquired cases  
of the virus in the last 50 years, said Vance Vorndam, a 
microbiologist for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Although diseases like dengue, yellow fever and malaria 
were common in the United States earlier this century, they have 
been mostly wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Dengue symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, joint and  
muscle pain and nausea. The disease usually lasts about two weeks 
and is rarely fatal. There is no vaccine or cure for dengue. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC confirmed 90 cases of dengue in the United States last  
year, all acquired in other countries. Since dengue is rarely 
fatal, many cases might go unreported or misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is experiencing spillover from an outbreak in northern  
Mexico, where 7,000 cases have been reported this year. Arizona had 
three suspected travel-related cases of dengue fever this year and 
California had a handful of cases.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Cop Accused of Sexual Battery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A police officer being investigated in  
connection with the alleged rape of a bartender at a police social 
club was charged with sexual battery Wednesday in a separate 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Bill Martin was accused of groping a female security guard  
and making suggestive comments on Sept. 5 near the police station 
he oversaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin also is the focus of an investigation into events that  
occurred at a police social club called the Glitter Dome on Sept. 
25. A bartender says she was raped by one or more officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have released a 911 call that Martin placed from the club  
saying the woman was drunk and nude. Martin also said he saw three 
or four condoms, but police responding to the club said they didn't 
find any. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is out of state and has been on personal leave since the  
investigation began. Martin's attorney said he would talk to Martin 
on Wednesday night by telephone and promised that the officer would 
be back in Oklahoma City by Friday for arraignment.

<HEADLINE> `Garage Olimpo' Recalls Dirty War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Marco Bechis knew he wanted to  
film ``Garage Olimpo'' back in 1977. In April of that year, army 
troops under the junta's command dragged him from school and hauled 
him off to a secret jail. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 20, and the 10 days of confinement had a lasting impact.  
In captivity he was blindfolded and kept isolated; all he heard 
were the sounds of doors being opened and shut brusquely, of chains 
clanking, of locks jangling. Bechis survived thanks to his Italian 
passport; he was expelled from the country and went to Italy, where 
he lives now. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Argentine-Italian director has recaptured the terror  
of that violent era through ``Garage Olimpo,'' helping moviegoers 
revisit the atrocities of the 1976-83 dictatorship through a 1990s 
lens. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie re-creates the terror of the so-called Dirty War, when  
thousands were kidnapped or made to disappear during the military 
regime's hunt for leftist opponents and other dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Set in the time of the dictatorship, the film tells the story of  
Maria, a 19-year-old political activist who teaches poor shantytown 
workers to read and write. Played by Antonella Costa, the beautiful 
heroine lives in a decaying mansion in Buenos Aires, where her 
mother rents out rooms to make ends meet. One of the tenants is 
Felix, a shy young man who falls in love with Maria. 
</P>
<P>
	Played by Carlos Echevarria, Felix is without a past. He claims  
to work as a watchman in a garage. One morning, soldiers seize 
Maria and take her to ``Garage Olimpo'' -- a torture center. There, 
Maria is shocked to discover her interrogator is none other than 
Felix. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, their peculiar relationship unfolds as Maria fights  
for survival against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 350 detention centers were said to operate at the  
height of the dictatorship. An official report said at least 9,000 
people were killed in the junta's war on what it called leftist 
subversion. Human rights groups put the figure as high as 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was also a time when thousands of Argentines celebrated  
in the streets over their first World Cup soccer championship -- 
won, no less, in Buenos Aires -- while compatriots languished in 
detention centers in this capital. As the unusual love between 
Maria and Felix develops inside the center, one even hears the 
cheering from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bechis said he sought to set that bleak period in a global  
context, ``to make a subtle connection between what happened in 
Argentina 20 years ago and ... what happened just a short while ago 
in Bosnia and Sarajevo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now 43, Bechis worries that memories of the junta years are  
fading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, someone in 100 years might say that none of this  
happened. If evidence and testimonies aren't left behind, it's 
perfectly possible that could happen,'' he said in an interview 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	Some reviewers charge that the film lacks the intensity and  
complexity of similar captor dramas. But a reviewer in Clarin, 
Argentina's largest newspaper, said the movie is a reminder of the 
deep injury that remains from that military era, writing: ```Garage 
Olimpo' is not only the story of Felix and Maria. It is the story 
of those who are no longer with us and those who managed to survive 
the horror -- of wounds felt deeply in all of society, of the 
nightmare that yet returns from the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, several former junta leaders were convicted and  
sentenced to life in prison, only to be pardoned by President 
Carlos Menem in 1990. Under a loophole in the amnesty, several of 
the former leaders are being prosecuted anew -- on charges of 
abducting infants born to women in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, ``Garage Olimpo'' has been presented in the  
noncompetitive section of the 52nd annual Cannes Film Festival as 
well as Toronto's film festival. But it finds resonance in 
Argentina, particularly among those who were only children at the 
time of the Dirty War. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabian Antonelli, 23, said he was disturbed by the film's  
graphic quality. Nonetheless, he said he had to see the movie. 
``They showed things one must never forget,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Florida State Cornerback Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Tay Cody, a junior cornerback, was  
suspended Wednesday by Florida State coach Bobby Bowden following 
his arrest for possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said Cody, who was arrested Tuesday, would miss  
Saturday's game against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm suspending him for the next game and maybe more, until the  
facts are in,'' Bowden said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody, of Blakely, Ga., was taken into custody near Colquitt,  
Ga., by troopers from the Georgia Department of Public Safety after 
a routine traffic stop led police to discover four bags of 
marijuana in the car he was driving, department spokesman Gordy 
Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers noted the car Cody was driving along U.S. Highway 27  
was not registered in the player's name. After stopping Cody, the 
troopers saw a small bag of marijuana on the driver's side 
floorboard, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers arrested Cody, and while searching him, discovered  
three more bags of marijuana. Wright said the amount of found was 
less than an ounce, a misdemeanor in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody, a third-year starter for the top-ranked Seminoles, has two  
interceptions this season and six for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	He sealed Florida State's 17-14 victory over Clemson last  
Saturday when he partially blocked a 41-yard field goal attempt 
with less than two minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Peter Warrick was reinstated in time for the  
Clemson game after missing two games while facing felony grand 
theft, which was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor. Warrick and 
teammate Laveranues Coles were arrested for paying only $21.40 for 
more than $400 worth of designer clothes.

<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Hoyt Axton, a folksy baritone, songwriter  
and actor who wrote Three Dog Night's No. 1 hit ``Joy to the 
World'' and songs that were performed by artists from Elvis Presley 
to Ringo Starr, died Tuesday. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton had suffered a heart attack two weeks ago, and another  
during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Dog Night's recording of his novelty ``Joy to the World''  
(``Jeremiah was a bullfrog ...'') topped the charts for six 
straight weeks in 1971, making it the biggest hit of the year. 
Axton had pitched the song to group members when he was their 
opening act in 1969-70. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote ``Never Been to Spain'' for the band, a song also  
recorded by Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	Axton's own singing hits include ``Boney Fingers'' and ``When  
the Morning Comes.'' 
</P>

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Michael Baring, a leading member of the British  
banking dynasty brought down by a rogue trader in 1995, died Oct. 
15, according to the ING Group, which took over the bankrupt 
Barings bank. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said he suffered a heart attack.  
</P>
<P>
	Baring played a key role in trying to steady nerves when a  
Singapore-based British trader, Nick Leeson, brought down the bank 
with bad bets on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Baring -- great-great-grandson of Sir Francis  
Baring, who founded the banking dynasty in the 18th century -- was 
head of international marketing at the bank. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Said Obliged To Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States is obligated to pay its  
past dues to the United Nations under a precedent of international 
law that Washington helped set more than 30 years ago, the world 
court's president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States faces the loss of its seat in the U.N. General  
Assembly if it doesn't pay at least $350 million of its $1.8 
billion debt by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, speaking at a news conference  
Wednesday, said a 1962 case before the International Court of 
Justice had underpinned the requirement of U.N. members to pay 
their dues. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, the United States led several U.N. member states  
in asking the court to clarify whether General Assembly members 
were obligated to pay assessments for U.N. peacekeeping operations, 
Schwebel said. And the United States argued that assessments made 
by the General Assembly were binding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an advisory ruling, the court held that members were bound to  
pay their peacekeeping assessments and made a more general 
statement about members' obligation to pay the portion of the U.N. 
budget apportioned to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That statement of law is as good today as it was in 1962,''  
Schwebel said. The advisory was later ratified in essence by the 
General Assembly 
</P>
<P>
	The court only handles disputes between nations that agree to  
grant it jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had long given the court that authority until  
it withdrew it in 1986 after Nicaragua brought an action against 
the U.S. government over its support of the contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed a budget bill Monday, giving as one  
reason that it would not have paid enough of the U.S. arrears to 
the United Nations to avoid losing the General Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also included only $200 million of the $485 million the  
Clinton administration asked for to cover the U.S. share of 
expected peacekeeping operations in East Timor, Sierra Leone, Congo 
and the Horn of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has held up payment of U.S. arrears for years,  
demanding that the United Nations streamline its organization. 
Legislation that would have paid off the bulk of the bills was 
vetoed last year by Clinton because it contained unrelated 
restrictions on U.S. spending for overseas family planning 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reiterating U.S. concerns that the United Nations adopt a  
no-growth budget, Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh said Wednesday 
that the proposed U.N. spending plan for 2000-2001 was too large. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly believe that it needs to be brought down, at a  
minimum, to the level of the current budget,'' Burleigh told the 
committee that deals with U.N. budget matters. ``We will not 
support a higher level.''

<HEADLINE> Cocoa Futures Hit 6 1/2-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cocoa futures fell Wednesday to their lowest level since 1993 on  
the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange as newly harvested 
cocoa arrived at West African ports in huge numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, natural gas futures touched a two-month high  
and gold bounced back after a long slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainties over the political liberalization in the Ivory  
Coast, the world's No. 1 cocoa-producing nation, have left cocoa 
prices unpredictable in recent months. Now the market is heading 
into its peak supply period this winter, with this year's cocoa 
crop shipped onward to foreign customers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, news that cocoa had arrived in greater-than-usual  
quantities at Ivory Coast ports last week helped send the price to 
a 6 1/2-year low of $858 per ton before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa for December delivery closed down $9 at $867 a ton.  
</P>
<P>
	``The market is just reacting to the increasing pressure from  
Ivory Coast,'' said Luis Rangel of Fimat Futures Inc. in New York. 
``The season has just started, cocoa has come to port and there's 
going to be a greater amount of hedging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also pressuring the price are weather conditions that bode well  
for cocoa-growing areas over the next few days, according to 
meteorologists. 
</P>
<P>
	Port arrivals had lagged behind those of a year ago, with  
farmers withholding shipments due to dissatisfaction with prices 
under the new liberalized system. But the total of 33,765 tons that 
arrived last week pushed the season total to nearly double that of 
last year at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't anticipate any protest that would disrupt the flow of  
cocoa,'' Rangel said. ``They're not going to hinder that -- cocoa's 
the life blood of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a frenzy of late buying  
pushed the expiring November contract for natural gas to its 
highest level since late August, settling up 8.1 cents at $3.092 
per million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	The buying was sparked by forecasts for high winter demand and  
by expectations that data to be released later in the day by the 
American Gas Association would heighten concerns about tight 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy prices on the New York Merc were mixed. December  
crude fell 27 cents to $22.92 a barrel; November heating oil rose 
.23 cent to 60.76 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline rose .03 cent 
to 64.18 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for December delivery fell 11  
cents to $22.59 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Comex division of the New York Merc, investors were split  
on whether gold's weeks-long decline was over after the metal's 
December futures contract rose $3.80 to $294.20 per troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Some predicted a further slide to $275; others said it was bound  
for $300-plus territory again. They said the outlook may depend on 
plummeting near-term interest rates, which made it cheaper to 
borrow gold instead of buying it.

<HEADLINE> NatWest Defends Against Hostile Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lifting a page from its pursuer's playbook,  
National Westminster PLC announced plans Wednesday to sell some of 
its businesses and trim 1,650 jobs in an effort to fend off a $34.4 
billion hostile bid by the Bank of Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest urged shareholders to reject its rival's offer -- one of  
the largest in British banking -- as it unveiled a defense strategy 
that includes stripping excess layers of management and tightening 
the focus on retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bank of Scotland dismissed the plan as a pale imitation of  
its own proposal, and analysts and investors seemed unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense document looks a little bit on the thin side,''  
said Simon Wills of Charterhouse Securities. ``I'm not sure that it 
changes things very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest revealed its plan to shareholders and the London Stock  
Exchange in a long-awaited response to the takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest scoffed at its Scottish rival's claim that $1.7 billion  
could be saved by merging the two companies and advised 
shareholders to spurn the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank of Scotland is attempting to hijack cost savings that  
belong to NatWest shareholders and is claiming unrealistic merger 
benefits,'' chief executive David Rowland said in a statement. ``I 
urge NatWest shareholders to reject the offer which is 
ill-conceived and significantly undervalues NatWest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to keep its shareholders loyal, the bank's management  
stressed that they would receive cash from any asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland startled the clubby world of British finance  
last month when it announced a takeover bid for NatWest and harshly 
criticized the London-based bank's executives for their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish bank's aggressive move triggered speculation that  
other bidders for NatWest might emerge with offers of their own. 
None has done so, although Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Abbey 
National, a leading mortgage lender, are widely expected to join 
the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts predicted that Bank of Scotland's bid also could  
trigger other takeover battles among the country's banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does represent a watershed and potential catalyst for a  
further round of consolidation,'' Wills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland dismissed NatWest's defense plan, which it said  
does nothing to detract from the logic of its takeover offer. The 
Scottish Bank said NatWest's latest ideas even concede the merits 
of key elements of its own proposed strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The credibility of NatWest's claims is undermined by its  
history of failure to deliver under substantially the same 
management team,'' Bank of Scotland said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors appeared to share that opinion. NatWest stock  
closed 2.5 percent lower Wednesday, at $22.67 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland shares rose 0.4 percent to finish at $11.86.  
</P>
<P>
	To streamline its operations, NatWest said it plans to slash the  
number of its business units to five from 13 and to ``de-layer'' 
management to allow for speedier decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	It aims to concentrate on serving business clients and wealthy  
individuals along with its retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its defense, NatWest said it plans to sell off  
Gartmore, its institutional fund management arm; Greenwich NatWest, 
its capital market business; NatWest Equity Partners, its venture 
capital unit; and Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland, for its part, has said it intends to unload  
three of those businesses -- Gartmore, Greenwich and Ulster Bank -- 
if its bid succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest also plans to cut 1,650 jobs, most of them by year's  
end. These cuts, amounting to 2 percent of its work force, would be 
in addition to a planned reduction of 10,000 jobs announced 
previously.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Southerners Gaining Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The laid-back Southern lifestyle is affecting  
waistlines below the Mason-Dixon line. 
</P>
<P>
	Southerners are less likely to hike, ride a bike, walk or join a  
health club than their counterparts in the rest of the nation. As a 
result, Southerners are tipping the scale at more than 30 percent 
above their ideal body weight. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, they're obese.  
</P>
<P>
	A study released Tuesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese 
soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Southeast, the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that  
time frame, with Georgia leading the nation with a whopping 
increase of 101.8 percent. West Virginia led the nation in terms of 
an overweight population, with an obesity rate of 22.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two culprits were suspected for the change: urban sprawl and  
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts in Georgia blamed the extra pounds on modern  
suburbs, with no sidewalks to encourage walking and long commutes 
forcing residents to spend hours in their cars instead of 
exercising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Atlanta is not a walkable community. We don't have sidewalks  
that lead anywhere,'' said Pam Wilson, a dietitian with the Georgia 
division of public health. ``Even if we do find a sidewalk, they 
dead-end into an eight-lane highway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The period measured in the study coincides with a time of rapid  
population growth around Atlanta. In 1991, Georgia had one of the 
lowest obesity rates in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Dietz, a co-author of the CDC study, said the sprawl  
around Atlanta keeps people trapped in their cars for hours, 
encourages them to eat quick meals of greasy fast food and prevents 
them from having enough time to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Atlanta drive more than in any other urban area in  
the country,'' he said. ``Community redesign may foster higher 
levels of activity and go a long way in preventing obesity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others blamed Southern weather, saying the summers are too hot  
for people to get outside. The lowest obesity rates in the nation, 
by comparison, were in New England and in the West, where people 
are more active and the weather is cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't get out in the morning, they don't exercise,''  
said Harry DuVal, director of the University of Georgia fitness 
center. ``They go in and find air conditioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It all adds up to a very unhealthy lifestyle,'' added Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
	The CDC study, which is included in today's issue of Journal of  
the American Medical Association, was based on telephone surveys of 
more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics  
showed the most drastic increases, but ``a steady increase was 
observed in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races, 
educational levels; and occurred regardless of smoking status,'' 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United  
States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, 
according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Another study in the journal attributed an estimated 280,000  
deaths a year to being overweight, but said the figure could be 
more than 374,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk  
of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and 
blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC Director Jeffrey P. Koplan said a national strategy is  
needed to combat obesity. He called for workplaces offer healthier 
foods and exercise facilities, more sidewalks and bike paths, and 
encouraging children to play outdoors instead of watching TV or 
using computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general, restoring physical activity to our daily routines  
is critical.''

<HEADLINE> Jet Pressure Valves Are Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pressure inside an aircraft cabin is  
regulated by carefully balancing the air flowing in and out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the Learjet that crashed Monday, killing golfer  
Payne Stewart and five others aboard, air was siphoned off the two 
jet engines, adjusted for the proper temperature and then piped 
into the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the route, the air flowed through valves on each side of  
the aircraft. One of them, the left-hand modulator valve, was 
replaced Saturday, Bob Benzon, chief investigator of the Stewart 
crash, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once air has entered an aircraft cabin, other valves in the  
front and rear of the aircraft automatically open and close as the 
altitude increases or decreases. That balances the amount of air in 
the cabin and maintains a pressure that is survivable for the 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1995, the FAA ordered that outflow/safety valves  
made by Allied Signal Aerospace be replaced in Lear 35 jets within 
18 months. The agency ordered the replacement to ``prevent rapid 
decompression of the airplane due to cracking and subsequent 
failure'' of the valves. 
</P>
<P>
	The outflow/safety valves are different from the left- and  
right-hand modulator valves. They are the valves in the nose and 
tail of the aircraft that ensure the proper cabin environment is 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the jet carrying Stewart, Sunjet Aviation of  
Sanford, Fla., said Wednesday that log books show previous owners 
completed the mandatory valve replacement in 1995.

	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Pressed in campaign debate about President  
Clinton's personal behavior, Vice President Al Gore said tonight 
that he understood the public disappointment and anger and sought 
to provide ``as much continuity and civility'' as possible during 
the Monica Lewinsky controversy. ``He's my friend,'' Gore said of 
the president, fielding the first question from a voter in the 
first debate with campaign rival Bill Bradley. In the opening 
moments of the debate, Bradley touted his $65 billion plan for 
universal access to health insurance. Both men pledged to work for 
an overhaul of the campaign finance laws to reduce the role of big

	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Gunmen inside Armenia's parliament were  
still holed up early Thursday with dozens of hostages. On Wednesday 
afternoon the men seized parliament, killing Prime Minister Vazgen 
Sarkisian and at least six other people. Three hostages were 
released about 10 hours after the assault, but the gunmen continued 
to demand talks with President Robert Kocharian. In a televised 
statement early Thursday, Kocharian promised to take ``all measures

	House Enters Assisted Suicide Debate

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House stepped into the emotional debate of  
physician-assisted suicide today, voting to bar doctors from using 
federally controlled drugs to help patients die. The House voted 
271-156 for a bill sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde 
that penalizes doctors who aid in a suicide but encourages them to 
treat the pain of dying patients. Opponents said doctors will be so 
worried about losing their licenses to prescribe drugs, and 
spending at least 20 years in jail for aiding in a suicide, that 
they will decline to dispense needed medication.

for bragging rights today between the White House and the 
Republican-led Congress, with both sides hoping to reap political 
dividends in next year's elections. President Clinton, battling 
Republicans over spending, accused the GOP of writing a budget that

Stock Exchange. In after hours trading, the shares fell to $67. The 
company blamed its problems on weaker-than-expected sales of its

into it, was expected to draw the most spirited bidding. Another 
dress -- believed to have been worn to entertain U.S. soldiers in 
Korea in 1954 -- sold for $112,000. The first big-ticket item -- a 
platinum eternity ring, encrusted with 34 baguette-cut diamonds, 
given to Monroe by ex-husband Joe DiMaggio -- sold for $772,500.

	TORONTO (AP) -- Multimillionaire rap artist and producer Master  
P, whose real name is Percy Miller, was waived by the Toronto 
Raptors today. The 29-year-old Miller, who has parlayed his music 
success into a successful recording label and a financial interest 
in a sports agent business was a training camp invitee by the 
Raptors. Miller, who played briefly in the CBA last year after 
being cut by the Charlotte Hornets in training camp, averaged 2.2. 
points in six exhibition games with Toronto.

<P>
	Defending champion Manchester United beat Croatia Zagreb 2-1  
Wednesday to reach the round of 16 of the Champions League. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other teams also advanced: Lazio and Fiorentina of Italy,  
Rosenborg of Norway and Olympique Marseille of France. 
</P>
<P>
	The five join six other clubs that already have qualified:  
Barcelona, Real Madrid, Valencia of Spain, Bordeaux of France, 
Porto of Portugal and Sparta Prague of the Czech Republic. Five 
spots are to be decided next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Manchester United got goals from David Beckham and Roy Keane to  
hold off the Croatians and move on from Group D. Olympique 
Marseille got the other berth despite a 3-2 loss at Sturm Graz. The 
Austrians had scored only one goal in their previous four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio won Group A with a 1-1 tie at home over Bayer Leverkusen.  
In the other group match, last year's semifinalist Dynamo Kiev won 
2-1 at Maribor. Dynamo can claim the other place by beating Lazio 
in Kiev next week. Leverkusen faces Maribor and needs a Dynamo loss 
to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorentina got a 75th-minute goal from Gabriel Batistuta to beat  
Arsenal 1-0 at Wembley in Group B and eliminate the English. 
Barcelona routed AIK Solna 5-0 in the other group game on two goals 
from Patrick Kluivert. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenborg beat Portugal's Boavista 2-0 to advance from Group C  
with 11 points. Borussia Dortmund and Feyenoord tied 1-1. Borussia 
has six points and can win a place by beating Boavista next week.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Honor Annie Leibovitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton honored photographer Annie Leibovitz at a White 
House ceremony that also recognized work to empower women. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was held to highlight an exhibition of Leibovitz'  
photos hanging at the nearby Corcoran Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit and accompanying book, ``Women,'' produced with  
writer Susan Sontag, examine the accomplishments of women in the 
20th century through portraits of female coal miners, judges, 
writers and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly believe that the stunning gifts of this great artist  
and fine human being, who happens to be a woman, will make a major 
contribution'' to equality and respect for women, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leibovitz, a longtime portraitist for magazines such as Rolling  
Stone, Vanity Fair and Vogue, said ``there was no higher honor than 
to be in this house tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a New Yorker, she also alluded to the political overtones  
that carry through any event involving the first lady as she moves 
steadily toward declaring her candidacy for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Clinton, may I use this occasion to say I am one of the  
many women in New York who are rooting for you,'' Leibovitz said. 
The East Room crowd of 700 burst into cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in attendance were actress Lauren Hutton, TV host  
Larry King and author Sontag. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also took the opportunity to reveal a bit about  
how he views the reporters and photographers who cover him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his staff sometime teases him because he's ``always  
comparing the job of photographer in Washington with the job of a 
reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, the job of a photographer is easy because a  
photographer is rewarded just for looking to see what is there and 
capture it in some remarkable, clear, crystal way,'' he said. ``The 
poor reporters and columnists have to perform reverse plastic 
surgery on the event to get any notice whatever.''

<HEADLINE> Brock Selected as LA Avengers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stan Brock, who played in the NFL for 16  
years, will be the first head coach of the Arena Football League's 
Los Angeles Avengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Brock was introduced at a news conference  
Tuesday at the Staples Center, where the Avengers will play their 
home games in their inaugural season, which begins next April. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock grew up in Portland, Ore., and was a four-year letterman  
at Colorado. He then played offensive tackle for the New Orleans 
Saints for 13 years and the San Diego Chargers for three before 
retiring in 1995 after playing 234 games in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock coached the Portland Forest Dragons of the Arena League  
for the past 2 1/2 seasons. Portland was 7-7 last year, and was 12-24 
under Brock, who took the job after Don Frease resigned in June 
1997, before the team's seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brock signed a three-year contract with the Avengers as coach  
and director of football operations. Terms were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past three years, I've become addicted to coaching, and  
this is such a tremendous opportunity,'' Brock said. ``The 
challenge of building the foundation of this franchise is something 
that I'm really looking forward to.''

<P>
                          *AP Sports Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young will be sidelined for the  
foreseeable future, but he's not ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to (play again) if it's appropriate,'' the San  
Francisco 49ers quarterback said at a news conference today. ``Yet 
it very well might not happen this season. If time runs out on the 
season, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg said Tuesday he doesn't think Young, still  
bothered by post-concussion symptoms, will play again this year. 
The team and Young's doctors appear to feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking this thing to the end of the season,'' the two-time  
NFL MVP said. ``My focus right now clearly is on my health, but I 
am also focusing on my team. That's all I'm going to think about 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the possibility was raised earlier that he would go on  
injured reserve today, that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined he not risk anything more this year,''  
Steinberg said Tuesday. ``He's probably going to end up on injured 
reserve. This is a football injury. He was hurt on the field and 
that's where those players go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said there would be no decision on retirement until  
after the season. But he added that Young will abide by the final 
medical consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come to the right decision, but this will take a  
little time,'' the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Young's primary neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg,  
no relation to the agent, made a long-term recommendation about 
whether Young should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was the first time since then that the 38-year-old  
quarterback has spoken with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dr. Steinberg's opinion hasn't been disclosed, Young has  
conceded the report was ``discouraging.'' His agent has said the 
opinion has been reaffirmed by other specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Young continued to refuse to discuss his doctor's long-term  
recommendations, but said, ``He's telling me I can't play right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like any injury,'' he added. ``You have to give it time  
to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to speak with contemporaries who were forced out  
of the game by repeated concussions, including Al Toon and Merrill 
Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also gathering more medical advice and may see another  
specialist this week. But coach Steve Mariucci and general manager 
Bill Walsh have both said that they would give greatest weight to 
Dr. Steinberg's conclusions, and they are in no hurry to see Young 
back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Young could be at risk for permanent brain damage from another  
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Monday the team, which has a bye this week, hopes  
to resolve Young's status in the next week or two and said injured 
reserve was a possibility. It would allow Young an extended period 
away from football while not shutting the door on a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Young has no real hope of receiving medical clearance to  
play any time soon, he remains optimistic that his condition will 
clear, leaving at least a possibility of a return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Young feels strong responsibility to the team, especially now  
that it's struggling without him. 
</P>
<P>
	By going on injured reserve, though, he could get treatment  
while remaining with the team as a locker room and sideline 
presence and mentor to his replacement, Jeff Garcia.

<HEADLINE> Philly Murder Is Probable Mob Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The naked, decomposing body of a mobster was  
found in the trunk of his wife's car, a likely victim of an 
embittered Philadelphia crime family fearful of turncoats, police 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Ron Turchi, 61, once third in command of the  
Philadelphia mob, was found Tuesday night with his hands tied 
behind his back, multiple gunshot wounds to his head and neck and a 
clear plastic bag covering his face, police said. No suspects have 
been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the mob's reputed former boss, Ralph Natale, agreed  
to cooperate with federal authorities after he was charged with 
running a methamphetamine distribution ring. The agreement made him 
the highest-ranking American mafia figure to flip sides, said Fred 
Martens, a former executive director of the now-defunct 
Pennsylvania Crime Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the mob has fallen into disarray, with Natale  
believed to be providing information on drug dealing, murders and 
political corruption in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to determine whether Turchi was  
silenced to prevent him from verifying Natale's information, said 
police Capt. James Brady. 
</P>
<P>
	``This murder is another example of the insecurity these men  
have,'' said mob criminologist and historian Celeste Morello. 
``This is a show of power. There are probably a million dumping 
grounds in Philadelphia if you want to cover up the murder. They 
wanted it to be found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The car was found after Turchi's wife reported him missing over  
the weekend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Posts Record Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                    *AP White House Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After decades of deficit gloom, the United  
States posted a record $123 billion federal budget surplus last 
year, marking the first back-to-back surpluses since Dwight 
Eisenhower was president. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news announcement -- exceeding all estimates -- sparked a  
battle for bragging rights Wednesday between the White House and 
the Republican-led Congress, with both sides hoping to reap 
political dividends in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said American businesses and workers have  
benefited from lower interest rates, a shrinking national debt and 
a growing pool of investment capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have closed the book on deficits and opened the door on a  
new era of economic opportunity,'' Clinton said. The president, 
battling Republicans over spending, accused the GOP of writing a 
budget that siphons $18 billion from the Social Security surplus. 
``That is wrong and it doesn't have to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also claimed credit for the surplus.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what happens when Republicans take care of the  
government checkbook and hold the line against tax hikes and more 
spending,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the 
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration acknowledged the 1999 surplus came entirely  
from Social Security. The huge benefit program is collecting more 
in payroll taxes than it is paying out in benefits. Without the 
Social Security cushion, the government would have had a $1 billion 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the two surpluses in a row, the government still has a  
$5 trillion debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was plagued by a long string of budget  
deficits since 1931 in the wake of the Depression and then World 
War II. In all that time, there were only eight years of surplus. 
The tide finally turned when the government broke into the black in 
1998, and now the government projects surpluses far into the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans have spent Social Security surpluses  
for decades but both have pledged this year to leave that money 
alone, trying to cast themselves as protectors of the massive 
pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, before taking Social Security into account, the  
government had a $29.9 billion deficit but a $99.2 billion Social 
Security surplus turned the overall deficit into a surplus of $69.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With the onset of surpluses, the government has paid down the  
national debt by $140 billion over the last two years, the largest 
debt reduction in American history, Clinton said. The shrinking 
debt also has meant lower interest costs for the government, 
Clinton said, and more investment capital for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said working families also have enjoyed lower interest rates.  
``It means $2,000 less in home mortgage payments for the typical 
family,'' Clinton said, talking with reporters on the South Lawn as 
he left for an appearance on Capitol Hill. ``It means $200 less in 
car payments and $200 less in college loan payments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, interest rates and mortgage rates have been rising in  
recent months as the Federal Reserve has tightened credit in an 
effort to slow the economy and fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The $123 billion surplus in fiscal 1999 was almost twice the  
size of the previous year's. It also was the largest ever in 
nominal terms and the largest since 1951 as a percentage of gross 
domestic product. The 1998 and 1999 figures marked the first two 
consecutive years of surplus since 1956-57. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said Clinton set the nation on a path of  
deficit reduction when he pushed a package of tax increases and 
spending cuts through Congress in 1993 -- a move that was opposed by 
every Republican House and Senate member. The campaign got more 
momentum from the 1997 balanced budget act supported by the White 
House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	To support its case, the administration noted that last year's  
surplus was the seventh straight year of budget improvements since 
the deficit peaked at $290 billion in 1992. The seven-year string 
is the longest series of budget improvements in the nation's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 surplus grew far above administration estimates In May  
1998, the White House projected the surplus would be $54 billion. 
That figure climbed to $79 billion by the time Clinton submitted 
his budget in February. In June the administration estimated the 
surplus at $98.8 billion, and last month Clinton said it would be 
at least $115 billion.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Head Optimistic About Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Key Democratic lawmakers, worried about  
consumers' privacy, are calling on President Clinton to veto 
sweeping legislation to overhaul the financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is pushing on with the bill -- which has  
divided congressional Democrats -- in hopes it will soon be enacted 
by the Republican-controlled Congress, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would lift Depression-era barriers and allow  
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge and sell 
each other's products. With the White House having lifted its 
long-standing veto threat and now supporting it, the measure is 
being given the best chance ever of adoption after 20 years of 
battling. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and other officials told a  
group of financial industry lobbyists the administration was 
optimistic about the bill's prospects and would continue to work 
toward its passage, a Treasury official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately clear whether House Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, D-Mo., would endorse the measure or break with the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Many moderate Democrats in the House support the legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., has been leading the fight for  
liberal House Democrats on the privacy issue as Congress has edged 
close to enacting the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey on Tuesday enlisted the aid of Rep. John Dingell of  
Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Commerce Committee, and 
Reps. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., and Bill Luther, D-Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	They circulated a letter to Clinton among their colleagues in  
the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul legislation ``does not go nearly far enough in  
ensuring that American consumers receive strong privacy 
protections,'' the letter says. ``We do not believe the bill ... 
adequately protects American consumers from the wholesale 
networking of their personal, private information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv had no immediate comment on the  
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks would not be allowed to provide customers' data to  
telemarketers under the new legislation, but would be able to share 
it with affiliated financial companies under the same corporate 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Data sharing is a major reason why financial companies want to  
merge, as it opens numerous opportunities for the companies to 
market a range of products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers are alarmed, however, at the prospect that their  
personal financial data could be shared by companies. Consumer 
activists such as Ralph Nader also have criticized the legislation 
on privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad coalition of consumer groups, privacy advocates, the  
American Civil Liberties Union and Phyllis Schlafly's conservative 
Eagle Forum sent its own letter to Clinton Tuesday urging his veto. 
``This bill fails to give consumers real choice about the sharing, 
selling or using of their personal information among (financial) 
affiliates,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, conservative Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has  
broken with Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over 
the privacy issue and said he would vote against the bill. Shelby 
served notice on Monday that he will try to force changes in the 
privacy provisions and failing that, attempt to derail the measure. 
Under Senate rules, a single senator can hold up action for hours 
or days if he chooses to.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Eyes Sanctions Against Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The NAACP accused the Detroit Tigers of ignoring  
baseball's initiative to consider minorities for management 
positions and is asking the sport's commissioner to impose economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of Comerica Park, the new home for the Detroit  
Tigers, NAACP president Kwesi Mfume said the Tigers' refusal to 
comply with the diversity initiative is ``essentially a slap in the 
face'' to minority coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is the Tigers' decision to hire Phil Garner, who is  
white, as manager for the Detroit Tigers. Garner is not the 
problem, Tigers owner Mike Ilitch is, Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Garner's hire was announced Oct. 14, Commissioner Bud  
Selig issued a statement saying he is conducting a review of the 
hiring of Garner to see if the team complied with the league's 
minority-hiring initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call on Mr. Ilitch to publicly apologize for this egregious  
affront to African-Americans and Latino communities all over this 
nation who believe in baseball, who love this sport and who believe 
in equal opportunity,'' Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what type of sanctions he wanted baseball to impose  
on the team, Mfume wouldn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes declined to say whether any  
minorities had been interviewed for the manager position because of 
the commissioner's ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he defended the team's commitment to diversity, touting the  
$60 million in construction contracts that has been awarded to 
minority firms to build Comerica Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no organization that is more committed to equal  
opportunity employment and the inclusion of minority business 
communities than the Tigers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume called for the Detroit minority community to send a  
message to Ilitch by not spending money at his places of business. 
In addition to owning the Tigers, Ilitch owns Little Caesar's 
pizza, the Rockers soccer team, the Fox Theatre and several 
restaurants.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota wants to show the  
NCAA it is serious about dealing with an academic cheating scandal 
by banning itself from postseason basketball tournaments for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The university barred itself from any possible berth in the NCAA  
tournament or the NIT in 2000, although it can still compete in the 
Big Ten tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is to complete its investigation of the school months  
from now and could hand out out its own sanctions then. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must demonstrate good faith and take meaningful action to  
repair the damage that has been done by others,'' Minnesota 
president Mark Yudof said Tuesday. ``It's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university also is placing the program on probation for an  
unspecified period. That will mean more stringent reporting to the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	No current players were involved in the scandal, and Yudof is  
aware the players may regard the sanctions as unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA has to worry about deterrents,'' Yudof said. ``I have  
to worry about deterrents in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation of the men's basketball team began in March  
after former tutor Jan Gangelhoff claimed she did more than 400 
pieces of course work for at least 20 basketball players from 1993 
to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof has said the investigation revealed ``numerous, maybe even  
massive'' instances of academic fraud. It has since widened to 
include accusations of improper payments and travel irregularities, 
and alleged sexual and other misconduct in the men's athletics 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the university and the NCAA could impose more  
sanctions after the final university report is completed, probably 
by Nov. 10. The report is expected to be made public about 10 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said the organization would not  
comment specifically on the sanctions. But she said schools often 
come up with their own punishments. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is supposed to have an infraction hearing next spring  
and could issue sanctions then or wait until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's just the beginning,'' said Gangelhoff, who now  
works at a casino in Danbury, Wis. ``President Yudof must have 
enough information to realize these two things (sanctions) were 
going to happen regardless of whether or not he has the complete 
report in hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof did not say whether jobs might be lost because of the  
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Clem Haskins resigned under pressure in June and accepted  
a $1.5 million buyout. He has said he had no knowledge of any 
academic cheating on the basketball team. Dan Monson of Gonzaga 
replaced Haskins. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason to come out with sanctions now was to improve team  
morale, Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the staff and our team, it's the beginning of the end,''  
Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson said he would be open with prospective players about the  
sanctions, which he and Yudof acknowledged would hurt recruiting. 
However, if they end after one year, they may not have as great an 
impact, Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's 64-team tournament determines the national champion.  
The NIT is held for 32 teams that don't qualify for the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota has won the NIT twice and qualified for the NCAA Final  
Four in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus Sweeten El Al Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing and its  
European competitor Airbus have improved their bids to replace part 
of the Israeli airline El Al's passenger fleet, a spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bids came as El Al continues to delay deciding whether  
to buy the Boeing 777 airliner or the Airbus A330, a tactic that 
Israel's transportation minister recommended to induce 
manufacturers to sweeten their offers. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al's decision was originally to have been taken by early  
spring but has been postponed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus is battling to break Boeing's hold on the Israeli market.  
El Al's present fleet consists entirely of Boeing aircraft, and 
Israel is under strong pressure from the U.S. to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	If Israel -- which receives $3 billion annually in U.S. foreign  
aid -- were to buy the less expensive Airbus jets, it could pave the 
way for other countries that receive substantial U.S. aid to grant 
more military contracts to non-U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al executives were to have convened Tuesday evening to make  
the choice. On Monday, however, the two manufacturers made new, 
more favorable offers verbally, El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman 
said. The bids were submitted in writing Tuesday, Klieman said, and 
the meeting was postponed to give the executives time to analyze 
the new figures. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al executives were to meet again Wednesday evening, Klieman  
said, though a decision may not come until later. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al has said the four Airbus planes will cost $350  
million-$400 million. However Airbus was offering to subcontract 35 
percent of the contract value to Israel Aircraft Industries, the 
European consortium's commercial director John Leahy said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Airbus bid offered to direct 50 percent of the contract  
value to IAI, the Israeli daily Haaretz said. Neither Klieman nor 
officials from either company would release details of the new 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy has said Airbus is prepared to take a loss to break the  
Boeing monopoly.

<HEADLINE> USDA Proposes Farm Policy Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said  
Wednesday he will offer proposals to Congress next year to overhaul 
government farm policy and provide more assistance to farmers when 
commodity prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has come under fire from Republicans  
over the past year for not offering legislative proposals of its 
own on crop insurance and emergency farm assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to come up ... with some specific  
proposals,'' Glickman said at a news conference. ``We've tried to 
do that, but we're going to have to do a better job in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said last week that Congress needed to  
``revise, revamp and improve'' the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law 
because it did not take adequate care of farmers. The law was 
intended to make farmers less dependent on government assistance. 
But commodity prices dropped sharply last year and Congress has 
responded by passing successive bailout packages worth nearly $15 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct government payments to farmers this year will total a  
record $22.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farm economy stinks in much of this country,'' said  
Glickman, adding that additional assistance probably will be needed 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Texas  
Republican Larry Combest, said he doubted Glickman's proposals 
would be sufficiently detailed. Ideas that sound good in theory 
often have undesirable ramifications when put in practice, Combest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't work hypothetically, they have to be specific. The  
more they are specific the more they will be players in the final 
outcome,'' said Combest. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest plans hearings, starting early next year, on possible  
changes to the 1996 law. The department will offer its proposals at 
that time, said August Schumacher Jr., deputy undersecretary for 
farm and foreign agricultural services. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman previously has proposed raising subsidy rates for crops  
and subsidizing grain storage so farmers could keep crops off the 
market when prices were low. He also has indicated interest in an 
insurance program proposed by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, that 
would allow farmers to guarantee a minimum income based on 
fluctuations in crop yields and prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The first checks from this year's assistance package started  
going into the mail Monday, and additional payments will be going 
out into next year, depending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers who lost crops to drought and flooding likely will get a  
35 percent advance payment with the rest to come after Agriculture 
Department totals up all the claims, Glickman said. Congress 
provided $1.2 billion for weather-related crop losses. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be many months before USDA implements a new program for  
reporting the prices that meatpackers pay for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporting program was included in the bailout measure but  
Congress did not allocate any money to operate it. Glickman said it 
would cost $4.7 billion to run the system over the next year. The 
program cannot start until Congress provides an appropriation for 
it or the department finds another source of funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to start the organization of the program. You  
can't implement the program without the money,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Shipyard Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Striking workers agreed Wednesday to  
return to work in Halla Heavy Industries Co., South Korea's third 
largest shipyard, which had been paralyzed by a two-month-long 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Halla workers went on strike in early August,  
demanding that the ailing company guarantee job security and hire 
back all labor leaders fired for illegal labor activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Management reached a compromise with labor leaders on Tuesday,  
agreeing to gradually hire back fired labor activists. On 
Wednesday, rank-and-file union members voted for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had threatened to raid Halla's Youngam shipyard on the  
south coast. Halla workers erected barricades at the shipyard's 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers said they will return to work this week and clean up the  
shipyard for operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyard is an affiliate of Halla Group, South Korea's  
12th-largest conglomerate, which collapsed under $4 billion in debt 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks took over the shipyard and asked Hyundai, South Korea's  
largest shipbuilder, to operate it on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs aimed at restructuring South Korea's inefficient  
industries were among conditions set by the International Monetary 
Fund when it bailed out the country's battered economy in late 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But that prescription was anathema to union members accustomed  
to lifetime employment.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned About Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Population Fund is grappling with  
a serious drop in income, requiring program cuts that will result 
in an additional 1.4 million unwanted pregnancies, its executive 
director says. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of celebrating the 30th year of operations and  
widespread acceptance of its programs to curb the population, Dr. 
Nafis Sadik said the fund is scrambling for resources and cutting 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's income has dropped 14 percent in two years -- from  
$290 million in 1997 to $277 million in 1998 to $248 million in 
1999, she said Tuesday. As a result, it can only cover two-thirds 
of its commitments to programs worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund is financed by voluntary contributions from the 188  
U.N. member states. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadik said the shortfall was due to exchange rate fluctuations,  
a drop in the dollar value of Japan's contribution which is the 
fund's largest -- and most importantly a drop in U.S. funding to $20 
million last year and zero this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The funding crisis has delayed plans to include family life  
education in the school curriculum in Tanzania, postponed plans for 
operations in remote villages in India, suspended training of 
health workers in Vietnam, and canceled the purchase of 
contraceptives for some 200,000 women in Ecuador, Sadik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when these programs are being effectively implemented,  
the brakes are being put on and resources are being cut,'' she told 
a news conference. ``It is both ironic and tragic ... as we move 
into what should be a new era of harmony and cooperation, that a 
shortage of funds is tying our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sadik, the shortfall in funds this year will mean  
over 1 million people who might have used modern contraceptive 
methods will use less-effective traditional methods -- and 1.5 
million people will continue to use no method of family planning. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be 1.4 million additional unwanted pregnancies each  
year, 570,000 induced abortions and over 670,000 unwanted births -- 
and these unwanted pregnancies will be linked to over 3,300 
maternal deaths, nearly 41,000 infant deaths and 15,000 child 
deaths, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill that would authorize $25 million for the fund in the next  
fiscal year is awaiting approval by the U.S. Congress. Rep. Carolyn 
Maloney, a New York Democrat, said she got assurances Tuesday from 
White House chief of staff John Podesta and House minority leader 
Richard Gephardt that the money would be approved.

<HEADLINE> Sony Profits Rise in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics powerhouse Sony Corp.'s profit  
rose 3.1 percent in the second fiscal quarter but plunged nearly 25 
percent for the first half, depressed by the strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The results disclosed today come as Sony faces a sluggish  
economy at home and a surging yen that threatens to damage exports 
by making Japanese products more expensive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony earned 46.5 billion yen, or $445 million, in the three  
months ended Sept. 30 compared with 45.1 billion yen a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales and operating revenue fell 6.8 percent to 1.6 trillion  
yen, or $15.3 billion, for the quarter from 1.7 trillion yen a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong yen not only hurts exports, it also means that  
dollars and other currencies earned overseas are worth less when 
converted into the home currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the July-September quarter, for example, the yen averaged  
112.7 to the U.S. dollar -- 23.3 percent stronger than the same 
quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony estimated that if the yen had held steady, sales would have  
increased 9 percent and sales would have risen 25 percent in the 
July-September quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This rise in the yen had a significant negative impact on the  
reported financial results translated into yen,'' Sony said in its 
earnings statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that sales in Sony's movie business decreased 19  
percent in the quarter. The second quarter got a boost from the Box 
Office success of ``Big Daddy' and ``Blue Streak'' but was hurt by 
``Muppets From Space'' and ``Jakob the Liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income from Sony's TV business, which is part of Sony  
Pictures, fell because of the loss of the sundication sales of 
``Seinfeld'' from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Sony Pictures would have been flat if the currency  
rate had remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, consolidated net profits plunged 24.5  
percent to 64.9 billion yen, or $607 million, compared to 86.1 
billion yen last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales and operating revenue fell 7.6 percent to 3.1 trillion  
yen, or $29.1 billion in the first half from 3.4 trillion a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony is moving through a major transition. It announced in March  
that it would lay off 17,000 of its 170,000 workers and cut 
manufacturing plants from 70 to 55 during the next four years. Sony 
is trying to make computers and video games a bigger part of its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony expects group operating profit for the full year to be less  
than previously forecast. The company did not release an updated 
forecast on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong yen has prompted calls for the government to  
intervene, since many fear it could stifle Japan's recovery from 
its worst economic downturn in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar figures provided by Sony were based on a calculation  
from yen using an average dollar-yen exchange rate for the period.

<HEADLINE> NBC, Yanks Work Out Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after NBC sports reporter Jim Gray was  
snubbed on live TV, the network threw him right back into the thick 
of things with the New York Yankees -- and everyone talked this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC even made a last-minute change and allowed Gray to present  
the World Series trophy to the Yankees in their clubhouse after 
they beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1 for a sweep Wednesday night. 
Hannah Storm had presented the trophy in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray interviewed team owner George Steinbrenner, manager Joe  
Torre, World Series MVP Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter and Roger 
Clemens after the game -- without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
	At Game 3 Tuesday night, some members of the Yankees wouldn't  
talk to Gray because of a contentious live interview he had with 
Pete Rose on Sunday night regarding accusations Rose gambled on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chad Curtis hit his game-winning homer in Game 3, he  
refused to be interviewed by Gray and walked away from him in front 
of millions of TV viewers. But Steinbrenner and commissioner Bud 
Selig intervened to resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about it late last night and they both jumped into  
it,'' NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said. ``George walked into 
the situation and took control. ... He made it abundantly clear 
that nothing like that would happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol, who admitted the Rose interview might have gone on too  
long, called Gray ``the best reporter in the business, maybe 
ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray apologized for the Rose interview on the air before Game 3.  
At one point before Game 4, he left Yankee Stadium for the NBC 
trailer escorted by security men as fans shouted insults. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre had criticized Gray's interview of Rose but said the issue  
was in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a certain obligation to NBC,'' he said. ``I just wish  
Chad would have said it was his choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis said Gray shouldn't take his actions on Tuesday night  
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it didn't come across that way,'' Curtis said. ``It  
seemed to me that he stepped out of bounds on the interview with 
Pete. It was something that needed to be done. ... I don't think 
we'll do it again because my personal feeling is we've made our 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC World Series analyst Joe Morgan, who played with Rose with  
the Cincinnati Reds, refrained from putting blame on either side. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff is taking away from the World Series and none  
of this is good for the game,'' Morgan said. ``All the players are 
individuals. I heard they took a vote, but I don't believe it.''

<HEADLINE> Securities Lawsuit Decision Stands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal court ruling intended to limit  
some securities fraud lawsuits will not be heard again by the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the court said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the court ruled in July that such lawsuits must be  
dismissed at the outset unless they contain detailed evidence of 
deliberate fraud. The court said a 1995 federal law, passed over 
President Clinton's veto, was intended to set a strict standard to 
discourage meritless suits. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs asked the court to rehear the case, but the court  
voted 6-3 Wednesday to decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-state circuit court includes California's Silicon  
Valley, home of companies that have been frequent targets of 
securities suits. 
</P>
<P>
	The July ruling was prompted by a lawsuit against Silicon  
Graphics Inc., in which the company and six officers were accused 
by stockholders of hiding bad news about a new product between 
September and December 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers sold large numbers of shares before the information  
was disclosed and the stock price plunged, the lawsuits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling was hailed as a victory for high-tech  
companies and others facing similar lawsuits, but it conflicted 
with interpretations by the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission and most other federal courts, which have declared 
standards that would let more suits survive pretrial challenges.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Crash Jet Recently Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- A valve in the cabin-pressurization system was  
replaced two days before golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet slammed 
into a South Dakota pasture, but the system worked fine during a 
short flight after the replacement, the chief government 
investigator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have said one possible explanation for the  
crash is that the jet lost cabin pressure soon after taking off 
from Florida, causing everyone aboard to die or lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	For four hours on Monday, the jet flew 1,400 miles across the  
country, apparently on autopilot, before running out of fuel and 
spiraling nose-first into a soggy field. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Benzon of the National Transportation Safety Board said  
investigators learned that a device called the left-hand modulator 
valve, which takes heated air from the engine and runs it through 
the air-conditioning system to pressurize the cabin, was changed on 
the plane Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the left-hand valve failed, the one on the right engine  
should have fed sufficient air into the cabin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said the valve was replaced Saturday to balance engine  
thrust on the plane -- not because of any prior problem with cabin 
pressure. After the valve was replaced, the plane 
pressure-regulation system worked fine during a short flight on 
Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said he does not know whether such a valve has ever been  
a factor in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact it was changed doesn't really mean anything right  
now, but it's something we're looking into,'' he said, speaking at 
the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators on Wednesday had removed about a quarter of the  
jet from the 10-foot crater, and found human remains, engines, golf 
clubs and oxygen masks for the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	They found the cockpit voice recorder just before sundown,  
Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Learjet had no flight data recorder that could  
provide mechanical information, the cockpit voice recorder has a 
30-minute loop that usually records over itself. Officials do not 
expect to hear anything about what happened when radio contact was 
lost and the plan veered off course because that happened hours 
before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But the voice recorder could have picked up sounds at the end of  
the flight that could tell a lot about what was happening in the 
plane, Benzon said. The recorder was soaked in fuel and the 
cassette was cracked, but information from the tape might be 
available as early as Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still confident we can get some good information off  
that tape,'' Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also want to determine whether oxygen masks had  
dropped from the ceiling as they are designed to do during a loss 
of cabin pressure, he said. The pilots' oxygen masks had not been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was one of the world's most recognized golfers,  
known for wearing knickers and a tam-o'-shanter hat. Also killed 
were Stewart's agents and the two pilots, and Bruce Borland, one of 
Jack Nicklaus' golf course designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said investigators hope to finish recovering wreckage and  
human remains by Friday, when the investigation will shift to a 
detailed examination of the parts in a hangar in nearby Aberdeen. 
</P>
<P>
	Planes that fly above 12,000 feet are pressurized because the  
air does not contain enough oxygen for people to breathe 
comfortably. If a plane loses pressure at high altitude, those 
aboard could gradually lose consciousness or, in the case of a 
broken door or window seal, die in seconds from lack of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Air traffic controllers could not reach anyone on the plane by  
radio soon after it took off Monday from Orlando, Fla. Fighter 
pilots who chased it reported that its windows were frosted over, 
indicating the temperature inside was well below freezing. That has 
raised suspicions that the plane suddenly lost pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Tissue samples from the victims will be tested. But a  
pathologist said toxicology tests may be unable to establish 
whether the victims suffered a sudden deprivation of oxygen.

<HEADLINE> Songwriter Accused of Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Child advocates say they hope charges that a  
successful songwriter abused some of his adoptive and foster 
children won't scare others away from adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let this tragedy make us afraid,'' said Frank  
Cervone, executive director of the Support Center for Child 
Advocates, a Philadelphia-based program for abused and neglected 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Cusick, the adoptive and foster father of 28 children,  
surrendered to police Tuesday after five boys in his care accused 
him of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with multiple counts of corruption of a minor,  
indecent assault and child endangerment. If convicted, he could 
receive up to 35 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick, 47, was released on $300,000 bail. A preliminary hearing  
date was set for Nov. 4, said his lawyer, Kevin M. Zlock, who 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Child advocate Cervone said he is concerned the case against  
Cusick ``is going to do some damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a world where there are thousands of families who  
have opened their homes to children, but that's not enough by a 
factor of many thousand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick's songs include ``Don't You Go,'' recorded by Ricky  
Martin, and others by have been recorded by artists including 
Lionel Richie, Tony Orlando, Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1972, Cusick has been an adoptive or foster father to 24  
boys and four girls in Pennsylvania and New York, police said. He 
began taking in children when he lived on New York City's Staten 
Island, Bucks County District Attorney Alan M. Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January 1998, Cusick and several boys and young men have  
lived in a seven-bedroom house in an affluent subdivision of 
Langhorne, about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick was married briefly in the early 1980s but adopted most  
of the children when he was single, authorities said. He received 
several awards and letters of commendation from adoption advocacy 
groups and community service programs, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started a month ago when a 17-year-old adopted  
son made the first allegations to police, Rubenstein said. 
Authorities then interviewed four other boys, between the ages of 8 
and 16, who reported similar assaults, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were among 11 boys, all minors, who were removed from  
the house shortly after the investigation began and placed in 
foster care, Rubenstein said. Two other adopted sons, both 19, 
moved out of the house Monday.

<HEADLINE> Curtis Standing Tall After Homerun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He is the second-shortest member of the New York  
Yankees, and one of the least known. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hit just one home run since May 23, hadn't hit one in  
Yankee Stadium since Sept. 23, 1998, was 3-for-25 with no RBIs in 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that matters, anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Chad Curtis joined the list of Yankees with postseason walk-off  
homers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Leyritz did it against Seattle in 1995. Bernie Williams  
did it against Baltimore the following year and again to beat 
Boston two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't do it in the World Series.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think -- in fact, I know -- I've never hit one in the  
regular season, I've never hit a walk-off home run,'' Curtis said 
after his leadoff shot in the 10th, his second of the night, gave 
New York a 6-5 win over Atlanta and a 3-0 World Series lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other Yankees have done it: Tommy Henrich in the ninth  
inning of the '49 opener against Brooklyn and Mickey Mantle in the 
ninth of Game 3 against St. Louis in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard people talk about tingling,'' Curtis said. ``I've  
never felt that before. I think somewhere between second and third, 
I felt like there was electricity running through my legs. It was a 
great feeling. You're rounding third base coming home, seeing all 
your teammates there waiting for you in a World Series game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He remembered back to last October, when after 456 at-bats  
during the regular season, he never saw a pitch against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very frustrating,'' Curtis said. ``I played 152 games.  
that's 152 of 162. I never stepped on the field in the World 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees capped their amazing season with a sweep, he  
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't pouting. We won the World Series,'' he said. ``By the  
same token, I felt I was more congratulating my teammates than 
celebrating with them. That was something I was uncomfortable 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Tom Glavine hadn't gotten the flu, Curtis would have started  
against the lefty in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really fired up to play in Game 1,'' Curtis remembered.  
``I had been there probably a half hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then somebody told him Greg Maddux, a righty, had replaced  
Glavine as Atlanta's starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `What?' He was joking, I thought,'' Curtis said.  
</P>
<P>
	So there he was Tuesday night, hitting the 11th World Series  
walk-off homer, the first since Toronto's Joe Carter took Mitch 
Williams deep in Game 6 in 1993 to win the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about that fifth-inning homer, the one that made it 5-2  
and started the Yankees on their comeback? He had been 0-for-12 
against Glavine in his career before hitting that one out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were flat there,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``We were down 5-1  
and Glavine was just mowing us down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the other Yankees are well-known: Jeter and Williams,  
Knoblauch and O'Neill, Martinez and Brosius, Davis and Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis?  
</P>
<P>
	He was supposed to lose his job to Darryl Strawberry.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Shane Spencer.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Ricky Ledee.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Tony Tarasco.  
</P>
<P>
	But no matter what else happens now, Curtis has that moment, a  
replay that will be shown over and over in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it for my grandma,'' he said, still on the field with  
the game-winning ball, ``but I got to give it to my 2-month-old 
son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Remlinger had just come in, and throughout the ballpark,  
there was the feeling the win was there for the taking. John Rocker 
had pitched his two innings, and the rest of the Braves' bullpen 
scares mainly their own fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis fouled off the first pitch, then took a ball.  
</P>
<P>
	And then came the drive.  
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Gerald Williams knew after two steps.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency in these situations to try and hit a home  
run,'' Curtis said. ``So I went up there and tried to hit a liner 
up the middle, and I hit a homer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He became the man of the night, the toast of the town, a New  
York hero. 
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis, at 5-foot-10 an inch taller than Chuck Knoblauch,  
doesn't even know if he'll get back on the field for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait on that,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said,  
``and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Publisher Denies Plotting Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A leading Israeli publisher confirmed today he  
is being accused of plotting murders -- reportedly those of his two 
main media rivals -- and dismissed the claims by a convicted 
wiretapper as a ``terrible web of lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ofer Nimrodi, until last week the publisher of the Maariv daily  
newspaper, broke his silence today after a court lifted a gag order 
and the allegations became front-page news in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	According to media reports, a private investigator who bugged  
phones at a rival newspaper at Nimrodi's request several years ago, 
now accuses him of having plotted to kill publishers Amos Schocken 
of Haaretz and Arnon Mozes of Yediot Ahronot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have been investigating the allegations by the  
wiretapper, Rafi Pridan, for three months, but have not called 
Nimrodi in for questioning because they lacked evidence, said the 
reports in Israel's major dailies and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they would not comment on an ongoing investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	Emerging today from his villa in the posh Tel Aviv suburb of  
Savyon, Nimrodi said: ``I am being accused of being connected with 
murder ... I am simply in a state of shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nimrodi said Pridan, who is serving a four-year sentence for  
wiretapping, repeatedly tried to blackmail him. The publisher said 
Pridan threatened to spread fabrications that would wreck Nimrodi's 
reputation unless he was paid millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Maintaining his innocence, the publisher said he wanted police  
to ``investigate the terrible web of lies that has been spun above 
my head, to investigate whether I have any connection with 
murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nimrodi said the case has taken a severe toll on him and his  
family. ``I just want my life back,'' said Nimrodi, who bought 
Maariv in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he suspended himself as Maariv publisher and director  
of the Israel Land Development Corp., a holding company for a 
variety of commercial interests, including Maariv. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ministry officials were not available for comment today.  
However, they said last week that police were investigating whether 
Nimrodi had plotted to kill a third person, private investigator 
Yaakov Tzur, who had become a witness for the prosecution in the 
wiretapping scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Nimrodi hired Pridan and Tzur to wiretap the offices of Yediot  
Ahronot in the early 1990s, during a bitter circulation war between 
the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
	Police began investigating the charges in 1994. Tzur turned  
state witness in 1995. Ultimately, Nimrodi was sentenced to eight 
months in prison and Pridan to four years. In exchange for his 
testimony, Tzur was not tried. 
</P>
<P>
	Nimrodi was released in February after serving more than four  
months. Pridan, who started his sentence last month, began 
cooperating with police in August, the Jerusalem Post daily 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the media reports, Pridan told police that Nimrodi  
hoped to lure Tzur to Indonesia in 1996, by getting a Thai-based 
Israeli businessman to hire the detective to run a security check 
on his operations in the region. Pridan was to arrange the killing. 
Tzur turned down the job offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The media reports, quoting police and prosecution officials, did  
not say if Pridan explained why Nimrodi would want to kill Mozes or 
Schocken.

<HEADLINE> Execution Nears Despite Confession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Days before Richard Charles Johnson is to  
be executed for shooting a South Carolina state trooper to death 14 
years ago, a woman has stepped forward to say she's guilty of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials doubt her credibility and say the execution will  
likely proceed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's own appeal for clemency has been joined by the state's  
new Roman Catholic bishop, who wants Gov. Jim Hodges to reduce 
Johnson's sentence to life without parole in light of the new 
information. Johnson is scheduled to die Friday by lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sworn affidavit submitted last week, Connie Sue Hess says  
she killed trooper Bruce K. Smalls in September 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 36, of Morehead City, N.C., was convicted of killing a  
Virginia man who gave him, Hess and another man a ride. He was also 
convicted of killing Smalls, who pulled over the motor home they 
were in. 
</P>
<P>
	Recanting earlier testimony, Hess also said in the statement  
that the other man, not Johnson, killed the motor home's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said she confessed to ease her conscience, and had lied  
originally ``because I did not want to die. The solicitor told me I 
would fry if I had anything to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's lawyer has appealed to the state Supreme Court to  
postpone the execution, and Johnson has petitioned the governor's 
office to have his sentence commuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess' statements may be challenged because of her mental  
history, the Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald reported today. The 
newspaper said Hess has spent time in mental institutions and 
currently lives in a supervised apartment complex for the mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that without a doubt her credibility is an issue,''  
Robb McBurney, a spokesman for the South Carolina attorney 
general's office, told the newspaper. He said the attorney 
general's office is reviewing her statement and will advise the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by both the newspaper and The Associated Press to reach  
Hess and her family were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Hess nor the third hitchhiker were prosecuted in the  
case. Whether she will now be prosecuted has not been determined, 
but she could face murder, obstruction of justice and perjury 
charges, McBurney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges will not make a decision about the execution until the  
case is reviewed by the attorney general and the local prosecutor's 
office, said spokesman Nina Brook. And Hess' statement has not 
altered preparations for the state's third execution this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going ahead ... until we hear something different  
from the courts,'' said John Barkley, a Corrections Department 
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Delays Haunt America's Cup Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- America True and Nippon asked for  
delays because of gear failures, Young America turned up late, and 
the Swiss and French teams didn't show at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenger series for the America's Cup fell into disarray  
today as on-board problems, blustery weather and officials' 
decisions left only one real race out of a scheduled 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials cut short celebrations for Italy's Prada team, voiding  
the result of the race which completed the team's sweep of 
round-robin 1 of the regatta to decide who will face Team New 
Zealand for sailing's prized trophy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its afternoon race, Prada easily beat Hawaii's Abracadabra  
2000, Italian skipper Francesco de Angelis' 10th win in 10 starts. 
But Abracadabra successfully protested, complaining it had not had 
enough time to prepare for its second race after the morning 
matchups were postponed because of strong wind conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the same reason, officials also voided the result of the  
afternoon race between Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes and Young 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two races are scheduled to be rerun Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	After a three-day postponement because of collision and mishap  
damage to two boats, racing resumed today on Hauraki Gulf in winds 
of about 20 knots and choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the morning races, Stars and Stripes easily defeated Young  
America, which missed the start after returning to port because of 
a gear failure and started the race a full leg behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada, the Spanish team and Japan's Nippon all received wins  
after the teams they were supposed to race -- the French and the 
Swiss -- effectively forfeited by staying in port to work on their 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne's final two races Tuesday were postponed until  
Thursday while the team repairs damage from a collision with Stars 
and Stripes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	America True and Nippon met in the only real race of the  
morning, and even that was delayed after gear failures on both 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon skipper Peter Gilmour beat Dawn Riley's America True in  
pre-start maneuvers, leaving the Americans stalled as the gun 
fired. Gilmour took the wind advantage and finished the first 
upwind leg 10 boat lengths in front. 
</P>
<P>
	Nippon had a clear lead until the last downwind leg, when, with  
both boats plunging though the chop under spinnaker, America True 
trimmed 57 seconds off Nippon's lead and crossed just one second 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries receive one point for each victory in the 
first of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet defending champion Team  
New Zealand in a best-of-9 regatta starting in February for the 
America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Lung Cancer Detection Study Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors and scientists are urging the federal  
government to immediately begin studying a new method of detecting 
lung cancer in its earliest stages, The New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The method, spiral CT scanning, can find lung cancers when they  
are about as small around as a pea. Chest X-rays find lung cancers 
when they are about the size of a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The scanning method is so new that doctors are still learning  
what it can do, including whether it can help save lives. The first 
major papers on it were written in April and July, but patients 
already are lining up for the scan, and hospitals are offering to 
provide it. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts at a workshop in Gaithersburg, Md., on Tuesday  
said the study was very important because the new method may become 
so widely used that no one will question its effects. 
</P>
<P>
	They called for an immediate study involving possibly tens of  
thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to convey to decisionmakers that a study should be  
moved on as quickly as possible so that we can understand the 
benefits and risks of this technology,'' said Dr. Christine Berg of 
the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claudia Henschke of Cornell University directed one of two  
studies on smokers and ex-smokers and estimated the new method of 
spotting tumors could allow up to 80 percent of lung cancer 
patients to survive at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 15 percent currently live that long.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus Split El Al Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli airline El Al has decided to split a  
contract to replace its passenger fleet between the U.S. aircraft 
manufacturer Boeing and the European consortium Airbus, an El Al 
spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al will buy three Boeing 777 planes and three or four Airbus  
330 planes, spokesman Nachman Klieman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to buy the Airbus planes still requires final  
approval by the company management, expected in two weeks, Klieman 
said in a statement. The decision to buy the Boeing planes has been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al will pay $400 million to replace its 747 planes with the  
Boeing 777's. Airbus spokesman Dan Arkan said the Airbus deal would 
be worth about $250 million, depending on the number of planes 
purchased and the maintenance agreements reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Klieman said the company decided to split the contract because  
the 300-seat Boeing 777's were more suitable for long flights, 
while the 250-seat Airbus 330's were a better choice as a 
medium-sized airplane used for shorter flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies welcomed the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Senior Sales Vice President Thomas Basacchi in a  
statement thanked El Al for its ``continued expression of 
confidence in the Boeing company.'' He said the first 777 would be 
delivered in February, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus Vice President John Leahy said in a statement that his  
company was happy with the contract, ``but we are a lot more happy 
with the new partnership between Airbus and El Al.'' If the Airbus 
deal is approved, the first plane would arrive by February 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of the Airbus aircraft will break Boeing's  
monopoly at El Al, which currently uses only Boeing planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel was under strong pressure from the United States to give  
the contract to the Seattle-based manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	By awarding part of its contract to Airbus, Israel -- which  
receives $3 billion annually in U.S. foreign aid -- could pave the 
way for other countries that receive substantial U.S. aid to grant 
more military contracts to non-U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	El Al's decision, announced following a late night meeting  
Wednesday, was originally to have been taken by early spring but 
has been postponed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	As El Al continued to stall, both companies gave sweeter and  
sweeter offers, most recently offering improved bids on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	In its new bid, Airbus agreed to subcontract 50 percent of the  
contract value to Israel Aircraft Industries, company spokesman Dan 
Arkan said, up from its initial offer to direct 35 percent of the 
contract value to IAI. 
</P>
<P>
	Klieman said Boeing had also pledged to spend at least 50  
percent of the contract value to buy products from Israeli 
companies.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers Cut Two Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers cut two players  
Wednesday, including promising rookie Roberto Bergersen, to trim 
their roster to the NBA-required 15 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergersen, a 6-foot-6, 200-pound guard who was drafted by  
Atlanta in the second round out of Boise State, had an impressive 
debut for Portland, hitting a 3-pointer in overtime to help the 
Blazers beat the Seattle SuperSonics 124-115 in the exhibition 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	But he never distinguished himself as a shooter after that. In  
his next game against Golden State he was 0-for-5, missing all four 
3-point attempts in 12 minutes. He didn't score again the rest of 
the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good kid, and he works hard, but it's tough being a  
draft pick on this team,'' said Blazers guard Steve Smith, noting 
Portland's talent and depth. 
</P>
<P>
	Monty Buckley, a 6-6, 210-pound journeyman guard-forward, played  
in four preseason games, averaging 2.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergersen averaged 17.3 points over three seasons at Boise  
State, finishing fourth on the Broncos' career scoring list with 
1,485 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergersen was selected by Atlanta with the 52nd pick in the  
draft, then traded to Portland for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckley was undrafted out of California and spent the past three  
seasons with the CBA's Sioux Falls Skyforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland is allowed to carry 15 players on its roster, three of  
whom will be placed on the injured list before next Tuesday's 
season opener at Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> Mother of Columbine Victim Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (AP) -- Hundreds of people attended the  
funeral Wednesday of a woman who committed suicide six months after 
her daughter was critically injured in the Columbine High School 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Hochhalter, 48, shot herself in a pawn shop last week.  
Relatives have said she suffered from clinical depression, and that 
the Columbine shootings and her daughter's grave injuries were more 
than she could tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stress was mounting, and Carla was dealing with an  
illness,'' pastor David Jensen told mourners at Christ Lutheran 
Church. ``It became too much, not just for Carla, but for many of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 700 people filled the church's main sanctuary and a  
separate room set up with folding chairs and a television screen 
for the overflow crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hochhalter walked into an Englewood pawn shop Friday and  
asked to see a handgun, police said. When the clerk was distracted, 
she loaded it with her own ammunition and killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, her daughter, Anne Marie, was shot in the spinal  
cord when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began their attack at 
Columbine. Twelve students and a teacher died and about 26 others 
were wounded before the gunmen killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hochhalter, 17, who was partially paralyzed, was released  
from a rehabilitation hospital in August. Several days before her 
mother's death, she said she moved her legs for the first time 
during a therapy session. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hochhalter's suicide was the latest blow to a community  
still reeling from the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Columbine student was arrested after allegedly  
saying he planned to ``finish the job'' started by Harris and 
Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't seem to quit,'' said Bob Palmer, a member of  
Christ Lutheran. ``Things seemed to be settling down and getting 
back to normal, and now this has happened. It's terrible.''

<HEADLINE> Tribal Casino, Union Agree to Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIEJAS INDIAN RESERVATION, Calif. (AP) -- Tribal and union  
leaders on Wednesday signed the first collective bargaining 
contract covering workers at an Indian casino in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal sovereignty exempts Indian tribes from the National Labor  
Relations Act, which gives U.S. workers the right to unionize, and 
tribal officials had resisted allowing unions to talk to casino 
workers, saying it would forfeit the tribes' right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But gambling compacts Gov. Gray Davis recently signed with 57  
California tribes include a provision allowing workers to petition 
for a union vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The compacts were signed to legalize Indian gambling and allow  
the expansion of slot machines on tribal lands. The compacts came 
after U.S. attorneys threatened to enforce a federal court order to 
shut down tribal casinos that followed a successful court challenge 
to a voter-approved ballot measure that legalized gambling in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, Anthony  
Pico, signed the collective bargaining contract with the 
Communications Workers of America Local 9400. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-year contract, which goes into effect Nov. 25, calls for  
a salary increase and benefits equaling a 15 percent pay hike for 
nearly 700 service and maintenance employees at the Viejas Casino &AMP; 
Turf Club, about 30 miles east of San Diego. Pay increases range 
from 42 cents per hour to $1.40 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Micheal Hartigan, executive vice president of the CWA local,  
said he believes the deal paves the way for other tribes to agree 
to similar contracts.

<HEADLINE> Players Deal With Stewart's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The courtesy car set aside for Payne Stewart is  
parked in his spot at Champions Golf Club in front of nine bouquets 
and a pair of red roses tied to his nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
	Vijay Singh came to the end of a long and strangely silent day  
at a tournament that usually is one of the most festive on the PGA 
Tour. He put his clubs in a car parked next to the unused vehicle 
belonging to Stewart, then stared at some of the messages attached 
to the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a word, Singh seemed to echo what Tiger Woods quietly  
said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe he's not going to be here,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's memory was a driving force Tuesday. Walking the  
fairways while playing with four amateurs, Woods said he saw 
flashes of Stewart. Phil Mickelson saw a picture of the U.S. Open 
champion on a Jumbotron next to the driving range and stopped to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after Stewart was among five people killed when a  
Learjet soared uncontrolled across the heartland of America before 
crashing in South Dakota, the 22 players who showed up at Champions 
tried to seek therapy by playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, this would have been a glorious day.  
The sun was shining bright in a blue sky, the breeze barely a 
trace. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dreary day,'' said John Huston, summing up a somber mood as  
the players tried to cope with the shocking death of the 
42-year-old Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags were at half-staff. Smiles were hard to find.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods felt a void when he watched the developments unfold on  
television Monday. It hit him even harder when he flew to Houston 
that night and picked up the pro-am pairing. 
</P>
<P>
	His tee time was 9 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	The slot below, which once held Stewart's name, was blank.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was a rude awakening,'' Woods said. ``You think that  
hopefully it was a bad dream, a nightmare ... but unfortunately, it 
came true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service for Stewart will be at 11 a.m. Friday at the  
First Baptist Church of Orlando, Fla. The PGA Tour altered the 
schedule to give players a chance to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship will begin with 27 holes on Thursday, have  
another 27 holes on Saturday and conclude Sunday with an 18-hole 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tournament should go on,'' Woods said. ``But obviously,  
it's not going to be an easy week. It's going to be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It clearly wasn't an easy day.  
</P>
<P>
	While the pro-am was canceled, 22 players kept their date with  
four amateur partners. It was a form of therapy for some, although 
they played with no emotion and even less focus. Stewart, his quick 
wit, loose swing and colorful knickers, was never far from their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just a matter of dealing with it and coming to the peace  
and understand that he is in a better place right now,'' Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship is one of the best events of the year, a  
festive atmosphere for the top 30 players on the money list. While 
Champions is only a mile from one of the busiest thoroughfares in 
Houston, the silence was spooky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was really asking for autographs or clamoring for  
pictures,'' Woods said. ``Nobody was talking. It was very eerie. 
This golf tournament ... it doesn't have the same emphasis as it 
once did, and rightfully so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who hadn't arrived was Davis Love III, whose father  
was killed in a plane crash in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our entire family knows the grief the Stewart family is  
enduring,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickelson, who finished one stroke behind Stewart in the U.S.  
Open, showed up before dawn for morning television shows and 
returned to the course in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this to happen at the height of his career, and really the  
height of his life, is difficult to accept,'' Mickelson said. ``I 
haven't really thought about the tournament this week or playing. 
It's just a real somber mood here. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as golf is concerned, it really takes a seat on the  
back burner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will not be replaced in the field.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who won for the sixth time this year at Disney World on  
Sunday, has a chance to surpass $6 million if he wins the next two 
tournaments, although that was not even a consideration on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be paired with David Duval, No. 2 on the money list, for  
the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Big deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be difficult to be focused on what you're  
doing,'' Duval said. ``I don't know how spectacular the golf will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was among a dozen or so players at Champions on Monday for  
a practice round. Mike Hicks, Stewart's caddie, was stepping off 
the yardage on the course when he was summoned to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think today was any easier, but yesterday was the  
worst part about it all,'' Duval said. ``I think today was just 
trying to get a grasp of it being real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flags were a constant reminder how real it was. If that  
wasn't enough, PGA Tour officials were making black ribbons for 
players and caddies to wear as a tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to think about playing a tournament,'' Huston said.  
``It doesn't seem worth it.''

<HEADLINE> New Grain System May Help Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota farmers irked by inaccurate  
and burdensome tests for grain damage could benefit from new 
technology that seeks to streamline the process, a Fargo company 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Bandy Technology Systems has developed a system that enables  
elevators to essentially test for sprout damage with the push of a 
button, said president Mark Bandy. The company also has received 
$25,000 from the North Dakota Agricultural Products Utilization 
Commission for research on a vomitoxin testing system for wheat and 
barley. 
</P>
<P>
	APUC provides grants to developers of North Dakota farm  
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers complain that they often get unfair prices for their  
crops because existing testing systems are inaccurate. The testing 
process also is complicated for elevator managers who do not have 
the technical expertise, Bandy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprout-testing machine is on the market, he said. The  
systems cost from $10,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of those systems replace laborious, inaccurate testing  
systems,'' Bandy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The existing tests require extremely well-trained technicians.  
It requires a great deal of knowledge in terms of things that are 
normally taught to chemists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Diepolder, a Willow City farmer who has spoken out against  
inaccurate testing, said he welcomes any improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was consistent and they could sample a load and get it  
accurate and consistent ... I'd welcome it because the current 
situation is inadequate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprouting of crop kernels, which can significantly damage grain,  
occurs under excessively wet conditions. Vomitoxin is a byproduct 
of scab disease, which has ravaged North Dakota crops in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Animals that eat infected grain can become sick, and beer made  
from barley with high levels of vomitoxin can foam excessively. 
</P>
<P>
	Elevators discount the price they pay for lower-quality grain,  
and some farmers question the test results. A study by a federal 
grain inspection agency last year said elevators did not have the 
technology to offer pinpoint accuracy needed in evaluating barley 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The) tests are for baloney, not for barley. Frustrated  
farmers are boiling over, and it will come to a head soon,'' 
Diepolder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bandy said his company's system not only will eliminate  
inaccuracies, but also allow for quick tests. He said current tests 
can run up to an hour, while the new technology does it in about 
five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make it easier for farmers who want to test just a  
truckload to eliminate what Bandy calls the 
``one-bad-apple-in-a-barrel'' scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``You take one truckload and put it in with 10 loads and you can  
end up with all 11 loads not meeting milling specifications,'' 
Bandy said. ``The idea here is to ... give the farmer and elevator 
more control over their process, rather than mixing good grain with 
bad.''

<HEADLINE> Power Giant AES Buys Brazil's Tiete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Global power giant AES Corp. on  
Wednesday bought a controlling stake in Brazilian energy company 
Tiete for $470 million. 
</P>
<P>
	AES, based in Arlington, Va., bid 30 percent more than the  
minimum asking price for Tiete, which can produce 2,600 megawatts 
of energy and serves Brazil's most heavily industrialized state, 
Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts originally had predicted a much higher selling price,  
but many potential bidders dropped out because of recent legal 
problems involving the privatization of the Cemig power company in 
the neighboring state of Minas Gerais. 
</P>
<P>
	Minas Gerais had sold a 30 percent stake in Cemig to private  
shareholders, including AES, Southern Co. and the Brazilian bank 
Opportunity. But the current governor wants to bring Cemig back 
under full state control and is trying to restrict the power of 
minority shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Fat-Cell Hormone Shows Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A hormone naturally produced in fat cells  
showed promise in helping people lose weight, though a small 
portion of those studied gained weight during a six-month study. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 47 adults injected with varying dosages of the  
hormone leptin lost weight, with those getting higher dosages 
losing the most -- as much as 15.6 pounds on average. 
</P>
<P>
	The study combined exercise and diet with the hormone treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, gained weight, pointing out the need for further  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is no magic bullet,'' lead author Dr. Steven B.  
Heymsfield of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York told 
science reporters Tuesday at a conference of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is possible that scientists may one day be able to  
``switch off appetite,'' Heymsfield said, ``diet and exercise are 
ultimately the mainstay of treatment'' for obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study began with 70 adults, but only 47 lasted through the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said only three people dropped out of the study  
because of adverse reactions -- two had injection site reactions and 
one had heart palpitations.The authors believe patients who 
withdrew did so because they didn't like having to repeatedly 
inject themselves with leptin. Patients who received the highest 
doses were most likely to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	Those on leptin lost from about 1.5 pounds on average for the  
lowest dosage, to 15.6 pounds on average for the highest dosage; 
subjects who received a placebo lost about 3 pounds on average. 
</P>
<P>
	A few gained from about 2 to 10 pounds, apparently because their  
bodies resist leptin, Heymsfield said 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary results of the study were reported last year. The  
study was partly funded by California-based leptin manufacturer 
Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
	Research on humans remains preliminary and clinical use of  
leptin is still years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The study results are ``ambiguous'' because the doses of leptin  
given were relatively high compared to natural levels, the weight 
losses were small, and some people did not respond to the treatment 
at all, an outside leptin researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a glass half full or half empty. ... We don't know if  
these levels and type of leptin are really safe,'' said Dr. Luciano 
Rossetti, professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York. ``This raises both hope and concern at the 
same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leptin is produced by fat cells. It is supposed to signal the  
brain to stop eating but the signal does not get through in some 
overweight people. It is one of at least a half-dozen hormones that 
``tightly regulate'' food intake in animals and probably humans, 
Heymsfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in the study, the highest weight losses involved  
injecting the equivalent of several tablespoons of leptin daily, 
and presumably the hormone would have to be taken for life in order 
to maintain its benefits.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Worldwide Commercial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. hopes to reach a billion viewers  
Monday evening in a rare global advertising gamble aimed at raising 
its corporate profile as the millennium approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's second-biggest automaker has cobbled together an  
unusual collection of television networks that will carry an 
unusually long two-minute commercial at about 9 p.m. local time in 
most markets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's strategy is to get the widest possible exposure for a  
single airing of a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial subtly showcases all seven of Ford's automobile  
brands, suggesting in a montage of emotional vignettes that its 
products fit seamlessly into people's lives around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, it shows a war veteran riding in a Ford Mustang  
convertible in a homecoming parade, an Italian couple embracing in 
front of a Volvo, a well-dressed woman putting her sleek dogs in 
the back seat of a Jaguar and Japanese girls playing in cherry 
blossoms near a Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad from the agency J. Walter Thompson carries the Ford logo  
near the start and at the end but there is no narrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The often disconnected images, shot in nine countries, are held  
together by the song ``Just Wave Hello,'' written expressly for 
Ford and sung by the 14-year-old soprano Charlotte Church. Waving 
people appear in many scenes, their actions sometimes matching the 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad is being shown two months ahead of the year 2000, and  
Ford officials said the timing signals their intent to make the 
company the global leader in automotive products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are serious about trying to understand people and their  
lives and their needs in an emotional way so we can design vehicle, 
products and services they opt to choose,'' James C. Schroer, vice 
president of global marketing for Ford, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes viewers ``come to the conclusion that Ford Motor Co.  
has a heart and soul and has the kind of people and products that 
people will want to get to know better and will trust us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroer declined to say how much it cost to run the ad globally  
but he said one published estimate of $10 million was conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grubbs, who oversees the ad agency BBDO's purchases of  
national commercial time for clients like Pepsi-Cola, Visa and 
Federal Express, said Ford's plans represented ``a pretty big 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most difficult things today is how to break through  
the clutter and get impact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday nights typically attract TV's biggest audiences  
of the week, and he said a two-minute commercial is bound to get 
attention simply because it is four times longer than the typical 
30-second ad. Announcing the plans in advance will also help. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may actually get some people to tune in for curiosity's  
sake to see what is up with this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad will run on 38 different networks in the United States  
alone, including the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and WB. 
Due to the time differences across the U.S., viewers on the West 
coast could see the commercial on some cable networks as early as 6 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroer said he expects the ad will reach 300 million households  
and one billion people globally the first night. 
</P>
<P>
	After its initial run, Ford plans to continue running shortened  
one-minute versions of the ad through the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad wasn't designed to trigger an immediate sales surge,  
Schroer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He intends to watch how many people go to Ford's Web sites for  
more information after the commercial runs and how many people 
mention the ad when they visit dealers selling Ford's brands which 
also include Lincoln, Mercury, and Aston Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hopes Ford moves up in the ranking of most-trusted  
companies around the world, which he said will be key to competing 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the first page'' of such listings, he said. ``We  
would like to be at the top.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Won't Open Ramsey Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens said Wednesday he has decided not  
to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the JonBenet Ramsey 
slaying, saying police are working with new evidence and headed in 
the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also had strong words for the little girl's parents, John  
and Patsy Ramsey, asking them to ``stop hiding behind their 
attorneys'' and return to Colorado to help authorities solve the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the killers, let me say this: You only think you have  
gotten away with murder. There is strong evidence to suggest who 
you are,'' Owens said. ``I think investigators are moving closer to 
proving their case. They will keep pursuing you. You will reap what 
you have sown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who moved to the Atlanta area after the killing,  
have insisted they are innocent. A statement from their attorneys 
called Owens' remarks ``slanderous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said the governor's references  
to the killers was the strongest accusation yet against the 
Ramseys. He called it a ``cheap shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone, even a governor, should be allowed to  
accuse people of doing something, which they have a constitutional 
right to do, which is hide behind their lawyers,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, a Boulder County grand jury completed a 13-month  
investigation of the 1996 slaying without issuing any indictments. 
District Attorney Alex Hunter said there was not enough evidence to 
charge anyone, although he and police said the Ramseys remain under 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also asked a seven-member task force to recommend whether  
a special prosecutor should be appointed. The group was made up of 
a former Colorado Supreme Court chief justice; Owens' chief legal 
counsel; a deputy attorney general and four district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Owens said he had decided that investigators were on  
the right track and were analyzing ``substantial new evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens acknowledged that initial mistakes harmed the probe.  
Critics have claimed the investigation was compromised when 
detectives allowed the Ramseys and friends to roam through their 
mansion in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the initial Ramsey investigation was far from  
perfect,'' Owens acknowledged. ``There can be little doubt that the 
Ramsey case will be harder to prove in court because of the initial 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``The killers in the case made some very serious  
mistakes, but they're also very smart. They have stonewalled very 
effectively and they have covered their tracks well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor declined comment on whether the Ramseys had a role  
in their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could speak to John and Patsy Ramsey,'' he said, ``I  
would tell them to quit hiding behind their attorneys, come back to 
Colorado and work with investigators in this case, no matter where 
that trail will lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement issued late Wednesday, the Ramseys'  
attorneys called Owens' remarks ``slanderous'' which ``pander to 
the fringe lynch mob which long ago cast aside the time-honored 
presumption of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming from a public official elected to the highest office of  
this state, his comments are unconscionable,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bradley Leads Gore in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While Al Gore has a hefty lead nationally  
over Bill Bradley, the vice president trails in the East in the 
race for the Democratic presidential nomination, a poll reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate national poll found Republican Sen. John McCain of  
Arizona running neck-and-neck with Gore in one possible general 
election matchup but trailing Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a large regional difference in the support for Gore  
and Bradley,'' said Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's 
Institute for Public Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the latest Marist poll found the vice president  
leading the former senator from New Jersey, 49 percent to 32 
percent. An April poll from the Poughkeepsie-based Marist pollsters 
had Gore leading Bradley, 59 percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the East, Miringoff said his latest poll had Bradley, a  
former star with the New York Knicks, leading Gore, 52 percent to 
35 percent. Conversely, Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, led 
Bradley in the South, 58 percent to 19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, Gore led  
Bradley 53 percent to 29 percent. In a hypothetical matchup with 
GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, Gore was behind Bush, 
49 percent to 39 percent. Bradley trailed Bush by about the same 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
	When Pat Buchanan, who this week left the Republican Party to  
run for president as a Reform Party candidate, is added to general 
election matchup, both Bradley and Gore cut Bush's lead in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley were to meet Wednesday night in New Hampshire  
for their first debate of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Miringoff said the new poll also showed ``Gore's fortunes are  
very much tied to how Clinton is viewed.'' Among Democratic voters 
who approve of the job Clinton is doing, Gore leads Bradley, 52 
percent to 30 percent. But with Democrats who don't like the 
president's work, Bradley leads, 47 percent to 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent polls, Gore's earlier leads over Bradley have vanished  
in such crucial early primary states as New Hampshire and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Marist poll found Bush, the Texas governor, leading both  
Gore and Bradley. Bush led Gore 53 percent to 39 percent, and led 
Bradley, 52 percent to 37 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the Marist poll had Bush leading McCain, 62 percent  
to 10 percent, for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate national poll from Zogby International, a Utica-based  
firm, had Bush leading McCain, 64 percent to 12 percent, among 
Republican voters. Gore led Bradley among Democrats, 51 percent to 
27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zogby poll showed Bush well ahead of both Gore and Bradley.  
And, in a boost for McCain, it showed the Arizona senator favored 
by 42 percent of voters with Gore at 40 percent, a statistical dead 
heat. The poll had Bradley ahead of McCain, 41 percent to 34 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Marist's telephone poll of 761 registered voters was conducted  
Oct. 18-20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 
percentage points. Zogby's telephone poll of 1,017 likely voters 
was conducted Oct. 23-25 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 
3 percentage points. The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll of 1,003 
people was taken Oct. 23-25 and has an error margin of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers To Name New Chairman, CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday will name  
a new chairman and chief executive officer who is purchasing a 
small part of the team, a source close to the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers would only say a ``major executive appointment'' is  
planned for 10 a.m. PDT at the Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press on Wednesday the new chairman and CEO will be ``a 
famous entertainment person who lives in Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The source wouldn't provide further details.  
</P>
<P>
	Bob Graziano was fired as president and CEO of the Dodgers late  
last month -- shortly before the team finished a most disappointing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziano, 41, joined the Dodgers in January 1986, and became  
president and CEO when the Fox Group division of Rupert Murdoch's 
News Corp. bought the team from Peter O'Malley's family on March 
19, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers have been underachievers since the sale to Fox. Last  
year, they finished 83-79 and in third place in the NL West. This 
year, as prohibitive favorites in the division with a $79.2 million 
opening-day payroll -- second highest in the majors -- they wound up 
77-85 and 23 games behind first-place Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Gore-Bradley Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Wednesday's debate between Democratic  
presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley: 

</P>
<P>
	On leadership and the presidency:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``A president is the only person in our constitutional  
system who has the responsibility to fight for the welfare and 
well-being of all of our people. Senators and congressmen have 
constituency groups, and they look to the national interest, but a 
president is charged with fighting for all the people. That's what 
I want to do; to bring into being a vision of a bright future for 
our country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``I think there are three values that are important  
that a leader has to have. One is absolute integrity -- honesty and 
integrity. There I think of Jimmy Carter. Second, I think that a 
leader has got to have the ability to see around the corners, to 
see the future before it's here ... And next, I think a leader has 
to have courage. Example of that, I would pick somebody who's not 
an American, Mikhail Gorbachev, who saw that the world was change, 
and had the courage to make that change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On expanding gay rights:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``I'm for domestic partnerships having legal protections,  
but not the same sacrament, not the same name, because I favor 
protecting the institution of marriage as it has been understood 
between a man and a woman. But I think that a partner should have 
legal protection and contractual rights and health care and the 
rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``I support gays being able to serve openly in the  
military. If a gay American can serve openly in the White House, in 
the Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department and in the 
attorney general's office, why can't they serve openly in the U.S. 
military? It doesn't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On campaign finance reform:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``I think it's very important to set a higher standard  
because what I want to do as president -- if you elect me president, 
I promise you I will fight my heart out to get meaningful campaign 
finance reform and get the influence of big money out of our 
political system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``From my perspective, there is no issue that is so  
linked to other issues as campaign finance reform. That's why it is 
an imperative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On expanding health care coverage:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``The availability of treatment for diabetes and the  
availability of treatment for depression or schizophrenia ought to 
be the same in my view ... I promise you, give me a chance to roll 
up my sleeves and go to work on this. This is one that I will fix 
for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``One of the things that I've offered as a part of the  
health care plan was to allow Medicare to pay not only for health, 
but also for plans that would cover health and provide the social 
services to people who were in their homes. Now, it wouldn't be 
quite the special services that an Alzheimer's patient needs, but 
it would give relief to someone who is caring for an Alzheimer's 
patient in the home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On U.S. intervention in foreign conflicts:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``We are the natural leader of the world. I don't think  
that is a chauvinist American statement. I think that's a statement 
of fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``There is no way we have the resources or the wisdom  
to be involved in all 32 ethnic wars in the world. What we need to 
do is we need to find ways of using multilateral institutions like 
the U.N. or regional institutions like NATO ... we don't take the 
full responsibility, but we play a part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On protecting the environment:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``We, in our country, have a lot of work to do. Global  
warming is a real problem. Air pollution is a real problem. Water 
pollution is a real problem. We've got to clean up the toxic waste 
sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``You protect the natural world from pollution or you  
clean up that which has been polluted so that individuals may 
encounter something that is bigger than they are and lasts longer 
than they do. Every time I have some moment on a seashore, or in 
the mountains, or sometimes in a quiet forest, I think that this is 
why the environment has to be preserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On education reform:  
</P>
<P>
	GORE: ``I favor tough teacher testing for new teachers including  
in the subjects that they teach. Tough peer evaluation for existing 
teachers. I think that one of the reasons we do need more teachers 
is to reduce the class size so there's more one-on-one time between 
teachers and students who might learn in a different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BRADLEY: ``When FDR was president of the United States and we  
were in a depression, he said 'I'm going to try this, I'm going to 
try that, I'm going to try something else. But we are going to get 
out of this depression.' And I say to the American people that if 
I'm president of the United States, when it comes to urban public 
education, we're going to try this, we're going to try that, we're 
going to experiment here, experiment there. But we are going to 
improve urban public education.''

<HEADLINE> White House Rejects Helms Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today rejected an offer by  
Sen. Jesse Helms for a hearing next week on the ambassadorial 
nomination of former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun in exchange for 
sensitive documents. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called Helms' request  
``completely unreasonable and unmeetable.'' But he said the White 
House was not inclined to circumvent the committee process to 
install Moseley-Braun as ambassador to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to continue to work through the relevant  
committees to try to get movement,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stalemate increased the likelihood that Clinton would give  
Moseley-Braun a so-called ``recess appointment'' when the Congress 
recesses next month, Democratic congressional officials suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	That would enable the Illinois Democrat, the nation's first  
black female senator, to serve until the end of this Congress, when 
Clinton leaves office anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution allows the president to make such appointments  
-- and bypass the usual Senate confirmation process -- during 
congressional recesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Another White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said earlier today  
that ``we don't discuss the possibility of recess appointments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the White House hopes that Helms would change his mind  
and not seek to delay the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., offered to hold a hearing on her nomination as  
soon as next week. But, in exchange, he demanded sensitive 
documents from the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service 
on her background by ``no later than Monday, Nov. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are ``vital'' to the consideration of the  
nomination by the Foreign Relations Committee, which he chairs, 
Helms wrote in a letter to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But Toiv said that the request ``asked for an extraordinary  
amount of information, including materials on anybody who has ever 
worked for the nominee or in her campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The deadline is not a serious deadline,'' Toiv said. ``So we  
don't think this was a real request designed to move the nomination 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are allegations, never proven, that Moseley-Braun used  
leftover 1992 campaign funds to pay for personal luxuries. The 
accusations were raised during her unsuccessful 1998 re-election 
campaign against Republican Peter Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms last week said her nomination was under an ``ethical  
cloud'' and suggested Senate action on it wouldn't come anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms clashed with Moseley-Braun during her one term in  
Congress, most memorably on the Senate floor over use of the 
Confederate Flag. She later accused Helms of taunting her in an 
elevator by singing ``Dixie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights groups and congressional Democrats condemned Helms'  
apparent efforts to block the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Helms made his offer to hold a hearing next week -- in  
exchange for the IRS and Justice Department documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Helms, said that Helms' offer was  
a legitimate one, not a ruse as charged by Democrats, and that the 
North Carolina Republican was ``willing to have a hearing'' and 
that her nomination could go ahead in the Senate ``if she has a 
clean bill of health.''

<HEADLINE> Lodge Sued in Yosemite Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The families of three Yosemite National  
Park tourists allegedly slain by a mountain lodge handyman sued the 
lodge Wednesday, alleging it assigned the women to an isolated room 
and failed to do a proper background check on the man. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrongful death lawsuits filed by the Sund and Pelosso  
families also accuse the lodge of allowing Cary Stayner to wander 
the grounds with a master key and failing to provide enough 
security for its guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Both families also seek unspecified sums for punitive and other  
damages, and reimbursement for funeral expenses and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 38, is named as a codefendant in the complaints, which  
add yet another legal layer in a case already compounded by 
parallel federal and state prosecutions and potentially thorny 
defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who is being held at the Fresno County Jail, was  
charged last week by a state prosecutor in the mid-February deaths 
of Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old daughter Juli, and their 
Argentine friend Silvina Pelosso, 16. An arraignment hasn't been 
scheduled in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has pleaded innocent in the July 21 death of Yosemite  
naturalist Joie Armstrong and will be tried in U.S. District Court 
in that case because the park falls under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are still working out how and when the cases will  
proceed. Stayner faces the death penalty in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cedar Lodge is one of six motels in the Mariposa County area  
owned by Gerry Fisher and his family. In a short statement, the 
company said it had not seen the lawsuits and could not comment on 
the specific allegations.

<HEADLINE> Daiei Hawks Lead Japan Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGOYA, Japan (AP) -- Hiroki Kokubo drove in two runs and Junji  
Hoshino allowed three hits in 6 1/3 innings as the Daiei Hawks 
defeated the Chunichi Dragons 3-0 Wednesday, moving within one 
victory of winning their first Japan Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who won the Pacific League pennant for the first time  
in the team's 11-year history, lead the best-of-7 series 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	They could end the series in Game 5 Thursday at the Nagoya Dome,  
home of the Central League champion Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	Koji Akiyama doubled home the first run after an infield hit by  
Chihiro Hamana and Kokubo singled home the second run in the third 
inning for the Hawks. In the sixth, Kokubo hit his first homer of 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoshino was relieved by Takayuki Shinohara in the seventh. In  
the bottom of the ninth, reliever Rodney Pedraza got Leo Gomez to 
ground into a game-ending double play for his first save of the 
series.

<HEADLINE> Business Leaders Back WTO Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite protests over the upcoming World Trade  
Organization meeting, labor leaders have joined with their 
corporate counterparts on a presidential advisory board to support 
the administration's trade agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of the 35 panelists declined to sign a letter backing  
Clinton's WTO strategy. But administration officials said the 
expression of support by the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy 
and Negotiations as a ``conceptual breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of compromise and acknowledgment of mutual interest  
has been long sought after,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky said in an interview Wednesday. ``This is the first time 
in six and one-half years that labor has not dissented from an 
ACTPN initiative, or that the business community has not 
dissented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, President Clinton and the leader of the European  
Commission met to discuss the trade talks. Officials said progress 
was made on areas of dispute such as the U.S. export of genetically 
altered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the commission president, Romano Prodi, agreed to  
high-level talks before year's end on biotechnology, and the United 
States is assisting the Europeans in creating an agency similar to 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sensitive subject,'' Prodi said. ``We need to  
give guarantees to our constituents that the scientific controls 
will be of the highest level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, led administration  
efforts to forge a strategy for the WTO ministerial talks, set to 
begin in late November in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders were pleased by the administration's call for a  
working group within the WTO to deal with issues such as worker 
rights and protections, which business leaders traditionally have 
tried to keep separate from trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Four groups, including the Consumers Union of America and the  
American Farm Bureau Federation, declined to sign the letter. But 
that did not dampen the administration's enthusiasm over the 
compromise between labor and business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where the most serious degree of conflict has existed  
over a marketization agenda,'' Barshefsky said. ``That gap has been 
bridged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, written by Procter &AMP; Gamble's John E. Pepper,  
chairman of the commission established by Congress and named by 
Clinton, was signed by, among others, Robert Shapiro of Monsanto 
Co., Curtis H. Barnette of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Thomas J. Donahue 
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and 
Jay Mazur, president of UNITE!, a New York-based labor union. 
</P>
<P>
	``While, not surprisingly, all of our members are not in  
agreement on every element of this agenda, a strong majority ... 
believe that the U.S. negotiating agenda as a whole is bold and 
appropriately comprehensive,'' said the letter, obtained by The 
Associated Press. ``We believe that if achieved, it will result in 
better jobs, higher living standards and increased economic 
opportunities for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thea Lee, a trade expert at the AFL-CIO, said that labor's  
endorsement of the administration's negotiating strategy should not 
be seen as an abandonment of labor's concerns about the WTO and its 
historical lack of consideration for labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of the ACTPN letter was broad support for many of  
the U.S. goals, including putting forward a working group on trade 
and labor,'' Lee said. ``We have a lot of other issues and we have 
a lot of critiques of the WTO that aren't changed by our signing 
onto the ACTPN letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with Prodi also yielded what Barshefsky said were  
``encouraging'' signs in the standoff between the United States and 
Europe over exports of beef and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be cautious here because we know these two issues  
are difficult for European policy,'' Barshefsky said. ``But there 
seems to be renewed vigor on the part of Europe to reach mutually 
agreeable solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has imposed punitive tariffs on more than $300  
million of European products in retaliation for the 15-nation 
European Union's refusal to abide by WTO decisions involving 
American beef and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodi and Clinton also agreed to coordinate efforts to get  
developing countries committed to the new round of international 
trade negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq To Link to Online Brokerages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors will soon be able to jump directly  
from the Nasdaq Stock Market's Web site to their online brokerage 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	National Association of Securities Dealers Chairman Frank Zarb  
said the Nasdaq's new service, to be called Mybroker, will allow 
the 23.5 million daily visitors to the Nasdaq's Web site to see 
news and the latest stock quotes, then go directly to their online 
trading account via links set up between the Nasdaq and the 
brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said in a speech Wednesday that no date has been set for  
when the service will begin. He said some online brokerage firms 
need time to get their technology connected to the Nasdaq's Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokerage firms that participate in the service will  
benefit by getting the added exposure of being linked to the 
Nasdaq's widely visited site. 
</P>
<P>
	More information will be released in two or three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Zarb detailed a plan announced in June to open a  
Japanese version of the Nasdaq's computerized trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb said the Internet-based system is being designed by  
Japanese banking giant Softbank. He said the move is intended to 
create a partnership with the Japanese, rather than a move to 
compete with existing Japanese exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Nasdaq system will hopefully be the first step in  
creating an interconnected, 24-hour global exchange, Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, the Japanese Nasdaq system would be open to both  
Japanese and American companies that met similar standards 
established by both countries, Zarb said. ``That would allow 
investors to trade large, liquid stocks equally in both markets 
using the same system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a combined U.S. and Japanese Nasdaq would create  
more liquid markets -- meaning more money is circulating -- which 
would attract additional companies to list on the dual exchange, 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statements by Zarb on a Japanese Nasdaq came the same day  
The Wall Street Journal reported that the Nasdaq was also seeking 
to create a linked computerized trading market in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Zarb acknowledged his desire to move into Europe and said he  
hoped all three continents -- the United States, Europe and Asia -- 
would one day be linked by a single computerized trading system.

<HEADLINE> Report: Dan Marino Out 2-3 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino will  
miss 2-3 weeks because of a flareup of a disc in his neck, 
according to a broadcast report. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports News, citing unidentified Dolphins sources, said  
Marino's malady was triggered by the bone spur in his lower neck 
which has idled him for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was in Los Angeles to meet with Dr. Robert Watkins for a  
second opinion on his condition. Watkins has operated on the backs 
of quarterbacks Troy Aikman, Joe Montana and, more recently, Steve 
McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Fox, no surgery is required but Marino will be out  
until at least Nov. 14, when Miami plays Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	With Marino unable to throw effectively, Damon Huard has been  
starting at quarterback for Miami.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Courts S.C. Backers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan  
said Wednesday that leaving the GOP to seek the Reform Party 
nomination has not alienated one of his biggest backers, South 
Carolina textile executive Roger Milliken. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan also courted support at a West Columbia barbecue  
restaurant run by Maurice Bessinger, one of the state's most 
visible Christian conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's positions that include renegotiating the North  
American Free Trade Agreement have the potential of helping textile 
makers and other manufacturers. He said his sister had spoken with 
Milliken, who was not unhappy about the party switch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessinger, a Korean War veteran, also supported Buchanan in his  
failed bid for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. ``He's 
a patriot. He's not going to sell us out like the rest are doing on 
this globalism stuff,'' Bessinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Buchanan shook hands and fielded questions while  
touring a textile plant in Gaffney, where workers asked what he 
would do to help save their jobs through tougher trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you got to say is whatever has been gone from that  
manufacturing base, we are not going to let more of it go. You'd 
have trade policy which was rooted in nationalism and patriotism,'' 
Buchanan said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Courts Michigan Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential contender Pat  
Buchanan says he would still be a Republican if the GOP gave 
Americans a true alternative to Democratic politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talk about a two-party system,'' Buchanan said during a  
Tuesday night fund-raising appearance in this Detroit suburb. 
``What we've got is a one-party establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Republican leaders don't oppose President Clinton and  
congressional Democrats on most issues because they're too 
comfortable with power and perks, Buchanan told about 400 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't fight, and I'm tired of a party that won't fight,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was Buchanan's first full day as a candidate for the  
Reform Party nomination, and he went straight to Macomb County and 
its Reagan Democrats -- voters who supported the former president 
even as they continued to elect and re-elect Democrats further down 
the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Buchanan spoke at Lutheran North High School in  
Macomb Township -- where he first spoke during his unsuccessful 1992 
run for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The former co-host of CNN's ``Crossfire'' and former  
communications director for Reagan won more delegates in Michigan 
than in any other state during his failed 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In his return visit Tuesday, Buchanan focused most of his  
criticism not on Democrats but on the Republican Party to which he 
belonged for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pretend to be two separate parties, battling parties. But  
it is a lot like professional wrestling, where one guy wins one 
night and they go on to another town and the other guy wins,'' 
Buchanan told students, teachers and a handful of supporters at the 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He called Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the  
Republican presidential nomination, a ``redneck cowboy'' who was 
ducking debates with him; poked scornful fun at Reform Party 
founder H. Ross Perot and billionaire developer Donald Trump, his 
potential rival for the Reform nomination; and dismissed the theory 
of evolution as ``preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a student about Trump's critical response to his book,  
``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' Buchanan said: ``He hasn't read my 
book. I'm not sure he read the book he wrote about himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan drew more laughter from the audience when he described  
a visit with Perot: ``I went down to Texas to see him. I didn't 
come out any wiser than when I went in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's combative messages impressed Larry Lilly, 46, of  
Sterling Heights, a real estate broker who attended Tuesday night's 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that he touched on a lot of issues that ought to be  
touched on, but aren't because they're not politically correct,'' 
Lilly said. ``He's a good, God-fearing Christian man. I just think 
he's the man for the job right now.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Has School Voucher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain on Wednesday proposed a $5.4 billion school voucher program 
that would be funded by ending government subsidies for ethanol, 
sugar and the gas and oil industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the three-year pilot program, each state would receive  
money based on the number of children in its public schools. States 
would decide which schools and children would be eligible for the 
program, although the money would be targeted to poor children in 
poorly performing school districts. The $2,000 grants would help 
send children to private schools, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator challenged his rivals for the Republican  
presidential nomination to support his plan. He will face all of 
them except Texas Gov. George W. Bush in a televised forum 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope each candidate in my party who agrees we need choice  
and agrees we need experimentation also agrees we need a way to pay 
for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending ethanol subsidies would provide $1.5 billion for the  
voucher program, McCain said, while $3.9 billion would come from 
phasing out tax credits and subsidies to the oil and gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Eliminating sugar subsidies would add $390 million more, he  
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``These subsidies are an example of the influence of special  
interest in Washington,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethanol -- alcohol distilled from corn and mixed with gasoline --  
is a particularly key campaign issue in Iowa, where the first 
presidential caucuses are held. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who skipped Iowa's summer straw poll and has not focused  
on the state, said his opposition to ethanol goes back far longer 
than his presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the position I take on (ethanol) 17 years ago,'' he  
said. ``I'm convinced many people in Iowa believe as I do that 
ethanol is good for neither the environment nor the consumer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he isn't ruling out increasing his campaign efforts  
in Iowa and expects to make a decision during the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll debate in Iowa, but we're still deciding how much of a  
commitment to make to Iowa,'' he said. ``Our strategy all along has 
been to take a stand here in New Hampshire and South Carolina.''

	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China will cut domestic airline flights  
by nearly 8 percent on Sunday, the second reduction this year to 
reduce excess capacity in the troubled industry, state media said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But international flights will increase nearly 3 percent during  
the next five months to meet rising demand for travel abroad, the 
official Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's airlines expanded rapidly after the breakup of the  
monopoly carrier in the early 1990s, but the increased capacity led 
to heavy losses when a slowing economy cut into air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	The national regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of  
China, cut flights by 5 percent for a three-month period beginning 
May 1 in an attempt to shore up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Wednesday did not say whether the new flight  
reductions were in addition to the earlier cuts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Turns Federal Surplus Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government ended the fiscal year  
with a budget surplus of $123 billion, recording the first 
back-to-back surpluses since Dwight Eisenhower was president, the 
White House announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 followed a  
$69.2 billion surplus in 1998, the first time the government had 
finished in the black since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The two consecutive budget surpluses marked the first time the  
government has managed that feat since 1956 and 1957 during the 
Eisenhower administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the surpluses, the government still has a $5 trillion  
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart disclosed the figures in  
advance of a formal White House event where President Clinton was 
to talk about the administration's economic accomplishments later 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart called the 1999 surplus the largest in U.S. history in  
total dollar terms. As a percentage of the total economy, it is the 
largest surplus since 1951, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton last month had said the administration was looking for a  
surplus of at least $115 billion. That figure was up from a $98.8 
billion projection the administration had made in its mid-session 
budget review in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Trust Fund had a $124 billion surplus last  
year, Lockhart said. But $1 billion of that surplus was spent on 
federal programs; both Democrats and Republicans have promised not 
to spend any of the trust fund surplus this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the president also would note that the national  
debt has been reduced by $138 billion, the largest debt reduction 
on record. He said Clinton would use the occasion to appeal for 
further fiscal discipline in order to eliminate the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done an enormous amount of work to turn this economy  
around, turn our fiscal picture around,'' Lockhart said. ``But 
there is still a lot of work to do.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Decipher Immunity Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In a study that could lead to improvements in organ transplants  
and fighting disease, scientists reported today that they have 
deciphered a part of the human genetic code that plays a key role 
in the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers identified the 3.6 million building blocks of  
DNA in the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC. Genes in the 
complex help immune system cells work together to fight off disease 
and recognize the body's own tissue as friend and not foe. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the entire sequence is known, transplant centers might  
eventually be able to find donor organs that more closely match the 
recipient's genetic code. That might reduce the risk of organ 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a bit hard to overstate the importance of  
understanding this set of genes,'' said Elbert Branscomb, a 
geneticist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
California who was not involved in work. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was reported in today's issue of the journal Nature by  
scientists from the United States, Britain and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have traced many diseases to genes in the MHC -- more  
diseases, in fact, than are linked to any other region of the human 
genetic code. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several reasons for this. The MHC contains a lot of  
genes, about 400, which allows many chances for error. Also, the 
region is easy to inspect for disease-promoting genes. And the 
MHC's job description means flaws in its genes can cripple the 
body's defenses against some germs, or mistakenly prod the immune 
system into causing disease by attacking the body's own tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diabetes is an example. In some forms it's caused when the  
immune system attacks cells in the pancreas,'' said co-author 
Daniel Geraghty, a geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work will help scientists understand diseases brought on  
by a faulty immune system attack and learn how the body can resist 
infectious diseases, researchers said. That could lead to new 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists have been studying the MHC for years, the new  
work shows the region contains more genes than previously thought, 
Branscomb said.

<HEADLINE> EBay 3rd Q Results Top Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Online auction house eBay Inc. posted  
higher quarterly operating profits after it signed up a record 
number of new users and expanded its offerings to include cars and 
art. 
</P>
<P>
	But its stock slumped more than 10 percent this morning as eBay  
also reported late yesterday on rising expenses to expand its 
computer systems. Shares fell $15.37 1/2 to $136.62 1/2 a share at 
midmorning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Sept. 30, San Jose, Calif.-based eBay  
reported net income of $1.35 million, or 1 cent a share. The 
earnings were up from $476,000, or break-even, the comparable 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company took charges during the current quarter for stock  
compensation plans and acquisitions. Excluding those, operating 
income was $3.2 million, or 2 cents a share, compared to $1.8 
million, or 2 cents a share, the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay makes money by charging auctioneers for listings and taking  
a percentage of each sale. The results beat Wall Street 
expectations of 1 cent a share, according to a survey of analysts 
by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported its registered users increased 509 percent  
from the same time last year, to 7.7 million from 1.3 million, with 
a record 2.1 million added in the most recent quarter. The number 
of auctions increased 292 percent to 36.2 million from 9.2 million 
in the previous comparable quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Meg Whitman, eBay's president and chief executive, said the  
company's decision to expand its auction site to include premium 
and high-end items such as collector cars is helping keep it ahead 
of increasing competition who are ``all trying to muscle in on the 
large online market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the recent wave of competitive efforts, I am pleased  
to report that eBay's leadership position remains firm and 
unchallenged,'' she said in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay said it has added staff and redundant computer systems to  
try to prevent outages that have plagued its site. The company also 
is expanding to provide local auctions and service in large 
European markets. Total operating expenses were $46.2 million in 
the latest quarter, compared with $15.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said the company's priority is to secure its network  
against problems, moves that should be completed by the end of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues jumped 169 percent to $58.5 million from $21.7 million.  
The company reported revenue from its auction subsidiaries fell 
during a seasonal lull, while costs of sales and marketing rose. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, eBay reported net income  
of $5.9 million, or 4 cents a share, from $4.6 million, or 4 cents 
a share. Revenues rose to $150.8 million from $55.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Some Opposed to Financial Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and  
President Clinton's top economic adviser met today with Democratic 
congressional lawmakers, some of whom have expressed opposition to 
sweeping legislation, backed by Clinton, that would overhaul 
financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there will be a divided vote'' among Democrats,  
Summers said after the closed-door meeting with House Democrats. 
But he insisted that the legislation would protect consumers' 
financial privacy -- the main concern for one group of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hard-fought compromise ... represents a very significant  
step forward for the American economy and for American consumers,'' 
said Summers, who was accompanied by Gene Sperling, Clinton's 
economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is pushing on with the bill, hoping it soon  
will be enacted by the Republican-controlled Congress. Some 
Democrats opposed to the measure are calling on Clinton to veto it, 
but many others in the House support it. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would lift Depression-era barriers and allow  
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge and sell 
each other's products. The newly affiliated companies would be able 
to share customers' financial data with each other. With the White 
House having lifted its long-standing veto threat and now 
supporting it, the measure is being given the best chance ever of 
adoption after 20 years of battling. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., a leader in the fight on the  
privacy issue, said after today's meeting he was unconvinced by the 
administration officials' defense of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no protection'' for consumers, he said. ``Their  
privacy is now for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told The Associated  
Press he hadn't yet decided whether he would endorse the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey on Tuesday enlisted the aid of Rep. John Dingell of  
Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Commerce Committee, and 
Reps. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., and Bill Luther, D-Minn., in circulating 
among House colleagues a letter to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul legislation ``does not go nearly far enough in  
ensuring that American consumers receive strong privacy 
protections,'' the letter says. ``We do not believe the bill ... 
adequately protects American consumers from the wholesale 
networking of their personal, private information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv had no immediate comment on the  
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would allow banks to share customers' data with  
affiliated financial companies under the same corporate ownership 
but not telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing data is a major reason financial companies want to  
merge, opening numerous opportunities to market a range of products 
and services under one umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, are alarmed at the  
prospect that people's personal financial data could be shared by 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad coalition of consumer groups, privacy advocates, the  
American Civil Liberties Union and Phyllis Schlafly's conservative 
Eagle Forum sent its own letter to Clinton Tuesday urging his veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill fails to give consumers real choice about the  
sharing, selling or using of their personal information among 
(financial) affiliates,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has broken with  
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over the privacy 
issue and said he would vote against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby served notice on Monday that he will try to force changes  
in the privacy provisions and failing that, attempt to derail the 
measure. Under Senate rules, a single senator can hold up action 
for hours or days if he chooses.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Subpoena CBS' Rather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Dan Rather has been subpoenaed to testify  
at the murder trial of the third white man charged in the dragging 
death of a black man. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors want to ask the CBS anchorman about an interview he  
did last month with the defendant, Shawn Allen Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview aired on ``60 Minutes II'' on Sept. 28. In it,  
Berry said that he tried to stop the attack but that he backed off 
when one of his alleged accomplices, John William King, threatened 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Bob Golden approved the subpoena on  
Tuesday, ruling that Rather is a ``material and necessary 
witness.'' The judge ordered the newsman's presence for about two 
weeks, starting Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS attorney Susanna Lowy, contacted by The Lufkin Daily News,  
had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden also ordered CBS producer Mary Mapes to appear Friday  
with outtakes and unedited portions of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Mapes cannot produce any tapes of the interview because  
she has never possessed or controlled the tapes,'' her lawyer, 
Thomas Leatherbury, said, trying to have the subpoena thrown out. 
The judge is set to rule on that request on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry, 24, is accused of chaining James Byrd Jr., 49, to the  
back of a pickup truck last year and dragging him to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	White supremacists King and Lawrence Russell Brewer were  
convicted earlier this year in separate trials and each received a 
death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Fat-Cell Hormone Shows Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A hormone naturally produced in fat cells  
showed promise in helping people lose weight, though a small 
portion of those studied gained weight during a six-month study. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 47 adults injected with varying dosages of the  
hormone leptin lost weight, with those getting higher dosages 
losing the most -- as much as 15.6 pounds on average. 
</P>
<P>
	The study combined exercise and diet with the hormone treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, gained weight, pointing out the need for further  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is no magic bullet,'' lead author Dr. Steven B.  
Heymsfield of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York told 
science reporters Tuesday at a conference of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is possible that scientists may one day be able to  
``switch off appetite,'' Heymsfield said, ``diet and exercise are 
ultimately the mainstay of treatment'' for obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study began with 70 adults, but only 47 lasted through the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said only three people dropped out of the study  
because of adverse reactions -- two had injection site reactions and 
one had heart palpitations.The authors believe patients who 
withdrew did so because they didn't like having to repeatedly 
inject themselves with leptin. Patients who received the highest 
doses were most likely to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	Those on leptin lost from about 1.5 pounds on average for the  
lowest dosage, to 15.6 pounds on average for the highest dosage; 
subjects who received a placebo lost about 3 pounds on average. 
</P>
<P>
	A few gained from about 2 to 10 pounds, apparently because their  
bodies resist leptin, Heymsfield said 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary results of the study were reported last year. The  
study was partly funded by California-based leptin manufacturer 
Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
	Research on humans remains preliminary and clinical use of  
leptin is still years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The study results are ``ambiguous'' because the doses of leptin  
given were relatively high compared to natural levels, the weight 
losses were small, and some people did not respond to the treatment 
at all, an outside leptin researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a glass half full or half empty. ... We don't know if  
these levels and type of leptin are really safe,'' said Dr. Luciano 
Rossetti, professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York. ``This raises both hope and concern at the 
same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leptin is produced by fat cells. It is supposed to signal the  
brain to stop eating but the signal does not get through in some 
overweight people. It is one of at least a half-dozen hormones that 
``tightly regulate'' food intake in animals and probably humans, 
Heymsfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in the study, the highest weight losses involved  
injecting the equivalent of several tablespoons of leptin daily, 
and presumably the hormone would have to be taken for life in order 
to maintain its benefits.

<HEADLINE> Budget Fights Raging on Capitol Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders are bowing to pressure and  
including congressional salaries in their proposed across-the-board 
budget cuts. But they are still hunting the votes they need to push 
the plan through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders decided Tuesday to include lawmakers' pay in the  
reductions after rank-and-file Republicans, President Clinton and 
radio talk-show hosts chided them for not doing so. They now want 
agencies' budgets cut 1 percent, savings they say can come from 
paring federal waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican members of Congress believe that the government can  
find a penny on the dollar in waste, fraud and abuse'' to avoid 
spending Social Security surpluses, said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. ``They also believe that they can set an example by 
shaving back their own pay by the same percentage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers decided last summer to boost their pay next January by  
3.4 percent to $141,300, a $4,600 raise. With the 1 percent 
reduction, their salary would rise to $139,900. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear, however, whether legislators' salaries will ever  
be affected. President Clinton has promised to reject the GOP's 
across-the-board spending reduction, arguing it would be too 
damaging to defense, education and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will veto the across-the-board cut they've  
proposed,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Applying the reduction to lawmakers' pay would save less than $1  
million, a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars in dispute 
between Clinton and Congress in their budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Republicans arguing that federal agencies could afford  
to trim waste from their budgets, their initial exclusion of 
lawmakers' pay had caused them a public relations headache. 
</P>
<P>
	One worry was that unless legislators' salaries were included,  
labor unions might run advertisements contrasting that with the 
GOP's reluctance so far this year to raise the minimum wage, said 
John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans had been pushing a 1.4 percent reduction in federal  
agencies' spending, a cut that would not affect automatic benefits 
such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On Tuesday, they 
were planning to drop that to a 1 percent cut in hopes of picking 
up support from lawmakers unhappy over reductions to defense and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said they had not originally included lawmakers' pay  
in the across-the-board cut because money for their salaries is not 
controlled by the spending bills that finance agency budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders were having other problems in the struggle to  
push their plan through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., was  
demanding that the across-the-board cut not apply to highway 
programs, and other lawmakers were said to be seeking exemptions 
for other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working it, just like anything else,'' said House  
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House GOP's top vote counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans plan to attach the cuts to a $314 billion measure  
financing labor, health and education programs, the biggest and 
last of the 13 annual spending bills for the new fiscal year, which 
began Oct. 1. Also affixed to the bill will be the District of 
Columbia's budget after Clinton vetoed an earlier version. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the bill exceeds Clinton's overall demands for education  
spending, the president plans to veto it because of the 
across-the-board cuts and because it provides little of the $1.4 
billion he wants for hiring new teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, eight of the 13 spending bills for fiscal 2000 have  
become law. Clinton has vetoed three and has yet to act on two

<HEADLINE> Free Encyclopedia Site Still Jammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- So far, Encyclopaedia Britannica's much-touted  
new Web site has been a real bomb.com. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a week after the publisher put all of its volumes on  
the Internet for free, www.britannica.com remained jammed Wednesday 
-- a victim of huge worldwide demand and inadequate hardware and 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	An apology greeted Web users trying to visit the site, with the  
company explaining it is working around the clock to fix the 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive of Britannica.com Inc. acknowledged that the  
problems will take weeks to fix. While many users should be able to 
get in by next week, increasing the system's capacity to ensure it 
can handle millions at once will take longer, said Jorge Cauz, 
senior vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet troubles, at nine days and counting, have marred an  
innovation that had succeeded in drawing attention to the 
struggling publisher as it tries to shake its stodgy image and get 
with the electronic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten million or more hits a day have tied up its site from the  
first day, Oct. 19, causing problems an army of software and 
hardware specialists have been unable to quickly resolve. Only 
100,000 people have reached the first page. 
</P>
<P>
	The company admits it underestimated the early public response.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one in his right mind would have built an infrastructure  
capable of handling the initial demand we had,'' Cauz said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Britannica should have learned a lesson from the many companies  
that haven't anticipated the volume of response, said Emily Meehan 
of the Boston-based Yankee Group. She cited similar problems that 
at one point slowed traffic at auction site eBay and America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Meehan said the rocky debut shouldn't be harmful over  
the long haul because of Britannica's prestigious brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Britannica's printed sets have fallen off by an  
estimated 80 percent since peaking at about $650 million in 1990 as 
knowledge-seekers turn to computer versions, mostly Microsoft's 
Encarta. The Chicago-based Britannica is counting on advertising, 
sponsorship and e-commerce to make the venture pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	The encyclopedia set was first published in 1768 in Scotland. It  
was introduced in the United States in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
	It is still available in the printed version, at $1,250 per set,  
as well as on CD-ROM.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Meet in First Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is getting one of  
the debates he's been demanding against Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley. But Gore's ranking supporter in the leadoff primary state 
said it wasn't likely to change many minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't usually find a smoking gun in a debate,'' Gov.  
Jeanne Shaheen said in an interview Tuesday. ``Not very often are 
they the thing that changes somebody's mind ... particularly this 
early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley meet for an hour tonight at Dartmouth College  
in something short of the head-on debates the vice president wants 
weekly. This one is a televised town hall forum, with the 
candidates answering questions from an audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gore said in advance that the format takes the edge  
off, he didn't scrimp on preparation. He discussed likely questions 
with a team of New Hampshire advisers on Tuesday and was devoting 
much of today to warm-ups. One aim was to get Gore's answers down 
to 90 seconds each. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was preparing, too, after a campaign walk in Hanover.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore issued his debate challenge -- usually the tactic of a  
candidate trying to catch the leader -- during a campaign makeover 
after Bradley began carving into his once overwhelming lead. ``I'm 
campaigning like I'm behind,'' Gore said. ``I'm campaigning like an 
underdog all over the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's making headway in national polls, widening his lead over  
Bradley and narrowing his deficit against Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the prime Republican candidate for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's advisers credit that in part to a more relaxed, less  
rigid campaign style. Outside the State House in Concord on 
Tuesday, he lingered after an anti-drug rally to shake hands, chat 
and slap hands with youngsters as aides tried to usher him to the 
motorcade. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen said the constraints of the vice presidency have been a  
problem for Gore, but that he is getting around them now. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hampshire polls rate Bradley even or narrowly ahead, and  
the vice president said Friday that he probably is behind here in 
the state that will hold the first presidential primary on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got three months left -- that's an eternity,'' Shaheen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there's been a favorable initial reaction to Bradley  
``because he's a new face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little too early to see whether that translates into  
real votes,'' the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Style isn't Gore's only campaign change; he has sharpened his  
line against Bradley, saying the former New Jersey senator is 
running as a ``left-of-center'' insurgent and criticizing him for 
once hinting at running for president as an independent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, attacking is a strategy,'' said Eric Hauser,  
Bradley's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gore has the advantage of experience in campaign  
debates, but Bradley is ready to counter him. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Democrats, five of the six Republican candidates --  
absent the front-running Bush -- will have another turn at debating 
Thursday night. They met last Friday without drawing sharp lines on 
major issues, save for a push on campaign finance reform by Sen. 
John McCain of Arizona, on which he'd just lost in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, conservative activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch  
of Utah and radio commentator Alan Keyes round out the lineup for 
the 90-minute GOP forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush skipped those debates, citing schedule conflicts, but as  
the front-runner he also is unwilling to let the others have at him 
so soon. He has agreed to a debate in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2.

<HEADLINE> Bullpen Keeps Yankees in Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Once again in October, the New York Yankees'  
bullpen kept them in the game long enough for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Three relievers combined for 6 1-3 scoreless innings after Andy  
Pettitte was knocked out and the Yankees came back from four runs 
down to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 in 10 innings Tuesday night and 
take a 3-0 lead in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw Andy struggle a little bit, we knew it was going  
to be one of those games we were going to need a lot of middle 
relief,'' said Jeff Nelson, who pitched two perfect innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like in 1996, when these Yankees won the title, it was the  
bullpen that was the difference against the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pettitte was bounced around for five runs in 3 2-3  
innings, Jason Grimsley, Nelson and Mariano Rivera kept the Braves 
off the scoreboard long enough for the Yankees to tie it on homers 
by Chad Curtis, Tino Martinez and Chuck Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which trailed 5-1 when Pettitte left, eventually won  
it in the 10th on Curtis' second homer. Without the bullpen, Curtis 
never would have gotten the chance to be the hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley, who didn't make the roster for the first two rounds,  
started it with 2 1-3 scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the credit goes to Grimsley,'' Nelson said.  
``He hasn't pitched in a month and he comes in and pitches like he 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson then came in to pitch two perfect innings.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nellie was terrific,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He was really  
the key guy for us in the seventh and eighth innings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera finished the job, pitching the ninth and 10th innings for  
the win. Rivera hasn't allowed a run in 41 2-3 innings since July 
21 and in his last 24 1-3 in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a performance by New York's relievers similar to Game 4  
in 1996, when the Braves took a 5-0 lead after two innings against 
Kenny Rogers. They would add one run in the fifth off David 
Weathers, but that was all Atlanta could muster in eight innings 
off the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored three in the sixth and then tied it in the  
eighth on Jim Leyritz's three-run homer off Mark Wohlers. They won 
it in the 10th when Steve Avery walked Wade Boggs with the bases 
loaded and went on to take the Series 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time Joe Torre takes a guy out of game when we're  
losing, he tells the new pitcher to hold them here and get a win,'' 
Knoblauch said. ``That's the way we have to think. It's not 
cockiness. It's having a great deal of confidence in the guys we 
have on our team to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stingy relief has been the calling card for the Yankees in the  
postseason under Torre. In four postseasons, the bullpen has blown 
only one save and has been the biggest reason the Yankees are one 
win away from becoming the sixth team to win three World Series 
titles in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been no different this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside of Hideki Irabu's disastrous relief outing in Game 3 of  
the AL Championship Series against Boston, the Yankees' bullpen has 
been nearly untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
	The other relievers have allowed two runs in 24 innings, with  
both coming with New York leading 7-0 in the ninth inning of Game 
2.

<HEADLINE> Les Nubians Bring Afropean Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's no sibling rivalry between Helene and  
Celia Faussart, who perform as the African-French duo Les Nubians. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview, younger sister Celia can't get the lid off  
a bottle of ketchup. She doesn't stop talking, she just hands the 
bottle to Helene, who opens it and hands it back. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters talk to one another as much as to the questioner,  
reaching out to touch each other's arms when making a point. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean these ``no quibbling'' siblings don't have  
an occasional disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sisters, of course,'' Helene explained.  
</P>
<P>
	But ``we're pretty similar, that's why we manage to do an album  
together and to have a group,'' said Celia. ``If we were always 
fighting for everything, it would be impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They began performing professionally about five years ago and  
have gained a dedicated following in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Les Nubians combine the hip-hop soul sensibilities of Lauryn  
Hill and Erykah Badu with the world rhythms that reflect their 
international upbringing in Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	They are currently on tour, playing to capacity audiences at  
clubs across the United States. It doesn't seem to matter to their 
American fans that most of the songs on their album, ``Princesses 
Nubiennes,'' are sung in French. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are saying that `We don't know what they're  
saying but we can feel what they're saying,''' Helene, 25, said. 
``They can definitely love the music, the voices, the 
arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second album is under way. The English-language version of  
``Makeda,'' the first single off their album, didn't sell well, so 
they don't feel any push to sing in English. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we are in a position where we can be competitive  
in front of Lauryn, Erykah or whatever,'' Helene said of recording 
in English. ``It's their language. I can't write in English as 
easily as I'm going to do it in French.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helene and Celia, 21, were born in France. Their father is  
French and their mother is Cameroonian. The family moved to Chad 
when Helene was 10 and Celia was 6. When they returned to France 
several years later, they were shocked by the level of ignorance 
people showed about Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were asking me, `In Africa you were living in a  
tree?''' Helene recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The racism toward people of color in France was hurtful to the  
sisters. When reminiscing about France, their father had always 
described his homeland as a country of equality and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say in France, `People are educated, people are  
civilized,' and when I see how they are `civilized,' it makes me 
wonder `where are we going?''' Celia said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Makeda'' is about the Queen of Sheba. It deals with the  
misrepresentation of history, especially the history of the African 
continent. Other songs on the album touch on their mother's village 
in Africa, dealing with the aftermath of an abortion, and there's 
even a remake of Sade's ``Sweetest Taboo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to do music that really looks like us, with our  
personalities, our influences, our experiences. ... We wanted to do 
music that was really moving our souls and our hearts,'' Helene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helene does much of the composing and Celia does much of the  
vocal arrangements. They write their songs either separately or as 
a duo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty (much) in symbiosis,'' said Helene when asked if  
she pulled rank when musical disputes arose. She started to 
elaborate, but stopped when she saw the look on Celia's face. 
</P>
<P>
	``What?'' she asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saying it's true, that sometimes being an older sister,  
you do that,'' Celia responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Does she listen to what her sister has to say?  
</P>
<P>
	``It really depends, sometimes,'' Celia said. ``Sometimes we  
discuss a lot and then I realize I was wrong. ... She cannot be 
right every time, I must be right sometimes, but sometimes I'm 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being together on the road helps them deal with the pressures of  
the music industry and avoid getting caught up in their hype, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are never alone,'' Helene said. ``If your head gets  
bigger, the other one is here to say `calm down.''' 
</P>
<P>
	After this current schedule of shows ends, the sisters will  
return to Europe for more performances and then perhaps tour 
Africa. They plan to be back in the United States by the end of the 
year.

<HEADLINE> Pet Store Recalls Dog Chews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pet store is recalling a brand of  
Canadian-made dog chews because they may be contaminated with 
salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella-tainted treats are not considered a risk for dogs.  
But pet owners who hand their dogs the treats could become infected 
if they then touch their mouths or their own food before thoroughly 
washing their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration already was warning dog  
owners to wash after touching any dog chews made from pork- or 
beef-derived materials, including pig ears, beef jerky and pigskin. 
That is because Canadian health authorities have reported at least 
30 dog owners sickened apparently by salmonella-tainted chews. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wednesday, Pet Valu International Inc. took the additional  
step of recalling certain Rollover brand dog chews from its stores 
in New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. The 
Pennsylvania-based pet chain cited Canadian testing that determined 
that brand, made by Farm Meats Canada Ltd, could be contaminated. 
Pet Valu asked consumers to return recalled chews to the store of 
purchase for a refund or exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalled are the following Rollover products: garlic-flavored  
pig ears bearing UPC code 6076688023; cheese-flavored pig ears, UPC 
6076688022; five-inch chews, UPC 6076688005; lambie chunks, UPC 
6076688102; and dog chew hooves, smoked or plain, sold in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Pet Valu said it sells other dog chews supplied by a different  
manufacturer that are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmonella can cause flulike symptoms in healthy people, but can  
be lifethreatening in the elderly, young children and people with 
weakened immune systems.

</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Unidentified gunmen opened fire today in the  
chamber of the Armenian parliament and some witnesses said there 
were casualties, according to local journalists. The gunmen opened 
fire while Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian was addressing a session 
of the parliament, the journalists said. Several shots were fired, 
they said. Armenia became an independent republic following the 
Soviet collapse in 1991.

	Gore, Bradley To Meet in 1st Debate  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley  
will meet tonight in the first debate between the Democratic 
presidential front-runners. The meeting falls short of what Gore 
had hoped for. The Vice President wanted weekly, head-on debates. 
This one, at Dartmouth College, is a televised town hall forum, 
with the candidates answering questions from an audience. Gore is 
making headway in national polls, widening his lead over Bradley 
and narrowing his deficit against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the 
prime Republican candidate for 2000.

today he intends to reopen a corruption investigation into former 
President Suharto but said the 78-year-old autocrat might 
eventually end up with a pardon or amnesty even if wrongdoing is 
uncovered. New President Abdurrahman Wahid said Suharto should be 
questioned again about his wealth and that Marzuki Darusman is 
entitled to pursue the case. Suharto was Indonesia's authoritarian 
ruler from 1966-98. Critics of his iron-fisted regime accuse him of 
abusing his power to enrich his family and of stashing away 
billions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian jets bombed downtown Grozny today  
in some of the heaviest airstrikes against the Chechen capital 
since federal troops invaded the breakaway republic. It was the 
most serious attack on the city since a rocket strike on a downtown 
market last Thursday killed at least 150 people. President Boris 
Yeltsin said Russian forces would ``destroy the center of 
international terrorism in Chechnya and let people live calmly and 
peacefully.'' Russian troops entered Chechnya in September, with 
the stated mission of wiping out Islamic militants who twice raided 
a neighboring Russian region this summer and are blamed for four 
apartment blasts in Russian cities that killed 300 people.

	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Breaking away from a funeral

today in a third day of protests over the army's shooting of a 
Bethlehem souvenir vendor. Israeli troops responded with tear gas 
and rubber-coated steel pellets. Three demonstrators were hit by 
rubber bullets and two were treated for tear gas inhalation, 
Palestinian paramedics said. The vendor, Mousa Abu Hilail, was 
fatally shot Monday by a soldier near Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish 
shrine revered as the burial site of the biblical matriarch. The 
soldier claimed Abu Hilail had tried to stab him, but Palestinian 
officials have alleged that the soldier opened fire without 
provocation.

three days of low-key protests by members of the banned spiritual 
movement Falun Gong. Group members staged no overt demonstrations 
and were not easily distinguished from the hordes of Chinese 
tourists normally wandering the square. But their presence there in 
defiance of a three-month crackdown against Falun Gong assured that 
they would be arrested, as dozens of others have been in the square

lung cancer in its earliest stages, The New York Times reported 
today. The method, spiral CT scanning, can find lung cancers when 
they are about as small around as a pea. Chest X-rays find lung 
cancers when they are about the size of a quarter. The scanning 
method is so new that doctors are still learning what it can do, 
including whether it can help save lives.

	Yankees Push Braves to Brink  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chad Curtis, making his first start in a World  
Series, hit two home runs, including the game-winner in the 10th 
inning as the New York Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 to take 
a 3-0 lead in the best-of-7 series. No baseball team has ever 
overcome an 0-3 deficit in any playoff series. The Braves knocked 
out Yankees starter Andy Pettitte in the 4th inning with a 5-1 
lead, but New York got home runs from Curtis and Tino Martinez to 
cut the gap to 5-3. Chuck Knoblauch's two-run homer off Tom Glavine 
tied the game in the eighth, and Curtis won it against Mike 
Remlinger leading off the 10th. The Yanks go for their record 25th 
championship tonight.

<HEADLINE> Bears' QB Matthews Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- After missing the last two games with a  
pulled hamstring, Chicago Bears quarterback Shane Matthews ran in 
practice for the first time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring any setback, he plans to play Sunday against the  
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to go,'' he said. ``I'm not 100 percent, but I feel  
like I'm good enough to go out there and play. I'm ready to get 
back into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews' return couldn't come at a better time for the Bears  
(3-4). After upsetting the Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome on 
Oct. 10, Chicago had a two-game winning streak and playoff talk 
didn't seem so farfetched. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Matthews on the sidelines and rookie Cade McNown  
starting, the Bears stumbled. They dropped two straight, and 
Sunday's 6-3 loss to Tampa Bay was ugly enough to bring back 
memories of the Dave Wannstedt days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I could have made a difference, but I don't know  
if that's true or not,'' Matthews said. ``I just want to get back 
to playing. We had a little bit of a rhythm going before the 
injury, and we let a couple of games get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost them, and it's over with,'' he added. ``But we've got  
to get back on the winning track and try to end up the first half 
of our season at 4-4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While McNown has more speed and mobility and can throw further  
downfield than Matthews, he's still a rookie. Matthews may not have 
as much experience as Brett Favre or Brad Johnson, but he's a lot 
more seasoned than McNown. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was injured, Matthews was 111-for-177 (62.7 percent)  
for 1,043 yards. His quarterback rating of 86.9 was third-best in 
the NFC, and tops in the NFC Central. McNown is 45-for-90 for 553 
yards with a 59.2 QB rating and was benched after throwing an 
interception against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane's calm. Things don't rattle him. He understands what  
he's trying to do with the offense and what he's capable of doing 
inside our offense,'' Bears coach Dick Jauron said. ``And he also 
understands what the opponent is trying to do. That doesn't come 
easy in our league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews' absence wasn't the only reason for Chicago's slump.  
Receiver Curtis Conway has been out since the Minnesota game with a 
sprained ankle. He didn't practice Wednesday and probably won't 
play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting Matthews back might give the Bears a spark.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're optimistic that with his return, we will have more  
control of our offense,'' Jauron said. ``It's not meant as a slight 
to Cade or Jim (Miller) at all. Shane's got the most experience at 
the helm, he's got experience in the league and he's a smart guy. 
He understands what we want and what he can do, also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews' return means McNown drops back to No. 2, although  
he'll continue to play a series or two every game. While not 
getting more playing time is always disappointing, McNown said he 
knew his role as the starter was temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like everybody came out and said, 'He's our guy.  
We're going with him,''' McNown said. ``It was like, 'Get in there. 
Do a good job and get better.' But unless you blow everybody's 
socks off, you're going to be back in the same situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And McNown knows he could be right back in the game if Matthews  
reinjures the hamstring. Although he ran in practice, Matthews 
didn't move around as much as he'll probably have to in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't plan to give his gimpy leg that kind of a test before  
Sunday, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of dumb to come out here and run around and reinjure  
it in practice,'' he said. ``If I'm going to reinjure it, it's 
going to be in a game.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Decipher Immunity Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have deciphered a part of the human genetic code that  
plays a key role in the body's immune system, an accomplishment 
that could lead to improvements in organ transplants as well as in 
fighting disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers identified the 3.6 million building blocks of  
DNA in the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC. Genes in the 
complex help immune system cells work together to fight off disease 
and recognize the body's own tissue as friend and not foe. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the entire sequence is known, transplant centers might  
eventually be able to find donor organs that more closely match the 
recipient's genetic code. That might reduce the risk of organ 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a bit hard to overstate the importance of  
understanding this set of genes,'' said Elbert Branscomb, a 
geneticist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 
California who was not involved in work. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature  
by scientists from the United States, Britain and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have traced many diseases to genes in the MHC -- more  
diseases, in fact, than are linked to any other region of the human 
genetic code. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several reasons for this. The MHC contains a lot of  
genes, about 400, which allows many chances for error. Also, the 
region is easy to inspect for disease-promoting genes. And the 
MHC's job description means flaws in its genes can cripple the 
body's defenses against some germs, or mistakenly prod the immune 
system into causing disease by attacking the body's own tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diabetes is an example. In some forms it's caused when the  
immune system attacks cells in the pancreas,'' said co-author 
Daniel Geraghty, a geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work will help scientists understand diseases brought on  
by a faulty immune system attack and learn how the body can resist 
infectious diseases, researchers said. That could lead to new 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	While scientists have been studying the MHC for years, the new  
work shows the region contains more genes than previously thought, 
Branscomb said.

<HEADLINE> Badgers Support Dayne for Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- At 252 pounds, Ron Dayne doesn't look like  
the kind of guy who needs his fighting done for him -- at least not 
on the field. Off the field is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne's coaches and teammates are defending Dayne with vigor as  
the senior tailback tries to pass Ricky Williams' career rushing 
record while Dayne hears negative scrutiny from the national media. 
</P>
<P>
	They say Dayne, whose 1,234 yards rushing this season are more  
than anyone in the nation, has been held to ridiculously high 
expectations this season. When Dayne's quest for the record and the 
Heisman Trophy appeared to be failing, he began receiving criticism 
that usually doesn't fall on a player of his caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron has been built up to be something that nobody is,''  
offensive coordinator and running backs coach Brian White said. 
``And when he doesn't become that, everybody wants to get on him. 
It's ridiculous. This guy is the best running back in the history 
of college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White guarantees that Dayne, who needs 483 yards in Wisconsin's  
last three games, will break the record if he stays healthy. But 
now that Dayne's chances to catch Williams and even contend for the 
Heisman are looking slightly better, the Badgers are still angry 
about the criticisms and labels placed on Dayne. 
</P>
<P>
	Their message, especially vocal because of Dayne's own taciturn  
ways, seems to be this: If you got off the Dayne Train, don't try 
to get back on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every week, somebody seems to find a reason to criticize Ron  
Dayne,'' said coach Barry Alvarez, whose strategies for using Dayne 
also have come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't pay much attention. Ron and I talked about  
this. This guy has proven himself to everyone in the state the last 
four years, so if someone finds criticism, that's up to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne rushed for 214 yards and two touchdowns in Wisconsin's  
40-10 thrashing of Michigan State last Saturday, his best 
performance in an inconsistent season. White was asked if Dayne had 
made a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told him in the locker room that he needs to come out with  
tattoos all over his body and earrings all over his nose and in his 
face,'' White fumed. ``Then he'll make a statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, Dayne's most tireless supporter in the media, took  
particular umbrage at an article in Sports Illustrated labeling 
Dayne as one of the 10 biggest disappointments in college football 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous. That's asinine,'' White said. ``I've said  
for about four weeks that it has been a travesty how he has been 
perceived by the national press. An absolute travesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne has been criticized as too big, too injury-prone and too  
likely to disappear in big games, as he did by gaining no yards in 
the second half of the Badgers' loss to the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
	That rankles people in Madison, who see Dayne as a treasure,  
even a symbol of the Badgers' football rebirth under Alvarez. As 
the most prominent player to suit up for Wisconsin since Alan 
Ameche in the 1950s, Dayne is revered at his school, and attacks on 
him are seen as attacks on the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
	In its game-day press release for Wisconsin's game against  
Michigan State, the school listed an entire page of purported 
misconceptions about Dayne, entitled ``What's Myth and What's 
Fact?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne entered the season needing 1,717 yards to break Williams'  
career rushing record. The Badgers play Northwestern, Purdue and 
Iowa in the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People around here are angry about what's been said about  
Ron,'' offensive lineman Casey Rabach said. ``We know what Ron can 
do. We're just going to keep going out there and doing it.''

<HEADLINE> Fat-Cell Hormone Shows Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A hormone naturally produced in fat cells  
showed promise in helping people lose weight, though a small 
portion of those studied gained weight during a six-month study. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 47 adults injected with varying dosages of the  
hormone leptin lost weight, with those getting higher dosages 
losing the most -- as much as 15.6 pounds on average. 
</P>
<P>
	The study combined exercise and diet with the hormone treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, gained weight, pointing out the need for further  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really is no magic bullet,'' lead author Dr. Steven B.  
Heymsfield of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York told 
science reporters Tuesday at a conference of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is possible that scientists may one day be able to  
``switch off appetite,'' Heymsfield said, ``diet and exercise are 
ultimately the mainstay of treatment'' for obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study began with 70 adults, but only 47 lasted through the  
study. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said only three people dropped out of the study  
because of adverse reactions -- two had injection site reactions and 
one had heart palpitations.The authors believe patients who 
withdrew did so because they didn't like having to repeatedly 
inject themselves with leptin. Patients who received the highest 
doses were most likely to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	Those on leptin lost from about 1.5 pounds on average for the  
lowest dosage, to 15.6 pounds on average for the highest dosage; 
subjects who received a placebo lost about 3 pounds on average. 
</P>
<P>
	A few gained from about 2 to 10 pounds, apparently because their  
bodies resist leptin, Heymsfield said 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary results of the study were reported last year. The  
study was partly funded by California-based leptin manufacturer 
Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
	Research on humans remains preliminary and clinical use of  
leptin is still years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The study results are ``ambiguous'' because the doses of leptin  
given were relatively high compared to natural levels, the weight 
losses were small, and some people did not respond to the treatment 
at all, an outside leptin researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a glass half full or half empty. ... We don't know if  
these levels and type of leptin are really safe,'' said Dr. Luciano 
Rossetti, professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York. ``This raises both hope and concern at the 
same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leptin is produced by fat cells. It is supposed to signal the  
brain to stop eating but the signal does not get through in some 
overweight people. It is one of at least a half-dozen hormones that 
``tightly regulate'' food intake in animals and probably humans, 
Heymsfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in the study, the highest weight losses involved  
injecting the equivalent of several tablespoons of leptin daily, 
and presumably the hormone would have to be taken for life in order 
to maintain its benefits.

<HEADLINE> Injured Cards' Dye Visits Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- After six operations and 70 days in a  
Flagstaff hospital, Ernest Dye made a surprise appearance at the 
Arizona Cardinals' headquarters on Wednesday and talked about his 
recovery from the car accident that crushed his right arm and ended 
his football career. 
</P>
<P>
	He immediately displayed the sense of humor that has so  
impressed those around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked them yesterday how much it would cost to get a bionic  
hand to fit in here,'' he said. ``It would save me some time and 
trouble. I don't know if insurance would cover that, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye said he feels lucky to be alive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's most definitely put a change over me,'' he said. ``I got  
a lot closer with my kids. I realize how much my family means to 
me. It happened so quick. It's like we could leave here and be 
driving down the street and `boom' it would be all over with. 
That's pretty much the way this was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big offensive tackle and two of his teammates, Lester Holmes  
and Carl Simpson, were traveling back to training camp in Flagstaff 
Aug. 16 when their car went off rain-slickened Interstate 17 and 
overturned several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes and Simpson weren't seriously injured, but the 335-pound  
Dye was thrown through the windshield and his right arm was crushed 
to the point that doctors feared it would have to be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the accident happened, I was asleep and I think Carl was  
asleep, too,'' Dye said. ``When we opened our eyes, we were 
sliding. We didn't know what was happening. Before I knew it, we 
had spinned around backwards and I guess we started flipping from 
there. When I woke up, I was outside the car lying face-down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said doctors later indicated that those moments at the  
accident scene nearly cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
	`They got real scared and I got scared, too. I ain't going to  
tell you no lie,'' Dye said. ``They said the worst part in the 
whole accident was lying out there waiting for the ambulance to 
come because a lot of infection went through my body. My white 
blood cell count got real low, and I came real close to dying at 
that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1993 first-round draft pick out of South Carolina, Dye plans  
to attend Sunday's game between the Cardinals and New England 
Patriots. He has come to terms with the fact that his playing 
career is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat out last season, but I had the intentions of coming  
back,'' he said. ``Now I haven't got any intention of coming back, 
so it's kind of like a permanent state. This is where I'm going to 
be at with the NFL -- I'm going to watch, unless I decide to try to 
get into coaching or something. I ain't sad about it or nothing 
like that, but that's pretty much the disposition now. I've got to 
get used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He must get up early each day to go to a clinic to have the  
dressing changed on his arm. Later, there will be physical 
rehabilitation. So far, he hasn't regained much feeling in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even really explain it,'' he said. ``Sometimes it  
feels like I can feel something, sometimes it doesn't. It's kind of 
in between right now. One time I thought I was feeling hot and 
cold, and if you poke it, I can feel that a little bit. But the 
blood's been circulating and the scar's been healing on my hand, so 
that's good. It's still warm. It ain't cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye was released from the hospital on Monday. He's back in his  
Phoenix home with his wife, Rhonda, daughter Ariel, 4, and son 
Ernest Jr., 2. He plans to catch up on the movies he's missed, 
starting with a trip to see ``The Best Man'' on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than that, his future plans are uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a million things going through my head,'' he said.  
``I've got a music studio -- a production studio -- and I've got some 
new talent that I really haven't put out there yet. I'm so close to 
Hollywood, I think I might get into acting. There's a whole bunch 
of stuff going through my head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care, man. I've got one life to live, and I realize  
that now, and I'll try anything.''

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Reveals Stiff Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Air Canada disclosed Wednesday it would have to  
pay stiff penalties -- as much as $169 million in the first year 
alone -- if it leaves the Star Alliance of United Airlines and 
Lufthansa for rival Oneworld of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty provision was part of a 10-year deal Air Canada  
signed last week with the Star Alliance to help fight off a hostile 
takeover bid by Onex Corp., one of Canada's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex, which is backed by American Airlines, insists the  
penalties are a ``poison pill'' designed to thwart its offer to 
merge Air Canada with Canadian Airlines to create a single national 
airline linked with the Oneworld alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada shareholders are scheduled to vote on the $1.2  
billion Onex offer on Nov. 8. To try to block the takeover, Air 
Canada has offered a $628 million package that includes buying back 
35 percent of the airline's shares at a premium price. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report to Canadian securities officials Wednesday, Air  
Canada for the first time revealed the penalties it would incur if 
Onex takes it over and breaks the agreement with the Star Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada said in the event it withdrew from the alliance, it  
agreed to pay liquidated damages to (United) and Lufthansa in 
amounts declining over a 10-year period. from a maximum of $169 
million the first year to $25 million if it pulls out after January 
1, 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines and Lufthansa have offered financial backing  
worth more than $450 million for Air Canada's package, which 
includes the purchase of rival Canadian Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has agreed to refund up to $57 million to United and  
Lufthansa if it cannot buy Canadian and bring it into the Star 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex is reportedly considering increasing its offer in response  
to the Air Canada package announced last week. The corporation 
controls a variety companies, including Sky Chefs airline catering, 
Lantic Sugar Ltd. and American Buildings Co.

<HEADLINE> Army Taps National Guard for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army said Wednesday it has scheduled three  
National Guard divisions to rotate with active duty divisions in 
commanding U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement is designed to make more use of reserve forces  
and increase their combat readiness while easing some of the 
peacekeeping burden on the active duty force. Army forces have been 
on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia since 1995 and there is no end in 
sight to the NATO-led mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservists have been on duty in Bosnia from the start. But now,  
for the first time, the Army is putting a National Guard division 
in charge of a combined ``team'' of active and reserve units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army had announced it would send Texas' 49th Armored  
Division in March 2000 to command a combined team of active duty 
and reserve forces in Bosnia in March 2000. On Wednesday, it 
announced a longer-term schedule that added two other National 
Guard divisions for command duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment of the 49th Armored Division will mark the first  
time since the Korean War that a National Guard division has served 
in a contingency operation and commanded its own battalions, the 
Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 2000, the 3rd Infantry Division, an active duty unit  
from Fort Stewart, Ga., will command U.S. peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia, including a battalion task force made up of companies from 
the 30th Infantry Brigade of the North Carolina National Guard and 
the 45th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 2001, the 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland and  
Virginia National Guard will take over the command. It will be 
teamed with companies from the 10th Mountain Division from Fort 
Drum, N.Y., and the 155th Armor Brigade of the Mississippi National 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky., will take  
over as the active-duty headquarters in charge in April 2002, and 
will be teamed with companies from two National Guard units from 
Idaho, the 116th Armor Brigade and the 76th Infantry Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	From October 2002 to April 2003, the 28th Infantry Division of  
the Pennsylvania National Guard will be in command. It will be 
teamed with elements of the active duty 3rd Infantry Division from 
Fort Stewart, Ga.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Flu Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *By LAURAN NEERGAARD    	
</P>
<P>
                         *AP Medical Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flu sufferers won their first effective pill  
against both types A and B flu Wednesday as the Food and Drug 
Administration approved Tamiflu. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill, manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche, helped reduce the  
duration and severity of flu symptoms in unvaccinated adults who 
agreed to be infected with influenza to test the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision means flu sufferers this year have two new  
treatment choices. The FDA earlier approved an inhaled flu drug 
called Relenza that also works against both A and B flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Older flu medicines worked against only the type A flu, which  
accounts for about two-thirds of the estimated 20 million U.S. flu 
cases yearly, and doctors have said those medicines didn't work 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu is not a cure-all, the FDA warned. Studies showed taking  
the drug helped patients recover only about a day earlier than flu 
patients who took a dummy pill, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	To get that benefit, patients took Tamiflu within 40 hours of  
the first flu symptom -- meaning patients would have to recognize 
flu symptoms and get to the doctor to get the prescription-only 
drug rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Side effects included nausea, vomiting, bronchitis, trouble  
sleeping and dizziness, FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health experts stress that neither Tamiflu nor the competing  
Relenza flu treatments are a substitute for a flu vaccine. The flu 
kills about 20,000 Americans a year, a toll the government says 
could be decreased if more people got their flu shots in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu vaccination is most recommended for people over 64 --  
although one doctors' group now recommends the shots starting at 
age 50 -- as well as anyone with chronic heart or lung problems or a 
weak immune system, and anyone in close contact with high-risk 
patients, including relatives and caregivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have welcomed more treatment choices because so many  
Americans don't get vaccinated. In addition, flu vaccine isn't 
always perfect, so treatments like Tamiflu or Relenza might be 
useful during flu outbreaks in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said Tamiflu has not yet been proved to prevent flu.  
</P>
<P>
	But a study published in Thursday's edition of the New England  
Journal of Medicine suggested it might reduce the chances of 
catching flu if unvaccinated people took it daily during flu 
season, which runs from November through April. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, was given to 520

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Spar in N.H. Debate </HEADLINE>

<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Pressed in campaign debate about President  
Clinton's personal behavior, Al Gore said Wednesday night he shared 
the public's disappointment and anger over the Monica Lewinsky 
affair and sought to provide ``as much continuity and stability'' 
as possible during the impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend,'' the vice president said of Clinton, fielding  
the first question from a voter in the first debate with 
presidential campaign rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, too, was pressed on a potential campaign softspot,  
Gore's criticism of his Senate retirement in 1996 at a time when 
Republicans had taken control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things I wanted to do I couldn't do in the Senate,'' he  
said, referring to stops at Stanford, in the private sector and at 
Notre Dame. In a gentle jab at Gore, who has been in government 
continuously since 1976, Bradley said that by leaving office, he 
had been able to ``encounter people where they live their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a followup poke, he added, ``If you're going to do this, you  
ought to deal with the big problems and you ought to have big 
solutions to big problems.'' Clinton often has been criticized for 
advocating bite-size solutions to problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley sat on stools in a Dartmouth College auditorium  
for the 60-minute debate, co-sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV. The 
first primary election ballots of the 2000 campaign will be cast in 
New Hampshire in February, and the polls show Bradley with a lead, 
having overcome Gore's enormous early advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore sought to take the offensive 15 minutes before the  
television cameras were switched on -- and again as the scheduled 
hour was wrapping up, when he said he would gladly remain to answer 
any remaining questions. 
</P>
<P>
	He took questions for more 90 minutes after the TV lights dimmed  
and Bradley departed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage for introductions, the vice president turned to the  
audience and said: ``What do we do now? ... Why don't you start 
asking some question while we're waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, members of the audience did.  
</P>
<P>
	The first question was about bipartisanship, and both pledged to  
work with Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few moments into the debate, Gore was asked about  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward  
President Clinton, and I felt it myself. I also feel that the 
American people want to move on and turn the page and focus on the 
future and not the past,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend. I took an oath under the Constitution to serve  
my country through thick and thin, and I interpreted that oath to 
mean that I ought to try to provide some -- as much continuity and 
stability during the time that you're referring to as I possibly 
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also noted there were ``some real hard fights'' on economic  
and other issues at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rivals pledged their support to an overhaul of campaign  
finance laws, to reduce the role of big money. And they agreed, in 
general terms, about the need to expand health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	On military involvement overseas, Bradley advocated a United  
States role -- but not ``full responsibility'' -- in multilateral 
groups like the United Nations and NATO. ``There is no way we have 
the resources or the wisdom to be involved in all 32 ethnic wars in 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to identify his biggest mistake, Gore replied sheepishly,  
``My choice of words when I claimed to have taken the lead in the 
Congress for inventing the Internet'' -- a comment that earned him 
ridicule from Republicans and standup comics alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe the characteristics of effective leadership,  
Gore said, a president must have a ``vision of the future'' and 
feel compelled to strive towards it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said ``absolute integrity'' is essential.  
</P>
<P>
	The debate rules weren't designed for the two men to address one  
another directly. 
</P>
<P>
	But at one point, Bradley took issue with a claim about his  
health insurance proposal that Gore had made. ``I dispute the cost 
figure that Al has used,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spoke emphatically about his support for gay rights.  
</P>
<P>
	``I support gays being able to serve openly in the military. If  
gays can serve openly in the White House, in Congress, in the 
courts, in the Treasury Department ... why can't they serve in the 
military?'' he asked. ``It just doesn't make any sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gore got a similar question, he said Bradley's answer had  
been eloquent, then followed up by saying he supports legal 
protection for same-sex domestic partnerships, but ``not the same 
sacrament, not the same name,'' as marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the television audience was problematic -- the show  
was aired at the same time as Game 4 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign put a full-court press on Bradley, providing  
itemized, written rebuttals to his answers during the debate and 
dispatching three Cabinet members to tout his performance to 
reporters afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Hauser, Bradley's press secretary, spoke for the former New  
Jersey senator, saying his candidate had been responsible and 
direct, and that the numbers Gore used in criticizing his health 
care proposal were suspect. ``On budget issues the vice president 
has no credibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore advisers cautioned him before the debate to avoid appearing  
too negative, though he was poised to seize on any question that 
gave him an opening to question Bradley's proposals or commitment 
to the party. Bradley's team had him ready to respond if Gore went 
on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate was held in the context of new Democratic polling  
that underscored Bradley's surge. A Quinnipiac College survey 
released Tuesday showed him leading Gore 47 percent to 39 percent 
in New Hampshire, just outside the margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has pulled even in New York and has narrowed the vice  
president's lead in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Two polls released Wednesday showed that Bradley trails Gore  
nationally, though he has gained ground since July and April, 
respectively. Other polls suggest that Gore has slowed his slide in 
national polls this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president had expressed no interest in debating until  
Bradley dashed his hopes for an easy primary contest. Gore now says 
he wants to debate weekly, though the campaigns have agreed on only 
a handful of dates before the first votes are cast in Iowa's Jan. 
24 caucuses.

<HEADLINE> Panel Questions NATO Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and its European allies  
should do more to help Russia avoid becoming ``a failed state,'' 
including help in safeguarding its nuclear arsenal, the prospective 
new NATO commander said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, nominated by President Clinton to  
replace Army Gen. Wesley Clark as supreme allied commander in 
Europe, told a Senate confirmation hearing that Russia's economic 
decline poses one of the biggest challenges to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that we do not just wish the problem away,''  
Ralston told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston, now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is  
considered close to Defense Secretary William Cohen. Cohen stood by 
Ralston when his nomination for the top Joint Chiefs job sank two 
years ago over his admission of a long-ago affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject of the affair did not come up at Wednesday's  
confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who ran the 78-day NATO air campaign to drive Serb forces  
from Kosovo, is leaving in April, two months earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said the  
announcement in July that Clark would leave early caused ``some 
confusion about that process and misunderstanding, particularly 
abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston repeated the administration's position that the early  
job change was driven by a bureaucratic quirk and was not a slap at 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	His present term at the Pentagon expires Feb. 29 and by law he  
must assume another four-star position within 60 days -- or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralston said that he had worked closely with Clark over the  
years and ``in my judgment, he has served this nation extremely 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark argued strenuously to keep open the option of using ground  
troops in Kosovo, although the Pentagon ruled it out. He chafed at 
the graduated air campaign dictated by the 19-member NATO alliance, 
saying he felt hamstrung. 
</P>
<P>
	That made him popular with Warner, who had advocated a more  
aggressive prosecution of the war, but often put him at odds with 
Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think General Clark did a superb job of keeping 19 nations  
together,'' Ralston said. In the end, ``We had 19 nations that were 
hanging together. That was a major factor in getting the successful 
outcome that we got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about biggest threats now facing NATO, Ralston put dealing  
with an economically and socially weakened Russia high on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	He voiced support for increased international security  
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Ralston said NATO allies should be encouraged to  
join U.S. efforts to help Russia in making sure its aging arsenal 
of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction ``remains safe and 
secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do everything we can to make sure Russia does not  
become a failed state,'' Ralston said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the current situation in Russia is impairing the  
nation's military, affecting readiness, morale and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Worsening conditions could ``pose the added dilemma that as  
conventional capabilities erode, they will rely more on their 
nuclear forces,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also conducted confirmation hearings for Air Force  
Gen. Richard B. Myers, to replace Ralston as vice chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs; Army Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz to command allied forces 
in South Korea; and Air Force Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart to be 
commander of the U.S. space command. 
</P>
<P>
	All the military nominations were expected to win Senate  
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz told the panel he did not believe allegations of a  
Korean War massacre of civilians by U.S. soldiers had poisoned 
relations between U.S. forces there now and South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a theater that we fought together, bled together. I  
think everybody understood the contest in which that all took 
place,'' Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 30, The Associated Press reported accounts by American  
veterans, corroborating those of South Korean villagers, that their 
unit killed hundreds of civilians at No Gun Ri, South Korea, during 
the early days of the 1950-53 war. A subsequent AP report said the 
Army a short time later destroyed two strategic bridges as South 
Korean refugees streamed across, killing hundreds of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work through this, we will study it, we'll find the  
facts, and we'll do the right thing as a result,'' said Schwartz.

<HEADLINE> White House Drug Adviser Raps IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The White House drug adviser on  
Wednesday derided as ``crazy'' the IOC's plan for a drug agency. He 
said the proposal shows the organization has yet to change its 
autocratic ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, head of the U.S. drug policy office, spoke at  
the European Union's headquarters in support of an independent 
agency to combat the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IOC agency, which could start as early as Nov. 10,  
would undercut democratic decision-making and the input of 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nuts,'' he said in an interview with The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six nations are to discuss drugs and sports at meetings  
in Australia on Nov. 14-17. McCaffrey said that would be the ideal 
time to discuss a drug agency. He called the IOC's plans to preempt 
that meeting unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's crazy,'' he said. ``It's not the way we work in  
the international community. We consult, we listen to each other's 
viewpoints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Olympic corruption and bribery scandal broke last  
winter, the EU and the United States have been highly critical of 
the IOC and its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC contends it does not intend to monopolize the new  
agency, which is to supervise worldwide drug testing and policy. 
The Olympic group says it has requested only three of the 24 seats 
on the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such assurances, McCaffrey says he won the backing of  
the EU to keep the agency out of the IOC's grasp as much as 
possible. The EU has said it will try to remove the agency as soon 
as possible from the IOC's home base of Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's stinging criticism dampened hopes the IOC and its  
critics were finally reconciling differences. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the EU had not even seen the draft of the drug  
agency's medical code. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the agency starts in November, McCaffrey wants the  
governments to listen to the outcome of the drug meetings in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey met with the EU commissioner responsible for sports,  
Viviane Reding, who will meet with Samaranch on Tuesday in an 
attempt to bring both sides closer. 
</P>
<P>
	The governments and sports organizations still have to discuss  
funding for the agency. The EU nations have been unable to propose 
a site for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	There are seven candidates: Athens, Greece; Bonn, Germany;  
Lille, France; Lisbon, Portugal; Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; and 
Vienna, Austria.

<HEADLINE> Series Win Is Sweet for Torre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Torre knew coming back was right the first  
time he realized the knot in his stomach had more to do with the 
fear of losing a baseball game than his battle with cancer. And 
Wednesday night, for the first time in months, he didn't have to 
worry about either. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy since May and manager of the world champions for the  
third time in four years, Torre hung back in the dugout for a few 
moments after the last out of a 4-1 win disappeared into left 
fielder Chad Curtis' glove. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, he made his way up the steps and into that waving,  
screaming, joyous jumble of players on the pitcher's mound, 
disappearing into the middle of a celebration that would have been 
impossible without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put into words,'' Torre said, ``what this feels  
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Measured by numbers, this season was less impressive than last.  
The Yankees won fewer regular-season games, scored less and gave up 
more runs. But measured by the adversity they overcame to reach the 
pinnacle of the game a second straight year, this one was more 
impressive. Much more. 
</P>
<P>
	Their tribulations began early in spring training, when Torre  
was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and didn't end with the last 
game. Right fielder Paul O'Neill played that one with a heavy 
heart, having lost his father, Charlie, to a continuing heart 
problem some 18 hours earlier. Those were the bookends, but hardly 
the only misfortunes these Yankees had to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, reserve infielder Luis Sojo left the club to  
take the body of his father, Ambrosio, back to Venezuela for 
burial. Last month, it was Scott Brosius, returning to Oregon to 
bury his father, Maury. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the New Yorkers had to find a way to bring wayward  
native son Darryl Strawberry back into the fold, to honor two 
fallen heroes -- Joe DiMaggio and Catfish Hunter -- from their past 
and honor that glorious tradition by doing more than wearing 
commemorative patches on their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	But through it all, they never took their eyes off the prize.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of emotion on this club this year,'' Torre  
began before paying tribute to the sons among them who had lost 
fathers and played on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will never be another first,'' he continued, ``but even  
after what we accomplished last year, I think this might be a 
better team -- only because we had to do it again to validate last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like that edition, this year's was a team you had to admire.  
</P>
<P>
	It was self-assured, yet loaded with guys who never quit  
striving. There was only one real personnel change, a swap of 
starters, in which Roger Clemens replaced David Wells; otherwise, 
it was complete and harmonious enough that even George Steinbrenner 
knew to stay out of its way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mentally tough team that depicts New York,'' The Boss  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a particularly appropriate salute, since the two times  
Steinbrenner was tempted to meddle -- threatening to unload starter 
Andy Pettitte and reliever Ramiro Mendoza, both of whom figured 
prominently in the postseason -- Torre stood up to him, backed by 
general manager Brian Cashman and chief scout Gene Michael. 
</P>
<P>
	And a willingness to take on The Boss wasn't the only thing  
different about the Yankees since Torre took over in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, they bought the highest-priced talent and couldn't  
quite put it together,'' Braves Game 4 starter and loser John 
Smoltz said admiringly. ``But now, the last three or four years, 
there's no selfishness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The glue all along was Torre. He had more veterans than lineup  
spots to fit them into, a rehab project like Strawberry to work 
back into the mix and a fire-breathing owner to keep at arm's 
length. 
</P>
<P>
	And then came something to make the balancing act even tougher:  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Torre got through the pressure of chasing the  
World Series by focusing on the plight of his older brother Frank, 
a former big-leaguer who was awaiting a heart transplant. That 
story had a happy ending. At the start of this year, the tables 
were turned. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he found out about his cancer, I was flat on my back in  
the hospital with a setback I had with my new heart,'' Frank, in 
town for the series, recalled the other day. ``The first call I got 
was from Joe. That's the way he is; he didn't want me to hear about 
it first from the TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Torre returned to the club in mid-May, he picked up right  
where he left off. Somehow, he got his starters to accept sitting 
on the bench some days, and he kept his role players confident 
enough to step in at the big moments. In short, he kept everybody 
on the club happier most of the time than they had a right to be. 
</P>
<P>
	And no one realized how special this campaign was more than  
Clemens, who outdueled Smoltz on Wednesday night to win his first 
World Series game and ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I finally know what it's like to be a Yankee. You talk about  
heavy hearts and guys who are warriors,'' he paused, ``I just feel 
very blessed to be part of this bunch.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Plant Emissions Up Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For the third consecutive year, emissions from the  
14 oldest power plants across New England increased, according to a 
report issued Wednesday by a coalition of environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were especially disturbing to environmentalists  
because the emissions decreased in the first half of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've eroded half the gains we've made, if not a little  
more,'' said Rob Sargent, spokesman for MassPIRG. 
</P>
<P>
	Old plants don't have to meet the same emissions standards as  
new plants because of a loophole in the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows emissions from New England's oldest plants in  
the first half of 1999 have increased 5.5 percent for sulfur 
dioxide, 3.6 percent for nitrogen oxide and 4.7 percent for carbon 
dioxide, compared to the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sargent has spent a good part of the last three years organizing  
demonstrations against the dirtiest power plants. Lately, political 
leaders have begun to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The six New England states and New York sent a petition Tuesday  
to the federal Environmental Protection Agency asking for stiffer 
emission regulations to fight acid rain. And several states have 
plans to clean up their dirty plants.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Seeks Better Race Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley has placed improving  
race relations at the center of his campaign for the White House, 
highlighting a career in professional basketball and calling racial 
unity ``the defining moral issue of our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his appeal seems not to be resonating among one seemingly  
ripe audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous polls show Vice President Al Gore holding a bigger lead  
over Bradley among black voters than among Democrats overall. One 
recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press 
gave Gore a 3-1 lead among black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew center, said the results are  
not surprising because black voters generally are loyal Democrats -- 
and loyal Democrats support the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a trend that still could change,'' Kohut said, ``but  
we don't see any sign of that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been endorsed by 20 of the 38 members of the  
Congressional Black Caucus; Bradley by none. And Bradley's proposal 
to expand Civil Rights Act protections to gay Americans drew 
criticism from black leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and 
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who said reopening the landmark 1964 
law would be risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign spokesman Eric Hauser predicted that Bradley's ``depth  
of commitment to racial justice'' will produce support from people 
of all races -- eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in most parts of the country are still getting to know  
him,'' Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stump, Bradley often talks of his own experiences with  
race, including how his Little League team in Crystal City, Mo., 
couldn't stay at certain hotels because some of the players were 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	He pledged that, as president, he would evaluate federal  
employees on the basis of ``how your department or agency has 
furthered tolerance and racial understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say there is no doubt about Bradley's commitment to  
improving race relations, but critics question why he didn't do 
more during his 18 years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made some memorable speeches on race on the floor and, I  
believe, is respected by African-Americans as sincerely committed 
on race. (But) he is not remembered for spearheading legislation,'' 
said District of Columbia Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a nonvoting 
House Democrat who backs Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``Gore has proved that he's there when the going gets  
tough. This is a man from the South who was not afraid to be a 
leader on civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One problem for Bradley is that he often chose to pursue his  
interest in race relations in small settings, sometimes even in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
	He traveled to a Chicago public housing project in 1987 after  
reading a series of Wall Street Journal articles on Lafeyette 
Walton, a black 12-year-old struggling to survive the atmosphere of 
violence and despair. Squeezing his 6-foot-5-inch frame into a 
child-sized chair, Bradley talked to mothers about what it was like 
raising their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, then a senator from New Jersey, was accompanied by a  
single aide on the visit to the Henry Horner Homes. He held no news 
conference afterward, and made no speech. 
</P>
<P>
	As a New York Knick, Bradley refused commercial endorsements in  
part because of discomfort about being hailed as basketball's 
``great white hope.'' Between basketball seasons, he worked for the 
Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington and the Urban League 
street academies in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Bradley's prominent black backers say the candidate's  
own history of grappling with race is more important than any 
political pronouncement or legislative initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornel West, a professor of Afro-American studies and philosophy  
of religion at Harvard University, said Bradley ``understands that 
listening and being open to others is part and parcel of 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's campaign compiled a list of his Senate efforts related  
to civil rights, including his opposition to the nominations of 
Robert Bork and William Rehnquist to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of his Senate record on race consisted of speeches in  
his third and final term. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Senate floor in 1992, Bradley rapped a pencil against the  
lectern 56 times to dramatize the beating of black motorist Rodney 
King by Los Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	As a presidential candidate, Bradley repeatedly has told the  
story of wincing at racist comments uttered by a beloved aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pledge that it will be your generation that will put these  
stupid attitudes behind us,'' he told college students during an 
April speech on race in New York City.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose moderately Thursday  
morning, helped by gains on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 69.35  
points, or 0.40 percent, to 17,451.75 at the end of the morning 
session. On Wednesday, the average closed down 289.43 points, or 
1.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.16 yen, down 0.16 yen from late Wednesday  
and marginally below its late New York level of 104.17 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, prices opened higher Thursday as players were  
encouraged by a sharp rise in U.S. stocks Wednesday in New York. 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 92.76 points to close at 
10,394.89. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in Tokyo came as market players were awaiting the  
release of U.S. gross domestic product data for the July-September 
quarter, due out later Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 4.94 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,528.32. The 
TOPIX closed down 19.71 points, or 1.28 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed in a narrow range as  
traders remained apprehensive over possible dollar-buying 
intervention by Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's administrative vice finance minister, Nobuaki Usui, said  
Thursday morning that Japanese finance authorities will take firm 
steps in the foreign exchange market if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been gaining ground against the greenback in recent  
trading sessions on expectations that the Japanese government will 
spend a significant amount of money to buoy the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have said the government will submit a second  
supplementary budget in the upcoming parliamentary session, which 
begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Total spending in the package is estimated at between $95.2  
billion and $123.8 billion, according to Japanese news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.55 yen, down  
from 110.69 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8400 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8300 percent. Its 
price fell 0.09 point to 99.65.

<HEADLINE> Military Readiness Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A smaller and busier U.S. military remains  
ready to fight in two major foreign battles at the same time, but 
with an increased risk in the potential second conflict, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take longer to respond to hostilities which, in turn,  
means territory lost and an increased potential for casualties,'' 
the chiefs' chairman, Army Gen. Henry Shelton, said Tuesday at a 
Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing on the readiness of the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, in three hours of testimony flanked by the chiefs of  
the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines, said officers rate the risks 
of fighting a single conflict as ``moderate,'' a second conflict as 
``high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This does not mean that U.S. forces would not prevail in  
either contingency,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ascribed the increased risk to diminished readiness in both  
strength of U.S. forces and the condition of their equipment. 
Difficulties in recruiting and in getting personnel to stay in the 
military are major factors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent increases in outlays for the military should begin to  
solve the problems, Shelton said, but all five chiefs complained of 
budgets that fall billions of dollars short of needs to maintain a 
ready, modern force. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that the force is much smaller than it was a  
decade ago, and also much busier,'' Shelton said. The total force 
is down 40 percent, yet faces increased requirements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A major challenge cited by all four service chiefs is how to  
increase the number of soldiers and officers who make long-term 
commitments and step up recruitment at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said proposals in congressional budget negotiations for  
across-the-board budget cuts would be ``devastating'' for the 
military, and cuts in the number of personnel available it would be 
``disastrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the military is ``walking a personnel tightrope,'' but  
pay and retirement improvements are beginning to increase 
retention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we are better off today than we were last year,''  
Shelton said. But he said recruiting has been held back by a 
job-rich economy, larger numbers of high school students going to 
college and ``the smallest cohort of 18- to 23-year-olds to recruit 
from in the history of the all-volunteer force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. Jay L. Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said world  
events in the last few months ``should dispel any misconception 
that the demands on our Navy have diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our battle force is getting older, and there is no  
shock-absorbency left,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force chief, Gen. Michael E. Ryan, cited a ``slow but  
steady decline'' in Air Force readiness -- down 5 percent since last 
year, 23 percent since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, said there  
remains in his service ``a mismatch between what we are asked to 
do, and the troops we have to do it with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Commandant Gen. James L. Jones said the Marines face  
increased commitments with force reductions that have cut ``well 
into the muscle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, ``The cumulative effect of repeated  
short-notice deployments could result in continued degradation in 
overall readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite budget increases this year, the service chiefs each  
complained of shortfalls below needs to increase readiness: $2.6 
billion for the Navy, $2.5 billion for the Air Force, $2.4 billion 
for the Army, $1.4 billion for the Marines.

<HEADLINE> Gore Starts Debate on His Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore staged a bit of political theater  
reminiscent of Ronald Reagan in 1980, seizing the initiative -- if 
not the microphone -- to begin debating rival Bill Bradley 15 
minutes before the debate officially began. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we do now?'' the vice president asked Wednesday night  
after he and the former New Jersey senator were introduced to the 
in-studio audience. It was an awkward period before airtime -- the 
candidates were fidgeting on their stools -- and Gore knew exactly 
what he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you start asking some questions while we're  
waiting?'' he told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	They did as he suggested. And the debate began on Gore's terms,  
just as he had planned. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tactic borrowed from former President Reagan, who broke  
the format in a 1980 debate and, when a moderator threatened to 
turn off his microphone, shot back: ``I paid for this microphone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan looked strong and in charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Advisers said Gore's strategy was to solicit questions from the  
get-go. It is part of what they hope is a new-and-improved 
candidate, one eager to answer every question, shake every hand and 
solicit every vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's trying very hard to connect with voters,'' said  
Vanderbilt University political science professor Erwin Hargrove. 
``Notice that he was asking people for their names, how many kids 
they have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like a fighter throwing the first punch before the opening bell,  
Gore never let up -- raising questions about Bradley's education, 
health care and spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers have to add up,'' said the vice president.  
</P>
<P>
	``The cost is way excessive.''  
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to shred the safety net'' that protects the poor.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley calmly rebutted Gore and passed up chance after chance  
to lash out. ``I'm not going to get into the details at this point 
of the game,'' he said after being served a softball-sized chance 
to criticize Clinton-Gore fund-raising excesses in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made sweeping promises filled with vision and few  
specifics, saying it was time to reduce poverty, reform campaign 
finance laws and provide affordable health insurance to almost 
every American. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore all but begged for votes -- ``give me a chance to roll  
up my sleeves'' -- a typically understated Bradley said, ``If you 
agree, then you'll vote for me. I hope you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first head-to-head encounter of their presidential campaign  
underscored the differences in styles. Gore was combative and 
coached, trying hard to look more homespun and drive down Bradley's 
rising poll numbers. The former New Jersey senator said voters are 
tired of political sniping and slick campaigning, so he avoided 
direct criticism and worked hard not to look like he's working 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It thought Gore was as good as I've ever seen him,'' said  
Democratic consultant Jim Duffy. ``He was trying desperately to 
look like a guy who is a friend, look like a guy who is 
intelligent, look like a guy who is compassionate. And yet, he 
pressed Bradley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy, who is not tied to either campaign, said Bradley came  
across as a soft-spoken, nontraditional candidate ``in an era where 
that might be very welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley talked about big ideas and handled them well,''  
Hargrove said. ``Gore seemed over eager at times -- kind of 
frantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time will tell whether voters welcome the change or not. ``I  
wonder if people will see him in this format and forget about his 
ties to President Clinton. It's possible,'' Hargrove said. ``It's 
nice to see him try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And try. And try.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to stick around,'' Gore said, as the television  
lights dimmed, ``and answer some more questions.'' Which he did, 
for 90 minutes. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> British Back U.S. Drug Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United States has gained an important ally in  
its push for an independent international agency to lead the fight 
against performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain has agreed to back the U.S. proposal for a drug agency  
that is not controlled by the International Olympic Committee. 
Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House drug policy office, is 
touring Europe to build support for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey opposes the IOC's plans for such an agency, contending  
it would lack independence and accountability. But the IOC said 
Tuesday it plans to set up its agency next month and have it 
operating by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement after a two-day meeting in London with  
British antidrugs coordinator Keith Hellawell, Britain endorsed 
McCaffrey's five principles: 
</P>
<P>
	--an independent and accountable antidrug agency.  
</P>
<P>
	--testing on a year-round, no-notice basis.  
</P>
<P>
	--no statute of limitations for drug offenses.  
</P>
<P>
	--preservation of samples so they can be tested years later when  
new detection techniques are developed. 
</P>
<P>
	--advanced research.  
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey will present his plan in Belgium on Wednesday to the  
European Commission. On Thursday, he will meet in Portugal with 
drug policy officials of the 15 European Union countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, McCaffrey said he hopes to enlist European  
opposition to the IOC plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't act, we're going to have a Swiss corporation, the  
International Olympic Committee, assert that they can unilaterally 
decide on a drug-testing agency that won't in fact be independent 
and probably won't achieve the results and won't have credibility 
with the world's athletes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the agency will only be independent if it has  
``the ability to act without being a wholly owned subsidiary to the 
IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects support from Britain, France, Germany, Canada  
and Australia at a 26-nation drug summit in Australia next month 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not looking for a fight,'' he said, ``but clearly we  
have a heavy responsibility. ... I can't imagine we're going to 
continue to ignore a situation that we think is untenable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said he would be happy to meet with IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch. And despite the standoff, he said he expects the 
sides can work together and reach some sort of consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, I have a feeling that rational thought  
will win out,'' McCaffrey said. ``I can't imagine there isn't going 
to be a sensible outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said Tuesday the IOC was  
going forward with its agency with or without McCaffrey's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency, set up as a Swiss foundation, will start  
Nov. 10 with the appointment of a board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said European sports ministers had responded  
favorably to the IOC project, and the EU's new sports commissioner, 
Viviane Reding, will meet with Samaranch in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the IOC could not control the agency because  
the 24-member board would include only three representatives from 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has never been any question of the IOC controlling the  
agency,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``And the claim that the IOC 
should not be involved at all seems to us a little unfair 
considering we were the ones who stepped up to the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will initially be located in Lausanne. Other cities  
expressing interest in serving as headquarters include Athens, 
Greece; Lille, France; Lisbon, Portugal; Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; 
and Vienna, Austria.

<HEADLINE> Another Treaty May Cause D.C. Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the Clinton administration wants to see a  
rerun of the debacle in the Senate over the 1996 nuclear test ban 
treaty, it need only suggest amending an earlier one, the 1972 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, that's exactly what it's been talking about lately as it  
tries to cajole Russia into agreeing to go along with a limited 
anti-missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	It could all lead to another major foreign-policy embarrassment  
for the administration on the heels of the Senate's rejection 
earlier this month of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 13 test-ban vote is forcing new attention on the older  
treaty -- both at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all arms-control pacts, the ABM treaty between Moscow and  
Washington is the most widely despised by congressional 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't want to modify it. They want to scrap it.  
</P>
<P>
	That's because it prohibits either country from developing a  
national missile defense system -- long a Republican priority and 
now embraced by the Clinton administration as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is trying to persuade Russia that both  
nations need limited national missile defense systems to protect 
against possible nuclear attacks by terrorist or ``rogue'' nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's suggestion that the ABM  
treaty might need to be adjusted slightly to permit such systems is 
drawing jeers from Senate conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since Article 1 of the treaty expressly prohibits a national  
missile defense, the secretary's suggestion that only a slight 
adjustment is required is a huge understatement,'' said Sen. Thad 
Cochran, R-Miss, a strong proponent of a missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The arms-control controversy seems bound to be an issue in next  
year's presidential and congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are pressing their attack on Republicans for rejecting  
the test-ban vote, a move that also drew wide international 
condemnation. Both Vice President Al Gore and Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley vow they'll resubmit the test-ban treaty if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush favors  
going even further than President Clinton in building a nationwide 
anti-missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans portray the Clinton-Gore administration as weak on  
national defense -- and are searching for an issue that works for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Some conservatives, including Foreign Relations Committee  
Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., consider the ABM treaty already null 
and void -- on the grounds that it was negotiated with the Soviet 
Union, which no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd likely use any move to revisit it in the Senate -- even for  
modifications -- as a chance to kill it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing it would lose such a showdown, the administration has  
not yet sent the Senate ABM modifications agreed to in 1997 by 
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. These transfer Soviet 
responsibility for the treaty to Russia and other nuclear-capable 
former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate ``no'' vote on any ABM modifications could undermine  
the entire ABM treaty, which arms control advocates see as a 
bedrock agreement -- and send new shock waves around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote on the test ban treaty should be seen as a sign that  
the arms control regime is under a great deal of stress,'' said 
Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers. 
``And it may not be able to sustain further stress, whether due to 
partisan politics, or misguided national policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration must walk a fine line -- with Russia now  
balking at moves to modify the ABM treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In words that caused alarm here, Russia's deputy defense  
minister, Nikolai Mikhailov, asserted on Monday that Russia would 
overcome any defense against ballistic missiles that the United 
States could build. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the United States violates the 1972 ABM treaty ... Russia  
can unequivocally defend itself by improving its weaponry,'' 
Mikhailov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright called those reports troubling, an overreaction. ``I  
don't want anybody, whether here or in Russia, to be reviving old 
problems. We should be trying to solve new problems,'' she said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia wants to stick to the terms of the treaty, there is  
no practical way it can prevent the United States from breaking 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	That could have the same effect that Helms and other  
conservatives desire: consigning the pact to history's dustbin.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 28.49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as the continuing watch  
over inflation kept most investors from making any big commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 28.49 at 10,330.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 5.74 at 1,287.65, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 9.96 at 2,801.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a short-lived lift from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured 
goods fell 1.3 percent in September, the first decline in five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was sharper than many analysts had expected, and  
offered some indication that the pace of U.S. economic growth may 
be tapering off. Stocks have stumbled in recent weeks amid worries 
that the economy is growing fast enough to convince the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates would slow economic growth by making it more  
expensive to borrow money to finance growth. They could also hurt 
stocks, however, by cutting into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks hovered in a narrow range as investors awaited two pieces  
of economic data viewed as better gauges of inflation. On Thursday, 
the government will report on the employment cost index and the 
gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay fell 14 3/16 to 137 13/16. The company  
said after the close of trading Tuesday its quarterly operating 
profits rose, beating analysts' expectations, after it signed up a 
record number of new users and expanded its offerings. But the 
company's profit margin fell, which caught some investors by 
surprise. EBay also recorded fewer transactions for new users, 
raising concerns about future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer rose 1/2 to 20 after reporting earnings of $117  
million, or 7 cents a share in the recent quarter. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected Compaq to earn 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two weeks, corporate earnings reports have provided  
a distraction from the lingering worries about inflation. But as 
the tide of profit reports begins to slow, the market may remain 
stuck in a relatively narrow range, said Brian G. Belski, chief 
investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``With most of the third-quarter earnings news out, stocks will  
likely return to an interest rate and Fed-watch stance over the 
next several days,'' he said.

	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 260.83 million 
shares, behind Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Stockbrokers Found Shot to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Two stockbrokers were found shot to  
death at the estate where one lived with his girlfriend, and 
authorities had few leads in what they consider an ``execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a definite `whodunit.' In the majority of homicides we  
have a pretty clear-cut idea, even if we can't prove who did it 
right away, we at least have a pretty good idea who did it,'' 
Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said. ``This is very 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police called to the house early Tuesday found Alain Chalem, 41,  
and Mayir Lehmann, 37, shot to death in the foyer, their cellular 
telephones inches from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem lived on the 16-acre property with his girlfriend,  
Kimberly Scarola, and her 13-year-old son. Lehmann lived in 
Woodmere, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were stockbrokers and sold penny stocks through a Web site  
called www.stockinvestor.com, but Kaye didn't know whether their 
profession had anything to do with their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, but there was no burglary involved,'' Kaye said.  
``That was never a thought. This was an execution. Reasons, we're 
not certain yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye said two workmen who were friends with Chalem called police  
at about 1 a.m. Tuesday after arriving to spend the night. The men 
had been calling the house, where Chalem and Lehmann operated their 
business, since Monday evening but no one had answered, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehmann was shot once in the back of the head, while Chalem was  
shot repeatedly, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellphones were found inches from both victims' hands, Kaye  
said. Investigators have checked what calls were made from the 
phones but Kaye would not release that information. 
</P>
<P>
	The home in this community of 8,500 about 10 miles northwest of  
Asbury Park belongs to Russell Candela of Brooklyn and Easthampton, 
N.Y., the father of Chalem's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scarola had gone to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., several days  
before the bodies were found. Her son, Jeffrey, was with her 
ex-husband, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem had been living in the home for seven or eight months,  
Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem also owned a hotel in the Catskills in 1994 and ran  
another hotel in Hampton Bays, N.Y., Kaye said.

<HEADLINE> Late-Term Abortion Bans Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By MIKE ROBINSON    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A sharply divided federal appeals court has  
upheld Illinois and Wisconsin laws banning some late-term 
abortions, a decision experts predicted will wind up before the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-4 decision Tuesday, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled that laws in both states banning a procedure critics describe 
as ``partial-birth abortion'' are constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision creates a constitutional crisis which will  
probably go to the Supreme Court,'' said Janet Benshoof, president 
of the New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which advocates abortion rights, says 30 states have  
passed similar laws, and 20 states have been barred or sharply 
restricted by courts from enforcing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the anti-abortion  
National Right to Life Committee, told The New York Times the issue 
was now likely to receive high court review, ``perhaps next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reversed a ruling by a federal judge in Chicago  
that held the Illinois law unconstitutional as well as an appeals 
panel's order that temporarily halted enforcement of the Wisconsin 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that both laws can be enforced in a constitutional  
manner,'' Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion acknowledged the laws could be wrongly applied by  
local authorities, but other laws could prevent that. Neither law 
has been enforced pending court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure in question is known medically as a ``dilation and  
extraction.'' It involves reducing the size of the fetus' skull as 
part of the process of removing it. The court said reducing the 
skull ``causes the adverse public (and legislative) reaction'' to 
the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the minority, Chief Judge Richard Posner said the  
decision represented a compromise between the desire to ban the 
procedure and the fear that the states' laws would be applied to 
procedures they were not meant to address. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``the court does throw a bone to'' those seeking to lift  
the bans by ordering lower courts to limit how they may be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion groups were elated by the decision after losing a  
round last month when a federal appeals court in St. Louis struck 
down similar laws in Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Armacost, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Right to Life Inc.,  
said the decision represents ``a huge victory for the babies of 
Wisconsin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson called the procedure ``a gruesome,  
abhorrent way to take a life,'' and said there is ``no place'' for 
it in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Deputy Attorney General Steve Grasz said the Illinois  
decision heightens chances that his state's case will be the first 
major abortion case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court since it upheld 
the Roe vs. Wade decision in 1992. Grasz said Nebraska will 
petition the court to consider its case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin law, enacted last year, provides for life in  
prison for anyone performing the procedure except to save the 
mother's life. The 1997 Illinois law calls for a three-year prison 
term.

<HEADLINE> Prada Clean Sweeps America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Young America settled into second  
place behind Italy's all-conquering Prada team in the challenger 
races for sailing's America's Cup on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In races which ended a controversial and often-interrupted first  
round-robin, Prada defeated Hawaii's Abracadabra 2000 for the 
second time and Ed Baird's Young America defeated Paul Cayard's 
AmericaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	In the much anticipated first meeting of the American teams,  
Young America was easily able to dominate AmericaOne, which 
experienced sail problems before the start. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne struggled through two legs with only a headsail  
raised before withdrawing and handing Young America the win. During 
the race, bowman Curtis Blewitt clung to the top of the mast trying 
to fix the problem, and was rocked violently from side to side in 
the lumpy conditions, with winds around 16 knots and rain 
streaming. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada finished round-robin 1 with a 10-0 record. AmericaOne lost  
only to Young America and Prada, while Young America lost to Prada 
and Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 syndicates from seven countries will now begin  
reconfiguring their boats for round-robin 2 in the regatta to 
decide who will take on defender New Zealand for the America's Cup 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays and controversial rulings were common during the first  
round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing was due to finish last Saturday, but officials altered  
the race schedule to give AmericaOne time to make repairs after a 
collision with Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision angered some teams, which wanted a quick finish to  
round-robin 1 so they could begin reconfiguring their boats for the 
more important second group of races. 
</P>
<P>
	When it resumed on Wednesday, racing was thrown into disarray  
when the race director postponed the morning's races, then ordered 
teams to do a quick turnaround and begin their afternoon races. 
</P>
<P>
	Two boats protested, claiming they did not have time to carry  
out repairs needed after the first races. The official jury voided 
the results of two races, including Prada's first victory over 
Abracadabra. They were rerun Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also unusually, boats in four races were left to run on their  
own after the struggling Swiss and French teams effectively 
forfeited by staying in port to ready their boats for the next 
round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning boats earn one point per victory in round-robin 1, four  
per victory in round-robin 2, and nine points for winning in 
round-robin 3. A finals series will then decide the challenger for 
the America's Cup regatta starting in February 2000.

<HEADLINE> Songwriter Accused of Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Child advocates say they hope charges that a  
successful songwriter abused some of his adoptive and foster 
children won't scare others away from adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let this tragedy make us afraid,'' said Frank  
Cervone, executive director of the Support Center for Child 
Advocates, a Philadelphia-based program for abused and neglected 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Cusick, the adoptive and foster father of 28 children,  
surrendered to police Tuesday after five boys in his care accused 
him of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged with multiple counts of corruption of a minor,  
indecent assault and child endangerment. If convicted, he could 
receive up to 35 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick, 47, was released on $300,000 bail. A preliminary hearing  
date was set for Nov. 4, said his lawyer, Kevin M. Zlock, who 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Child advocate Cervone said he is concerned the case against  
Cusick ``is going to do some damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a world where there are thousands of families who  
have opened their homes to children, but that's not enough by a 
factor of many thousand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick's songs include ``Don't You Go,'' recorded by Ricky  
Martin, and others by have been recorded by artists including 
Lionel Richie, Tony Orlando, Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1972, Cusick has been an adoptive or foster father to 24  
boys and four girls in Pennsylvania and New York, police said. He 
began taking in children when he lived on New York City's Staten 
Island, Bucks County District Attorney Alan M. Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January 1998, Cusick and several boys and young men have  
lived in a seven-bedroom house in an affluent subdivision of 
Langhorne, about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusick was married briefly in the early 1980s but adopted most  
of the children when he was single, authorities said. He received 
several awards and letters of commendation from adoption advocacy 
groups and community service programs, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started a month ago when a 17-year-old adopted  
son made the first allegations to police, Rubenstein said. 
Authorities then interviewed four other boys, between the ages of 8 
and 16, who reported similar assaults, Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were among 11 boys, all minors, who were removed from  
the house shortly after the investigation began and placed in 
foster care, Rubenstein said. Two other adopted sons, both 19, 
moved out of the house Monday.

<HEADLINE> Some States Lag in Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of computers in schools has doubled  
since 1993 to 8 million nationwide, but many states still lag in 
the access they provide students to the machines, an annual report 
on school technology says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Tuesday also said that if classroom computers are  
going to make a difference, the nation must focus on training 
teachers to do more with them than surfing Web sites and sending 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is beginning to ask for proof that their investment  
in technology has paid off,'' according to the report by Market 
Data Retrieval of Shelton, Conn. ``It's no longer sufficient to 
point to inventory lists, as important as they are, as the only 
proof of progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth annual ``Technology in Education'' report from Market  
Data, which is a Dun &AMP; Bradstreet research subsidiary, highlights 
student-to-computer ratios in each state. And despite a national 
ratio of 5.7 pupils per computer, down from 10.8 in 1993, this 
year's results continue to show varying degrees of computer access 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate work on teacher training in technology, Market Data  
found that new teachers -- those with two years or less experience -- 
didn't have to prove they could use technology to teach to get 
certificates (67.3 percent) or get jobs (82.9 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the new teachers -- among the first generation to  
grow up with computers -- got fewer hours of on-the-job training 
than older teachers, despite the fact that nearly two-thirds of the 
beginners reported that only one or two of their college courses 
even included instruction on how to use technology to teach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, schools of teacher education have not focused  
very much on technology,'' said Beth McGrath, an education 
researcher at Steven Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found that states with education plans that emphasize  
computer learning yielded better student-to-computer ratios than 
the national average. For instance, Kentucky had 5.3 pupils per 
computer; West Virginia, 5.4 pupils. More state dollars improved 
the picture in Indiana, 4.5 pupils; Florida, 5.0; and Texas, 5.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like Wyoming, with 3.5 pupils for each computer,  
benefited from low student populations that allow even a small 
investment to go a long way. Pupils have computer access above the 
national average in Midwestern states such as Iowa, Ohio and 
Minnesota, with relatively little computer-related industry, as 
they do in Washington state, home of software giant Microsoft Corp. 
and many Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But California, home to the Silicon Valley computer industry,  
fell behind at 8.1 students per computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Market Data gathered the information through mail and telephone  
surveys of the nation's 86,000 schools, with 48 percent responding. 
The survey was not a sample survey, so no margin of error was 
calculated, said Kathleen Brantley, the company's director of 
product development. She said the company ensures that a profile of 
responding schools matches characteristics of all schools surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics warned Tuesday against analyzing education  
technology solely on boxes and wires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a shopping-cart mentality tells much of the  
story,'' said William L. Rukeyser, coordinator of Learning in the 
Real World, a Woodland, Calif., organization that questions the 
overemphasis of school spending on education technology. ``We've 
had this kind of multibillion-dollar investment without the 
necessary level of sophistication to use it -- and that is across 
the board.''

<HEADLINE> Aetna Gets OK To Operate Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest life  
and health insurers, has won permission from federal regulators to 
operate a savings bank offering trust services to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval was announced Wednesday by the Office of Thrift  
Supervision, a day after mutual fund giant Fidelity was granted the 
same powers. They are the latest in a string of companies to get 
new federal savings and loan charters in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come as Congress edges toward passage of sweeping  
legislation to rewrite the financial services laws and allow banks, 
insurance companies and securities firms such as Fidelity to merge 
and sell each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Thrift Supervision, part of the Treasury  
Department, has reviewed and approved applications from a number of 
insurance companies, securities firms and other businesses outside 
the banking industry seeking to open federal thrifts. In granting 
the requests, the regulators have chipped away at the 
Depression-era laws separating the financial services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna plans to use the new savings bank,  
to be called Aetna Trust Co., to offer trustee, custodian and 
recordkeeping services to employee retirement plans and individuals 
with IRA plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formation of Aetna Trust Co. ... is an ideal complement to  
our business, enhancing our ability to deliver products and 
services that help our customers live the lives they want to 
lead,'' Catherine Smith, chief financial officer of Aetna Financial 
Services, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal thrift agency required that at least 40 percent of  
the new savings bank's directors be individuals who are not 
officials or employees of Aetna Inc. or its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies receiving new savings and loan charters recently  
include agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co., 
long-distance telephone company Excel Communications Inc. and 
coffin manufacturer Hillenbrand Industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrift charter applications are pending from, among others, Ford  
Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and department store chains 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-financial companies such as these would not be able to  
acquire federal thrifts under the current financial overhaul 
legislation now before Congress, however, as legislators seek to 
avoid the mixing of commerce and banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would not affect non-financial companies which  
have already had their applications approved.

<HEADLINE> Journal Scooped on Its Own Story? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The changes in the makeup of the Dow Jones  
industrial average may have been made by senior editors at The Wall 
Street Journal, but news of the additions didn't appear there 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	It may seem ironic that the Journal -- which prides itself on  
breaking major business stories -- appeared to have missed out on a 
big scoop, especially since the paper's top brass knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
	But since news of those changes can cause big swings in the  
stock prices of companies being added and dropped to the widely 
quoted indicator, officials at the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones &AMP; 
Co., said they wanted to make sure the announcement Tuesday was 
made in the fairest possible manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Had news of the changes appeared first in the Journal, it would  
have been available throughout the wee hours of the morning, 
allowing an investor who got the paper early or visited the 
Journal's Web site to trade on the information via an after-hours 
system like Instinet. 
</P>
<P>
	``As wonderful as our distribution system for the paper is, some  
people get it at different times,'' said Paul Steiger, the 
Journal's managing editor. ``Since it's such an up-to-the minute 
thing, it seems fairer to blow it out over the wires than to hold 
it as an exclusive for the paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones decided to release the news electronically at 9:15  
a.m. over several outlets -- its own real-time news wire, the 
Journal's Web site, a news release distribution system and the CNBC 
business cable channel, which has a news partnership with Dow 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	By making the announcement this way, there was ``complete  
dissemination'' of the news by the time trading opened on the New 
York Stock Exchange 15 minutes later, company spokesman Dick Tofel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones used to make announcements of changes in the Dow 30  
after the close of stock trading on Wednesdays. But with more 
trading occurring after regular market hours, Tofel said the early 
announcement gave all investors a better chance of getting an equal 
shot at the information.

<HEADLINE> 77 Pitches One Too Many for Glavine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As each inning went by, Atlanta manager Bobby  
Cox and pitching coach Leo Mazzone marveled at their good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Glavine, who spent the weekend in bed with the flu, was  
cruising by the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the World Series, 
using remarkably few pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, taking a conservative position, had hoped for seven innings  
from the left-hander, and he got that with very little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he pressed for one more, and that got him in very big  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven innings, Glavine threw just 73 pitches. He was leading  
5-3 and looked extremely comfortable, even after surrendering home 
runs to Chad Curtis and Tino Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``The home run by Martinez was a hanging slider,'' Glavine said.  
``It was the only mistake I made all night,'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout as the Braves batted in the eighth, the manager  
and his pitcher talked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was discussion, yes,'' Glavine said. ``I felt fine. I  
went back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, though, Cox had closer John Rocker warming up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tommy Glavine was throwing great,'' the manager said. ``Didn't  
want to come out of the game. I asked him if he was tired, and he 
said no. We all thought he was throwing great. Tommy thought he was 
throwing great himself and I thought he was throwing good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With all precincts agreeing, Rocker stayed in the bullpen and  
Glavine went to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The first batter in the eighth was Joe Girardi, and he lined  
Glavine's first pitch, No. 74 of the game, into right field for a 
single. Glavine never flinched and Cox never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up was Chuck Knoblauch.  
</P>
<P>
	Pitch No. 75 was outside and so was No. 76, putting the pitcher  
in a 2-0 hole, the kind of count hitters love. Still, Cox sat stone 
still in the dugout. This was obviously Glavine's game. He was six 
outs away from a win, three outs away from Rocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Tommy could get at least a couple of outs,'' Cox  
said. ``He was throwing real good. There was no reason to take him 
out, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Knoblauch provided a reason.  
</P>
<P>
	He hit Glavine's 77th pitch to right field. Brian Jordan went  
back as far as he could and jumped as high as he could. The ball 
hit his glove and caromed over the wall for the two-run homer that 
tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine was flabbergasted.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was down and away, pretty much where I wanted it,'' he said  
of the turning-point pitch. ``A pop fly to right field turns out to 
be a two-run homer. Here, it's a home run. Everywhere else, it's an 
out. The game was played here. It counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox came and got Glavine at that point, bewildered at what he  
said was a 315-foot home run, convinced that his pitcher really got 
the out the manager thought he would. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an out in my book,'' Cox said. ``But here, it's not.''  
</P>
<P>
	After that, it seemed just a matter of time. Curtis' second home  
run of the game settled the issue in the 10th inning against 
reliever Mike Remlinger, giving the Yankees a 6-5 victory and 
positioning them for their second straight World Series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got beat by two pop flies to right field that carried,'' he  
said. ``It was bad luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the only kind the Braves have had in this World Series.

<HEADLINE> Helms Has Congresswomen Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms ordered Capitol police to  
remove several congresswomen from a Senate hearing today after they 
disrupted the meeting by trying to present him a letter supporting 
an international treaty against sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, has blocked a Senate vote on the 1979 United Nations 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., led the congresswomen and several  
female staff members to Helms' office and then to the Foreign 
Relations Committee, where he was chairing a hearing on China. They 
tried to present him a letter signed by more than 100 House members 
in support of the U.N. Convention to Eliminate All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
	After asking the women to ``please act like ladies,'' Helms  
directed Capitol Police to escort them from the hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women of the House will no longer tolerate his delay  
tactics,'' Woolsey said. She said Democratic representatives had 
attempted to meet with Helms for nearly five years on the treaty, 
but had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not know what the senator's objections to the treaty  
could possibly be, because he hasn't told us,'' said Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said later that any  
member of Congress should be able to enter a hearing, even 
unscheduled, and be allowed to speak. Helms' reaction to the 
congresswomen, he said, ``is wrong. Shouldn't have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' staffers had no comment after the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	Helms, a critic of the United Nations, has often opposed U.S.  
participation in international treaties. He recently led Senate 
efforts to defeat ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey said 162 nations had ratified the women's treaty since  
the U.N. General Assembly approved it 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton submitted the U.N. convention on women's  
rights to the Senate in 1994. Helms has not scheduled hearings on 
the issue, or submitted the treaty to the full Senate for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed  
ratification of the treaty with Helms. ``It's not his favorite 
treaty, but I have made clear it is an administration priority,'' 
Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Caviar Caper Lands in Federal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a multimillion-dollar plot stretching from  
Eastern Europe to the United States. Another Russian money 
laundering scandal? A heroin ring? 
</P>
<P>
	No, it's caviar -- thousands of pounds of Russian sturgeon roe  
allegedly smuggled in suitcases, bound for New York City's gourmet 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Two businessmen are on trial in Brooklyn federal court in a case  
that highlights an international endangered-species law and the 
lucrative black market for the world's finest fish eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugeniusz Koczuk, the 48-year-old owner of an import company  
called Gino International, and his associate Wieslaw Rozbicki, 37, 
are the first people to be prosecuted under new provisions in the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. They could 
get five years in prison and be forced to forfeit $2 million if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the caviar the men imported was a protected  
wildlife product that should have been declared to the proper 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys call the case overkill and say their clients  
are honest importers caught in a complex regulatory web. Rozbicki 
is ``bewildered and feeling quite overwhelmed by all of this,'' 
said his lawyer, Roger Adler. 
</P>
<P>
	Under provisions of the endangered species agreement, which  
involves the United States and 142 other countries, three types of 
Caspian Sea sturgeon were added to a list of threatened animals. 
</P>
<P>
	For centuries, the sturgeons' eggs have been harvested to  
produce prized beluga caviar, as well as lower-grade sevruga and 
osetra caviar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last April, anyone carrying more than a half-pound of  
caviar into the United States must produce permits showing it was 
legally harvested. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also has 
begun DNA-testing caviar shipments to make sure they really contain 
the premium varieties like beluga, which retails for about $80 an 
ounce in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations are aimed reversing a 70 percent drop in the  
population of Caspian Sea sturgeon over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the rules went into effect last year, the Fish and  
Wildlife Service held a seminar for importers and retailers. Koczuk 
and Rozbicki, who worked out of Koczuk's Connecticut home, signed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators say they ignored the restrictions and instead  
paid off-duty Polish airline employees $500 each to smuggle tins of 
Caspian caviar in their luggage on flights from Poland to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show the company sold 19,000 pounds of caviar for  
millions of dollars between April and November of l998. During that 
period, the defendants received permission to import only 88 
pounds, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged scheme began to unravel when investigators got a tip  
that seven couriers would be arriving from Warsaw last October. The 
suspects were met by federal agents, who found ``caviar, and 
nothing but caviar'' in 16 suitcases, 1,000 pounds in all -- 
prosecutor Cynthia Monaco said. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, agents raided Koczuk's home and seized another  
1,000 pounds of allegedly smuggled caviar from refrigerators in the 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Koczuk's attorney, Andrew Bowman, told jurors the defendant had  
obtained a proper permit, but someone in Poland failed to forward 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing that says that if you are in possession of  
caviar or you eat caviar or you sell caviar, you are in violation 
of the law,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Restructures Bank Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. has restructured its $2.7  
billion in bank debt, giving it an extra year to pay off $1.3 
billion tied to the purchase of PCS Health Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 3 drugstore chain also said Wednesday it has  
consummated the sale of $300 million of its convertible preferred 
stock to an affiliate of Leonard Green &AMP; Partners, which made the 
extension of its credit possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Both actions had been expected since last week's management  
shakeup, which included the resignation of Martin L. Grass as 
chairman and chief executive officer, the appointment of Timothy 
Noonan as his interim successor, and the establishment of an 
executive committee to oversee operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-year extension of the credit deadline to Nov. 1, 2000,  
affects more than half of Rite Aid's bank debt, including the $1.3 
billion associated with the acquisition of PCS, the nation's 
largest pharmacy-benefits manager, and $300 million in 
due-on-demand bank debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain, which owns more than 3,800 stores in 38 states and  
the District of Columbia, recorded $12.7 billion in sales in 1999. 
But earnings have sagged recently, particularly since it acquired 
PCS in January, and Rite Aid has acknowledged it is considering 
selling at least part of its interest in that company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Camp Hill-based company recently reported a second-quarter  
loss of $67.9 million, or 26 cents per diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid's stock has tumbled from more than $51 a share in  
January to below $10. Shares rose 87 1/2 cents to $9.25 Wednesday on 
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Purer Form of Claritin Submitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Schering-Plough Corp., maker of Claritin, has  
applied for U.S. and European approval for a next generation form 
of the popular prescription allergy drug, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Desloratadine, which does not yet have a brand name, is a purer  
form of Claritin, and like its chemical cousin, it is a 
non-sedating, once-a-day antihistamine, according to David 
Southwell, chief financial officer of Sepracor, the specialty 
pharmaceutical company which helped develop the new medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Desloratadine is vital for Schering-Plough because the first  
patent on Claritin expires 2002, making the blockbuster medicine 
subject to competition from cheaper generics. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough has conducted four large  
studies using desloratadine, but has yet to release the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	With minimal side effects, Claritin has a strong following among  
doctors and patients. Analysts say Schering-Plough may have a tough 
sell persuading patients to switch to a newer version of the drug. 
The most likely ways the drug could be improved would be to speed 
its onset time and increase its potency. 
</P>
<P>
	Claritin, expected to have at least $2.5 billion in sales in  
1999, controls about 45 percent of the prescription allergy market. 
Its dominance, though, has fallen in recent years due to 
competition from Hoechst Marion Roussel's Allegra and Pfizer's 
Zyrtec. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepracor, based in Marlboro, Mass., is also developing its own  
new antihistamine, which could be on the market in the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough has been lobbying Congress to pass a bill that  
would extend the patent life of Claritin three years beyond its 
expiration date. But the bill has met resistance among consumer 
groups and generic drugmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Schering-Plough on Tuesday fell $2.25 to $45.81 1/4 in  
New York Stock Exchange trading. Sepracor rose $2.43 3/4 to $75.18 3/4 in 
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Results Top Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's losses widened in the third quarter  
as the giant Internet retailer significantly boosted its spending 
to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the steep losses, which were less than analysts were  
expecting, Amazon.com's sales grew by 132 percent from the year-ago 
period and its customer base climbed by 2.4 million to 13.1 
million, three times larger than it was in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com reported Wednesday that it lost $197 million, or 59  
cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a 
loss of $45.2 million, or 15 cents a share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding $111.3 million of merger, acquisition,  
investment-related costs and stock-based compensation charges, 
Amazon.com lost $85.8 million, or 26 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss was smaller than the 28-cents-a-share loss expected by  
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the third-quarter number was right on target,''  
said Sara Zeilstra, an analyst at Warburg Dillion Read. ``The 
concern right now has to do with the fourth quarter and year 2000 
and how much the losses will widen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter rose to $355.8 million, up from $153.7  
million a year ago. Since the start of the year, sales are $963.8 
million, well above the $608 million in sales that Amazon.com 
tallied during all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its four years in business, Amazon.com has yet to turn a  
profit. Yet, the company hasn't stopped spending money to build 
itself into a bigger and more diversified online retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company not only seeks to woo shoppers to its  
site, but it wants people to keep coming back. Repeat customer 
orders represented more than 72 percent of its orders during the 
third quarter, compared with 70 percent in the second quarter of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Amazon has moved from being exclusively  
an online bookseller into an Internet shopping superstore, offering 
music, videos, auctions and electronic greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter, it added a wide array of toys and  
electronics to its Web site. It also started allowing anyone -- from 
major manufacturers to enterprising grandparents -- to sell 
merchandise on Amazon.com through its new zSHOPS program. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com has also invested millions of dollars this year in a  
number of online merchants with big growth potential. Those include 
online pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop Pets.com and Web 
wedding-gift registry Della &AMP; James. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we find new opportunities, we will investment in them, and  
we think that is the right thing to do,'' Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com 
founder and chief executive officer, said during a conference call 
with analysts late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com has aggressively built itself up, its costs  
have soared. During the third quarter, the company spent $86 
million on marketing and advertising and $44 million on product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said costs are likely to continue increasing. In the  
fourth quarter, Amazon.com expects its marketing expenses to rise 
as well as its costs to fulfill orders. It also expects that that 
the profits it makes off each item to decrease. Revenue is expected 
to soar, however, as shoppers buy gifts for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Amazon.com said that it expects its U.S. book  
business -- long the anchor of the company -- to make a profit during 
the fourth quarter, though it will contribute less than half of its 
total revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	As Amazon.com moves into 2000, the company said might not renew  
its contracts with some Internet portals because the advertising 
and marketing deals are expensive and not as effective as 
Amazon.com had hoped they would be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that each company has been looking at its own internal  
measures of what advertising and marketing is effective,'' Ms. 
Zeilstra said. ``Some portals are paying off and others aren't, and 
everyone is evaluating what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Amazon.com lost $396.8  
million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $78.1 million, or 27 cents 
a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding merger and acquisition, investment and stock-based  
compensation costs, Amazon.com lost $204.9 million, or 63 cents a 
share, compared with a loss of $51.6 million, or 18 cents, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Amazon.com fell $5.31 1/4 to $75.93 3/4 in trading Wednesday  
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In after-hours trading, shares fell to 
$72.75.

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Complains About Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Here's a switch: ``60 Minutes,'' the TV  
newsmagazine that built its reputation with its pitiless, 
prosecutorial style, doesn't like the way it's being portrayed in 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS says the upcoming movie ``The Insider'' paints an unfair  
picture of how the show's producers and star correspondent Mike 
Wallace handled a confrontation with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmakers say ``The Insider'' takes some artistic license but  
is a faithful depiction of what happened. The movie, starring Al 
Pacino and Russell Crowe, opens in theaters Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Insider'' tells the story of former Brown &AMP; Williamson  
tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand, a whistle-blower who agreed to go 
on ``60 Minutes'' in 1995 with accusations of perjury and other 
wrongdoing by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, CBS caved to pressure from its lawyers who worried  
that B&AMP;W would sue the network for encouraging Wigand to violate a 
confidentiality clause he signed with the tobacco company. A 
version of the segment without the explosive Wigand material ran 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The full report eventually aired, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' and CBS have been attacking the movie for months,  
sight unseen. CBS executives have tried to get into advance 
screenings, but ``Insider'' director Michael Mann says he has 
refused to let them in because of the network's ``unrelenting'' 
hostility toward the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is being distributed by Disney, which owns CBS rival  
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing on reports from people who have seen the movie, CBS News  
complains that ``The Insider'' presents a distorted view of the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resent being used in a dishonest way to create fictional  
drama,'' Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	His strongest objection is over a scene in which Christopher  
Plummer, who plays the newsman, agrees with the CBS management 
decision to yank the full tobacco story and substitute the edited 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he went along with the edited segment only when it  
became clear that CBS would not broadcast the Wigand interview. He 
said he figured ``once we got that on the air, we'll wait for 
another day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had caved in, I would be not happy to admit it, but I  
would acknowledge it,'' Wallace said. ``The fact is, I fought to 
get it on the air. There was hell to pay around `60 Minutes.' 
Everybody knew how I felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman, who is portrayed  
by Pacino, said that although Wallace eventually championed the 
Wigand story, he did not push to get it on the air early on. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one was happy with the decision,'' said Bergman, who  
participated in developing ``The Insider.'' ``But I didn't witness 
anyone at `60 Minutes' in any meeting saying, `We're going to go 
public, we're going to appeal this higher up,' and that includes 
Wallace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	B&AMP;W executives, who also have not seen ``The Insider,'' also are  
concerned about fictional elements of the movie. In a scene at a 
golf driving range, Wigand is shadowed by a menacing man, 
presumably a tobacco-industry thug. Wigand said that scene was made 
up for the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Which gives you pause if that never happened,'' said B&AMP;W  
spokesman Mark Smith. ``Doesn't it question the whole veracity of 
the film?'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS News President Andrew Heyward said the film omits important  
details -- such as Wallace's commentary at the end of the abridged 
tobacco segment, in which he expressed dismay that the news side 
lost out to the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyward said Bergman, who ferreted out Wigand and talked him  
into the interview, tailored the story to make himself a hero. 
``I'd love the chance at the end of my career to influence a 
screenplay in which I could cast Al Pacino as me,'' Heyward said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacino disagreed, saying that Bergman and Wigand, played by  
Crowe, are not glorified, and are merely presented as ordinary 
people in unusual circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Wallace, Pacino said: ``I've admired him for years. I  
think he's done some extraordinary things. I don't think he has to 
worry about his legacy from this picture. I think his legacy's 
intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer also said he finds nothing in the film that Wallace or  
``60 Minutes'' should take offense to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played Wallace with as much respect as I have for him as a  
journalist,'' Plummer said. ``I tried to show all the colors he has 
up there on the screen. He's a theatrical figure, but we also 
showed his human side. I'm sure he can't deny that he has one.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Unfazed by Dollar's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar's renewed weakness against the Japanese  
yen didn't phase Japan's top economic planner, who said Thursday he 
wasn't concerned about the greenback's latest decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's appreciation was not rapid enough to cause alarm,  
Taichi Sakaiya, director-general of Japan's Economic Planning 
Agency, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that that if the dollar falls below 100 yen,  
the government will need to take steps to support the Japanese 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.16 yen,  
down 0.16 yen from its late Wednesday level in Tokyo and also 
marginally below its level in late New York trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had traded as high as 104.90 yen on Wednesday in  
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has sunk by more than 9 percent against the Japanese  
currency since Aug. 2, when it traded at 114.04 yen. A variety of 
factors have encouraged investors to buy yen, including 
expectations of economic recovery in Japan and concerns about 
inflation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the yen Thursday were expectations that the  
Japanese government will spend a significant amount of money to 
buoy the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said the government will submit a second  
supplementary budget in the upcoming parliamentary session, which 
begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Total spending in the package is estimated at between $96.2  
billion and $125 billion, according to Japanese news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	An unduly strong yen worries officials here because it can make  
Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and thus less competitive 
in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn  
in 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Recovering Lost Savings Bonds / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bestowed at christenings, tucked into birthday  
cards and doled out at graduations, the U.S. savings bond has been 
one of the most popular gift items in America over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also one of the most misplaced.  
</P>
<P>
	Right now, a whopping $6.5 billion in savings bonds is  
languishing out there, past maturity and no longer earning 
interest, simply because the owners have lost track of them. Some 
of these unredeemed securities may be collecting dust in basements 
and attics, others inadvertently thrown away, still others may 
never have made it to the intended recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who don't realize you can reclaim  
them,'' said Daniel J. Pederson, author of ``Savings Bonds: When to 
Hold, When to Fold and Everything in Between.'' ``They think 
they're like cash and they're gone forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, with a little work, they could be replaced and  
eventually cashed in. The federal government keeps records on all 
the savings bonds that have been issued (from the original ``E'' 
Series bonds issued in 1941 through today's newest ``I'' Series 
bonds) and will conduct a free search for any bondholder who 
requests one in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery process may take several weeks or months. It begins  
by filling out a special form -- PDF 1048, ``Application for Relief 
on Account of Loss, Theft or Destruction of United States Savings 
and Retirement Securities'' -- and mailing it to the Bureau of 
Public Debt in West Virginia. The completed form must be certified 
by a notary public or an officer of a financial institution. If the 
bonds were stolen, a police report also must be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Forms can be downloaded from the bureau's Web site  
(www.savingsbonds.gov) or requested by telephone (304-480-6112). 
Commercial banks and regional Federal Reserve Banks also have them 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Detailed questions about issue dates, denominations, serial  
numbers and inscription are asked on the form. Of course, the more 
information you can provide the better your chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially important: registered names of individual owners and  
Social Security and serial numbers as they may have appeared on the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Hollenbach, a spokesman for the Bureau of Public Debt,  
says that even if you don't know all the answers to those 
questions, it's still worth sending in the form. ``We'll take a 
shot at it (and) if we need more information we'll ask,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned, ``We're trying not to encourage fishing  
expeditions. The oldest bonds are on microfilm. It costs us a huge 
amount of money to go in there and extract all this stuff to turn 
microfilm images into data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Pederson's tips: List as many past home addresses as  
possible and provide several spelling variations of your name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gift giver could have made a mistake in spelling or maybe  
a relative knew someone as 'Johnny' when the real name is 
'Jonathan,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollenbach says the bureau receives about 800,000 inquiries  
about bond replacements each year. During the fiscal year ended 
Sept. 30, the bureau handled 30,000 claims and replaced 160,000 
bonds, or about five bonds per claim. A common occurrence: Some 
bond owners may have thought their bonds were missing but forgot 
that they actually cashed them in years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson expects more replacement requests through the next  
century as additional bonds mature. 
</P>
<P>
	Series E bonds issued May 1941 through November 1965 have a  
final maturity of 40 years from date of original issue, and those 
issued December 1965 through June 1980 have a final maturity of 30 
years from the date of original issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Series EE bonds, first issued in 1980, have a final maturity of  
30 years from date of original issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonds only pay interest up to their final maturity date.

<HEADLINE> GOP Criticizes Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders are making clear that  
President Clinton's Social Security legislation is going nowhere on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a realistic proposal,'' Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday. ``I've heard this proposal 
described as the Godzilla of all shell games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This plan won't save Social Security, it denies Americans the  
opportunity for personal accounts, and it places a huge burden on 
the backs of future generations,'' said House, Ways and Means 
Committee chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The scaled-down proposal from Clinton this week formalizes a  
Social Security rescue plan he first outlined in his State of the 
Union Address. 
</P>
<P>
	It would earmark for baby boomers' retirement benefits any  
government savings from using Social Security surpluses to pay off 
the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The official version Clinton delivered to Congress on Tuesday  
dropped a particularly controversial provision that would also have 
let the government invest some of the retirement program's cash 
reserves in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Republican leaders, who had previously rejected  
Clinton's plan and declared discussion of it dead for the year, 
were not swayed by that change. 
</P>
<P>
	Both political parties have pledged this year not to spend  
Social Security surpluses as in the past, but to use the money 
instead to pay down the national debt. That would allow the 
government to save billions it would otherwise have to pay in 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would use those savings, which would presumably  
accrue in the form of income tax surpluses, to help pay Social 
Security benefits after baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who want to see tax cuts in coming years, have  
objected to the fact that Clinton's plan would give Social 
Security, which has traditionally been financed with a separate 
payroll tax, a claim on other tax revenues.

<HEADLINE> Consecutive Series Sweeps Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The names are the most illustrious in baseball  
history: Ruth and Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice in baseball history has a team swept the World Series  
in consecutive years, and they were the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Murderers' Row Yankees swept Pittsburgh in 1927 and St.  
Louis in 1928, and DiMaggio's Yankees swept the Chicago Cubs in 
1938 and Cincinnati in 1939, giving them four Series titles in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when it sounded like a mixture of Verdun, St.  
Mihiel, Ypres and the Somme as the `slammerese twins' rolled their 
heavy artillery into position and once more opened up the big 
blast,'' Grantland Rice wrote in the New York Herald Tribune after 
Ruth homered three times and Gehrig once in a 7-4 victory that 
capped the '28 Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Babe and Lou stalked through this series the Four Horsemen of  
the Sock Eclipse -- Dyanmite, Demolition, Destruction and Death. And 
that spins out only part of the story. In addition, they were a 
pounding pestilence, a mauling misery, a clouting contagion, a 
black plague of mighty wallops that continued to clear out the 
right-field wall and threaten the lives and homes of those 
benighted denizens who lived in gunfire range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth game at St. Louis, the Yankees trailed 2-1 before  
a four-run seventh. After going 110-44 in 1927, New York had 
``slumped'' to 101-53 and was the underdog going in, hampered by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the cripples came through,'' Ruth wrote in a  
first-person account in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ``And whatever 
may be said of about our playing or our pitching or our hitting, 
there's one thing I don't think anyone can deny. They can't say we 
didn't have courage. I never expected to win this series in four 
straight games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth was 10-for-16 (.625) in the four games with three doubles,  
three homers and four RBIs. Gehrig was 6-for-11 (.545) with four 
homers and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 11 years later, the Yankees did it again, with Charlie  
Keller going 7-for-16 (.438) with a double, a triple, three homers 
and six RBIs. Bill Dickey drove in five runs and DiMaggio went 
5-for-16 (.313). 
</P>
<P>
	New York trailed 4-2 in the ninth but tied the score, then won  
it with a three-run 10th. DiMaggio hit a go-ahead single to right, 
with Frank Crosetti scored and Keller slid home for a 6-4 lead as 
the ball got away from catcher Ernie Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi fell as Keller crossed the plate and no one went after  
the ball, and DiMaggio wound up coming all the way around on what 
the Herald Tribune called a `home-run' single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signor Schnozzola is sleeping beauty of a strange spectacle,''  
said a headline in the New York Journal-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Much was made how manager Joe McCarthy matched Miller Huggins'  
feat of leading teams to consecutive sweeps. After the win McCarthy 
led the team in the clubhouse singing ``East Side, West Side,'' and 
``Roll Out the Barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No other manager, no other team has equaled that record in  
baseball's first 100 years,'' Bill Corum wrote in the 
Journal-American. ``None will in its second 100. .. The way it 
looks now, the Yankees' complete dominance of the baseball world is 
not for a month and not for a year, but for always.''

<HEADLINE> Probe Widens of Belgian Beer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission said Wednesday  
it has widened its antitrust investigation of the Belgian brewing 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, EU investigators raided the officies of the Alken  
Maes brewery and the Confederation of Belgian Brewers, said EU 
spokesman Michael Tscherny. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, investigators searched the offices of Belgium's largest  
brewer, Interbrew SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Tscherny said the Commission suspected brewers were guilty of  
price fixing and carving up the beer distribution market in 
Belgium. The brewers'confederation office was raided ``to clarify 
whether it is involved or if it is in the know,'' Tscherny said.

<HEADLINE> Cowsills Come Back on the Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It wasn't a deal with the devil, but it felt  
that way to John, Paul, Bob and Susan Cowsill. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining active members of the singing siblings who were  
the real-life models for the Partridge Family sat in Dick Clark's 
office, ready to sign a contract to participate in one of his 
oldies package tours. 
</P>
<P>
	It was good money and easy work. Go on stage each night and sing  
their hits: ``The Rain, the Park and Other Things'' and ``Hair,'' 
both sweetly psychedelic, harmony-suffused relics from a long-ago 
era in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
	The price was abandoning any pretense they were contemporary  
musicians. Oldies tours may be lucrative, but they're generally a 
graveyard for anyone with musical ambition. That same conundrum was 
the subject of the late Ricky Nelson's 1972 hit, ``Garden Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowsills swallowed hard and walked away.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided that we couldn't do this,'' Bob Cowsill recalled.  
``Susan is a great singer and a great artist. I had continued to 
write songs. We didn't view ourselves as this dinosaur band that 
had nothing left to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So seven years after that fateful decision, the Cowsills  
continue their comeback attempt. They recorded an album on their 
own, ``Global,'' and are peddling it on a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise is: The album isn't bad.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, the Cowsills will never give the Backstreet Boys or  
Britney Spears any competition on the charts, nor are they pushing 
any artistic boundaries. But for people who fondly recall the Beach 
Boys or the Mamas and the Papas, it's a fun listen. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Cowsills haven't quit their day jobs. Bob trains  
computer programmers, John is a carpenter and Paul is in 
construction. Susan is the more active musician, performing in the 
critically acclaimed Continental Drifters. 
</P>
<P>
	When your formative years are spent hearing your songs on the  
radio, giving concerts around the world and appearing on your own 
TV special, it's hard to accept the idea that your years of stardom 
are gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the Jacksons, Osmonds and Cowsills, the tail end of the  
1960s and early 1970s was a busy era for family acts. The Cowsills 
consisted of mom Barbara Cowsill, who died in 1985, and six of her 
seven children. They were originally approached for the TV series 
that became ``The Partridge Family,'' which instead went to a group 
of actors including Shirley Jones and David Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob's twin, Richard, was the only Cowsill not in the group, left  
behind by a domineering father who would not permit Richard to 
perform with the rest of the family because he said he wasn't good 
enough. Much bitterness ensued, and his influence dims the group's 
sunny public facade. Susan, now 40, joined the act when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have really excellent memories of that time,'' she said.  
``As far as I was concerned, we were having nothing but fun. I 
wasn't going to school, I was traveling all over the place, I had 
my own dog and we were out singing and laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The end came in 1970 when their father caught the oldest  
brother, Bill, smoking pot and banished him. Bill and Bob were 
songwriting partners and the act's creative forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went on another couple of years, but it started downhill  
right there,'' Bob said. ``It was the beginning of the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changing times and tastes made the end inevitable, too. The act,  
and the family, splintered. The money disappeared and some siblings 
went years without talking to each other until they reunited for 
their mother's funeral. That's when they started talking, and 
singing, again. 
</P>
<P>
	The four reunited Cowsills began performing together partly  
because they had all settled in the southern California area. Bill, 
who is in Canada, and Barry, who is in New Orleans, didn't want to 
do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a semi-famous name in the music industry is more a  
hindrance than a help when it's tied to a particular era. 
</P>
<P>
	From his perspective, one thing he can offer to young musicians  
-- particularly a family act like the three Hanson brothers -- is 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enjoy it, embrace it and really cradle it,'' he said,  
``because it can be gone tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> WWII War Criminal Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Three weeks after he was sentenced to  
prison for war crimes, the last known surviving World War II 
concentration camp commandant has been hospitalized with heart 
problems, court officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinko Sakic, 78, was diagnosed with ``grave disorder of the  
coronary rhythm'' and was admitted to the prison hospital three 
days ago. He has since been sent to a civilian hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Drazen Tripalo, who presided at Sakic's trial, confirmed  
Wednesday that he authorized Sakic's transfer to a clinic in a 
Zagreb suburb after receiving a medical report on his condition. 
Doctors have not decided whether Sakic must undergo surgery, the 
Vecernji list newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic's trial was initially postponed for ten days in March  
because he fainted on the eve of the opening session and had to be 
hospitalized. Doctors testified that he suffered from high blood 
pressure and was unfit to stand trial. He managed, however, to go 
through the six-month trial, which ended with a conviction on Oct. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic commanded Croatia's infamous Jasenovac concentration camp  
in 1944. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for ordering, 
committing or authorizing the torture and killings of thousands of 
Jasenovac prisoners, including Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and 
anti-fascist Croats. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasenovac was the most notorious of the more than 20 camps ran  
by the Nazi puppet state in Croatia during the war.

<P>
 *Nortel Networks Corp., up 2 1/2 at 58    	
</P>
<P>
	Nortel said late Tuesday that it earned 28 cents per share in  
the third quarter, up from 21 cents in the year-ago quarter, and 
above analysts' estimates of 26 cents per share. The networking 
company said its fiber-optic business contributed to strong growth. 

</P>
<P>
 *Stone &AMP; Webster Inc., down 9 1/2 at 15 1/2    	
</P>
<P>
	The construction company lost $6.9 million, or 52 cents per

a provision of $10.4 million to cover costs of three major projects 
and the impact of hurricanes and floods in the Southeast. 

</P>
<P>
 *Inacom Corp., down 4 3/16 at 3 15/16    	
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to lose 10 cents to 20 cents per share in  
the fourth quarter due to customers' concerns over the Year 2000 
computer bug. Inacom is a major reseller of computers that run on 
Microsoft Windows and Intel microprocessors. 

</P>
<P>
 *CVS Corp., down 4 1/2 at 39    	
</P>
<P>
	The drugstore chain reported third-quarter earnings of $121.6  
million, or 30 cents per share, matching analysts' expectations. 
CVS said same-store sales, which measure results at stores open for 
at least a year, rose 12.2 percent in the quarter. 

</P>

                              *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *eBay Inc., down 13 5/16 at 138 11/16    	
</P>
<P>
	Although the online auction house beat analysts' expectations

expenses to expand its computer systems. Also, many new users are 
conducting fewer transations on the Web site. 

</P>
<P>
 *Aspen Technology Inc., up 4 1/16 at 13 1/4    	
</P>
<P>
	The software and service designer for manufacturing plants

cents per share, from 26 cents per share in 1998. 

</P>
<P>
 *F5 Networks Inc., up 37 7/8 at 137    	
</P>
<P>
	The Internet traffic management company earned 11 cents per  
share in its fiscal fourth quarter, beating analysts' estimate of a 
loss of 5 cents per share. F5 said it received net proceeds of 
about $31.4 million from a public offering of stock earlier in 
October. 

</P>
<P>
 *CellNet Data Systems Inc., down 3 11/32 at 2 3/32    	
</P>
<P>
	The company, a wireless communications service provider, has  
been unable to raise the additional capital it needs to continue 
operating. CellNet said potential investors have been reluctant to 
invest in CellNet because it carries a large amount of debt.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Mock Calif. Man's Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man accused of murdering his wife  
claimed that he stabbed her as many as 25 times in the back in 
order to conceal her suicide from their son, a defense mocked by 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Andrew Storey told police that Ginny Change Storey was  
already dead when he stabbed her last year in their Fountain Valley 
apartment. He said he wanted to spare their son the trauma of 
dealing with her suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely ridiculous,'' prosecutor Chris Kralick told  
jurors during closing arguments in Storey's murder trial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for a second day on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Storey, 22, had just filed for divorce from her 27-year-old  
husband, who was discharged from the military for mental health 
reasons after serving in the 1993 peacekeeping mission in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Storey was found stabbed once in the stomach and up to 25  
times in the bedroom of the apartment the couple shared with her 
parents. Storey testified that he found his wife with a knife in 
her abdomen and believed she committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Storey's lawyer, Phil Zalewski, called the defense unusual but  
valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere does it say that unusual means unreasonable,'' he  
said. ``He walks into the bedroom and finds his wife, with his 
child, is taking her life. That night his universe crashed and he 
suffered a psychotic episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zalewski also said it's possible that Storey ``felt guilty for  
her death and wanted to be punished'' by implicating himself to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found a suicide note written by Mrs. Storey, but  
prosecutors said she was forced to write it.

<HEADLINE> Yen Up Vs. Dollar; Euro, Pound Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The yen continued its upward march against the  
dollar Wednesday on expectations that Japan will spend significant 
amounts of money to shore up its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 104.17 Japanese yen  
from 104.69 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese currency has been gaining ground against the dollar  
in recent trading sessions on expectations that the next government 
spending plan will be bigger than earlier projected. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell slightly against the dollar despite growing  
expectations that the European Central Bank will raise interest 
rates when it meets next week. The common currency for 11 European 
nations was quoted at $1.0500, down from $1.0586 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5244 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5122, and 1.4721 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4744. The British 
pound fell to $1.6439 from $1.6532. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the European countries participating in the euro  
are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8633 
German marks, up from 1.8481; 6.2491 French francs, up from 6.1982; 
and 1,844.42 Italian lire, up from 1,829.60.

<HEADLINE> GAO Cites Broken Army Trailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army spent $50.6 million for 6,700  
two-wheeled trailers that now cannot be used unless the jeeps and 
trucks that pull them are modified, congressional investigators 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the 6,700 high-mobility trailers the army has  
purchased are not usable because of a safety problem and not 
suitable because they damage the trucks towing them,'' said the 
General Accounting Office, the auditing and investigative arm of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army plans to pay an additional $640 per trailer to correct  
the flaw, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't rocket science, these are simple trailers. If the  
Army couldn't properly manage this contract, how can we expect them 
to handle high-tech missiles and other weapons,'' said Sen. Tom 
Harkin, D-Iowa, who requested the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO study said the Army found that the trailers could break  
causing a safety problem. They can also damage the trucks that pull 
them. Most of them have been stored until modifications are made. 
</P>
<P>
	George Schneiter, director of strategic and tactical systems for  
the Defense Department, said the Pentagon would follow GAO's 
suggestion that the Army ``demonstrate the design will meet 
requirements and will not damage the trucks'' before acquiring more 
trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army wants to purchase 18,000 additional trailers.  
</P>
<P>
	The trailers were built my Silver Eagle Manufacturing Co. of  
Portland, Ore., to be used for active guard and reserve Army units.

<HEADLINE> Hatchette Gives Vikings Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Jeff George wasn't the only elixir  
for Minnesota's offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of wide receiver Matthew Hatchette from a lingering  
ankle injury opened up the running lanes for the Vikings on Sunday 
and freed up Cris Carter, Jake Reed and Randy Moss for their share 
of single coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	With four wideouts, the Vikings (3-4) spread out San Francisco's  
defense, taking away the blitz, and helped fill-in Leroy Hoard post 
a 100-yard rushing game and George to throw for three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	George, who replaced the ineffective Randall Cunningham as the  
Vikings' starting quarterback, won the NFC offensive player of the 
week award, in no small part because of Hatchette's return. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatchette didn't just harm the 49ers by his presence. His  
play hurt them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatchette's 80-yard touchdown catch put Minnesota ahead to stay  
in the second quarter and propelled the Vikings to their 40-16 rout 
they hope signals a turnaround after six weeks of poor play. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter noted that Hatchette's not 100 percent because of his  
high ankle sprain, ``but, as you can see, he can run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatchette said he's 95 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``It feels better and better every day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And so do the Vikings, thanks to Hatchette.  
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Green hoped to employ his four-wideout set early and  
often this season, but Hatchette, a third-year pro from Langston, 
severely sprained his right ankle during training camp and 
re-injured it against the Chicago Bears three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	When healthy, ``he'll help us bring an even more potent offense  
to the field,'' Green said. ``He gives us a good stretch receiver. 
Matthew has outstanding speed, he has good hands. He gives us a 
chance to go four wide. You can put in a lot of pressure for them 
to bring in six defensive backs, which breaks down the 
two-linebacker concept and give us some running lanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy so confounded the 49ers that they repeatedly got  
caught in wrong formations Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One time, we had five linemen to block four guys,'' Hoard  
said. ``Jeff just looked at me and smiled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he changed the play to a rush, handed off and watched  
Hoard break another long run. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 49ers adjusted and played the run, that freed up one of  
the receivers, all of whom are 6-foot-3 or taller and can outjump 
or outrun almost any safety or cornerback. Also, George fires the 
ball faster than just about any quarterback in the NFL except Green 
Bay's Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatchette hopes to force defenses to stop double-teaming his  
fellow receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can keep performing well, then they'll have to take some  
of that coverage off the other guys,'' Hatchette said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moss said if teams continue to play six defensive backs,  
``we'll just run and make those six tackle Leroy, and I don't think 
there's many guys out there that want to tackle Leroy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against San Francisco, Hoard hit the holes faster than Robert  
Smith, out with a hernia that's slowed him all season, and George 
released the ball faster than Cunningham, who was plagued by slow 
windups and tardy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Hatchette's return that allowed the Vikings to score  
their most points of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hatchette brings another weapon,'' Moss said. ``He probably  
had the best offseason workout that I've ever seen a guy have. I 
was anxious to see him get on the field with the three of us. ... 
And then he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think he's almost 100 percent healthy, so it feels good  
to see a lot of guys out there that you can count on to make a big 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, who constantly complained for more attention from  
Cunningham, insisted he didn't mind catching just one pass Sunday. 
He said he was eager to see what the Vikings could do if Hatchette 
stays healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the past two years, people have praised how  
explosive the Minnesota Vikings are, but thus far we haven't really 
had a real explosive game,'' Moss said. ``I still believe we can 
put up maybe 60 points, 70 points.''

<HEADLINE> Boyfriend in Starve Case Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINDEN, La. (AP) -- The boyfriend of a Missouri woman accused of  
starving to death her two 8-year-old sons -- two of a set of 
triplets -- has been charged with child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony B. Dixon, 36, of Kansas City, Mo., was arrested Tuesday  
night in northwestern Louisiana. Prosecutors today charged him in 
Kansas City with two counts of child abuse and four counts of 
endangering the welfare of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City Police spokesman Steve Young said Dixon was stopped  
on another matter by Louisiana police, who ran his name through a 
computer and found warrants for him in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon was questioned and released last week pending further  
investigation into the deaths of Larry and Gary Bass. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Mary Bass, pleaded innocent to assault, abuse and  
neglect. Police said she admitted punishing the boys by putting 
their feet in scalding water, locking them in a room and depriving 
them of food except bread and water for up to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry died Oct. 20 and Gary died early Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The third triplet was not abused and was placed in foster care,  
along with two other children who were not abused -- a 12-year-girl 
and a 10-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a police complaint, Dixon said he did not seek  
medical attention for either child because he was scared he would 
be arrested for child abuse. He also was aware that the boys had 
been locked in a room and deprived of food for extended periods of 
time, the complaint said.

	Armenian Premier Killed in Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Gunmen assassinated Armenia's prime  
minister and several other officials and lawmakers today, spraying 
Parliament with automatic weapons fire during a debate and saying 
they were staging a coup. Hours after they burst into the chamber 
and shot Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, the attackers remained in 
control of the building and were holding dozens of hostages, police 
said. Hundreds of police and army soldiers ringed the building in 
central Yerevan as officials negotiated with the assailants. 
Sarkisian was number two in the government, behind President Robert 
Kocharian. Armenia, which became an independent republic following 
the Soviet collapse in 1991, has endured years of political and 
economic turmoil.

	NTSB Probing Payne Stewart Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Crash investigators are back at work today,  
looking for clues as to what killed golfer Payne Stewart and five 
others. They are concentrating on removing wreckage from the 
10-foot deep crater caused when Stewart's Learjet crashed into a 
field. Tissue samples from the victims were taken for testing 
yesterday. No one was apparently conscious at the controls for four 
hours on Monday, when the jet flew 1,400 miles across the country 
on autopilot before running out of fuel. Authorities are focusing 
on a theory that the plane may have suffered sudden cabin 
depressurization, which could have caused the crew and passengers 
to black out or die.

	U.S.: Iraq Guilty of Major Crimes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said today that Iraqi  
authorities have engaged in nine ``major criminal episodes'' that 
qualify as crimes against humanity and pushed for an international 
war-crimes tribunal for Iraq. Among the nine are the use of poison 
gas against Iraqi Kurds in 1988, killing an estimated 5,000 people, 
and use of gas during the 1980-88 war with Iran.

cuts that will result in an additional 1.4 million unwanted 
pregnancies. Dr. Nafis Sadik said the fund is scrambling for 
resources and cutting programs. Dr. Sadik said the funding crisis 
has delayed plans to include family life education in the school 
curriculum in Tanzania, postponed plans for operations in remote 
villages in India, suspended training of health workers in Vietnam, 
and canceled the purchase of contraceptives for some 200,000 women 
in Ecuador.

	Re-Enactment Offends Columbine High  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A Halloween display at a Texas church featuring a  
re-enactment of the massacre at Columbine High School has offended 
and shocked some of those connected to the attack. The ``Hell 
House'' at Trinity Church in Cedar Hill, Texas, features a skit in 
which young actors dressed in trench coats re-enact the shooting in 
which 15 were killed and more than 26 were wounded. The skit ends 
with the gunmen being sent to Hell. One parent of a Columbine 
student said she was ``repulsed'' by the act. Trinity's youth 
pastor, Tim Ferguson, has said he must scare teen-agers in order to 
save them from sin and another attack like the one at Columbine.

upswing in food production. The Korea Agricultural Economy 
Institute said the impoverished North would reap up to 3.6 million 
tons of food this year -- an increase of 20 percent from last year. 
But the country needs about 6.6 million tons a year to feed its 22

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 16.78 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as the continuing watch  
over inflation kept most investors from making any big commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 16.78 at 10,318.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 3.45 at 1,285.36, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 27.76 at 2,783.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a short-lived lift from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured 
goods fell 1.3 percent in September, the first decline in five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was sharper than many analysts had expected, and  
offered some indication that the pace of U.S. economic growth may 
be tapering off. Stocks have stumbled in recent weeks amid worries 
that the economy is growing fast enough to persuade the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates would slow economic growth by making it more  
expensive to borrow money to finance growth. They could also hurt 
stocks, however, by cutting into corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks hovered in a narrow range as investors awaited two pieces  
of economic data viewed as better gauges of inflation. On Thursday, 
the government will report on the employment cost index and the 
gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer eBay fell 14 to 138. The company said after  
the close of trading Tuesday its quarterly operating profits rose, 
beating analysts' expectations, after it signed up a record number 
of new users and expanded its offerings. But the company's profit 
margin fell, which caught some investors by surprise. EBay also 
recorded fewer transactions for new users, raising concerns about 
future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer slipped 1/4 to 19 1/4 after reporting earnings of  
$117 million, or 7 cents a share in the recent quarter. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected Compaq to earn 5 
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online rose 1 to 117 3/4. The company will report its  
profits after the close of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two weeks, corporate earnings reports have given the  
market some sporadic relief from the lingering worries about 
inflation. But as the profit reports end and are no longer a 
distraction, the market may remain stuck in a relatively narrow 
range, said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George 
K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	``With most of the third-quarter earnings news out, stocks will  
likely return to an interest rate and Fed-watch stance over the 
next several days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 554.16 million 
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.11 to 415.68.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Guard Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Matt O'Dwyer, a guard for the Cincinnati  
Bengals, has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and third-degree 
assault in connection with a July bar brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, formerly of the New York Jets, originally was charged  
with assaulting police officers, harassment and disorderly conduct 
after an altercation that also involved the Jets' two starting 
offensive tackles, Jumbo Elliott and Jason Fabini. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer will be sentenced Dec. 21 by Long Beach City Court Judge  
Roy Tepper. The judge has told O'Dwyer he will not serve time in 
jail, Nassau County District Attorney Frank Schroeder said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer could be fined or ordered to perform community service.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said that the 6-foot-7, 308-pound Elliott triggered the  
brawl by urinating in a sink in the women's bathroom in the bar, 
then punching two patrons. He was charged with misdemeanor assault, 
harassment and public lewdness and faces up to a year in jail and 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer kicked out the window of a police car, sending shattered  
glass onto two officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini was charged with disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and  
faces a maximum sentence of 15 days in jail and a fine.

<HEADLINE> Editor Leaves Paper Over Bush Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, the  
publishing house that recalled its new biography of Republican 
presidential candidate George W. Bush, has resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief resignation statement issued Tuesday, Robert Wallace  
said he did not ``in any way'' want to be associated with the book, 
``Fortunate Son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be associated with a book I have no control  
over,'' Wallace told The Washington Post in an interview appearing 
in today's editions. ``I haven't even read the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, St. Martin's Press recalled the book, which it  
published Oct. 19, after learning through published reports that 
the author, J.H. Hatfield, was paroled from a Texas prison in 1993 
after serving time for a felony conviction. Hatfield has called his 
conviction a case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing anonymous sources, the book alleges that Bush, now Texas'  
governor, was arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 and that the 
matter was dropped after he performed community service arranged by 
his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, then U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush has called the allegations ``science fiction''  
and ``totally ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Martin's issued a statement countering that Wallace had read  
the afterword to the book -- the part containing the part about the 
alleged cocaine arrest -- ``and advised on various aspects of the 
book's launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time prior to its release did he object to the afterword  
or the publication of the book,'' according to an account of the 
St. Martin's statement published in today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Richardson, president and publisher of St. Martin's press,  
told the Times she spent for days trying to persuade Wallace to 
remain at the company, staying up until 3 a.m. on Tuesday as part 
of her effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why he's leaving a job over this,'' she  
told the times. ``He's clearly in pain. If you talk to him, he's 
miserable so it's sincere. But I'll never understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace acknowledged to the Times that he had read the afterword  
but said he was ``never given a copy of the manuscript or the 
book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the New York paper his advice about publishing it was  
sought only days before publication in an eleventh-hour meeting on 
Oct. 15 after it became clear the Times would not publish an 
article about the book because it could not corroborate the book's 
more explosive accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was published under the imprint of Thomas Dunne Books,  
a St. Martin branch overseen by senior editor Thomas Dunne. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted St. Martin employees as saying there had been  
tension between Wallace and Dunne, a longtime employee who had been 
passed over for the top editor's position when Wallace, a former 
ABC producer and Rolling Stone editor, was chosen for the top 
position, his first job in book publishing.

<HEADLINE> Internment Camp Marker Plan OK'ed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A proposal to mark the site of a World War  
II internment camp for Japanese American civilians squeaked through 
City Council on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't deny history,'' said Mayor Larry Delgado, who broke a  
tie to authorize the placement of a bronze plaque on a boulder at a 
city park. 
</P>
<P>
	The marker was opposed by some local veterans who survived the  
brutal Bataan death march in the Philippines and 3 1/2 years as 
Japanese prisoners of war a half-century ago. Embittered by the 
cruel treatment they received, they view the plaque as an affront. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like asking us to turn the other cheek,'' said  
Manuel Armijo, 88, after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The marker, to be paid for with private donations, was  
recommended by a committee that said it was time to recognize the 
overlooked chapter in Santa Fe's history. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be placed on a hilltop overlooking the 28-acre site --  
now a residential neighborhood -- where the camp was located. 
</P>
<P>
	Operated by the Justice Department from 1942-46, the camp held  
mainly middle-aged and older Japanese-born men who were leaders in 
their communities, and therefore considered a threat when the war 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounded by barbed wire and marked by guard towers, the Santa  
Fe camp held 2,100 men at its peak. A total of 4,555 men passed 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among more than 120,000 U.S. residents of Japanese  
ancestry who were removed from the West Coast during World War II 
and locked up in internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has formally apologized to the internees  
and paid at least $1.6 billion in reparations.

<HEADLINE> Braves Miss Plays and Pay the Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball scouts believe that when a major  
leaguer gets to a ball, he ought to be able to make a play. That's 
what makes them major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in the pivotal third inning of Wednesday night's Game 4 of  
the World Series, Atlanta infielders got to the ball but failed to 
make the play. The result was three runs as the New York Yankees 
completed their sweep of the Braves, winning 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither play was scored an error. Either could have been.  
</P>
<P>
	The first play came when Chuck Knoblauch led off the inning with  
a shot in the hole between shortstop and third base. Walt Weiss, 
one of the best fielders in the league, got to the ball but it 
glanced off his glove, putting the leadoff man on base. Official 
scorer Red Foley ruled it an infield single. 
</P>
<P>
	When Derek Jeter singled to right, Knoblauch took third. Then,  
as Paul O'Neill struck out, Jeter stole second. Bernie Williams was 
walked intentionally to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Tino Martinez hit a ball to the right of first baseman Ryan  
Klesko. The runner seemed to block his view for an instant and the 
ball glanced off Klesko's arm and into the outfield. Two runs 
scored on the play, which also was scored a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the play could have gone either way -- hit or  
error. Both balls were hit sharply, but neither was a line drive. 
They were plays that needed to be made, especially by a team facing 
elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast with the Yankees' infield was dramatic, especially  
in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, shortstop Jeter ranged far to his left on a ball  
hit up the middle by Gerald Williams, crossed second base and made 
the play cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Bret Boone walked, Chipper Jones hit a bouncer to  
third base. Scott Brosius, playing him to pull, got a good jump and 
backhanded the ball at the bag. Then he pivoted, jumped like an 
old-time quarterback throwing a pass and retired the runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays missed.  
</P>
<P>
	Two plays made.  
</P>
<P>
	They were the difference in the deciding game of the World  
Series.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Enlists Elmo, Big Bird </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc., maker of the blockbuster antibiotic  
Zithromax, has enlisted the help of Elmo, Big Bird and other Sesame 
Street characters to educate parents about antibiotics and reduce 
kids' fears about going to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's Television Workshop, which produces the Sesame Street  
television show, and Pfizer will distribute ``Sesame Street Goes to 
the Doctor'' kits to pediatricians and child care providers. 
Parents will be able to order printed materials for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit includes a 15-minute video in which the Muppets learn to  
get through a visit to the doctor and about proper use of 
antibiotics. The story line revolves around Elmo's trip to the 
doctor to help treat an ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit also includes a special issue of Sesame Street Parents  
Magazine that gives advice on caring for young children with common 
respiratory infections. In addition, the kits includes a poster and 
a booklet that gives child care providers tips about how to work 
with families when a child is ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The information given to parents has two main messages: Parents  
should never insist on an antibiotic for a viral infection such as 
a cold, because antibiotics won't work. And when an antibiotic is 
prescribed, they should always make sure the child finishes all of 
the doses so the infection does not return. 
</P>
<P>
	The unnecessary use of antibiotics and patients not finishing  
their drug regimen are two reasons why bacteria have become 
increasingly resistant to antibiotics, rendering them less 
effective in treating bacterial illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The kits do not mention any of Pfizer's drug by name. But  
reducing children's fears about going to the doctor and making sure 
they take antibiotics appropriately likely will indirectly help 
boost sales of Zithromax, which is used to help treat ear 
infections and pneumonia among other uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical companies increasingly do not mention the name of  
their drugs in marketing campaigns, partly because if they did, 
federal rules would require them to detail side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Zithromax, which had $1 billion in sales last year, has steadily  
gained market share against its primary competitor, SmithKline 
Beachum's Augmentin, which had sales of $1.6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who better than the trusted and well-loved Muppets to help  
children feel better about doctor visits and help parents 
understand how to use antibiotics appropriately,'' said Pat Kelly, 
a Pfizer spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer has also agreed to help underwrite the production of  
Sesame Street shows during the first half of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Green, the workshop's vice president for outreach and  
strategic partnership, said her not-for-profit company has sought 
out opportunities to use their popular characters to educate young 
children on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer is not the first drug maker to work with Elmo and Big  
Bird. Merck &AMP; Co. published a special magazine a few years ago 
using the Muppets to help promote the importance of vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the workshop nor Pfizer would disclose how much the  
drugmaker is paying to support the project. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Seeks Paternity Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield,  
who is the father of five children out of wedlock, wants a 
paternity test for the son of his estranged wife, who is divorcing 
the boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's lawyer filed papers Tuesday in Fayette County  
Superior Court asking a judge to order DNA testing on himself, 
Janice Holyfield and 13-month-old Elijah Jedediah Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Janice Holyfield's lawyer, John Mayoue, said he did not  
understand why Holyfield took that step. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am appalled. Mr. Holyfield could not in good faith seriously  
doubt that Elijah is his child,'' Mayoue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thomas, the boxer's personal lawyer, couldn't be reached for  
comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Holyfield's nine children are two born to other women  
since the fighter married Janice Holyfield in October 1996. The 
boxer filed for divorce last March. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Holyfields are scheduled to appear in court  
Friday. Mrs. Holyfield wants his earnings from the Nov. 13 rematch 
with Lennox Lewis, which court papers say could reach $15 million, 
put in escrow.

<HEADLINE> Sosa: Baylor May Be Next Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sammy Sosa met on the field with Don Baylor  
prior to Game 4 of the World Series on Wednesday and assumes the 
Atlanta Braves hitting coach will be the next manager of the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who managed Colorado from 1993-98 and guided the Rockies  
to their only postseason berth, already has interviewed with 
Chicago, Anaheim and Milwaukee. The Cubs are thought to have the 
inside track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much understand that the strongest candidate we have  
is Don Baylor,'' Sosa said after receiving the Hank Aaron Award as 
the top hitter in the National League. ``I believe that Don Baylor 
would be a good decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs fired Jim Riggleman after finishing last in the NL  
Central with a 67-95 record. Baylor's name has been mentioned for 
virtually every opening after just one season on the Braves' 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa said he has not been consulted by the Cubs' front office  
during the search, and hasn't closely followed the dealings with 
Baylor and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just waiting for the announcement,'' he said. ``I think it  
will be soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor denied he has reached an agreement to manage the Cubs,  
saying he hasn't talked with team officials in a week. But he is 
fully aware of all the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I'm hearing, too,'' he said while walking back to  
the clubhouse after batting practice at Yankee Stadium. ``I'm sure 
I will get bombarded with this as soon as the Series is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement that Baylor had been hired as Cubs manager was  
discovered last week by a Chicago Tribune reporter on a hidden area 
of the team's Web site. Apparently, a Cubs employee prepared a 
profile and news release in case Baylor got the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch denied that Baylor had been hired;  
the information was removed from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's a great manager and a great person,'' Sosa said.  
``We're not going to rebuild this team from one day to the other. 
We need to get a manager first, then we can go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor would like to make a decision by the first week of  
November. The Braves already have conceded that Baylor will not 
return as their hitting coach next season.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Refuse To Talk To NBC's Gray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC reporter Jim Gray apologized to baseball  
fans Tuesday night for his contentious interview with Pete Rose 
before Game 2 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yankees weren't in a forgiving mood, refusing to talk to  
Gray after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans Sunday night after  
Gray's interview with Rose at Turner Field in Atlanta. It centered 
on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and came 
minutes after he returned to a major league field for the first 
time in 10 years as a member of baseball's All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	During NBC's pregame show Tuesday night at Yankee Stadium, Gray  
spoke about the Rose interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``After viewing the videotape, I can understand the reaction of  
many baseball fans,'' Gray said. ``I thought that it was important 
to ask Pete Rose if this was the right moment for him to make an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If in doing so, the interview went on too long and took out  
some of the joy of the occasion, then I want to say to baseball 
fans everywhere that I'm very sorry about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gray approached Chad Curtis after the game to ask him about  
his game-winning home run in the 10th, the Yankees' left fielder 
made the team's feelings plain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of what happened with Pete, we decided not to say  
anything,'' Curtis told Gray on live television, adding a greeting 
for his grandmother before walking away. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray shouted after Curtis, ``Don't you want to talk about your  
home run?'' but Curtis did not turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a personal thing with me and Jim Gray,'' Curtis said  
later. ``It's a thing that the team decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what Pete did, I don't know whether he should be  
in the Hall of Fame or shouldn't be. All I know was that was a 
special day for Pete and some other people. He probably should have 
been able to just have an enjoyment of that celebration and not 
have to answer questions about other things, and it really upset 
some people. 
</P>
<P>
	``So as a team we decided to boycott talking to him on the  
field,'' Curtis said. ``If my teammates decide that, I'm going to 
honor it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its postgame report on CNBC, reporter Craig Sager, who had  
been covering the Braves' dugout, moved over to the Yankees' side 
of the field to ask the questions instead of Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC does not plan any changes in its coverage despite the  
boycott, said spokesman Ed Markey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Gray will be back tomorrow night in the Yankee dugout --  
same assignment as tonight,'' Markey said after Tuesday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Markey added that the network expected the Yankees will talk to  
Gray for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans seem willing to forgive Rose, speaking out in polls in  
favor of his reinstatement to baseball. He received the longest 
ovation of any baseball hero introduced Sunday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose told Gray he was ``surprised you're bombarding me like this  
on such a festive occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Gray said his questions shouldn't have  
surprised Rose since other reporters asked the same things at a 
news conference shortly before. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, backed Gray by calling him  
``the best TV sports reporter of his generation.'' However, Ebersol 
said he thought the interview ``probably went too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Switchboards at NBC affiliates across the country were bombarded  
by phone calls from people angry at Gray -- two hours nonstop at 
WLWT in Cincinnati, where Rose collected most of his record 4,256 
hits for the hometown Reds.

<HEADLINE> Curtis Standing Tall After Homerun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He is the second-shortest member of the New York  
Yankees, and one of the least known. 
</P>
<P>
	He had hit just one home run since May 23, hadn't hit one in  
Yankee Stadium since Sept. 23, 1998, was 3-for-25 with no RBIs in 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that matters, anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	Chad Curtis joined the list of Yankees with postseason walk-off  
homers Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Leyritz did it against Seattle in 1995. Bernie Williams  
did it against Baltimore the following year and again to beat 
Boston two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't do it in the World Series.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think -- in fact, I know -- I've never hit one in the  
regular season, I've never hit a walk-off home run,'' Curtis said 
after his leadoff shot in the 10th, his second of the night, gave 
New York a 6-5 win over Atlanta and a 3-0 World Series lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other Yankees have done it: Tommy Henrich in the ninth  
inning of the '49 opener against Brooklyn and Mickey Mantle in the 
ninth of Game 3 against St. Louis in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard people talk about tingling,'' Curtis said. ``I've  
never felt that before. I think somewhere between second and third, 
I felt like there was electricity running through my legs. It was a 
great feeling. You're rounding third base coming home, seeing all 
your teammates there waiting for you in a World Series game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He remembered back to last October, when after 456 at-bats  
during the regular season, he never saw a pitch against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very frustrating,'' Curtis said. ``I played 152 games.  
that's 152 of 162. I never stepped on the field in the World 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Yankees capped their amazing season with a sweep, he  
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't pouting. We won the World Series,'' he said. ``By the  
same token, I felt I was more congratulating my teammates than 
celebrating with them. That was something I was uncomfortable 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Tom Glavine hadn't gotten the flu, Curtis would have started  
against the lefty in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really fired up to play in Game 1,'' Curtis remembered.  
``I had been there probably a half hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then somebody told him Greg Maddux, a righty, had replaced  
Glavine as Atlanta's starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `What?' He was joking, I thought,'' Curtis said.  
</P>
<P>
	So there he was Tuesday night, hitting the 11th World Series  
walk-off homer, the first since Toronto's Joe Carter took Mitch 
Williams deep in Game 6 in 1993 to win the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And what about that fifth-inning homer, the one that made it 5-2  
and started the Yankees on their comeback? He had been 0-for-12 
against Glavine in his career before hitting that one out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were flat there,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``We were down 5-1  
and Glavine was just mowing us down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the other Yankees are well-known: Jeter and Williams,  
Knoblauch and O'Neill, Martinez and Brosius, Davis and Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis?  
</P>
<P>
	He was supposed to lose his job to Darryl Strawberry.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Shane Spencer.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Ricky Ledee.  
</P>
<P>
	Or to Tony Tarasco.  
</P>
<P>
	But no matter what else happens now, Curtis has that moment, a  
replay that will be shown over and over in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it for my grandma,'' he said, still on the field with  
the game-winning ball, ``but I got to give it to my 2-month-old 
son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Remlinger had just come in, and throughout the ballpark,  
there was the feeling the win was there for the taking. John Rocker 
had pitched his two innings, and the rest of the Braves' bullpen 
scares mainly their own fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis fouled off the first pitch, then took a ball.  
</P>
<P>
	And then came the drive.  
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Gerald Williams knew after two steps.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency in these situations to try and hit a home  
run,'' Curtis said. ``So I went up there and tried to hit a liner 
up the middle, and I hit a homer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He became the man of the night, the toast of the town, a New  
York hero. 
</P>
<P>
	But Curtis, at 5-foot-10 an inch taller than Chuck Knoblauch,  
doesn't even know if he'll get back on the field for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait on that,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said,  
``and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Business Leaders Back WTO Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite protests over the upcoming World Trade  
Organization meeting, labor leaders have joined with their 
corporate counterparts on a presidential advisory board to support 
the administration's trade agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of the 35 panelists declined to sign a letter backing  
Clinton's WTO strategy. But administration officials said the 
expression of support by the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy 
and Negotiations as a ``conceptual breakthrough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This sort of compromise and acknowledgment of mutual interest  
has been long sought after,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky said in an interview Wednesday. ``This is the first time 
in six and one-half years that labor has not dissented from an 
ACTPN initiative, or that the business community has not 
dissented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, President Clinton and the leader of the European  
Commission met to discuss the trade talks. Officials said progress 
was made on areas of dispute such as the U.S. export of genetically 
altered foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the commission president, Romano Prodi, agreed to  
high-level talks before year's end on biotechnology, and the United 
States is assisting the Europeans in creating an agency similar to 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very sensitive subject,'' Prodi said. ``We need to  
give guarantees to our constituents that the scientific controls 
will be of the highest level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, led administration  
efforts to forge a strategy for the WTO ministerial talks, set to 
begin in late November in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders were pleased by the administration's call for a  
working group within the WTO to deal with issues such as worker 
rights and protections, which business leaders traditionally have 
tried to keep separate from trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Four groups, including the Consumers Union of America and the  
American Farm Bureau Federation, declined to sign the letter. But 
that did not dampen the administration's enthusiasm over the 
compromise between labor and business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where the most serious degree of conflict has existed  
over a marketization agenda,'' Barshefsky said. ``That gap has been 
bridged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, written by Procter &AMP; Gamble's John E. Pepper,  
chairman of the commission established by Congress and named by 
Clinton, was signed by, among others, Robert Shapiro of Monsanto 
Co., Curtis H. Barnette of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Thomas J. Donahue 
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and 
Jay Mazur, president of UNITE!, a New York-based labor union. 
</P>
<P>
	``While, not surprisingly, all of our members are not in  
agreement on every element of this agenda, a strong majority ... 
believe that the U.S. negotiating agenda as a whole is bold and 
appropriately comprehensive,'' said the letter, obtained by The 
Associated Press. ``We believe that if achieved, it will result in 
better jobs, higher living standards and increased economic 
opportunities for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thea Lee, a trade expert at the AFL-CIO, said that labor's  
endorsement of the administration's negotiating strategy should not 
be seen as an abandonment of labor's concerns about the WTO and its 
historical lack of consideration for labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept of the ACTPN letter was broad support for many of  
the U.S. goals, including putting forward a working group on trade 
and labor,'' Lee said. ``We have a lot of other issues and we have 
a lot of critiques of the WTO that aren't changed by our signing 
onto the ACTPN letter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting with Prodi also yielded what Barshefsky said were  
``encouraging'' signs in the standoff between the United States and 
Europe over exports of beef and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be cautious here because we know these two issues  
are difficult for European policy,'' Barshefsky said. ``But there 
seems to be renewed vigor on the part of Europe to reach mutually 
agreeable solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has imposed punitive tariffs on more than $300  
million of European products in retaliation for the 15-nation 
European Union's refusal to abide by WTO decisions involving 
American beef and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodi and Clinton also agreed to coordinate efforts to get  
developing countries committed to the new round of international 
trade negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Two Stockbrokers Found Dead in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Two brokers who sold penny stocks via  
the Internet were shot to death gangland-style inside a New Jersey 
mansion in a crime that has baffled investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an execution. Reasons, we're not certain yet,''  
Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends found Alain Chalem, 41, and Mayir Lehmann, 37, face down  
early Tuesday on the marble floor of the estate Chalem shared with 
his girlfriend and her 13-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem had been shot in the chest and five times in the head,  
while Lehmann, who lived in Woodmere, N.Y., was shot in the leg and 
once in the back of the head. Their cellular telephones were inches 
from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The men traded stocks for investors on a Web site operated from  
the mansion. Investigators said they had no idea if the trading had 
anything to do with their slayings. And Kaye said there was no sign 
of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said he had no suspects and no murder weapon.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this county, there are about a dozen homicides a year and  
they are not `whodunits,''' Kaye said. ``This is an unusual 
killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem had lived on the 16-acre estate for seven or eight months  
with Kimberly Scarola, 39, and her son. Ms. Scarola had gone to 
Florida, several days before the shootings, and her son was with 
her ex-husband, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends found the wrought-iron gates to the home open, the front  
door unlocked and no signs of forced entry. The white brick home 
with a towering fountain is in a wealthy community of 8,500 about 
an hour from New York City.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. said Wednesday its  
third-quarter earnings rose 13 percent on strong growth in domestic 
beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, Michelob and other beers  
earned $462 million, or 97 cents per share, on sales of $3.22 
billion. That was up from earnings of $408 million, or 84 cents per 
share, on sales of $3.12 billion in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were 2 cents above the average estimate of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. But the company's stock 
fell $1.50 a share to $67.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Domestic beer industry fundamentals are the best we have seen  
in this decade,'' chairman August A. Busch III said. ``Improving 
demographics, high capacity utilization and an improved pricing 
environment are creating opportunities for margin enhancement and 
earnings growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Busch said the company expects earnings to be strong again in  
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Anheuser-Busch reported  
earnings of $1.21 billion, or $2.53 per share, compared with income 
of $1.06 billion, or $2.18 per share in 1998. Sales for the nine 
months were $8.99 billion, up from $8.64 billion in the year 
earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweiser is the nation's best-selling beer, and Bud Light is  
tops among light beers. The company's domestic market share for the 
nine months, excluding exports, was 47.2 percent, up from 46.3 
percent a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> 3 Arrested in NYC School Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three high school students were arrested  
Wednesday on charges of beating and sexually assaulting a 
16-year-old girl in a school bathroom, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was punched in the face. Her hands were bound,'' said  
Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. ``She was strangled with 
a belt and left unconscious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th grade victim was found partially clothed with her hands  
tied behind her back about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday at Bayside High School 
when a passing student heard someone moaning. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim told police she was struck from behind, dragged into  
a basement bathroom and choked into unconsciousness. A swim meet 
was taking place nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Three fellow students, 18-year-olds Leon Elkech, Parrish Jones  
and Jonathan Mendoza, were charged Wednesday with sodomy, 
kidnapping, sexual abuse and assault, said Deputy Chief Patrick 
Timlin. 
</P>
<P>
	All three made videotaped confessions, Timlin said. None has a  
prior criminal record.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Debate Begins Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley began their  
Democratic campaign debate without waiting for the opening whistle 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we do now?'' Gore said shortly after the pair was  
introduced to the audience at Dartmouth College, before the debate 
was to begin airing on national television. Taking charge of the 
event, the vice president said: ``Why don't you start asking some 
questions while we're waiting?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So they did.  
</P>
<P>
	The first question was about bipartisanship, and both pledged to  
work with Republicans and Democrats alike. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN, co-sponsor of the debate, continued to air its regularly  
scheduled show, ``Crossfire,'' rather than cut to the debate early. 
WMUR-TV in New Hampshire also did not cover the early start. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN spokeswoman Maggie Simpson, on the set and whispering into a  
phone while the candidates spoke off-air, said CNN's coverage was 
scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``They decided to take some questions on their own,'' Simpson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hannon, the cable network's political director, said it  
would have been impossible to jump right to the candidates without 
microphone checks and other pre-broadcast adjustments. The 
situation also raised equal-time concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no ability at that point to control the amount of time  
each of the candidates was taking or even be sure that Bradley was 
going to play,'' Hannon said after the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was Vice President Al Gore's decision.''

<HEADLINE> Insurance Settlement Gets Early OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Two insurance companies that sold policies  
to people seeking to protect themselves against future steep 
nursing care costs have agreed to pay $14.7 million to settle a 
lawsuit alleging fraud, an attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which has been given preliminary approval by a  
magistrate, could benefit hundreds of people in North Dakota and 
two other states. It would affect those who either dropped their 
long-term care insurance policies or continue to pay high premiums, 
said Thomas Dickson of Bismarck, one of the lead attorneys for the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement arose from a lawsuit filed by three North  
Dakotans. They accused Ohio-based Acceleration Life Insurance Co. 
and Kentucky-based Commonwealth Life Insurance Co. of fraudulently 
selling long-term care insurance policies at prices that were too 
low and then dramatically raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The average premium increase in North Dakota between 1989 and  
1996 was 629 percent, Dickson said. As a result, many policyholders 
were forced to dump their coverage, according to the lawsuit, which 
was granted class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	Acceleration and Commonwealth denied the accusations in court  
filings, saying the coverage was priced properly and that the 
policies did not violate North Dakota insurance law. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Tepper, an attorney for Acceleration Life, declined to  
comment on the settlement Wednesday. An attorney for Commonwealth 
Life did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, people who dropped their policies will be  
partially reimbursed. Dickson said the percentage of premiums they 
will get back depends on how many people submit claims. He did not 
immediately know how many people bought policies from the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiums also will be reduced for people who held onto their  
policies, Dickson said. The reduction in premiums is valued at $2.1 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was to have gone to trial Oct. 4, but was postponed  
days before when lawyers began working on a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a case, but the class we were representing  
was extremely elderly,'' Dickson said. ``We wanted to get some 
relief for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Karen Klein has given preliminary approval to  
the deal. People who bought the policies in question must decide in 
the next month and a half whether to participate. A final hearing 
on the settlement is scheduled for Dec. 7 in Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also applies to residents of Wyoming and Florida  
who bought the policies in question. Similar lawsuits were filed in 
those states by Allan Kanner, a New Orleans lawyer who is one of 
the lead attorneys in the North Dakota case. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care insurance covers a certain amount of custodial  
care for the elderly or sick in their own homes, or in nursing 
homes. The policies are a popular way for older people to protect 
their estates from being depleted by high nursing care costs.

<HEADLINE> Haunted House Fashioned From Junk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- Books fly off shelves in the cobweb-lined  
library. In the tiny church, a bloodstained priest conducts an 
exorcism as a tin-can snake jumps out of the holy water bowl. In 
the evil veterinary laboratory of Dr. Mel Practice, a toilet seat 
rattles the nerves when its lid flies up with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't believe an old toilet can be scary, you've never  
met Peter Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The commode is among the discarded objects recovered from junk  
yards and trash bins that Wing has incorporated into 
``Frankenstein's Fortress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff that you picked out from a Dumpster has that trashed-out  
look that you can't get with new materials,'' Wing said. ``Death 
and decay is unsettling -- and that's what we're going for here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The enormous, scream-inducing Halloween attraction in this town  
80 miles north of New York City, takes visitors on a harrowing, 
10-minute journey through a Transylvanian graveyard, a wicked 
witches' forest, Miss Ann Thrope's fortuneteller's den, the Mad 
Hatter's tea party, an opium den, an execution yard and 
Frankenstein's lab, where the 7-foot monster makes a brief 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing, 52, started building the fortress on town property last  
year -- the town commissioned him for the job. It will remain an 
annual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 80 children and adolescents turn out each October  
weekend night to work at the fortress. All must be members of the 
Stanford Recreation Program in order to take part. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is community theater,'' Wing said. ``This isn't like  
sports, where you have to be a certain height or size. Any child 
can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``cast'' also includes more than 200 adults who sew  
costumes, apply makeup, do construction work or sell tickets. Local 
residents donated an old school bus and a speaker system that pumps 
out creepy sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun making people scream,'' said 11-year-old actor Eban  
Coenen, who plays a different role each night. ``By the time they 
get to me, they're so scared that I think I could do anything and 
they would freak.''

<HEADLINE> Voters Undecided on Philly Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With less than a week left before the city's  
mayoral election, nearly one-quarter of likely voters are still 
undecided and the candidates are running neck-and-neck, according 
to a poll released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat John F. Street has 39 percent of the vote and  
Republican Sam Katz 38 percent, with a margin of error of plus or 
minus 4 percentage points, according to the Keystone Poll by the 
Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, who is white, is seeking to become the city's first  
Republican mayor in 52 years. Street is trying to be the city's 
second black mayor. More than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.4 
million residents are black. The city has seven Democrats for every 
two Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found 23 percent of likely voters said they were still  
undecided. Of those, 74 percent are registered Democrats, 64 
percent are female and 47 percent are black, said G. Terry Madonna, 
the poll's director. 
</P>
<P>
	National Democratic leaders have mobilized on Street's behalf.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, visited  
Philadelphia to campaign for Street, and President Clinton plans to 
do the same Friday. Clinton also called a local talk radio show 
from the White House on Monday to discuss how the election could 
affect politics across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz has not brought in any GOP leaders to help his campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	The poll was based on a telephone survey conducted Oct. 22-24  
among a random sample of 606 likely voters.

<HEADLINE> UNLV Basketball Coach Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- UNLV basketball coach Bill Bayno will miss his  
team's Mountain West Conference opener against BYU because he 
missed a mandatory conference coach's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mountain West suspended Bayno for the Jan. 10 game for  
failing to comply with league rules that required him to attend 
last week's coaches meeting on basketball media day in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno will be allowed to attend the game but will not be  
permitted on the bench or within 100 feet of the locker room. Bayno 
said associate Glynn Cyprien would coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive committee of the conference management council  
voted 2-0 to suspend Bayno. 
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was right there in the guy's town, so it was hard  
for the council to be sympathetic,'' league commissioner Craig 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno said he was not aware he had to be at the meeting, which  
was attended by the league's seven other coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk to my players about being on time,'' Bayno said. ``This  
is a good lesson for them.''

<HEADLINE> US Army Investigates Europe Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) -- The U.S. Army appointed an  
investigator today to examine sex charges against its 
highest-ranking enlisted soldier in Europe, the 5th Corps 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Command Sgt. Maj. Riley C. Miller was charged last week with  
sodomy, kidnapping, assault and mistreating a subordinate. His 
commander, Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, suspended Miller from his 
duties last month and reassigned him. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator, who was not identified in keeping with Army  
practice, will conduct hearings and make a recommendation on 
whether to hold a court martial, deal with the case 
administratively or drop it. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations were made by a female soldier at the U.S.  
military community in Hanau, just outside Frankfurt, said 5th Corps 
spokeswoman Hilde Patton. The alleged misconduct happened in 
mid-April, an Army statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who represents the interests of all enlisted Army  
soldiers in Europe, has been the senior sergeant major for U.S. 
Army Europe for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a highly decorated infantry soldier and Vietnam veteran  
who has served in the Army for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton said she could not predict how long the investigator  
would take to review the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen it take two to three weeks, I've seen it take two  
months,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have refused requests for interviews, Patton  
said. She had no information on Miller's response to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe follows several other high-profile cases involving  
allegations of sexual misconduct in the Army in recent years. The 
Pentagon has tightened guidelines to prevent fraternization between 
male and female soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside U.S. Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, Army Capt.  
Cleveland Murphy said military officials were setting a positive 
example by investigating a high-ranking soldier like Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to give the man a fair shake,'' he said. ``If it's not  
true, we don't want to slander him. If it is true, the Army is 
going to go through its course and do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, then the highest-ranking  
enlisted soldier for the entire Army, was acquitted of 18 counts 
alleging sexual harassment of six military women. But he was 
convicted of obstruction of justice, demoted and reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the U.S. Army took the highly unusual step of  
demoting a retired general, David Hale, who admitted during a 
court-martial last spring that he had adulterous affairs with the 
wives of four subordinates.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Accuser To Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman who claims boxer Oscar De La Hoya  
raped her when she was 15 plans to appeal a judge's decision that 
upheld De La Hoya's refusal to answer questions about his sexual 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, now 18, is suing De La Hoya, claiming she was raped  
in 1996 at a hotel in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. De La Hoya denies the 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's attorney, Taras Kick, said after a hearing Tuesday  
that they are seeking to establish that De La Hoya has a ``fetish'' 
with young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Chapman, De La Hoya's attorney, said the judge's ruling  
means the boxer ``does not have to answer further questions.''

<HEADLINE> Young Not Ready To Call it Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *By DENNIS GEORGATOS    	
</P>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young will be sidelined for the  
foreseeable future, but he's not ready to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to (play again) if it's appropriate,'' the San  
Francisco 49ers quarterback said at a news conference today. ``Yet 
it very well might not happen this season. If time runs out on the 
season, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Leigh Steinberg said Tuesday he doesn't think Young, still  
bothered by post-concussion symptoms, will play again this year. 
The team and Young's doctors appear to feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking this thing to the end of the season,'' the two-time  
NFL MVP said. ``My focus right now clearly is on my health, but I 
am also focusing on my team. That's all I'm going to think about 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the possibility was raised earlier that he would go on  
injured reserve today, that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined he not risk anything more this year,''  
Steinberg said Tuesday. ``He's probably going to end up on injured 
reserve. This is a football injury. He was hurt on the field and 
that's where those players go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said there would be no decision on retirement until  
after the season. But he added that Young will abide by the final 
medical consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come to the right decision, but this will take a  
little time,'' the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Young's primary neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg,  
no relation to the agent, made a long-term recommendation about 
whether Young should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Today was the first time since then that the 38-year-old  
quarterback has spoken with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dr. Steinberg's opinion hasn't been disclosed, Young has  
conceded the report was ``discouraging.'' His agent has said the 
opinion has been reaffirmed by other specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Young continued to refuse to discuss his doctor's long-term  
recommendations, but said, ``He's telling me I can't play right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like any injury,'' he added. ``You have to give it time  
to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to speak with contemporaries who were forced out  
of the game by repeated concussions, including Al Toon and Merrill 
Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also gathering more medical advice and may see another  
specialist this week. But coach Steve Mariucci and general manager 
Bill Walsh have both said that they would give greatest weight to 
Dr. Steinberg's conclusions, and they are in no hurry to see Young 
back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Young could be at risk for permanent brain damage from another  
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Monday the team, which has a bye this week, hopes  
to resolve Young's status in the next week or two and said injured 
reserve was a possibility. It would allow Young an extended period 
away from football while not shutting the door on a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Young has no real hope of receiving medical clearance to  
play any time soon, he remains optimistic that his condition will 
clear, leaving at least a possibility of a return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Young feels strong responsibility to the team, especially now  
that it's struggling without him. 
</P>
<P>
	By going on injured reserve, though, he could get treatment  
while remaining with the team as a locker room and sideline 
presence and mentor to his replacement, Jeff Garcia.

	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators today said they have recovered  
about a fourth of the wreckage of golfer Payne Stewart's Learjet, 
including oxygen masks, an engine, some human remains and a set of 
golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	A large piece of fuselage remains in the 10-foot-deep crater dug  
by the jet when it crashed Monday, said Bob Benzon, an investigator 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the right engine was virtually intact and the left  
engine was broken into several large sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews also found several passenger oxygen masks, which Benzon  
said might allow investigators to determine whether the masks 
deployed from the jet's ceiling before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet took off from Orlando, Fla., for Dallas and flew four  
hours before running out of fuel and slamming nose-first into the 
ground near Mina. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed with Stewart were his agents, Robert Fraley and Van  
Ardan; pilots Michael Kling, 43, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue, 27; 
and Bruce Borland, 40, one of Jack Nicklaus' golf course designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews hope to find the valves that control the cabin pressure to  
determine whether the devices failed before the plane flew 1,400 
miles on autopilot and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts fear human remains may not reveal whether the  
plane's occupants died after the aircraft suddenly lost pressure. 
The plane had no flight data recorder, and the cockpit voice 
recorder -- a 30-minute loop of tape that may have been erased 
during the crucial first hour of Monday's flight -- hasn't been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	More human remains and some personal items had been brought out,  
Benzon said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``A large bag of golf clubs has been recovered,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said crews hope to soon find the recorder, which could be in  
the general area of the tail section. That portion of the plane was 
being removed at midday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the debris was embedded in mud and soil within a  
10-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide crater, NTSB vice chairman Bob Francis 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the aircraft was pretty much vertical when it  
hit the ground,'' he said Tuesday. ``The ground is soft, and it 
went in fairly deep. It's going to be a challenge, with the 
wreckage and sorting out what's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators planned to reassemble as much of the wreckage as  
possible at a hangar at Aberdeen's airport about 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are focusing on a theory that the plane's cabin may  
have suddenly depressurized, which could have caused the crew and 
passengers to blackout or die. Proving that will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plane's last radio transmission above Gainesville, Fla.,  
the pilot was instructed to climb to 39,000 feet. Planes that fly 
above 12,000 feet are pressurized because the air does not contain 
enough oxygen for people to breathe comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a videotape made by fighter pilots who chased after the  
plane may yield few clues because the Learjet's windows were 
frosted over in the minus-70 degree atmosphere. ``The quality is 
probably not going to be good enough to help us,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, federal regulators ordered that valves that  
regulate pressure on Learjets be replaced to ``prevent rapid 
decompression of the airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration also limited planes to an  
altitude of 41,000 feet until the valves were replaced because of 
the possibility they could fail. The FAA gave owners 18 months to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
	James Watkins, president of Sunjet Aviation, of Sanford, Fla.,  
which operated the Learjet, said today the oxygen valves had been 
replaced in 1995 by the previous owner. He didn't know the exact 
date, the number of valves replaced or their size. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was before it was in our possession. In other words, we  
didn't actually do it, but we have the logs on the airplane since 
it was born in 1976 and we do have a copy of the 337 showing that 
that was done in 1995,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said today his agency has been told that a piece of  
equipment called a modulator valve had been changed Saturday as 
routine maintenance. It's one of two such valves on the jet which 
bleed air from the engine for cabin pressurization and air 
conditioning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said both valves run all the time but if one quits, the other  
can do the job. ``It's a maintenance anomaly that just happened to 
be repaired,'' Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure inside an aircraft cabin is determined by a careful  
regulation of air flowing in and out. In the case of Stewart's 
plane, air was siphoned off the two jet engines, adjusted for the 
proper temperature and then piped into the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Valves at the front and rear of an aircraft automatically open  
and close as the altitude increases or decreases, maintaining a 
survivable pressure for the people on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old, eight-passenger plane had logged more than  
10,000 hours of flight time but had no history of serious 
mechanical problems, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Business Aviation Association says that amount of  
flight time is slightly more than the 400-hours-per-year average 
for such aircraft, but not unusual because the plane was used as an 
air charter.

<HEADLINE> Re-enactment Offends Columbine High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A Halloween display at a Texas church featuring a  
re-enactment of the April massacre at Columbine High School has 
offended and shocked some of those connected to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Hell House'' at Trinity Church in Cedar Hill, Texas,  
features a skit in which young actors dressed in trench coats 
re-enact the shooting in which 15 were killed and more than 26 were 
wounded. The skit ends with the gunmen being sent to Hell. 
</P>
<P>
	The parent of two Columbine students, Nancy Shakowski, said the  
Assembly of God church made a poor choice by choosing Columbine as 
a theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm repulsed by it,'' she told the Denver Rocky Mountain News.  
``I don't know what purpose it serves. My family will live with 
this forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughters, Jill and Courtney, attend the school in Littleton  
where seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire with guns 
and bombs before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity's youth pastor, Tim Ferguson, has said he must scare  
teen-agers in order to save them from sin and another attack like 
the one at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I can make one person think not to do it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson told the newspaper the re-enactment is tasteful.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not graphic,'' he said. ``There is no blood.''  
</P>
<P>
	The skit begins with two boys playing violent computer games and  
planning an attack, then donning trench coats and going into a 
library. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl in the library prays to God before the gunmen kill her  
and then themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus appears and rewards the girl. The boys are taken to Hell  
after insisting the attack was ``just a game, we didn't think we'd 
have to pay a price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The portrayal of the Columbine attack is not unusual for  
Trinity, which has staged other school shooting scenes over the 
past several years. Last year, it focused on the West Paducah, Ky., 
shooting.

<HEADLINE> Oil Overflow Spills Into Del. River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELAWARE CITY, Del. (AP) -- A storage hold overflowed on a barge  
loading oil from a refinery dock early Wednesday, spilling about 
100 barrels of oil into the Delaware River. 
</P>
<P>
	A sensitive bird rookery on Pea Patch Island, located less than  
a mile from the Motiva refinery, wasn't threatened by the spill, 
officials said. But about a dozen mallards were caught in the oil, 
and a firm that rescues animals from oil spills was called to 
assist the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	A barge crew was pumping oil into the barge before dawn  
Wednesday and didn't notice the hold was overflowing until about 
100 barrels had spilled, said Jan Morrill, a spokeswoman for 
Motiva, operated jointly by Shell, Texaco and Saudi Armaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers tried to contain the spill with booms, but the oil  
spread several miles down the coast from Delaware City, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams from the refinery, the Delaware Bay and River Cooperative,  
and the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental 
Control expected to have the oil cleaned up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The barge's owner did not return a message seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Lab Computers Limit Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists from sensitive countries such as  
China or Iran are to be barred from connecting with Energy 
Department computers that contain even unclassified information 
beneficial to a nuclear weapons programs, says a department 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have a policy out within the next five days that will  
greatly tighten foreign access'' to computers at the department's 
weapons laboratories, department security director Eugene Habiger 
told a House Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That policy is part of broad plans to tighten security at the  
nuclear weapons labs after security lapses allegedly allowed China 
to obtain nuclear secrets at a New Mexico lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal security investigations of the three weapons labs  
raised the prospect this summer that foreign scientists are allowed 
too much access to computer networks with unclassified information, 
Habiger said. Department officials worry that information on the 
computers, while not officially classified, could be used by 
knowledgeable scientists to aid other countries' weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the House panel said they were skeptical of  
claims by Energy officials of progress toward solving security 
problems at the labs, which have been criticized for security 
lapses for years in internal reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that this time what we're hearing is the truth,'' said  
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. ``We hope that this time there will 
be change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreign scientists, including some from 25 ``sensitive''  
countries, have been cleared to access unclassified computer 
systems at the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national 
laboratories, said Brad Peterson, an Energy Department computer 
security expert. One scientist from Iran, for example, has access 
to the unclassified system at Los Alamos, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos spokesman Jim Danneskiold said countries considered  
sensitive are: Algeria, Cuba, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North 
Korea, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, China, including Hong 
Kong, and the former Soviet republics of Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, 
Tajikstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Signs Jeeves the Butler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, whose  
clients include Robin Williams and Cameron Diaz, said Wednesday 
he's taking on some new talent: the fictional Internet gofer Jeeves 
the butler. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz has teamed up with Ask Jeeves Inc., which uses the  
butler's character on its Ask.com search site as a kind of 
Web-surfing domestic servant to track down information for computer 
users. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask Jeeves has retained Ovitz's Lynx Technology Group LLC and  
his talent agency, Artists Management Group, to help take the 
butler beyond the Internet with potential merchandising, animation 
and placement in movies and television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said ``kind, sweet or acerbic butlers'' have a long  
history in entertainment, including Lurch from ``The Addams 
Family'' and John Gielgud's regal character in the movie 
``Arthur.'' Jeeves has potential to become a hit with fans outside 
the World Wide Web, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not going to be a full-length movie about him. That's  
unrealistic,'' Ovitz said. ``But there's a lot of opportunity for 
tie-ins using the character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike search engines that require users to enter key words that  
can bring up links to hundreds of Web sites, Ask Jeeves operates a 
site that allows Internet browsers to type in real-language 
questions. Jeeves then directs users to an appropriate site chosen 
by the company's editors. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, someone who types in a question seeking information  
about Mark Twain is taken to a site about the author created by the 
University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company operates similar search sites for children and  
corporate users. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole notion of having this butler there to help get  
things and aggregate information is very appealing to people,'' 
said Ted Briscoe, senior vice president and general manager of 
Ask.com's consumer question answering service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without sounding flip, we don't know how far this extends,''  
Briscoe said. ``The more we get into it, the more we'll see what 
kind of legs this character has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The character is similar to, but not based on, the valet Jeeves  
in humorist P.G. Wodehouse's novels, Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's background as a Hollywood superagent will allow Ask  
Jeeves to tap into his contacts and insider knowledge of the 
entertainment industry, Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask Jeeves would not disclose financial specifics of its deal  
with Ovitz. Briscoe said Ovitz's companies would receive consulting 
fees plus a cut of revenues depending on the performance of Ask 
Jeeves' business.

<HEADLINE> Psychologists Seek Help for Anxiety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- This time, the psychologists are seeking  
professional help to relieve anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists in New York upset over their treatment by managed  
care plans have chosen a unique therapy: allying with unionized 
teachers. The New York State Psychological Association will be 
fully affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers and its 
state chapter by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It might seem strange for a group of professionals who tend to  
be independent. But the alliance is a move designed to strengthen 
both parties. The 3,200-member state professional group gains 
instant clout for lobbying and battling HMOs. And the union gains 
what could be a valuable toehold in expanding its membership base. 
</P>
<P>
	In a time when professional insecurity is rising to the level  
where even doctors are unionizing, analysts say the move by the New 
York psychologists could be a bellwether. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're going to see more and more of this rather than  
less and less,'' said labor expert Alan Draper of St. Lawrence 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was inked Oct. 4 to ally the psychological association  
with AFT and its 420,000-member state chapter, the New York State 
United Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychologists do not become union members with collective  
bargaining rights. But the psychologists hope the alliance is 
enough to strengthen their hand with health maintenance 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Horror stories about HMOs are common among psychologists -- extra  
paperwork, low reimbursements, patient treatment cut short. New 
York City psychologist Noemi Balinth recalls a suicidal teen-ager 
being approved for only five sessions with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's infuriating to have denials on patients where there very  
clearly is a continuing need to see them,'' said Balinth, 
president-elect of NYSPA. ``And the clerk on the other end of the 
line is saying `No, you've seen them enough now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By linking with the union, the psychologists increase their  
government lobbying power. New York State United Teachers is a 
powerhouse in Albany, annually among the top statewide campaign 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The union already represents school psychologists and other  
professional health care workers. But AFT President Sandra Feldman 
said the move keeps the union ``on the cutting edge'' as labor 
conducts expansion into new areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Psychologists are hardly the only health care professionals  
flirting with unions. The American Medical Association made 
headlines this summer by backing a union of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	There is other evidence that union ideals are gaining ground in  
the health care field: 
</P>
<P>
	--Texas recently approved a measure that allows doctors to  
bargain collectively with health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 74,000 homecare workers who tend to the sick and elderly  
in the Los Angeles area in February voted overwhelmingly to 
unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	--The American Nurses Association voted in June to create a new  
entity to support collective bargaining efforts by state nurse 
associations. The ANA also is exploring AFL-CIO affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no word on other psychological associations  
affiliating with unions. However, Russ Newman of the American 
Psychological Association said other state groups are watching to 
see how the New York experiment works out. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornell University labor studies professor Richard Hurd warns it  
could be ``torturous'' for professional associations and unions to 
figure out how much they have in common. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Balinth said some of the psychologists have had to be  
disabused of the stereotype of unions as a ``blue-collar thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurd also noted: ``This might be the future of labor.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Says `No' to 2000 Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura tried again Wednesday to  
clear up questions about his presidential ambitions by issuing a 
resounding ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the Reform Party governor had told Harvard  
Current magazine that he would consider running if Minnesotans 
mobilized behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said that I'm not running, that I won't run and they said to  
me, 'Well what if it means saving the third-party movement?''' 
Ventura told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I said, if indeed it got to that point, it would require  
the people of Minnesota to come out and say, 'It's OK, governor, 
run for president.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized, ``It does not mean I'm doing it. I said that  
would simply be one thing that would have to happen, but the 'nos' 
preceded that. No no no. I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also acknowledged his long-standing policy of never  
saying never to anything, and blamed the media for contorting his 
comments to make something out of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, I don't know if tomorrow, anything can happen  
tomorrow. But I tell you no means no and you don't believe me for 
whatever reason,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Harvard student interviewers were ``really begging''  
him to run in an attempt to save the third party and that he was 
clear he wouldn't run. 
</P>
<P>
	Before climbing into his Lincoln Navigator and riding off,  
Ventura joked that he might quickly change his mind, turn around 
and say, ``Yes, I'm running!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, who joined the Reform Party on Monday and is  
seeking its presidential nomination, plans several stops in 
Minnesota on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the possibility of meeting with Buchanan, Ventura said,  
``It's not on my schedule.'' Would he support Buchanan as the 
party's nominee? ``I plan to have no comment,'' Ventura said.

<HEADLINE> UConn Favorite in Big East Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Connecticut, the defending NCAA and Big East  
champion, was the runaway No. 1 choice by the league's coaches in 
the preseason poll released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, who return three starters from the team that beat  
Duke for the national championship last season, received 10 of a 
possible 13 first-place votes. Coaches do not place their own teams 
on their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Syracuse received the remaining No. 1 votes and 131 points, nine  
fewer than Connecticut. St. John's was third with 119 points and 
Miami, which got the other first-place vote, was fourth with 114. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown was fifth with 97 points and was followed by  
Villanova (82), Seton Hall (73), Rutgers (68), Notre Dame (60), 
Providence (45), West Virginia (34), Pittsburgh (30) and Boston 
College (19). 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Khalid El-Amin was chosen as the preseason player of the  
year, the second straight season a Connecticut junior received the 
honor. It is the fourth time a Connecticut player was tabbed for it 
with Richard Hamilton last season, Donyell Marshall in 1993-94 and 
Corny Thompson in 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining El-Amin on the preseason first team were seniors Johnny  
Hemsley of Miami and Etan Thomas of Syracuse and sophomores Troy 
Murphy of Notre Dame and Erick Barkley of St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemsley was selected the conference's most improved player last  
season, while Thomas was the defensive player of the year and 
Murphy the rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time more than one sophomore was voted to the  
first team since 1982-83 when Patrick Ewing of Georgetown, Chris 
Mullin of St. John's and Ed Pinckney of Villanova were selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The second team was all seniors, forwards Kevin Freeman of  
Connecticut, Isaac Hawkins of Pittsburgh and Marcus Goree of West 
Virginia and guards Bootsy Thornton of St. John's and Jason Hart of 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's Ajou Deng, a 6-foot-11 sophomore who sat out last  
season to concentrate on academics, was chosen the preseason rookie 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin and Deng are the first teammates to be chosen for the  
individual preseason awards since 1990-91 when Syracuse's Billy 
Owens and freshman Adrian Autry were selected.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Jets Bomb Downtown Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Diving Russian jets bombed downtown Grozny  
today in some of the heaviest airstrikes against the Chechen 
capital since federal troops invaded the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Large plumes of smoke rose over Grozny and houses were damaged  
on the eastern side of the city. Pairs of Russian jets roared over 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen officials said 38 civilians were killed and about 100  
injured in the strikes. The numbers could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most serious attack on the city since a rocket strike  
on a downtown market on Oct. 21 killed at least 150 people. Russian 
jets bombed industrial targets in Grozny's suburbs in September. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin said today that Moscow was determined to  
press ahead with its campaign. He said Russian forces would 
``destroy the center of international terrorism in Chechnya and let 
people live calmly and peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian soldiers and officers are bringing peace back to the  
long-suffering Chechen land. Every day and hour they display 
courage and heroism, cleansing Chechnya of bandits,'' he said in 
his most extensive comments yet on the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the homes destroyed was the residence of Chechen warlord  
Shamil Basayev, who led Islamic militants in two attacks against 
the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will force Russian prisoners of war to restore all those  
houses,'' Basayev said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russian forces in eastern Chechnya took control of  
four villages and surrounded two others, Russian Defense Ministry 
spokesman Gennady Alyokhin said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian forces in the region were focusing air and artillery  
raids on the nearby city of Gudermes, Alyokhin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four captured settlements -- Azamat-Yurt, Stepnoye, Nizhni  
Gerzel and Kadi-Yurt -- lie along a strategically important highway 
running east to Dagestan and just a few miles from Gudermes, the 
Russian military command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, is 20 miles east of  
Grozny. Seizing it would be a major step toward full Russian 
control of eastern Chechnya, but the city has been well fortified 
by militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interfax news agency, citing the Russian air force, said  
Russian jets had flown 34 missions over the region, killing an 
estimated 100 militants. The death toll could not be independently 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Militant leaders said they had killed more than 400 Russians in  
fighting Tuesday, but that number was believed to be exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive in the east came as Russian tanks and soldiers  
closed in on Grozny from the north. Chechen militants traded fire 
with them two miles from the city's outskirts and battled Russian 
forces in Tolstoy-Yurt village, to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen commanders appeared confident about defending the  
capital, where guerrillas inflicted severe losses on the Russian 
army in street fighting during the 1994-96 Chechen war. The 
Chechens say they have built concrete bunkers and other sturdy 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has sent mixed messages over whether it will try to take  
Grozny. After early successes, the Russian military now appears to 
be trying to occupy all of the republic and end its de facto 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow Interior Ministry troops commander Arkady Baskayev said  
today that the capital would definitely be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, of course, and not only Grozny. Time doesn't matter, the  
main thing is to be well-prepared for the operation and take 
(Grozny) without big losses,'' he said in an interview on the Echo 
of Moscow radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian troops entered Chechnya in September, with the stated  
mission of wiping out Islamic militants who twice raided a 
neighboring Russian region this summer and are blamed for four 
apartment blasts in Russian cities that killed 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chechen government has no control over the militants, but  
its forces are fighting side by side with the rebels against the 
Russian offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said today that the bomb  
attack Oct. 21 at a Grozny market had been aimed at his 
presidential palace. He said the Russians had used a tactical 
missile with cluster bombs for maximum casualties, and claimed that 
282 people had been killed in the attack. Earlier Chechen reports 
gave a death toll of about 150. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have issued contradictory statements on the  
attack, with some denying it occurred and others saying it had been 
directed at arms-sellers in Grozny. Others have said the casualty 
figures were exaggerated.

<HEADLINE> Daly's Fear of Flying Heightened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- While more at ease with life since he  
ended two years of sobriety, John Daly still has an almost 
overwhelming fear of flying that got worse when Payne Stewart was 
killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not even wanting to get on a plane to go anywhere  
right now,'' Daly said playing a practice round Tuesday at the 
Southern Farm Bureau Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they are safer and it's the best way to travel, but  
I've always said I like my chances in a car wreck before I do a 
plane crash, because nobody is going to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly arrived at Annadale Golf Club by car after driving more  
than six hours from the Dallas area rather than taking a one-hour 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Stewart and five others were killed while  
traveling in a Learjet only worsened Daly's fears. 
</P>
<P>
	``You expect some other kind of plane to go down before a  
Lear,'' Daly said. ``It was the only plane that I really felt safe 
in because of all of the safety features that it had. It was just 
like it was crash-proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for other aspects of his life, Daly insists he is more at  
ease since he ended his sobriety June 11 after missing the cut at 
the St. Jude Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	That cost Daly his endorsement with Callaway Golf and his  
primary source of income, but he says the freedom to make his own 
decisions has been more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot better. I felt like I was trying to do everything  
for everybody else instead of myself, and it was bringing me 
down,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the decision I made is right or wrong, but I  
still feel a little better about being able to make my own 
decisions and not having somebody over my shoulder all of the time 
watching every move I make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's five-year deal with Callaway, signed after he left rehab  
in April 1997, included a provision that he not drink or gamble. 
Chairman Ely Callaway offered to send Daly to an addiction 
specialist earlier this year, but Daly left after arriving at the 
undisclosed clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway, the 80-year-old chairman, was something of a father  
figure to Daly. Callaway said he had no choice but to drop the 
long-hitting golfer, who stood to earn about $3 million in the 
final two years of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. C basically made it too easy for me. The money was great,  
and I kind of backed off on practicing, and I think I was more 
worried about not drinking and not gambling than I was trying to 
play,'' Daly said. ``It took all of the energy out of me just 
trying not to do those two things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I've got a hunger in my belly to go out and play good  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he played in the Las Vegas Invitational this month, Daly  
said he gambled only for about an hour during the seven days he 
spent in the gambling mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even hardly gamble,'' Daly said. ``The drinking  
aspect of it, I feel like I've been doing great. I haven't even 
hardly drank to tell you the truth. It's not something I want to do 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that I can now and knowing that most everybody knows  
that I can, I'm not really doing it. The pressure's kind of gone. 
Now I can just go out and practice and play golf, and that's all 
I've got to worry about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly hasn't won since the 1995 British Open and is 163rd on the  
money list ($176,565) this year. He is not in danger of losing his 
PGA Tour card because of the 10-year exemption that came with his 
last win.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Jets Bomb Downtown Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Diving Russian jets bombed downtown Grozny  
today in some of the heaviest airstrikes against the Chechen 
capital since federal troops invaded the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Large plumes of smoke rose over Grozny and houses were damaged  
on the eastern side of the city. Pairs of Russian jets roared over 
the city.

<HEADLINE> Army Taps National Guard for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army said Wednesday it has scheduled three  
National Guard divisions to rotate with active duty divisions in 
commanding U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement is designed to make more use of reserve forces  
and increase their combat readiness while easing some of the 
peacekeeping burden on the active duty force. Army forces have been 
on peacekeeping duty in Bosnia since 1995 and there is no end in 
sight to the NATO-led mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Reservists have been on duty in Bosnia from the start. But now,  
for the first time, the Army is putting a National Guard division 
in charge of a combined ``team'' of active and reserve units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army had announced it would send Texas' 49th Armored  
Division in March 2000 to command a combined team of active duty 
and reserve forces in Bosnia in March 2000. On Wednesday, it 
announced a longer-term schedule that added two other National 
Guard divisions for command duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The deployment of the 49th Armored Division will mark the first  
time since the Korean War that a National Guard division has served 
in a contingency operation and commanded its own battalions, the 
Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 2000, the 3rd Infantry Division, an active duty unit  
from Fort Stewart, Ga., will command U.S. peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia, including a battalion task force made up of companies from 
the 30th Infantry Brigade of the North Carolina National Guard and 
the 45th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 2001, the 29th Infantry Division of the Maryland and  
Virginia National Guard will take over the command. It will be 
teamed with companies from the 10th Mountain Division from Fort 
Drum, N.Y., and the 155th Armor Brigade of the Mississippi National 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Ky., will take  
over as the active-duty headquarters in charge in April 2002, and 
will be teamed with companies from two National Guard units from 
Idaho, the 116th Armor Brigade and the 76th Infantry Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	From October 2002 to April 2003, the 28th Infantry Division of  
the Pennsylvania National Guard will be in command. It will be 
teamed with elements of the active duty 3rd Infantry Division from 
Fort Stewart, Ga.

<HEADLINE> Former Jets Player Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, N.Y. (AP) -- Cincinnati Bengals guard Matt O'Dwyer  
pleaded guilty Tuesday to disorderly conduct and third-degree 
assault in connection with a July bar brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wanted to get it behind him so he can focus on  
football,'' his lawyer, Stephen Scaring, said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer, who used to play for the New York Jets, originally was  
charged with assaulting police officers, harassment and disorderly 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to avoid the negative impact it was beginning to  
have on the team and to take advantage of the reduced charges,'' 
Scaring said of O'Dwyer's guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer will be sentenced Dec. 21 by Long Beach City Court Judge  
Roy Tepper. The judge has told O'Dwyer he will not serve time in 
jail, Nassau County District Attorney Frank Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer could be fined or ordered to perform community service.  
</P>
<P>
	John Elliott and Jason Fabini of the Jets, and O'Dwyer were  
drinking at Bogart's Bar and Restaurant in Long Beach one night 
when they began acting up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a tackle, triggered the brawl by urinating in a sink in  
the women's bathroom in the bar, then punching two patrons, police 
said. He was charged with misdemeanor assault, harassment and 
public lewdness. He faces up to a year in jail and fines. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer kicked out the window of a police car, sending shattered  
glass onto two officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabini, a tackle, was charged with disorderly conduct, a  
misdemeanor, and faces a maximum sentence of 15 days in jail and a 
fine.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Dixie Chicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Dixie Chicks and Clint Black are  
leading a small group of country music artists who are stretching 
the boundaries of the modern mainstream country album. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry standard for an album in Nashville is 10 carefully  
crafted songs designed to be radio hits. Breaking from that formula 
takes courage when lack of airplay can have a gigantic effect on 
sales -- and country music radio stations are among the most 
stylistically and topically conservative in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	So why would the Dixie Chicks risk their status as the latest  
darlings of radio programmers by including pointed songs about 
murder and sex on their new album, ``Fly''? 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess after you sell 6 million records and counting, you get  
to kind of call more shots,'' Dixie Chick Martie Seidel says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not the only ones taking chances.  
</P>
<P>
	Garth Brooks is promoting an album of pop-rock music under the  
name Chris Gaines. The album will tie into ``The Lamb,'' a movie 
set for next year, with Brooks playing Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Stuart released ``The Pilgrim'' earlier this year. It's  
reminiscent of classic Willie Nelson concept albums of the 1970s 
like ``The Red Headed Stranger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relative newcomer Gary Allan is having some success with ``Smoke  
Rings in the Dark,'' a moody single recalling pop singer Chris 
Isaak. 
</P>
<P>
	And just out is ``D'lectrified,'' Clint Black's ``unplugged''  
album. 
</P>
<P>
	Black took the acoustic concept further than the ``greatest hits  
on stools'' idea begun by MTV. He used only acoustic instruments, 
but the album sounds as full and brash as an electric album since 
he used creative arrangements and horn sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Black's album has guest appearances by Waylon Jennings, Eric  
Idle, Edgar Winter, Kenny Loggins and Bruce Hornsby, and the songs 
are a grab bag of Black originals, old classics by heroes like 
Jennings, Toy Caldwell and Leon Russell, and three remakes of old 
Black hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, a pretty fair harmonica player, stretches out on the  
instrument a couple of times on the album. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a cliche, but really I want to learn,'' Black  
says. ``I look at guys like James Taylor -- his albums are better 
today than they ever were, after 20 or 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be able to have that said about me, and that's the  
only way that you do it, is if you reach for something that's just 
out of reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial success of these gambles has been mixed, and many of  
the more far-out songs won't ever be released as singles. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Cook, who helps program more than 250 country stations  
as a vice president of the Westwood One Radio Network, thinks the 
radio industry should be more open to musicians taking risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been complaining about the sameness of the country  
artists over the last couple of years,'' Cook says. ``I don't think 
you can on one hand complain, then on other hand not be willing to 
take a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, it's small things. Several songs on ``D'lectrified''  
run more than 5 minutes, while most country singles run 4 minutes 
at most to encourage more airplay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't make an album with the hopes that every song is going  
to go to radio,'' Black says. ``I stopped doing that a long time 
ago, and I think it makes for a more interesting album.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The album ``Fly'' by the Dixie Chicks features plenty of the  
soaring harmonies and energetic music that worked so well on their 
1998 breakthrough album, ``Wide Open Spaces.'' And the Chicks 
continue to use lots of Emily Robison's banjo, an instrument that 
once doomed the airplay potential of a single. 
</P>
<P>
	But they take their daring further on the new album. In  
``Goodbye Earl,'' two women poison a wife-beater's black-eyed peas, 
wrap the body in a tarp and take it to a lake to be dumped. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Sin Wagon,'' Maines sings about wanting to do some  
``mattress dancing,'' and declares: ``I don't know where I'll be 
crashin'/But I'm arrivin' on a sin wagon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such messages could be troublesome to the parents of the legions  
of young girls who buy Dixie Chick records. But Seidel thinks the 
words will sail right over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember singing 'Like a Virgin' when I didn't even know  
what a virgin was,'' Seidel says. ``It was a song. It was Madonna. 
It wasn't too serious. I think a lot of our humor might go over the 
heads of kids that young. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be ashamed for my 5-year-old stepson to hear 'Sin  
Wagon' or 'Goodbye Earl.' That's how I gauge it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy over those two songs -- neither likely to be a single  
-- hasn't stopped ``Fly'' from quickly selling more than 2 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks' successful example might just galvanize other  
artists to take some chances. That would be fine by Seidel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think artists need to have a stronger voice with the  
music that's being produced on their behalf,'' she says. ``I think 
the worst thing is if you think your chance was squandered with 
somebody else's bad production, or ideas that weren't 
representative of you. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, I hope other artists might see that we take a  
chance. And they might fight for something they believe in.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Plans 100,000-Rupiah Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia will start issuing its first  
100,000 rupiah bank notes in anticipation of possible increased 
demand for cash by the end of the year on Y2K fears, central bank 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the current exchange rate, the note would be worth $15.  
</P>
<P>
	The face of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding president and father  
of new Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri, adorns the new 
currency to be in circulation starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aulia Pohan, deputy governor of the Bank Indonesia, said demand  
for bank notes has increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we know, the highest nominal value of the bank note is  
50,000 rupiah ($7.50) and, after the high inflation rate, the 
purchasing power of the note is decreasing,'' Aulia said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been concerns that the Y2K, or ``millennium bug,''  
could cause some computers to malfunction if they misinterpret the 
final 00 digits in dates as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major currency move in five months. The  
central bank began replacing the 50,000 rupiah notes in June 
because they carried the portrait of former President Suharto, who 
resigned last year amid bloody pro-democracy protests and riots. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been accused of massive corruption and blamed for the  
worst economic crisis in a generation. A graft investigation 
against him is being reopened.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest Vendor's Death </HEADLINE>

	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Breaking away from a funeral  
procession, 200 Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli soldiers 
today in a third day of protests over the army's shooting of a 
Bethlehem souvenir vendor. 
</P>
<P>
	Masked protesters twirling slingshots hurled rocks and empty  
bottles at soldiers guarding Rachel's Tomb, an Israeli enclave in 
Palestinian-run Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli troops responded with tear gas and rubber-coated steel  
pellets. Three demonstrators were hit by rubber bullets and two 
were treated for tear gas inhalation, Palestinian paramedics said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vendor, Mousa Abu Hilail, was fatally shot Monday by a  
soldier near Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish shrine revered as the burial 
site of the biblical matriarch. The soldier claimed Abu Hilail had 
tried to stab him, but Palestinian officials have alleged that the 
soldier opened fire without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu Hilail was buried today in Beit Sahour, a town adjacent to  
Bethlehem. His body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Hundreds of 
mourners followed the procession, some firing guns in the air and 
others waving Palestinian flags. 
</P>
<P>
	After the burial, several hundred young men broke away and  
headed to Rachel's Tomb, where they threw stones at soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethlehem, the town where tradition says Jesus was born, was  
already tense before Monday's shooting because of Israeli plans to 
turn a makeshift checkpoint at the town's entrance into a large, 
reinforced border station. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians need special entry permits to go to nearby  
Jerusalem, five miles away. They fear Israel is trying to make 
travel even more difficult by setting up the new checkpoint. 
Palestinian officials have also accused Israel of trying to scare 
off tourists during the millennium season. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has said it was only trying to reduce traffic jams at the  
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence in Bethlehem came just days before Palestinian  
leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and 
President Clinton's scheduled summit in Oslo, Norway, to try and 
launch talks on a final peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has asked the United States to scale down its involvement  
in the negotiations. However, Arafat said today that he seeks a 
``full role'' for Clinton and his mediators. The Palestinians feel 
they are the weaker party and need the Americans' help in facing 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's chief Mideast mediator, Dennis Ross, arrived in  
Jerusalem today to lay the groundwork for the Oslo summit. Ross 
said the peace process was at a delicate moment of great potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time to try to get down to business in a way that  
gives us a chance to realize that potential and turn what is a hope 
into a reality,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Cop Fired in Police Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A police officer accused in the beating of a black  
undercover officer who was mistaken for a murder suspect was fired 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans fired officer James Burgio  
after a department hearings officer upheld internal charges against 
him in connection with the January 1995 beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgio was terminated after charges of excessive force, failing  
to provide emergency care and failing to come to the aid of a 
fellow officer were sustained by the hearings officer, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgio, 39, is the first of five officers who have been accused  
in the attack on Officer Michael Cox -- or a cover-up that allegedly 
followed -- to be terminated from the force. They had all been 
suspended without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgio's attorney, Thomas Drechsler, said that his client would  
appeal the decision to a civilian arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``My client has always denied causing injuries to Mr. Cox,''  
said Drechsler. ``We're confident he will be exonerated after an 
appeal. My client feels as if he has been made a scapegoat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was working undercover in the city's Roxbury neighborhood  
when he was allegedly mistaken for a murder suspect during a foot 
chase and beaten severely by several offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox suffered a concussion, egg-sized contusions on his head,  
multiple facial cuts and kidney damage and spent the next six 
months out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the city of Boston agreed to pay nearly $1.3  
million to Cox to settle a civil rights lawsuit against the city 
and the police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Detective Margot Hill, a Boston Police spokeswoman, said  
there would be no comment in the Burgio termination because 
decisions in the cases of the other officers were still pending.

<HEADLINE> Houston Tops L.A. As Smog Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It was probably just a chemical belch at a  
factory on the edge of town. But it was enough to push Houston past 
Los Angeles to become the smoggiest city in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Los Angeles were running neck-and-neck in air  
pollution stakes until Oct. 7, when the nation's fourth-largest 
city surpassed the second-largest by recording its 44th smog day of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day that will live in infamy,'' Houston Health Department  
spokeswoman Kathy Barton said. ``Really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, the Houston count had reached 46. Los Angeles  
was still at 43. A smog day is when the ozone level rises above a 
certain mark set by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what caused the smog remains a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers know that large clouds of ethylene and propylene  
billowed over the city Oct. 7, and believe the gases were the 
product of one of the industrial plants on the edge of town. But 
they don't know which one. 
</P>
<P>
	The search has been narrowed down to 25 factories, all clustered  
around the Houston Ship Channel, home of the nation's largest 
concentration of petrochemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has had smoggy air for decades and has long been the  
butt of jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said unusually dry weather played a part in trapping  
dirty air over Houston, and Los Angeles may very well reclaim the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably pass it back and forth with each other for a  
few more years,'' said Gene McMullen, who has been monitoring 
pollution levels for the Health Department in Houston for decades. 
``It'll depend on whose weather is worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is staring at an EPA deadline next month to come up with a  
plan to clean its skies by 2007. The government has threatened to 
take away money for Texas highway construction if the state doesn't 
start making progress soon.

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Electrocutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JACKIE HALLIFAX    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to  
consider whether electrocution amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment, using a Florida case in its first evaluation of the 
controversial procedure in more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced Tuesday, comes four months after the  
third botched electrocution in Florida this decade. It effectively 
shut down Florida's electric chair, granting open-ended reprieves 
to a man scheduled to die today and another who faced electrocution 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue may not be resolved by the high court for months.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for death row inmates have tried unsuccessfully in  
state courts to prove that death in the electric chair violates the 
constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is one of just four states across the country that  
requires condemned killers to be executed by electrocution. Most of 
the 38 states with capital punishment have switched to lethal 
injection in the last 50 years, when a peak of 26 states used 
electric chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Supreme Court has not reviewed electrocution as a  
method of execution since 1890, when New York became the first 
state to approve its use. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Tuesday's action will stop electrocutions in Georgia,  
Alabama and Nebraska as well was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may,'' said Martin McClain, a New York lawyer who has  
handled most of the recent legal challenges against electrocutions 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That question probably won't be answered unless one of the  
states schedules an execution and the court stops it, McClain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last man to die in Florida's electric chair was Allen Lee  
``Tiny'' Davis, whose execution in July for the 1982 murders of a 
pregnant woman and her two young daughters led to the legal 
challenge before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered a nosebleed just before the current was applied,  
causing blood to drip from his face mask and onto his chest as he 
died. Davis may also have been partially suffocated before he was 
electrocuted because of the placement of a leather mouthpiece 
across his face. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloody execution followed problems in 1990 and 1997, when  
flames erupted from the headpiece worn by condemned Florida 
killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of Davis' bloody body and contorted face are before the  
nation's high court -- and available over the Internet -- after 
Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw attached three 
photographs to his blistering dissent of the state court's 4-3 
ruling upholding use of the chair last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision Tuesday came less than an hour after the state  
Supreme Court granted Anthony Bryan a two-day stay to pursue 
federal appeals. Bryan was scheduled to go to the electric chair at 
7 a.m. today for the 1983 murder of a watchman abducted in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan's lawyer, Andrew Thomas, called the decision  
``monumental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush was surprised and disappointed with the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, it's unfortunate the family members of  
the victims have to wait for justice,'' spokesman Cory Tilley said, 
adding that Bush still has confidence the chair will operate 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida House Speaker John Thrasher said he found the court's  
decision ``terribly frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thrasher, a Republican, said he would be willing to call a  
special legislative session if lawmakers could figure out a way to 
``carry out the law of the land'' without waiting for the high 
court to rule. 
</P>
<P>
	A way to do that, he suggested, might be passing a law to give  
death row inmates a choice between the electric chair and lethal 
injection.

<HEADLINE> Belgians Honor American Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- With Washington's National Museum of  
the American Indian not due to open its doors until 2002, Belgium's 
capital is currently one of the world's best places to discover the 
treasures of native North American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound unlikely? Just ask the director of the U.S. museum, still  
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the best of my knowledge, it is (Europe's) most significant  
show representing the native culture of the Western hemisphere for 
a generation,'' said Rick West. ``They can be proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West crossed the Atlantic to attend the late September opening  
of ``Indian Summer -- The First Nations of America'' at Brussels' 
sprawling Royal Museum of Art and History. 
</P>
<P>
	The show traces Indian heritage from pre-Colombian days to the  
present through more than 600 art works, video displays, life-size 
reconstructions of Indian homes and even a restaurant serving 
Buffalo steaks and maple syrup cakes. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first days, the exhibit was attracting packed crowds of  
curious Europeans, and winning rich praise from American Indian 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all thought it was great, better than much of what we get  
at home. Canadian museums could learn from this,'' said Bob Boyer, 
a Metis artist from Saskatchewan, who led a group performing 
spectacular traditional dances at the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Central to the exhibit is a vast chamber dedicated to revealing  
the deep diversity of American Indian societies. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a giant teepee from the Great Plains, an Iroquois long  
house lined with grimacing masks from upstate New York, a totem 
pole from British Columbia carved with images of a bear, whale and 
eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Inuit kayaks frozen in a mock snowscape face a reconstruction of  
a sacred Kiva chamber from the deserts of New Mexico filled with 
the richly decorated Kachina spirit dolls of the Hopi and Zuni 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
	``I envy them the material. Much of it is very, very  
beautiful,'' said West in an interview from his Washington home. 
</P>
<P>
	Haunting chants and rhythms of native music follow the visitor  
past displays of Siksika headdresses, Apache basketwork, intricate 
Sioux beadwork in a kaleidoscope of colors, Cree snowshoes, 
lacrosse rackets from the Cherokee and vivid red-and-yellow Navajo 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a glass floor are pair upon pair of brilliantly colored  
moccasins. The empty shoes are a poignant lead-in to the next room 
where the Indians' downfall is illustrated by a cabinet stuffed 
with repeater rifles, revolvers and a U.S. cavalry saber displayed 
alongside a screen rotating photographs of the 1890 massacre at 
Wounded Knee, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The show does not dwell on the tragic history, but seeks to show  
how Indian heritage is kept alive by a vibrant contemporary arts 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Great consideration was given to showing that we are not just  
a historical phenomenon,'' said West, a Southern Cheyenne. ``It 
helps people to see that native arts are still here, that the 
quality is every bit as good as it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, which runs through March 26, has a succession of  
live events scheduled to bring the show to life. This month there 
are Inuit dancers and drummers from the Arctic. Through November 
visitors can watch a Kwakiutl artist carve a totem pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Later events will feature Tlingit sculptors from Alaska,  
Montagnais dancers from Quebec, storytellers recounting Indian 
myths and legends, craftsmen building a bark canoe and experts 
offering art history courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very unique in Europe. I would like to see more in  
Europe so they could have a better idea of our culture,'' commented 
Joyce Kitson, a Sioux artist from North Dakota displaying her 
porcupine quill embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit's commissioner, Sergio Purin, said his team sought  
to present American Indian culture in a new light to Europeans 
brought up on Hollywood Westerns, the Indian adventure novels of 
Karl May or the comic-book capers of ``Tintin in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We also had to destroy a certain mangled or romanticized image  
of the Indian, passed on by popular literature, the movies or even 
the hippie movement,'' Purin writes in the exhibit catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	West thinks they've more than succeeded.  
</P>
<P>
	``There really was a significant effort to disabuse stereotypes  
of Native Americans,'' he said. ``It's a splendid job.''

<HEADLINE> Young's Season Appears To Be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young's season appears to be  
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The agent for the San Francisco 49ers quarterback said Tuesday  
he doesn't foresee Young, still bothered by post-concussion 
symptoms, playing again this year. The team and Young's doctors 
seem to feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time NFL MVP is expected to be placed on injured reserve  
within the next week or so, a course favored by general manager 
Bill Walsh, according to a club source, and echoed by agent Leigh 
Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm determined he not risk anything more this year,''  
Steinberg said Tuesday. ``He's probably going to end up on injured 
reserve. This is a football injury. He was hurt on the field and 
that's where those players go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, was expected to address his condition and status with  
the team today. It's his first such meeting with reporters in two 
weeks since word surfaced that his primary neurologist, Dr. Gary 
Steinberg, who is unrelated to the agent, had made a long-term 
recommendation about whether Young should play again. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dr. Steinberg's opinion hasn't been disclosed, Young has  
conceded the report was ``discouraging'' and his agent has said 
that the initial medical opinion has been reaffirmed in 
consultations with other specialists. 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to speak with some of his contemporaries who  
were forced out of the game by repeated concussions, including Al 
Toon and Merrill Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also gathering more medical advice and may see another  
specialist this week, but coach Steve Mariucci and Walsh have both 
said that they would give greatest weight to Dr. Steinberg's 
conclusions, and they are in no hurry to see Young back on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern with Young is he could be at risk for permanent  
brain damage from another concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said Monday that the team, which has a bye this week,  
hopes to resolve Young's status in the next week or two and said 
injured reserve was a possibility. It would allow Young an extended 
period away from football while not totally shutting the door on 
his eventual return. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Young has not received medical clearance to play and has  
no real hope of getting it any time soon, he remains optimistic 
that his concussion symptoms will eventually clear, leaving at 
least a possibility he could return next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg said there would be no decision or announcement  
on the possibility of Young's retirement until after the season, 
but added that Young also will abide by the final medical 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is going to happen in the way of retirement this  
season,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``He will come to the right 
decision, but this will take a little time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young continues to feel a strong sense of responsibility to the  
team, especially now that it's struggling without him, and wouldn't 
think of leaving in the middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	By going on injured reserve, though, he could stick around and  
get treatment while remaining with the team as a locker room and 
sideline presence along with helping advise his replacement, Jeff 
Garcia.

<HEADLINE> EEOC Sues Chuck E. Cheese Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A children's pizza chain is being sued for  
firing a mentally retarded janitor after a manager alleged 
remarked: ``We don't want those kinds of people working at Chuck E. 
Cheese's.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued the chain,  
claiming it violated Don Perkl's civil rights and the 1990 
Americans with Disabilities Act. A trial is scheduled next week in 
U.S. District Court, 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks up to $300,000 for back wages, emotional distress  
and punitive damages for the company's ``malicious and reckless 
conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A top official with the chain's parent company, CEC  
Entertainment Inc., said the pizza chain has a long history of 
employing people with disabilities at its 338 Chuck E. Cheese's 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is fair to say the EEOC wants to make an example of  
this case. We believe the facts will show they picked the wrong 
case to make an example of,'' said Jon Rice, vice president of 
marketing and communications. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkl, 52, started work at a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant in  
Madison on March 18, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	District manager Donald Creasy, who saw Perkl while visiting the  
restaurant that day, ordered a supervisor to fire Perkl, saying, 
``We don't want those kinds of people working at Chuck E. 
Cheese's,'' said Barbara Henderson, an attorney for the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant manager refused.  
</P>
<P>
	When Creasy returned April 7 and saw Perkl still sweeping  
floors, he fired him, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant manager, a general manager and two other workers  
resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Creasy has since been reassigned to the Chicago area, Rice said.  
He wouldn't say where Creasy could be reached and no residential 
telephone listing could be found when The Associated Press tried to 
reach him for comment.

<HEADLINE>  Hemingway's Son Shares Dad's Poetry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Admirers of Ernest Hemingway rarely think of  
him as a poet -- just not that kind of guy -- but his eldest son John 
was at the Library of Congress on Wednesday to present the author's 
first book: ``Three Stories and Ten Poems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was published in Paris in 1923 when Hemingway, later to win  
the Nobel prize for his novels, was 24. This copy is dedicated to 
his first wife, Hadley -- John's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	John, 76, was born the same year. Now he wears a rounded white  
beard, much like Ernest Hemingway's in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
	John told a news conference that his father had never spoken to  
him about his verses. ``But you know that a great deal of his early 
work was in poetry,'' he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Six poems were published in ``Poetry: A Magazine of Verse,'' and  
editor Harriet Monroe described the author then as ``a young 
Chicago poet now abroad who will soon issue in Paris his first book 
of verse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, many were written to Mary, Hemingway's fourth and last  
wife. One threatens jokingly to ``hang myself from your Christmas 
tree'' if she doesn't accept him as a Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Another poem, written earlier, is clouded with thoughts of  
death. It includes the lines: 
</P>
<P>
	``Eternity is scarcely found  
</P>
<P>
	``Until we're underneath the ground  
</P>
<P>
	``Where thudding hooves will never sound.  
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway killed himself at 61.  
</P>
<P>
	At age 12 he was rhyming about baseball:  
</P>
<P>
	``With Chance on first and Evers on third,  
</P>
<P>
	``Great things from the Cubs will soon be heard.''  
</P>
<P>
	He was bitter about World War I, in which he was wounded on the  
Italian front. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``Soldiers never do die well;  
</P>
<P>
	``Crosses mark the places,  
</P>
<P>
	``Wooden crosses where they fell;  
</P>
<P>
	``Stuck above their faces.  
</P>
<P>
	John said his father also wrote many poems about World War II,  
when he was a correspondent, ``mostly about separation from his 
girl friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A. E. Hotchner, a close friend for the last 14 years of  
Hemingway's life, also gave the library a large collection of 
photos, manuscripts, home movies and 15 spools of magnetized wire 
recordings. He was not sure of the contents of the recordings, he 
said, but knew they included Hemingway reciting two long poems to 
Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the wires have not yet been transcribed.  
</P>
<P>
	Alice Birney, an historian of American literature at the  
library, said that Hemingway's poems have no claim to be considered 
great verse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are pretty raunchy,'' she pointed out.  
</P>
<P>
	According to ``Advice to a Son:''  
</P>
<P>
	``Always put paper on the seat,  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't believe in wars,  
</P>
<P>
	``Keep yourself both clean and neat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never marry whores.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Add Linebacker Kopp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Jeff Kopp was cut by the Baltimore Ravens,  
failed a tryout with the lowly Atlanta Falcons and was unemployed 
for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he could be starting at linebacker for the New  
England Patriots, whose 5-2 record is one of the NFL's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great country, isn't it?'' Kopp said Wednesday before  
going through his first practice with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	It sure is, especially when a team is as desperate for  
linebackers as the Patriots. They had just two healthy players at 
that position at the end of last Sunday's 24-23 win over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	They were looking for linebackers to play Sunday at Arizona, and  
Kopp was looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
	A sixth-round draft choice out of Southern California by Miami  
in 1995, he spent one season there, 2 1/2 with Jacksonville and signed 
with Baltimore last Oct. 28. The Ravens cut him Oct. 5 but, at age 
28, he wasn't ready to give up the game. 
</P>
<P>
	So he tried out last week with the Falcons. They told him they  
would make some decisions after their game last Monday night 
against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to wait around for them. The Patriots said, `we  
want to sign you.' I said `great,' '' Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared his good fortune in a phone call Tuesday night with  
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `man, this is fun,' '' Kopp said. ``You go from being  
released, to a team that obviously doesn't want you, then the next 
thing you know you've got an opportunity to play every play on 
special teams and an opportunity to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be crazy to tell you I'm not looking forward to it. I love  
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Tedy Bruschi, listed as questionable after missing the last  
two games with a knee injury, is healthy enough to play, he'll 
start rather than Kopp, coach Pete Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	If not?  
</P>
<P>
	``He may have to start in this game,'' Carroll said of his  
newest player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's athletic, his attitude is upbeat all the time,'' said  
Patriots defensive end Willie McGinest, a college teammate of 
Kopp's. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in our conference and we played against him many  
years,'' said Chris Slade, one of the Patriots healthy linebackers. 
``We know the guy can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he can stay awake after late nights spent studying the New  
England defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp, who has started just three of his 57 NFL games, began his  
crash course after beating out four players at Tuesday afternoon's 
tryout and continued Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll put in a lot of extra time,'' he said. ``I got here the  
first thing this morning, probably before everybody else. ... I 
have to learn the system in four or five days and go out there and 
be ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without his wife and 16-month-old daughter in town, he can  
concentrate on his studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I want to hang out at the hotel,'' Kopp said.  
``I'd just as soon stay here and study all night if I have to. ... 
I'm preparing that I'm going to play every play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots added another linebacker, Ron Merkerson, to their  
practice squad. He was their fifth-round draft pick last year out 
of Colorado but was waived last Sept. 20 when the Patriots 
activated defensive back J'Juan Cherry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry was put on injured reserve Wednesday to clear a roster  
spot for Kopp. The Patriots also released running back Marques 
Brigham from the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the final steps New England took to add Kopp. First,  
he had to survive Tuesday's tryout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty intense. There were a lot of people out there, a  
lot of coaches, a lot of scouts,'' Kopp said. ``I feel like I won a 
lottery.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Freeze Indian Tribe's Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTEE, Neb. (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have frozen the bank  
accounts of the Santee Sioux Tribe in an attempt to shut down its 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Tom Monaghan said he intends to seize the assets  
to help pay more than $1 million in fines the tribe owes the 
government for operating its casino in defiance of court orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first step in the collection process,'' he said  
Tuesday. ``The tribe has not made any effort to pay those 
court-ordered fines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santee leaders said the money included federal funds earmarked  
for health-care and social service programs. None of the money was 
generated from the casino, tribal chairman Butch Denny said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an attack on our elderly and children,'' Denny said.  
``We are not going to let him get away with this. We are ready to 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest development in a three-year effort by state  
and federal officials to close the casino on the Santee reservation 
near the South Dakota border in northeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe opened the Ohiya Casino in 1996 even though the state  
refused to approve it. Casino-style gambling, including slot 
machines, is illegal in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 requires states to  
negotiate agreements with tribes to set rules and limits on 
gambling. The tribe sued the state, alleging it failed to negotiate 
in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe says the casino's 23 jobs are much needed on the  
reservation -- where the unemployment rate is 74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the tribe or Monaghan knew exactly how much money was in  
the frozen accounts at two banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge started fining the tribe $3,000 per day in  
February for refusing to close the casino. The fine was doubled in 
July. None of the fines have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Monaghan also seized about $87,000 from a Santee account in  
South Dakota in 1997. The tribe responded by filing a lawsuit and 
opening secret accounts.

<HEADLINE> Baffert Has Hot Breeders' Cup Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert will take dead aim at  
winning four of the eight Breeders' Cup races with two star fillies 
and a pair of talented colts. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Baffert pre-entered a total of eight horses in six races  
at Gulfstream Park Wednesday. Barring injury or illness, all eight 
are assured of starting Nov. 6. Official entries will be made Nov. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Watchmaker, the national handicapper for the Daily Racing  
Form, made the Baffert-trained 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday the 
2-1 early favorite to win the Distaff and unbeaten Chilukki the 9-5 
choice to win the Juvenile Fillies. Baffert has another early 
favorite, the colt Forest Camp, 3-1 in the Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will try to win the $4 million Classic with the  
3-year-old colt General Challenge, the 5-1 second pick, and the 
Sprint with Forestry, a 3-year-old colt, who is the 9-2 second 
choice. Baffert also trains River Keen, a 7-year-old and the 6-1 
third choice in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Baffert-trained horses pre-entered were Tuzla in the Mile  
on the grass and Captain Steve in the Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorite in the showcase Classic is Behrens (3-1). who lost  
his last two starts after winning four straight stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically we started the year at Gulfstream and we will end it  
in Gulfstream and I hope it will end on a positive note,'' Jim 
Bond, Behrens' trainer, said in a conference call. A victory by the 
5-year-old Behrens likely would make him Horse of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other early favorites are Artax (7-2) in the Sprint, Hawksley's  
Hill (4-1) in the Mile, Britain-based Daylami (7-2) in the Turf and 
Soaring Softly (4-1) in the Filly &AMP; Mare Turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Each race is limited to 14 starters and six of the races drew  
from 18 to 25 pre-entries, meaning they will have also-eligible 
lists. The Juvenile Fillies drew 10 pre-entries, and the Distaff 
drew 11. There were a total of 128 horses pre-entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those assured of starting in the 1 1/4-mile Classic besides  
Behrens, General Challenge, winner of the Pacific Classic, and 
River Keen, winner of the Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup, are 
3-year-olds Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the Belmont Stakes and 
Travers; Vision and Verse, second in both those races, and Ecton 
Park, winner of the Jim Dandy and Super Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Distaff, Silverbulletday will be seeking her ninth win in  
11 starts this year in her second race against older fillies and 
mares. Two of her rivals will be 4-year-old Beautiful Pleasure, who 
beat Silverbulletday in the Beldame in the slop, and Banshee 
Breeze, second in the Distaff last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory in the Juvenile Fillies would make Chilukki 6-for-6.  
One of her rivals will be Surfside, winner of three of four starts, 
trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who is expected to have seven starters 
in five races. 
</P>
<P>
	Two rivals of Forest Camp, winner of two of three races, will be  
Greenwood Lake, winner of the Champagne, and Dixie Union, who beat 
Forest Camp in the Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Horses who won Breeders' Cup races last year include  
Silverbulletday in the Juvenile Fillies and Buck's Boy in the 
Breeders' Cup Turf. Buck's Boy's start in this year's Turf will be 
only his second since he won last year.

<HEADLINE> Report: Dan Marino Out 2-3 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino will  
miss 2-3 weeks because of a flareup of a disc in his neck, 
according to a broadcast report. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports News, citing unidentified Dolphins sources, said  
Marino's malady was triggered by the bone spur in his lower neck 
which has idled him for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was in Los Angeles to meet with Dr. Robert Watkins for a  
second opinion on his condition. Watkins has operated on the backs 
of quarterbacks Troy Aikman, Joe Montana and, more recently, Steve 
McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Fox, no surgery is required but Marino will be out

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Ray Benson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ray Benson's favorite greeting is to  
crack a door slightly ajar and do his imitation of Lurch from ``The 
Addams Family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hel-LOOOW,'' he intones, emphasizing the bottom of his bass  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7-inch bandleader does a mean Lurch -- and an even  
meaner Bob Wills. His band Asleep at the Wheel has been carrying 
the torch passed from Wills and his band the Texas Playboys for 
three decades. Benson, a guitarist and vocalist, is the only 
remaining original member. 
</P>
<P>
	As Benson sees it, rock 'n' roll got its start in Western Swing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Haley and the Comets were a Western Swing band,'' argues  
Benson, 48, about the group whose ``(We're Gonna) Rock Around the 
Clock'' helped launch rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``All rock 'n' roll was, was they dropped the fiddle and they  
dropped the steel guitars and they turned the treble up (on the 
guitar).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western Swing, developed by the legendary Wills beginning in the  
1930s, combines the instrumental virtuosity and improvisation of 
jazz, the vitality of swing and the street-smart entertainment 
value of honky-tonk country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ride With Bob'' is Asleep at the Wheel's second album  
featuring guest vocalists and songs done first by Bob Wills and the 
Texas Playboys. It's a format that works well because of the 
quality of the Playboy repertoire and the fondness many country 
music stars have for Western Swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Featured on ``Ride With Bob'' are Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard,  
Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Steve Wariner, the 
Dixie Chicks, Clint Black, Tracy Byrd, Mark Chesnutt, Lyle Lovett, 
the Manhattan Transfer, Tim McGraw, Jason Roberts, Clay Walker, Don 
Walser, Steve Wariner, Lee Ann Womack, Dwight Yoakam and Shawn 
Colvin. 
</P>
<P>
	For music fans curious about Western Swing, the album is a fine  
place to start. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Ride With Bob'' is a tribute to Bob Wills. Isn't that a bit  
redundant, since Asleep at the Wheel as a band is pretty much a 
tribute to him? 
</P>
<P>
	Benson: I understand what you are saying. But no, we've always  
been an eclectic band and we just did what we wanted. We are a 
Western Swing band by instrumentation, because we have steel 
(guitar), fiddles, horns, electric guitars, piano and a rhythm 
section. On a regular album, I might do no Bob Wills songs, or I 
might do one. But on this album, it's his repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
	2. You must have been happy to see Wills make it into the Rock  
and Roll Hall of Fame this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson: I've been sitting here blowing that trumpet for 30  
years, you know? I always had a beef with the sound bites. ... That 
rock 'n' roll is the synthesis of country, bluegrass and rhythm and 
blues. Rock 'n' roll was an evolution from Western Swing. ... The 
difference is Western Swing was built on the big band, and rock 'n' 
roll was built on the small combo. 
</P>
<P>
	3. It's surprising you didn't play a role in the induction, as  
the acknowledged modern leader of Western Swing. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson: It was pretty disappointing because they called me for  
help identifying some of the band members over the years. ... I 
offered to put together a little performance and the lady said, 
`Oh, we only let performers do that.' 
</P>
<P>
	I had to go through the whole litany: I've been doing this for  
30 years, I've got 20-some albums, I've got six Grammys, and I'm 
one of the people who has carried on this tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like talking to a wall. All they knew was that Bruce  
Springsteen was going on, so they weren't going to waste their time 
having some old guys playing this Western Swing stuff. They had no 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Asleep at the Wheel would have received a giant boost had it  
been in the ``Urban Cowboy'' movie in 1980. I understand you turned 
it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson: We were supposed to be in that thing, but I turned it  
down and did another movie at the time. It was called `Roadie.' 
(Benson laughs at the misfortune of the decision). Hindsight's 
20-20, but `Roadie' actually offered us more money and it was 
Blondie and Alice Cooper and Meat Loaf. And we had speaking parts 
in it. But history is funny. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Asleep at the Wheel is on the DreamWorks record label now,  
but you've put out records on every label in Nashville over the 
years. Since you don't sell like Garth Brooks, how do you keep 
getting record deals? 
</P>
<P>
	Benson: I try to make it possible for the record companies to  
record us. By that I mean I'm very realistic about how many albums 
we are going to sell. They like having the integrity of the music, 
and I am not going to lose money for them, because I have a small 
but loyal audience.

<HEADLINE> House on Record Against Tax Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In case anyone missed it the first time, the  
Republican-led House has gone on record again as opposing a tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly a week after the House voted against $19.2 billion in  
specific tax increases sought by President Clinton to balance the 
fiscal 2000 budget, lawmakers on Tuesday approved a nonbinding 
resolution expressing general opposition to raising taxes in order 
to boost government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forces us to focus on the choices we need to make in order  
to maintain fiscal discipline,'' said Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz. 
``We cannot continue to burden working Americans with higher and 
higher and higher taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Clinton vetoed their cherished $792 billion tax cut,  
congressional Republicans have fought against several Clinton tax 
increase and other revenue proposals, including a 55-cent-a-pack 
cigarette tax and a plan to close corporate tax shelters. 
Republicans are seeking cuts in spending to balance the fiscal 2000 
budget instead of raising revenue elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	With these negotiations entering a key stretch, some Democrats  
said Tuesday's vote on the nonbinding resolution amounted to a 
Republican anti-tax press release given an endorsement by the full 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Speaker, this is stupid,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New  
York, ranking Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. 
``This is no way to deal with the problems that we face as a 
nation. You legislate in the House. You have hearings and you do 
something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel's choice of words brought Republicans indignantly to  
their feet. ``I don't believe I have heard so much hot air released 
at once since the Hindenberg went down,'' huffed Rep. John Sununu, 
R-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel apologized but later issued a statement saying the GOP is  
using the House floor ``as a public relations tool'' to bolster the 
party's effort at keeping the majority in the 2000 elections. 
``This is just a feel-good resolution,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, it passed 371-48 with 154 Democrats in favor.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the partisan flare-up, the House had no trouble agreeing  
to support the Clinton administration's proposal that a one-year 
ban on global Internet tariffs and taxes be made permanent by the 
World Trade Organization. The 132-nation WTO meets Nov. 30 in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A tariff retains an element of piracy,'' said Rep. Christopher  
Cox, R-Calif. ``This trade today is conducted free of piracy. The 
aim of this resolution is to keep it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year enacted a three-year moratorium on new  
Internet taxes in this country and created a public-private 
commission to recommend future tax policy for e-commerce. That 
panel is now accepting proposals for taxation of Internet 
transactions to determine whether such a system is possible, let 
alone desirable. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Moran, D-Va., warned that Congress would eventually  
have to confront how to keep the Internet tax burden low while 
ensuring e-commerce does not siphon tax dollars needed for schools, 
roads and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have also got to listen to the state and local officials  
who can see what is coming,'' said Moran, a former mayor of 
Alexandria, Va. ``We have to deal with this.''

<HEADLINE> Fired Manager Backs Teamsters Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A fired manager for Overnite Transportation  
Co. has gone to bat for the Teamsters union, which is striking the 
shipper in a dispute over a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Watson said Tuesday that employees sympathetic to the union  
were singled out for discipline and dismissal. Watson is a former 
operations manager at the trucking company's Memphis, Tenn., 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came in a conference call coordinated by the  
Teamsters, who struck the Richmond-based company on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite met all deliveries and pickups Tuesday for the second  
straight day, the company said. Teamsters strike coordinator David 
Cameron said 2,000 Overnite workers stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters and Overnite have been trying for several years to  
negotiate a contract for 22 terminals where the union represents 
company workers. The company has 166 terminals in the United 
States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite contends a major issue is control of the company's  
pension fund for employees. The union contends that Overnite hasn't 
negotiated in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite said the 22 locations account for 14 percent of the  
company's 13,000 employees. Picketing was reported Tuesday at 
terminals in Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, 
Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson said he filed an affidavit with the National Labor  
Relations Board because he wanted ``the truth to be known. There's 
too much injustice being done to employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overnite spokesman Ira Rosenfeld disputed Watson's account,  
saying the manager's disciplinary practices were so harsh that the 
company had to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Memphis service manager refused to let him discipline  
employees last summer because he was disciplining them too much. 
The company had to rein him in,'' Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld said Watson was fired for poor performance. Watson  
said he was dismissed for ``Mickey Mouse reasons,'' including 
arguing with another manager and showing an employee the wrong way 
to move equipment.

<HEADLINE> Marino Likely To Miss 2 More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino is likely to be sidelined for at  
least two more games and possibly longer because of a pinched nerve 
in his neck, he said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino left the Miami Dolphins' game Oct. 17 at New England in  
the first quarter because of the injury and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew Tuesday to Los Angeles to receive a second opinion from  
specialist Dr. Robert Watkins, who confirmed the assessment of the 
Dolphins' team doctor that surgery was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good-news, bad-news situation,'' said Marino, 38.  
``I'm going to be able to play again -- we just don't know when. I'm 
going to be out this week and probably out the next week. We'll 
reevaluate it in a couple of weeks and see where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, who led Miami to victory last week against  
Philadelphia in his first NFL start, will again replace Marino on 
Sunday at Oakland. The Dolphins, who lead the AFC East at 5-1, 
signed veteran Scott Zolak to their roster today as another backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino hurt his neck in Miami's victory Oct. 10 at Indianapolis.  
The pinched nerve created weakness in his shoulder, which has 
hindered the distance and velocity of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said his condition has improved in the past few days. He  
said he'll continue therapy to strengthen his triceps and back 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good part is I'm going to be able to play again at some  
point,'' he said. ``That sad thing is I don't know when. It could 
be in a couple of weeks, and it might not be.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Want Marijuana Ruling Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Justice Department on Wednesday asked a  
federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that could allow 
seriously ill patients to use marijuana without being prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month told a federal  
judge to rethink his order that closed down some Northern 
California medical marijuana clubs, and consider an exemption for 
patients who face imminent harm without the drug and have no 
effective legal alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors have repeatedly argued that Congress has  
declared pot to be among the most dangerous controlled substances 
and without a medical purpose -- invalidating the medical-necessity 
argument the court said should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling last month, the appeals court said the government  
has offered nothing to contradict ``evidence that cannabis is the 
only effective treatment for a large group of seriously ill 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling stands, it would affect California and four other  
states in the 9th Circuit -- Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Alaska 
-- that have laws protecting medical marijuana users against state 
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Amid Strong Demand / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Wednesday as strong investor  
demand at the government's auction of $15 billion in two-year 
Treasury notes spread into the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/8 point,  
or $6.25 per $1,000 invested. Its yield, which moves inversely to 
the price, fell to 6.33 percent from 6.37 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sold the two-year notes at a yield of 5.94  
percent, drawing a strong $40.3 billion in bids that helped buoy 
demand in the broader market for Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the market was a government report that orders  
for big-ticket manufactured goods, such as cars and airplanes, fell 
a greater-than-expected 1.3 percent in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The report helped ease speculation that the Federal Reserve will  
raise interest rates again to check any inflationary growth in the 
U.S. economy. Higher rates would hurt the value of existing 
fixed-rate securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices for short-term securities rose  
3/32 percent, while intermediate treasury securities rose 5/32 
percent to 9/32 percent, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.13 percent as the  
discount was unchanged at 4.99 percent. Six-month yields were 5.31 
percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 5.10 
percent. One-year yields were 5.50 percent as the discount fell 
0.02 percentage point to 5.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.38 percent from 5.19 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 108 5/32. The average yield 
to maturity held at 6.16 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Accuses Mo. Gov. of Lying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan is again  
apologizing for appearing in blackface in the 1960s, after 
Republicans accused him of lying about how recently he put on the 
makeup for hometown minstrel shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan said the GOP is distorting an explanation he offered  
Monday for his blackface appearance in a barbershop quartet. Still, 
the 65-year-old governor renewed his apologies for small-town 
racial insensitivity almost four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret having been in them and I regret the insensitivity  
that's shown, but I do think that I have grown,'' Carnahan said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that as a young state representative, ``I grew rather  
quickly, sponsoring civil rights legislation in 1965.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Carnahan acknowledged and apologized for his  
blackface role in an October 1960 minstrel show by the Kiwanis Club 
in his hometown of Rolla. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Missouri Republican Party's executive director,  
John Hancock, provided a photo from an October 1961 minstrel show 
showing Carnahan singing in blackface. 
</P>
<P>
	Another photo showed Carnahan without makeup singing in an  
October 1962 minstrel show that included other performers in 
blackface. All of the photos first appeared in the '60s in the 
Rolla Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just see this as setting the record straight,'' Hancock  
said. ``I don't believe Mel Carnahan is a racist. I do believe he 
has a fair difficulty with the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan is challenging Republican Sen. John Ashcroft for his  
Senate seat in 2000. Ashcroft has had no comment about the 
blackface photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP also issued a news release headlined: ``Carnahan Lied in  
his `Apology.''' Hancock said the photographs proved that Carnahan 
was trying Monday to minimize his experiences wearing blackface. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, when Carnahan was asked when the Kiwanis Club had  
stopped sanctioning fund-raising minstrel shows, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
	``In the early 60s -- I don't know whether it was '60 or '61.  
There may have been one other, I do not know. I have not had the 
benefit of all the research my opponents have had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter then asked whether he had performed at any other time  
with a Kiwanis barbershop quartet while wearing blackface. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so,'' Carnahan replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The two-term governor, who has also served as lieutenant  
governor and state treasurer, said he should be judged on his 
record since the 1960s. He said that includes his appointment of 
the first black Missouri Supreme Court judge in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	That judge, Ronnie White, was rejected for a federal district  
judgeship on Oct. 5. Ashcroft helped defeat White's nomination, 
calling the judge soft on the death penalty and ``pro-criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Bush Wilson, a St. Louis lawyer and former national  
board chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, called the new attention to the old photographs 
``absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirty-nine years ago a lot of people were bigoted, including  
a lot of people who dredged this stuff up. I think we need to get 
on with the business of today and stop this nonsense,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Turns Federal Surplus Again Since 1957%xhl) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By SONYA ROSS 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring ``the book on deficits'' is closed,  
President Clinton said today the federal government posted a budget 
surplus of $123 billion last fiscal year, recording the first 
back-to-back surpluses since Dwight Eisenhower was president. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 followed a  
$69.2 billion surplus in 1998, the first time the government had 
finished in the black since 1969. Almost all the surplus is from 
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the surplus is the largest in American history, and  
credited it to his economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have closed the book on deficits and opened the door on a  
new era of economic opportunity,'' he said. ``If we seize this 
historic moment, we can now create a generation of prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two consecutive budget surpluses marked the first time the  
government has managed that feat since 1956 and 1957 during the 
Eisenhower administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the surpluses, the government still has a $5 trillion  
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart disclosed the figures in  
advance of a formal White House event where President Clinton was 
to talk about the administration's economic accomplishments later 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, called the surplus a victory for GOP fiscal strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what happens when Republicans take care of the  
government checkbook and hold the line against tax hikes and more 
spending,'' Archer said. ``This is a huge victory for American 
taxpayers and is the latest in a string of victories that Congress 
has won for our country and our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart called the 1999 surplus the largest in U.S. history in  
total dollar terms. As a percentage of the total economy, it is the 
largest surplus since 1951, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton last month had said the administration was looking for a  
surplus of at least $115 billion. That figure was up from a $98.8 
billion projection the administration had made in its mid-session 
budget review in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Trust Fund had a $124 billion surplus last  
year, Lockhart said. But $1 billion of that surplus was spent on 
federal programs; both Democrats and Republicans have promised not 
to spend any of the trust fund surplus this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the president also would note that the national  
debt has been reduced by $138 billion, the largest debt reduction 
on record. He said Clinton would use the occasion to appeal for 
further fiscal discipline in order to eliminate the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done an enormous amount of work to turn this economy  
around, turn our fiscal picture around,'' Lockhart said. ``But 
there is still a lot of work to do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Combining more than a century of traditional  
mapping with modern technology, the National Geographic Society is 
issuing a massive new world atlas and making its maps available on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for maps,'' the society's chief cartographer,  
Allen Carroll, said in announcing the steps Wednesday at a news 
conference at 38 degrees 54 minutes 18 seconds north latitude, 77 
degrees 2 minutes 18 seconds west longitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not too many years ago, maps were pretty passive things. Back  
then, maps were kind of like nouns, now they've become active 
verbs,'' Carroll said of the book-Internet combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The new seventh edition of the atlas includes such changes as  
the breakup of Yugoslavia, the creation of the native territory 
Nunavut in Canada, new provincial boundaries in Poland and changing 
country names in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	It also marks the completion of a three-year $3 million effort  
to computerize all society maps -- a project that allows them to be 
put on the Internet at www.nationalgeographic.com/mapmachine. 
</P>
<P>
	The book costs $125 while the Internet is free -- supported by  
advertising and sponsors. But society officials are confident a 
market exists for both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think they are a perfect combination,'' Carroll said.  
``They are not redundant, they are complimentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book gives better resolution, looks better on a coffee  
table, is quicker and easier to use and makes a nice gift, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But any map book is out of date the minute it's printed, while  
the Internet can be kept up to date. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when there are changes that affect the printed atlas, people  
will be able to find the corrected map on the Web site, print it 
out at the correct scale, and paste it in their book, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it's already happened. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison,  
formerly a national monument, is now a national park. The printed 
correction can be pasted on plate 39 of the atlas. 
</P>
<P>
	Every map in the new atlas has been redone from the sixth  
edition, Carroll said, adding improved shaded relief. The volume 
also contains a new satellite mosaic map of the world, a 136-page 
index and an expanded section providing flags and descriptions of 
the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume will generate complaints, Carroll admitted, as have  
all the society's past atlases, because of the many disputed areas 
in the world. He said the society receives angry letters from 
people ``who want us to show the world as they think it should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The society's policy is to show the world as it is, listing  
which country is in actual control of an area, even if that control 
is disputed by some other country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor, for example, which recently voted for independence  
from Indonesia but has not yet become a recognized country, 
generated discussion, Carroll said. The atlas shows the island as 
part of Indonesia with a notation in red that, as of 1999, 
authorities were finalizing plans to give the island's eastern 
section political autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas generating the most letters, he said, are Cyprus, Taiwan,  
East Timor and Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> High-Ranking Soldier Faces Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army took a step Wednesday toward the  
possible court-martial of its most senior enlisted soldier in 
Europe, appointing an officer to hear evidence against Sgt. Maj. 
Riley C. Miller, who is accused of sexual assault and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy -- the latest in a string of highly embarrassing  
sex cases in the U.S. military -- was disclosed last week when 
commanding Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs of U.S. Army Europe declared 
Miller unfit to continue in the post of command sergeant major 
representing the interests of all enlisted soldiers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a 30-year veteran, has been reassigned to other duties.  
Jim Boyle, a spokesman at U.S. Army Europe headquarters in 
Heidelberg, Germany, said neither Riley nor his attorney would 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 51, is married. He served as an infantry platoon  
sergeant in Vietnam, where he received a campaign medal with three 
bronze stars. He also has a Legion of Merit and Defense Meritorious 
Service Medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations against him were made by an unidentified female  
soldier in Hanau, Germany, just outside Frankfurt, and stem from 
unspecified events of April 13 and 14. Following a preliminary 
investigation, the Army last Thursday announced that Miller faced 
charges of mistreating a subordinate, kidnapping, forcible sodomy, 
indecent assault and fraternization. At the same time, Meigs 
announced Miller was being reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to a reporter outside U.S. Army Europe headquarters  
in Heidelberg on Wednesday, Army Capt. Cleveland Murphy said 
military officials were setting a good example by investigating a 
high-ranking soldier like Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to give the man a fair shake,'' he said. ``If it's not  
true, we don't want to slander him. If it is true, the Army is 
going to go through its course and do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement last week, Meigs said he had no opinion on the  
charges but had begun looking for a replacement for Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's announcement said Meigs had appointed a lieutenant  
colonel to hear the evidence against Miller as prescribed by 
Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. An Article 32 
hearing is the rough equivalent of a grand jury proceeding in the 
civilian justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	No hearing date was announced.  
</P>
<P>
	After hearing the evidence, the lieutenant colonel in charge  
will recommend to Meigs whether to convene a court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Army took the highly unusual step of  
court-martialing David Hale, who had retired in March 1998 as a 
two-star general serving as the Army's deputy inspector general. 
Hale had been allowed to retire in the face of allegations that he 
had sex with the wives of four subordinates while serving as a NATO 
commander in southern Europe. The resulting furor led the Pentagon 
to change its rules to bar top officers from retiring while facing 
allegations of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Gene C. McKinney, the sergeant major of the Army -- the  
service's highest-ranking enlisted position -- was accused by a 
former female public affairs aide of sexual harassment. Other women 
came forward with similar charges. In March 1998, a military court 
acquitted McKinney of most of the charges but convicted him on one 
count of obstructing justice. He was reprimanded and demoted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has disclosed few details of the case against Miller  
beyond the specific formal charges. It has said only that his 
accuser is a female soldier in Hanau and that the alleged 
misconduct occurred ``on or about April 13 and 14'' in Hanau. The 
Washington Post last Saturday quoted an unidentified senior 
military officer as saying the accuser was a sergeant who served as 
Miller's driver. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army spokesman at the Pentagon, Col. Edwin Veiga, said  
Wednesday he could not confirm the Post report. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanau is home to the Army's 104th Area Support Group, which  
provides medical, educational and other support to troops and their 
families. The 414th Base Support Battalion also is headquartered in 
Hanau.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Kent Haruf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURPHYSBORO, Ill. (AP) -- Leaning back in his rocking chair, in a  
town where trees stand taller than buildings, Kent Haruf can hear 
the big city calling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone's ringing a little more than I'd like it to,'' the  
author said as he let the answering machine tally yet another 
message, this one from paperback publisher Vintage Books. ``I've 
begun to screen my calls a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, the 56-year-old Haruf was just another member of  
that journeymen's club known as ``midlist'' writers. Two previous 
novels were out of print and a third one was proving difficult to 
finish. Future recognition, and money, he thought, would have to 
come from his job teaching at nearby Southern Illinois University 
at Carbondale. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Plainsong'' was completed and sold to Alfred A. Knopf,  
which is unlikely to let it be forgotten. Like ``Cold Mountain'' or 
``Angela's Ashes,'' Haruf's new novel is becoming a word-of-mouth 
success, catching on through the appeal of the story rather than 
the author's fame. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, independent book sellers cited ``Plainsong'' as a  
work they're especially eager to promote. The novel has since 
received nearly unanimous praise from critics and a National Book 
Award nomination. Jessica Lange and Jonathan Demme are among those 
interested in movie rights, and Vintage next year will reissue 
Haruf's first two books. 
</P>
<P>
	That much luck would be unthinkable for the characters in  
Haruf's novels, all set in a rural Colorado community where just 
having a warm bed can be a blessing. It's also a head-scratcher for 
the author himself, a preacher's son for whom fame is as odd, and 
as unsettling, as a Martian's handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no great expectations about the book at all,'' Haruf  
said, his voice low and even. ``In fact, many times during the 
writing I was kind of in despair about it. This is all pretty 
surreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Plainsong'' is based in Haruf's fictional Holt, Colo., a  
composite of the three Colorado towns where the author grew up. 
Like Sherwood Anderson's ``Winesburg, Ohio,'' a book Haruf admires, 
the narrative circulates among a variety of small-town residents. 
They include a pregnant teen-ager, a high school teacher and his 
two young sons and two aging bachelor-brothers isolated on the 
family farm. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Haruf's previous novels, the prose is understated, the  
tone forgiving; judgments are left to the reader. In place of 
statements, the author tends to details. When people go to the 
store in his books, you know what they're wearing, what they 
bought, what kind of car they drove and what the color of the sky 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems very important for me to get the physical details  
right of where people live: What they're doing, what the weather 
is,'' Haruf said. ``I think weather has an enormous influence on 
what people do in rural America. I'm always striving to make things 
concrete and accurate and visceral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Praising his parents as lovers of books, Haruf said he read all  
the time as a child. He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University, a 
small liberal arts college; spent two years in the Peace Corps in 
Turkey and then returned to the United States to fine-tune his 
fiction at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a quiet, reserved, but friendly guy and when he said  
something it had resonance,'' said novelist Ron Hansen, who studied 
with Haruf at Iowa. ``He was older and seemed more assured about 
what he wanted to do as a writer. When he turned in manuscripts 
everybody was impressed and a little awestruck by the quality of 
the prose. He seemed like a master craftsman already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haruf said his undergraduate reading of Hemingway and Faulkner  
changed his life and that often, he still goes back to their books. 
Hemingway's style inspired Haruf to write cleanly, directly. From 
Faulkner, Haruf felt he had been granted license to take his 
stories out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an indication among some writers that rural people are  
less intelligent and less complex. Faulkner never does that,'' 
Haruf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haruf no longer goes to church, but religion remains at least an  
indirect influence. He keeps a private faith in the ``elemental 
virtues'' of ``courage, loyalty, a kind of concentrated, deliberate 
way of living one's life, the discounting of what seems to be 
faddish or temporary. And love, in some non-gushy, non-saccharine 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tie That Binds,'' his first novel, was published in 1984,  
winning a Whiting Writers' Prize and finishing as a runner-up for 
the PEN/Hemingway award for first fiction. His next book, ``Where 
You Once Belonged,'' came out six years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The author has his own way of going about his work. On first  
drafts, for example, he literally writes blind: turns off the 
lights, removes his glasses, pulls a cap over his eyes and lets 
nothing -- grammar, spelling, continuity -- distract the transmission 
from mind to manual typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of thought precede this. Haruf likes to allow time for an  
idea to grow inside before putting it down on paper. In 
``Plainsong,'' he took a childhood memory and slowly embellished it 
into the lives of the two brothers on a farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one of the churches my father preached there were two old  
bachelor-farmers who came every Sunday in their black suits. They 
were very shy. I knew nothing about them except that they were 
farmers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That condition of life has been in my mind for 50 years. My  
brother and I used to think that would be ideal -- to live out in 
the country and not bothered by women or parents, to kind of go as 
you want to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economics, not wanderlust, have kept Haruf out of Colorado; the  
best jobs have been elsewhere and he has taught all over the 
country. But Haruf and his second wife, Cathy, still spend summers 
back in his home state and are building a house there. While 
Faulkner was famously scorned by his native Mississippi, Haruf has 
had a better reception from his people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best moment I've ever had in terms of a response to a book  
that felt authenticating had to with `The Tie That Binds,''' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a couple of paragraphs where I'm describing what it's  
like to milk cows. I had milked cows for a summer, not long before 
I wrote `Tie That Binds.' ... What happened in those paragraphs 
happened to me. An old cow wrapped her tail, loaded with manure and 
afterbirth, around my face. In the book, I was trying to debunk the 
romantic notion of milking cows. 
</P>
<P>
	``After it was published, I was out in the country in Colorado,  
at a New Year's Eve party at a friend's house. He was a dairyman 
and he was drunk enough to call me out to the kitchen and to sit me 
down and read those two paragraphs aloud to me. After he was done, 
he stabbed his finger on the page and said, `That's exactly right!' 
For me, that's high praise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from Kent Haruf's novel ``Plainsong'':  

</P>
<P>
	``Here was this man Tom Guthrie in Holt standing at the back  
window in the kitchen of his house smoking cigarettes and looking 
out over the back lot where the sun was just coming up. When the 
sun reached the top of the windmill, for a while he watched what it 
was doing, that increased reddening of surprise along the steel 
blades and the tail vane above the wooden platform. After a time he 
put out the cigarette and went upstairs and walked past the closed 
door behind which she lay in bed in the darkened guest room 
sleeping or not and went down the hall to the glassy room over the 
kitchen where the two boys were.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``When they were in front of the empty house at the end of the  
road they stopped to study it and everything around it. The 
broken-down neglected locust trees, shaggy barked, the over-grown 
yard, the dead sunflowers grown up everywhere with their heads 
loaded and drooping, everything dry and brown now in the late fall, 
dust-colored, and the sunken house itself diminished and weathered, 
with the front door swung open carelessly and the windows broken 
out over the years, and the sole square intact window in the attic 
bearing a fly screen that was turned down loose from one corner in 
a way that looked peculiar, like it was sleepy-eyed.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``She turned in the bed. Dwayne was still sleeping beside her.  
She lay for a long time feeling sick and sad. She looked at the bar 
of sunlight that showed thinly along the edge of the window shade. 
She didn't even know what the weather was doing anymore. The sun 
was shining but what else was there? She drifted into a daze of 
sorrow and disbelief. She didn't want to think what any of the 
night before might have done to her baby. She could only remember 
the first of it. She could remember the dancing, but there were 
other things too. She didn't want to think about them. But it was 
what she couldn't remember that scared her most.''

<HEADLINE>  Marino Likely To Miss 2 More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino is likely to be sidelined for at  
least two more games and possibly longer because of a pinched nerve 
in his neck, he said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino left the Miami Dolphins' game Oct. 17 at New England in  
the first quarter because of the injury and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew Tuesday to Los Angeles to receive a second opinion from  
specialist Dr. Robert Watkins, who confirmed the assessment of the 
Dolphins' team doctor that surgery was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good-news, bad-news situation,'' said Marino, 38.  
``I'm going to be able to play again -- we just don't know when. I'm 
going to be out this week and probably out the next week. We'll 
reevaluate it in a couple of weeks and see where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, who led Miami to victory last week against  
Philadelphia in his first NFL start, will again replace Marino on 
Sunday at Oakland. The Dolphins, who lead the AFC East at 5-1, 
signed veteran Scott Zolak to their roster today as another backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino hurt his neck in Miami's victory Oct. 10 at Indianapolis.  
The pinched nerve created weakness in his shoulder, which has 
hindered the distance and velocity of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said his condition has improved in the past few days. He  
said he'll continue therapy to strengthen his triceps and back 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good part is I'm going to be able to play again at some  
point,'' he said. ``That sad thing is I don't know when. It could 
be in a couple of weeks, and it might not be.''

<HEADLINE> Daly May Be Next Dodgers Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday will name  
former Warner Bros. executive Bob Daly as chairman and chief 
executive officer. Daly also will purchase a minor stake in the 
club, a source close to the team told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers would only say a ``major executive appointment'' was  
planned for 10 a.m. PDT at the Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first moves Daly could make in his new position,  
according to the source who spoke on condition of anonymity, would 
be the rehiring of former Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano, 
who was fired last month. Graziano was at Daly's home on Wednesday, 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, 62, will buy a stake in the team that amounts to about 10  
percent, sources told the Los Angeles Times. Once Daly takes over, 
the Fox Group will have no involvement in day-to-day operations, 
the newspaper reported in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox Group, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., bought  
the team from Peter O'Malley's family in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the Times that the stake Daly is buying and the  
price are still being negotiated. Any purchase remains subject to 
approval by major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The price will probably be at cost, which would make Daly's  
investment about $31 million, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly and Terry Semel quit as chairmen and co-chief executives of  
Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group in July. At the time, both men 
said they wanted to pursue new ventures, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly grew up in the New York City borough of Brooklyn where he  
attended Dodgers games at Ebbets Field, developing a lifelong 
passion for the team before it moved to Los Angeles in 1958. He is 
a season ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly tried to form a group to buy the team shortly after  
O'Malley put it up for sale, but he never made a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Semel, who started with the studio 20 years ago, guided  
the film and television division and Warner Music Group to combined 
revenues of an estimated $10 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo's successful films include the ``Lethal Weapon'' and  
``Batman'' movies, ``The Killing Fields,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' 
and ``Unforgiven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers have been underachievers since their sale to Fox.  
Last year, they finished 83-79 and in third place in the NL West. 
This year, as prohibitive favorites in the division with a $79.2 
million opening-day payroll -- second highest in the majors -- they 
wound up 77-85 and 23 games behind first-place Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziano, 41, was fired shortly before the end of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Dodgers in January 1986, and became president and  
CEO when the Fox Group bought the team.

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders Fall 1.3 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Slackening demand for cars and airplanes in  
September helped drive down overall orders for big-ticket 
manufactured goods by 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was the first decline since April -- and worse than  
the 0.4 percent drop many analysts were expecting -- economists 
still believe manufacturers are recovering from the darkest days of 
the global financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for all durable goods -- items expected to last at least  
three years -- declined last month to a seasonally adjusted $204.9 
billion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists cautioned against reading too much into one month of  
data and said September's drop doesn't signal an end to the rebound 
manufacturers have been enjoying this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to worry about in the manufacturing sector,''  
said Russell Sheldon, chief economist for MCM MoneyWatch. 
Manufacturing slowed moderately last month, but data so far this 
year ``point to a pretty healthy manufacturing sector,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, durable-goods orders are 7  
percent higher than the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers meet Nov. 16 to decide whether to  
raise interest rates a third time this year to slow the economy and 
keep inflation under control. ``I don't think the report sways them 
one way or the other,'' said economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 92.76 at 10,394.89 as  
a rally in the bond market carried over to stocks. Much of the 
rally came in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Business Council, in its economic outlook  
released Wednesday, said chief executive officers of some of the 
nation's largest companies expect next year to bring a faster pace 
of global economic activity, slower U.S. economic growth and tame 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Business Council also said that most big companies expect no  
problems with domestic suppliers because of the Y2K computer bug, 
but many expect some disruptions because of overseas vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The council, which was releasing the outlook at its fall meeting  
in Boca Raton, Fla., said its economic consultants saw less than a 
50 percent chance that the current expansion, already the longest 
in peacetime history, will dip into recession during the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But they cited several possible causes for one, including rising  
U.S. interest rates, higher U.S. inflation and a stock market 
plunge, Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill said in a report on the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	September's decrease in durable goods orders was led by a 3.9  
percent drop in orders for transportation equipment, also the first 
decline since April, reflecting weaker demand for airplanes and 
aircraft parts and automobiles and car parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some spot shortages of the most popular models from  
American and offshore producers, so you're seeing some moderation 
in sales because inventory is down and selection is limited,'' said 
Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers 
Association. Showroom traffic was down too. Still, the auto 
industry expects a record 16.8 million cars and light trucks to be 
sold this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation often is volatile from month to month because it  
includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, orders rose 0.4 percent for both industrial machinery  
-- including computers and machine tools -- and electronic and other 
electrical equipment -- including semiconductors and home 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding transportation, overall orders for durable goods fell  
0.5 percent, the first such decline since a 1.4 percent drop in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis has cut sharply into manufacturers'  
overseas sales and opened them up to stiffer competition from 
cheaper imports. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clemens Proves Skeptics Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens had spent his entire life waiting  
for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't win the big one, they said. Didn't have the heart,  
didn't have the guts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years after he first stepped on a major league field, he  
finally proved them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to make history, Clemens didn't just beat the  
Atlanta Braves, he smothered them, never gave them a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	On baseball's greatest stage, the mound of Yankee Stadium with  
the World Series title just one win away, he threw four-hit ball 
for 7 2-3 innings and led the Yankees to a 4-1 win Wednesday night 
that gave them their second straight Series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight, I kind of feel what it's like to be a Yankee for  
sure,'' Clemens said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-hour after the game, he returned to the field from  
the clubhouse and jumped on top of the Yankees' dugout, leaning 
into the front row of the stands to hug and high-five fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens came to New York in February, looking for a ring. Those  
five Cy Young Awards were nice -- more than enough for each kid in 
the family -- but he couldn't flash one on a finger and proclaim 
himself a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he can. Here he was, bounding off the mound like a kid to  
field three comebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	He might not admit it, but he was juiced. He didn't allow a fly  
ball to an outfielder, didn't allow a runner past first base until 
the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to do it,'' Series MVP Mariano Rivera  
said. ``This guy was pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the mound, he stopped by Monument Park to give  
Babe Ruth's plaque a little pat. And then he gave a performance 
that would make Ruth proud. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Lockhart in the fifth was the only batter to reach leading  
off an inning. He was quickly erased when Eddie Perez bounced into 
a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens pumped his right fist, then pointed his right index  
finger, the one that has released so many fastballs, at second 
baseman Chuck Knoblauch as if to say, you can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't allow another hit until the eighth, when Walt Weiss  
reached on an infield hit -- replays showed first base ump Gerry 
Davis blew the call, that Clemens had caught the ball and had his 
right foot on the bag before Weiss stepped on the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer came out, but Clemens stayed in, allowing a clean  
single to Gerald Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	That was it, with manager Joe Torre deciding Clemens should call  
it a night, even though players on the Yankees bench seemed to want 
Clemens to stay in. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly off the mound, Clemens walked. He waved his cap to the  
crowd, then waved his right hand. Teammates hugged him as he made 
his way down the dugout, then walked into the runway and back to 
the clubhouse as Jeff Nelson allowed a single to Bret Boone that 
drove in Atlanta's lone run. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans had stood and cheered, those same fans who spent the  
season questioning the decision to acquire him from Toronto for Mr. 
Perfect, David Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	He had brought so much baggage with him to New York, including  
the hatred of Boston fans who felt he turned traitor when he left 
the Red Sox after the 1996 season to sign with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	After pitching seven shutout innings against the Rangers in the  
first round, he was bombed in Boston, didn't get out of the third 
inning. The Fenway fans said that was the real Clemens, the one 
with the 2-3 postseason record, not the one who went 247-134 during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that, Clemens said Wednesday night. This is me.  
</P>
<P>
	He came to New York for his ring, and he got it, did it on his  
own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very blessed to be a part of the team,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His career may not be complete, but his mission is.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Victims Seeking Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans who have sued terrorist nations only  
to be stymied by their own government joined senators Wednesday in 
criticizing a Clinton administration proposal to appoint a 
committee to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``This city needs another committee like a moose needs a hat  
rack,'' said Stephen Flatow of West Orange, N.J. He is trying to 
collect on a $247.5 million judgment against Iran for the 1995 
death of his daughter, Alisa, a student who was killed when her bus 
was blown up while riding in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Flatow and his family sued Iran under a 1996 law that allows  
Americans to seek damages for terrorist acts by nations that 
sponsor international terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the same anti-terrorism law, three families sued Cuba for  
killing members of the exile group Brothers to the Rescue. Their 
two unarmed planes were shot down on Feb. 24, 1996, while 
patrolling the waters off South Florida in search of Cubans fleeing 
their homeland. They won a judgment of $187 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning in court, the survivors tried to collect on their  
judgments by seizing assets of Iran and Cuba frozen by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	But citing national security concerns, President Clinton last  
year invoked a waiver blocking the families from collecting their 
judgments from frozen assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Connie Mack, R-Fla.,  
responded this week by introducing legislation that would limit the 
scope of the president's waiver, allowing the White House to 
protect only certain diplomatic properties from seizure and sale. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee,  
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat called the 
legislation ``fundamentally flawed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfreezing assets to satisfy judgments, he said, would weaken  
U.S. diplomatic leverage over terrorist nations, place U.S. 
diplomatic properties around the world at risk of retaliation and 
create a ``winner-take-all race to the courthouse'' that will 
benefit only those filing the earliest lawsuits against a given 
terrorist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The two senators who showed up for the hearing, Republican Jon  
Kyl of Arizona and Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, 
supported the families and endorsed the Lautenberg-Mack 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl pressed Eizenstat to square the administration's current  
position with a Clinton statement from 1996. Addressing reporters 
after the Brothers to the Rescue shootdown, Clinton urged Congress 
to ``pass legislation that would provide immediate compensation to 
the families, something to which they are entitled under 
international law, out of Cuba's blocked assets here in the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl asked Eizenstat, ``Are you telling us he wasn't sincere or  
he hadn't checked with you lawyers first?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat replied that Clinton was sincere but did not envision  
the legislation that Congress ultimately passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton at the time also dipped into frozen Cuban assets to free  
up $300,000 for each family of a Brothers to the Rescue victim. 
Eizenstat called that ``a one-time humanitarian gesture'' not 
intended as a precedent.

<HEADLINE> Gore-Bradley Debate Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Six-year-old Nikkita Gottling may not know  
what Al Gore does for a living, but she knew enough to be in the 
right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunapee girl and her mother were browsing through the  
Dartmouth Bookstore before a doctor's appointment Wednesday 
afternoon when the vice president came in. 
</P>
<P>
	Spying Nikkita at the end of an aisle, Gore went over and began  
reading the book she was holding, ``Tikvah Means Hope'' by Patricia 
Polacco, a tale of a cat that survives a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked Nikkita whether she knew who Gore was, the  
girl said no. Her mother, a Democrat who has yet to choose a 
candidate, helped her out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helps run the country,'' Sally Gottling said.  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps hoping to sway her mother's vote, Gore motioned the girl  
to the counter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on, Nikkita, let's go buy your book,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And he did.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the store, there was some confusion over which candidate  
the crowd was waiting to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's Bradley,'' one passerby said.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I think it's Gore,'' said another.  
</P>
<P>
	Anyone counting the campaign signs on the sidewalk would have  
guessed Bradley -- his sign-holders outnumbered Gore's by at least 
10 to one. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gore emerged, only a few of his supporters waved their signs,  
their chants of ``Gore! Gore! Gore!'' drowned out by Bradley's 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two, four, six, eight. Who are we going to nominate?'' they  
yelled. ``Bradley!'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Bradley slowly plowed through dozens of  
journalists and a handful of passers-by along the same street, 
shaking hands and making small talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Ladeau grabbed his right hand with both of hers.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're one of the honest ones,'' she said, gazing up at the  
former basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
	He played down the importance of the evening's forum.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every day is an important day when you're campaigning,''  
Bradley told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From Tim Van Leer's spot on Main Street, Gore and Bradley were  
good for business, but he says neither would be good for the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Leer spent Wednesday morning selling jewelry, socks, fleece  
hats and other odds and ends from a sidewalk cart. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the crowds the Democratic candidates attracted boosted  
business a bit, but he'd rather see Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, however, won't be joining his Republican rivals when they  
face each other in a forum Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about that,'' Van Leer said. ``I think it's  
probably a smart move for him. Let the other guys battle it out, 
let them do the damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Hanover resident said he considers himself an  
independent. He voted for President Clinton in 1992, but went for 
Bob Dole four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping Bush picks up Elizabeth Dole as his running mate,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain also was in the right place Wednesday.  
Arriving a day ahead of the Republican debate, he announced a plan 
to pay for a national school voucher program by canceling 
government subsidies for ethanol, sugar and the gas and oil 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he isn't taking anything for granted despite his  
recent gains in the polls. He said he considers all his 
challengers, even those in single digits, viable candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe at this time in 1992, there was an obscure governor  
of Arkansas who was mired in single digits who came on very strong 
in this state,'' he said, referring to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, following the examples of Republican rivals Bush and  
conservative Steve Forbes, will begin airing his first television 
advertisement this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said it is a biographical spot that draws from his rich  
personal history, including five years in a Vietnamese prisoner of 
war camp. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign planned to unveil the ads Thursday in New  
Hampshire, hours before the second GOP debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore recently aired his first ad, which is biographical. None of  
the campaigns have resorted to negative campaign ads as yet.

<HEADLINE> Man Creates Charity, Kills Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Hal Hovey took a long look at the high  
cost of living with cancer and didn't like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	The former state finance director first consulted with his  
doctor on treatment options. Then he pored over cost-benefit 
analyses and a computer spreadsheet he set up showed a grim future 
in black-and-white: His treatment would cost as much as $25,000 but 
would have uncertain results. 
</P>
<P>
	So Hovey chose to donate the amount he would have spent on his  
own treatment to create a fund that would help young cancer 
patients. Then he took his own life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey's decision was ``consistent with everything I knew about  
Hal Hovey,'' said David Sweet, dean of Cleveland State University's 
College of Urban Affairs and a former state development director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could just see him there doing a cold-hearted analysis of  
cost and benefits and coming to a conclusion that not many would 
probably follow,'' Sweet said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey chose not to watch himself deteriorate into a husk of his  
former self, his daughter said. Hovey died at age 60 of a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound Oct. 18 on Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months leading up to his death, Hovey, a smoker without  
health insurance, read several books on his illness -- cancer of the 
mouth -- and set up projections of estimated expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	His final decisions ``were really just a continuation of his  
whole life and the difficult decisions you make in government,'' 
said his daughter Kendra Hovey. ``Trying to make a decision that 
will do the most good, put the money where it will do the most 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hovey Fund will cover costs incurred by cancer patients not  
covered by insurance, such as transportation, lodging, child care 
and nonprescription drugs. The fund will accept donations to keep 
it going. 
</P>
<P>
	Money will be available to children up to age 19 suffering  
chronic illnesses such as sickle cell anemia or cerebral palsy, and 
cancer patients 16 to 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey was a public policy analyst at the Batelle Memorial  
Institute in Columbus when Democratic Gov.-elect John Gilligan 
tapped him to become state finance director in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the architect of Ohio's income tax. Legislators  
``quickly learned to take his word and his figures as rock-solid, 
the absolute truth,'' Gilligan said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, he became state budget director in Illinois, and later  
worked as a budgeting consultant to several federal agencies and 
state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey left Gilligan's office in 1973 to become state budget  
director in Illinois. He later worked as a budgeting consultant to 
several federal agencies and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey ``had a fantastically well-organized analytical mind,''  
Gilligan said. ``He could take over just a haystack of papers and 
reports and accounts, all speaking a different language, and make 
absolutely good sense about them so that anybody could read and 
understand them.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Tolerates Dishonesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- About cheating, stealing and lying, most parents  
know exactly what to teach their kids. But when it comes to 
dishonesty in baseball, it's not always an easy call. 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is, the national pastime not only tolerates  
untruthfulness, it often rewards it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen an instance when a player's had a call go  
his way when he knew it was wrong and he's fessed up,'' says Ken 
Burns, maker of the acclaimed, nine-part PBS documentary on 
baseball. ``If it's to your team's advantage, you don't say 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Simone Mordas, a mother of five who coaches children's  
baseball, soccer and ice hockey, was confronted with the ethical 
dilemma as her young sons stayed up late this month watching the 
Boston Red Sox unsuccessfully battle the New York Yankees for the 
American League title. 
</P>
<P>
	Blown calls by umpires in the first and fourth games of the  
series went against the Red Sox, and the umpires later admitted 
they were mistaken. But the beneficiary of the mistakes -- Yankees 
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch -- kept quiet, later saying he hadn't 
known the calls were bad. 
</P>
<P>
	And if he had? It wouldn't have mattered. Umpires, and not  
players, are responsible for making the call. Unlike, say, golf, 
baseball does not work on the honor system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard -- you feel conflicted,'' says Ms. Mordas, 34, of  
Wayland. ``You tell your kids to be honest, and the players aren't 
always.'' At the same time, ``I try to teach (the children) you 
can't question the referees or umpires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The phenomenon can be confusing for young fans, says Richard  
Lapchick, director of Northeastern University's Center for the 
Study of Sport in Society. ``I think the implication for children 
is you're telling them it's OK to not do something honest -- if you 
can get away with it,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the ``what goes around comes around'' rationale:  
For every erroneous call that goes a player's way, there's probably 
at least one that has gone against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Benefiting from a blown call in baseball is not considered a  
dishonest or dirty victory. In fact, Burns says, ``That would be a 
point of pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say I'd feel guilty'' about benefiting from an  
umpire's mistake, says Red Sox star Nomar Garciaparra. ``(Baseball) 
can't work with an honor system. Tell me any sport that can work 
with an honor system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the idea that you should get away with whatever you can  
carries over into sports like hockey, basketball and football. 
Honesty may be the best policy, but even Michael Jordan didn't call 
fouls on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In golf, however, professionals for a century have penalized  
themselves for infractions unseen by their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the Greater Hartford Open in 1996, Greg Norman  
learned the ball he used the first two rounds was not properly 
labeled. Despite being five strokes off the lead, the defending 
champion turned himself in and was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, two-time U.S. Open tennis champion Patrick Rafter  
stunned the crowd and his opponent, Andrei Cherkasov, during a 
second-set tiebreaker at a tournament in Australia. Rafter -- 
already down a set -- overturned a call that was in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `No, no, the linesman is wrong. It's your point,'''  
recalls ATP spokesman Joe Lynch. Rafter went on to lose the next 
point and the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, incidents like that are rare, even in the so-called  
country club sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a sense of fairness and a sense of decency which no  
longer exists,'' says retired tennis player Ted Schroeder, who won 
Wimbledon in 1949 and the U.S. Open in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	With the World Series under way this week, parents may want to  
explain that baseball -- like life -- has its share of hard work, 
victory, loss and, yes, tough breaks, Burns says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember playing ball and having a call go my way when I was  
clearly out and going, `Great!''' he says. ``Sometimes they go 
against you, sometimes with you, and that's just the way it is. 
There's human fallibility built into every aspect of the game, and 
that's a glorious thing.''

	Two Hostages in Armenia Released  
</P>
<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- At least two of the captives being held  
in Armenia's parliament were released early Thursday, nearly 10 
hours after gunmen killed Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian and at 
least six other people before holing up in the building with dozens 
of hostages. The attackers demanded to see the president. ``This 
shake-up is needed for the nation to regain its senses,'' said a 
man identified as the gunmen's leader, Nairi Unanian. He said the 
deaths were unintended except for Sarkisian, who he claimed had 
failed to serve the nation.

	News of Surplus Sparks Budget Fight  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States posted a record $123 billion  
federal budget surplus last year, marking the first back-to-back 
surpluses since Dwight Eisenhower was president. The announcement -- 
exceeding all estimates -- sparked a battle for bragging rights 
today between the White House and the Republican-led Congress, with 
both sides hoping to reap political dividends in next year's 
elections. President Clinyon, battling Republicans over spending, 
accused the GOP of writing a budget that siphons $18 billion from 
the Social Security surplus. Republicans also claimed credit for 
the surplus.

	Ventura Says `No' to 2000 Question  
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura tried again today to clear  
up questions about his presidential ambitions by issuing a 
resounding ``no.'' A day earlier, the Reform Party governor had 
told Harvard Current magazine that he would consider running if 
Minnesotans mobilized behind him. But Ventura acknowledged his 
long-standing policy of never saying never to anything, and blamed 
the media for contorting his comments to make something out of 
them. ``Certainly, I don't know if tomorrow, anything can happen 
tomorrow. But I tell you no means no,'' Ventura said.

	Gore, Bradley To Debate in N.H.  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley will hold their  
first debate of the Democratic presidential campaign tonight. The 
stakes were highest for the vice president, who has watched a 
commanding lead in polls dwindle in the face of Bradley's 
surprisingly strong campaign. The former New Jersey senator is 
rated even or slightly ahead in New Hampshire, where the nation's 
first primary is scheduled for Feb. 1. Audience members will 
furnish the questions in tonight's 60-minute televised forum.

	Houston Is Smoggiest City in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston has moved past Los Angeles to become the  
smoggiest city in America. Houston and Los Angeles were running 
neck-and-neck in air pollution stakes until Oct. 7, when the 
nation's fourth-largest city surpassed the second-largest by 
recording its 44th smog day of the year. Texas is staring at an EPA 
deadline next month to come up with a plan to clean its skies by 
2007. The government has threatened to take away money for Texas 
highway construction if the state doesn't start making progress 
soon.

	FDA Approves New Flu Pill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flu sufferers won their first effective pill  
against both types A and B flu today, as the Food and Drug 
Administration approved Tamiflu. The pill, manufactured by Hoffman 
La-Roche, helped reduce the duration and severity of flu symptoms 
in unvaccinated adults who agreed to be infected to test the drug. 
The decision means flu sufferers this year have two new treatment 
choices. The FDA earlier approved an inhaled flu drug called 
Relenza that also works against both A and B flu.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's losses widened in the third quarter  
as the giant Internet retailer significantly boosted its spending 
to expand its online offerings. The steep losses were less than 
analysts were expecting. Amazon.com's sales grew by 132 percent 
from the year-ago period and its customer base climbed by 2.4 
million to 13.1 million. Amazon.com lost $197 million in the three 
months ended Sept. 30. Sales in the quarter rose to $355.8 million, 
up from $153.7 million a year ago.

<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Tests for the herniated disc the Dallas  
Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin sustained earlier this month 
have uncovered a narrow spinal cord, a genetic condition that 
increases risk of serious injury if he takes another blow to the 
head or neck. In 1986, Green Bay cornerback Tim Lewis and Houston 
Oilers linebacker Frank Bush learned they had the same genetic 
condition. Both retired.

<HEADLINE> Braves Suffer World Series Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- One for the '90s. Maybe the next decade will be  
kinder to the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while making eight straight postseason appearances -- a feat  
unmatched by any other team -- these Braves will remembered as the 
Buffalo Bills of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairly or unfairly, that's their legacy after the New York  
Yankees completed a World Series sweep with a 4-1 victory Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	One Series title in 10 years is not enough to secure a loftier  
place in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many potential championships got away.  
</P>
<P>
	There was 1991, when Lonnie Smith stopped running and Minnesota  
won Game 7 in the 10th inning. That one was excused in the 
tomahawk-chopping euphoria over a miraculous worst-to-first season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves expected to win in '92 against Toronto and were on  
their way to a 2-0 lead in the Series until pinch-hitter Ed Sprague 
homered in the ninth against ancient Jeff Reardon. The Blue Jays 
went on claim the title in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning their lone Series title of the decade, beating  
Cleveland in '95, the Braves were poised to establish themselves as 
one of the great teams in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	They won the first two games of the '96 Series at Yankee Stadium  
by a combined score of 16-1, only to lose the next three at old 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The collapse was completed back in 
New York, and the Braves have never been so close to another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The decade of lost chances ended on a dismal note, the Yankees  
finishing off the four-game blitz with a workmanlike victory. It 
was the first time this decade that Atlanta lost a best-of-7 series 
in fewer than six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey Atlanta,'' said a placard held up by one Yankees fan.  
``Ever Heard of the Buffalo Bills?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message was clear: The Braves now have a place alongside the  
NFL team that lost four straight Super Bowls in the first half of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear about it all the time,'' second baseman Bret Boone  
said before the finale. ``But ... no, I don't think the players 
themselves worry about living up to the expectations that we've got 
to win `X' amount of World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not, but the totality of this defeat overshadowed what had  
been an amazing season for the Braves. They managed to win 103 
games despite losing five players to season-ending illness and 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough road for us this year,'' Boone said. ``For us  
to win as many games as we did and get by with a lot of our main 
guys out of there, I know everybody in that room is pretty darn 
proud of what we've done this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the final chance for Team of the Decade honors turned out to  
be a debacle. The Yankees showed Atlanta how it's supposed to be 
done, celebrating their third title in four years while their fans 
mocked the Braves with a Bronx version of the ``Tomahawk Chop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta finished the decade with three straight 100-win seasons  
and nary a Series title to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a bit of drama to the final game of the '90s,  
unlike the previous night when the Braves squandered their best 
chance to make a Series of it by blowing a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored all of their runs in the third, taking  
advantage of a potential double-play grounder that bounced off the 
right arm of first baseman Ryan Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	While judged a hit by the official scorers, it was clearly a  
miscue -- the kind of play the Yankees always seem to make, the kind 
of play the Braves couldn't make at critical times. 
</P>
<P>
	With Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez watching from the dugout,  
sidelined by cancer and a bum knee respectively, the free-swinging 
Atlanta hitters were thoroughly dominated by New York's starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez allowed on hit in Game 1. David Cone matched  
him in Game 2. Roger Clemens surrendered four hits in the clincher, 
allowing just one Braves runner to reach second base when he left 
with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox will take his share of blame for letting this  
one get away, too. In Game 1, when the Braves took a 1-0 lead into 
the eighth, he left starter Greg Maddux in the game four hitters 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 -- a contest the Braves had to have -- flu-ridden Tom  
Glavine was sent back to the mound in the eighth with a 5-3 lead, 
even though Cox said beforehand that all he wanted was seven solid 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two batters later, the game was tied on Chuck Knoblauch's  
315-homer down the right-field line. Two innings later, the series 
effectively ended when Chad Curtis hit a ball considerably farther 
into the Braves bullpen for a 6-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Braves bid adieu to the 1990s. Good riddance.

<HEADLINE> Study: Schools Unprepared for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the worst-case scenario, some of the  
nation's schoolchildren could return from winter vacation to find 
heating systems, cafeteria freezers and security systems failing -- 
or kaput. 
</P>
<P>
	With two months to go, more than a third of the nation's schools  
and colleges remain unprepared for the Year 2000's effect on 
computers and other technology, the Education Department said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the schools surveyed offer another scenario: 96 percent of  
districts with kindergarten through 12th grade and 97 percent of 
colleges contend they'll be ready by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials ultimately estimate that 15 percent of the nation's  
schools, or 12,000 schools, would not be ready for the Year 2000 
problem and may have to delay reopening after winter vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, the president's Council on Year 2000 Conversion  
chairman, said that in the next two months schools and colleges 
need to concentrate on fixing their systems, making sure they are 
independently tested and developing contingency plans in case of 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially schools looked at it as a software processing  
problem,'' Koskinen said. ``It has taken a long time for local 
educators to realize how much they rely on education technology for 
their operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite optimistic predictions for overall preparations for the  
Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K -- the Clinton administration 
has warned that schools, some cities, small hospitals and small 
businesses are foot-dragging on contingency plans for computer 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem occurs because some computer programs,  
especially older ones, might fail when the date changes to 2000. 
The programs, originally written to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year, could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials acknowledge that Y2K-related failures in schools would  
have little direct impact on teaching and learning, outside of 
lessons involving information technology. But the failures could 
have the worst effect where schools are least prepared, on critical 
operations such as school building heating and security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It boggles the mind that these planners couldn't foresee the  
Year 2000 was quickly approaching,'' said William L. Rukeyser, 
coordinator of Learning in the Real World, a Woodland, Calif.-based 
group often critical of ballooning school technology expenditures. 
``Reading a calendar is not brain surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Education Department survey last spring found that just 28  
percent of the more than 3,500 school districts surveyed had 
reached compliance, and only 30 percent of roughly 2,100 colleges 
had all of their systems Y2K ready. Then, many school districts and 
colleges predicted their Y2K work and contingency planning would 
have been finished by Oct. 1, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	But the follow-up survey conducted at the beginning of this  
month suggests there's little for the lagging schools to do now but 
prepare as best they can for the glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the fixes, any information that relies on a date could  
experience a year's-end glitch. Conceivably, heating systems could 
fail, cafeteria freezers could shut down, teacher paychecks could 
be held up and student records could be corrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey is based on a random sampling of 1,200 of the  
nation's local education agencies and 1,600 colleges contacted by 
mail in the first week of September. Almost 1,000 school districts 
and more than 1,350 colleges responded by participating in a phone 
survey.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 6, Islanders 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure scored two goals in his first  
action in two weeks as the Florida Panthers defeated the New York 
Islanders 6-3 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure and Mark Parrish each scored twice as the Panthers snapped  
a two-game losing streak. The six goals were the most by Florida 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure has five goals and four assists in five games this season.  
It was Bure's first action since suffering a groin injury against 
Montreal on Oct. 12, forcing him to miss five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Whitney scored a goal and had two assists, and Viktor Kozlov  
had three assists for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Filip Kuba also scored for the Panthers, who jumped to a 3-0  
lead in the first period, beginning with Bure's goal at 2:55 
against Felix Potvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney scored at 7:32, and Parrish followed at 12:21.  
</P>
<P>
	New York pulled within 3-1 on Olli Jokinen's power-play goal  
with 1:20 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida went ahead 4-1 on Kuba's power-play goal at 7:21 of the  
second period. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure's second goal of the night padded Florida's lead to 5-1  
with 4:57 left in the second. Whitney was credited for his second 
assist, working the puck from behind the net to Bure, whose wrist 
shot from the slot beat Potvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Parrish added a second goal to open a 6-1 lead for the Panthers  
with 2:36 left in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Connolly scored for New York on a power-play goal with 5.3  
seconds left in the second period, and Mariusz Czerkawksi scored at 
1:35 of the third period to close the gap to 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Brunell, Taylor Probable for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Quarterback Mark Brunell and running  
back Fred Taylor, two of Jacksonville's most important offensive 
weapons, are likely to play Sunday at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell is trying to overcome a strained muscle near his ribs  
that he aggravated two weeks ago while throwing a long pass against 
Cleveland. Taylor has been out since Oct. 3 with an aggravated 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunell threw less than usual in practice Wednesday. He said he  
needs to know he can make all the throws if he's to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you don't make them all now,'' Brunell said. ``You make  
them as you get closer to the game. The long ball is certainly 
something I've got to be able to throw Sunday. That's important, 
but it's still early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's injury has improved steadily since he left the lineup  
in the middle of a game against the Steelers. Coach Tom Coughlin 
said some of Jacksonville's troubles on offense -- the Jaguars are 
ranked 14th with just two plays of more than 40 yards -- might be 
solved with Taylor back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should be a good week for Fred and hopefully he'll be  
ready to perform this weekend,'' Coughlin said. ``And certainly, 
our big-play opportunities should come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coughlin said backup quarterback Jay Fiedler would get more work  
than usual in practice this week. He said a final decision on 
Brunell's status would be made later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiedler completed 12 of 14 passes for 113 yards in relief of  
Brunell against the Browns, leading the Jaguars to 18 points in a 
come-from-behind 24-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to go so deep into the week where someone is not  
as prepared as they should be because they're not getting the right 
number of snaps,'' Coughlin said. ``We've been in this situation 
before. We just have to get a good feeling of where Mark is after 
practice.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Art Reaching the Masses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julie Fergang always loved art but found buying  
intimidating -- until she got on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	She bought a $1,700 Mario Giacomelli photograph last spring from  
the comfort of her New York City apartment. It went so well, she 
has been checking the Net once or twice a week for more items to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
	High-end art priced at $1,000 or more is reaching the masses.  
With the Internet, no longer are buyers required to visit galleries 
or auction houses, where newcomers complain they do not always feel 
welcome unless they carry checkbooks with large balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Artstar.com will join the growing list of art-auction sites  
Thursday. Last week, mass-market auction site eBay created a 
special section for higher-priced artwork and antiques. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the old-line auction houses such as Christie's and  
Sotheby's are preparing to go online. Sotheby's has more than 
10,000 pieces lined up for two sites later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fergang, who used artnet.com for her purchase, said the Net  
opens up art to ``a whole different class of buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very old-world charm to running into Christie's or  
Sotheby's,'' she said, ``but there the eyes are on you, and there's 
an old-world intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artnet.com has sold some 350 pieces worth more than $1 million  
to Ms. Fergang and other collectors since March. During the past 
two weeks, the site sold a 1967 Andy Warhol screenprint for $34,650 
and a 1980 Marc Chagall lithograph for $16,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Neuendorf, a former gallery owner who started Artnet, said  
he is trying to change the traditionally exclusive art world by 
giving customers privacy and access to information. ``That 
liberates them and makes it easier for them to buy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galleries that have sold online agree that the Net is changing  
the industry for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bartman, who runs Art Resources Transfer in New York,  
said galleries and art dealers are generally in big cities such as 
New York and Los Angeles. Through the Internet, he has received 35 
orders from such locales as Gulfport, Miss., and Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are coming from places we would never normally have  
contact with,'' he said. ``They never would have walked into the 
space we have in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inability to actually touch the art is not necessarily a  
drawback. Long before the Internet, art collectors bought without 
first seeing the work in person. Galleries and auction houses 
published catalogs and accepted bids by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Internet raises concerns about the potential  
for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-time collector Ken Raboy in Dallas said he bought an Warhol  
print through eBay for about $1,200, and it arrived with a two-inch 
tear. He contacted the seller and was told the warranty lasted only 
three days. He still buys on the Internet, but with caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many art auction sites now offer authentication services and  
guarantees for the higher-priced goods. Even eBay, which considers 
itself no more than a pipeline to connect buyer with seller, now 
offers guarantees for the higher-end items sold at its Great 
Collections section. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before you write a ten- or maybe a hundred-thousand-dollar  
check, you want a guarantee. You want to chat with an expert,'' 
said Steve Westly, eBay's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	David Redden, executive vice president for Sotheby's in New  
York, can no longer ignore the Internet. When Sotheby's held an 
online auction last year, 40 percent of customers were new. 
</P>
<P>
	Redden said he does not think the Internet will entirely replace  
the traditional auction house, particularly for the items priced in 
the millions of dollars, but he is not ruling anything out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been an auctioneer for 24 years, and I don't really want  
to be redundant yet,'' he said. ``But one thing I've learned is 
that no one will speculate too far ahead. You just don't know 
what's going to be coming down the road in terms of technology.''

<HEADLINE> Raptors Cut Rapper Master P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Master P took the news hard.  
</P>
<P>
	The multimillionaire rap artist and producer, whose real name is  
Percy Miller, was waived by the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday along 
with former Duke forward Antonio Lang. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was crushed,'' Raptors forward Vince Carter said of Master  
P. ``He was rejected and it was hard. Especially with him being an 
entertainer, you don't really see rejection as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Miller, who has parlayed his music success into  
a successful recording label, No Limit Records, and a financial 
interest in a sports agent business, No Limit Sports, was a 
training camp invitee by the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto coach Butch Carter wanted to stash him on the injured  
reserve list, but he said the decision was made in consultation 
with Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald and team president 
Richard Peddie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miller didn't like it,'' Carter said. ``He's no different than  
any other multimillionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite looking overmatched when inserted into exhibition games  
-- usually in the closing minutes -- he was a hit with fans. During 
games in Edmonton, Dallas and Toronto, fans chanted loudly for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Though friends with his teammates, some of them disapproved of  
his presence. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Raptors blew an 11-point lead against Dallas with  
Miller on the floor, veteran Charles Oakley made his feelings 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess when you've been around long enough, you see  
everything, but I'm not for that kind of stuff,'' Oakley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who played briefly in the CBA last year after being cut  
by the Charlotte Hornets in training camp, averaged 2.2. points and 
4.0 minutes is six exhibition games with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took it very seriously,'' Raptors center Kevin Willis said.  
``He wanted to come out and try to prove himself, but it just 
didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's sports company represents New Orleans Saints rookie  
running back Ricky Williams as well as NBA players Ron Mercer and 
Derek Anderson. He played against Anderson when the Los Angeles 
Clippers visited Toronto earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang, who previously played with Phoenix, Cleveland and Miami,  
averaged 2.8 points and 3.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts leave the Raptors with a roster of 14.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sometimes he pitches two innings, sometimes one  
inning. The distances differ from game to game, but always the 
results are the same for Mariano Rivera, anchor of the New York 
Yankees bullpen and MVP of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera saved Game 1 of the Series, getting the last four outs in  
a 4-1 Yankees victory. He came back with two scoreless innings as 
the winning pitcher in the 6-5 victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, he came on in the eighth inning with the  
tying runs on base and retired Chipper Jones on a grounder to end 
Atlanta's last threat. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight postseason appearances, Rivera had two victories and  
six saves. He has not allowed a run in his last 25 2-3 innings of 
postseason play over 18 outings with two victories and 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's save extended his streak to 12 1-3 consecutive  
scoreless innings over eight games in three World Series. The last 
time he gave up a run in a Series game was the eighth inning of 
Game 3 in 1996. The Yankees beat Atlanta that night, triggering a 
record-tying streak of 12 World Series victories for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera said he relishes the high-wire act of a reliever.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the challenge,'' he said. ``I love to be in that  
situation. I guess that's my motivation. Once you're there, you 
have butterflies in your stomach. You know you're there for real. 
You just want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford to give up any runs, so I don't think about it.  
If I give it up, I give it up. That's not in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was the Yankees' setup man in the 1996 World Series when  
John Wetteland was the closer and saved all four Yankees victories 
against Atlanta to win that Series MVP award. When Wetteland signed 
as a free agent with Texas, New York moved Rivera into the closer 
role and he has flourished there. In three seasons as the closer, 
he has 122 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're the setup man, you know somebody will come behind  
you,'' Rivera said. ``When you're the closer, you know there's 
nobody coming behind you. It's tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The setup man has a net. The closer has nothing. If he falls,  
he's dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His postseason earned-run average of 0.36 -- two earned runs  
allowed in 47 1-3 innings -- is the lowest for any pitcher with at 
least 30 innings pitched in postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was just as good in the regular season, finishing with a  
4-3 record and 1.83 ERA and converted 45 of 49 save opportunities, 
which tied his career high. He ended the regular season with a 
scoreless streak of 30 2-3 innings over 28 games and converted his 
last 22 save chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The slender 29-year-old, who grew up playing with gloves cut out  
of cardboard in his native Panama, last gave up a run on July 16 
against Atlanta, over three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In three chances against him in the World Series, the Braves  
didn't come close to getting another.

<HEADLINE> Helms Has Congresswomen Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several congresswomen were removed from a  
Senate hearing today on orders of Sen. Jesse Helms after they tried 
to present him a letter supporting an international treaty against 
sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee, has blocked a Senate vote on the 1979 United Nations 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., led the congresswomen and several  
female staff members to Helms' office and then to the Foreign 
Relations Committee, where he was chairing a hearing on China. They 
tried to present him a letter signed by more than 100 House members 
in support of the U.N. Convention to eliminate All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
	After asking the women to ``please act like ladies,'' Helms  
directed Capitol Police to escort them from the hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women of the House will no longer tolerate his delay  
tactics,'' Woolsey said. She said Democratic representatives had 
attempted to meet with Helms for nearly five years on the treaty, 
but had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not know what the senator's objections to the treaty  
could possibly be, because he hasn't told us,'' said Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' staffers had no comment after the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	Helms, a critic of the United Nations, has often opposed U.S.  
participation in international treaties. He recently led Senate 
efforts to defeat ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey said 162 nations had ratified the women's treaty since  
the U.N. General Assembly approved it 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton submitted the U.N. convention on women's  
rights to the Senate in 1994. Helms has not scheduled hearings on 
the issue, or submitted the treaty to the full Senate for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discussed  
ratification of the treaty with Helms. ``It's not his favorite 
treaty, but I have made clear it is an administration priority,'' 
Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Series Win Is Sweet for Torre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Torre knew coming back was right the first  
time he realized the knot in his stomach had more to do with the 
fear of losing a baseball game than his battle with cancer. And 
Wednesday night, for the first time in months, he didn't have to 
worry about either. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy since May and manager of the world champions for the  
third time in four years, Torre hung back in the dugout for a few 
moments after the last out of a 4-1 win disappeared into left 
fielder Chad Curtis' glove. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, he made his way up the steps and into that waving,  
screaming, joyous jumble of players on the pitcher's mound, 
disappearing into the middle of a celebration that would have been 
impossible without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put into words,'' Torre said, ``what this feels  
like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Measured by numbers, this season was less impressive than last.  
The Yankees won fewer regular-season games, scored less and gave up 
more runs. But measured by the adversity they overcame to reach the 
pinnacle of the game a second straight year, this one was more 
impressive. Much more. 
</P>
<P>
	Their tribulations began early in spring training, when Torre  
was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and didn't end with the last 
game. Right fielder Paul O'Neill played that one with a heavy 
heart, having lost his father, Charlie, to a continuing heart 
problem some 18 hours earlier. Those were the bookends, but hardly 
the only misfortunes these Yankees had to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, reserve infielder Luis Sojo left the club to  
take the body of his father, Ambrosio, back to Venezuela for 
burial. Last month, it was Scott Brosius, returning to Oregon to 
bury his father, Maury. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the New Yorkers had to find a way to bring wayward  
native son Darryl Strawberry back into the fold, to honor two 
fallen heroes -- Joe DiMaggio and Catfish Hunter -- from their past 
and honor that glorious tradition by doing more than wearing 
commemorative patches on their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	But through it all, they never took their eyes off the prize.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of emotion on this club this year,'' Torre  
began before paying tribute to the sons among them who had lost 
fathers and played on. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will never be another first,'' he continued, ``but even  
after what we accomplished last year, I think this might be a 
better team -- only because we had to do it again to validate last 
year.''

<HEADLINE> Cox Becomes Accidental Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bobby Cox wandered the Big Apple like a tourist  
before Game 3 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing this, most New York Yankee fans would ask: ``Alone and  
unarmed?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes.  
</P>
<P>
	But that was hardly the biggest risk the Atlanta manager took  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That almost certainly was letting weakened Tom Glavine start the  
eighth inning. Unless it was letting Glavine face the second 
batter, Chuck Knoblauch, who promptly redirected Glavine's 77th 
pitch of the night over the short porch in right. That homer tied a 
game the Yankees would win 6-5, effectively vacuuming the last bit 
of drama from this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got beat with a pop-up to right field,'' Cox grumbled  
afterward, ``a Yankee home run. They hit three of those tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees actually hit four, but Cox had no problem with the  
last one. Chad Curtis began the 10th by crushing a pitch over the 
left-field wall. It had plenty to spare, landing in the middle of 
the Braves' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That one,'' Cox said, ``was really tagged.''  
</P>
<P>
	Besides, that wasn't the one with all the sleepless nights  
written all over it. That would be Knoblauch's, now and forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three-hundred-and-fifteen feet,'' Cox sighed one final time.  
``That's an out in my book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not the only page in his book that needs revising.  
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of this series, the Braves were contending for  
team of the decade. Now, it will take a miracle just for them to 
get off the deck. And the 58-year-old Cox will share responsibility 
for the fall, as much as the guys who couldn't hit, run and throw 
straight when it mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	He might be as good a regular-season manager as there is. But  
the Braves' 1-3 mark in the World Series already this decade 
suggests Cox hasn't figured how to play October baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Game 3, he was asked how much the flu weakened Glavine  
and how long he would pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven strong innings,'' Cox replied. Told the microphone in  
front of him wasn't working, he said it again. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the seventh, pitching coach Leo Mazzone had  
relievers Russ Springer and Mike Remlinger, the eventual loser, 
warming up. Glavine gave up a home run to Martinez to pull New York 
to 5-3. Nobody in the Atlanta dugout twitched. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he gave up a leadoff single to Joe Girardi to begin the  
eighth. This time, Mazzone had closer John Rocker warming up. 
Still, nobody twitched, even when Glavine started Knoblauch off 
with a 2-0 count. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all thought he was throwing great,'' Cox said.  
</P>
<P>
	Echoed Mazzone: ``He started the eighth at 70-something pitches.  
He was doing everything right. We actually thought he might go all 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had command, he was changing speeds, he didn't drop off at  
all. And we had Rocker going just in case something crazy 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of which begs the question: The Braves got what they wanted  
from Glavine. They had Rocker ready to roll. Why not switch after 
seven? 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to take him out,'' Cox replied.  
``Really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that's where October baseball is different.  
</P>
<P>
	This game was not about saving the bullpen. It was not about  
winning three out of five. This was one game Atlanta absolutely had 
to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox still doesn't understand that. His New York counterpart, Joe  
Torre, wins in the postseason precisely because he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep stressing, `Don't think in terms of the regular  
season.' We have to win every game. Every game is a series in and 
of itself,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to lose your momentum. That's what it's all  
about, especially in five- and seven-game series. You lose that 
momentum and you start getting on your heels a little bit and 
getting a little uneasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If so, Cox was on his heels from the start.  
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, he got caught without a left-handed reliever for New  
York pinch-hitter Darryl Strawberry in the eighth. That's when 
fast-tiring Atlanta starter Greg Maddux, a master of control, 
walked Strawberry on five pitches. That pushed the tying run into 
scoring position and ignited the Yankees' decisive rally. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 2, Cox swapped regulars Walt Weiss, Bret Boone and Eddie  
Perez for Ozzie Guillen, Keith Lockhart and Greg Myers. The move 
reeked of panic. He didn't get the offense he needed and the 
Guillen-Lockhart combination discombobulated the Braves' normally 
solid middle-infield defense. The two figured prominently -- and 
poorly -- in four plays that helped New York win. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Game 4 tonight, Cox will probably walk around New York  
one more time. It's an old habit, something he does every time he 
visits, something he started doing three decades years ago, when he 
was an infielder with the Yankees briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all very nice,'' Cox said about New Yorkers. ``I  
haven't had one person this year in New York say anything bad about 
the Braves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What? And ruin a good thing?  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kofi Annan Offers Help in NBC Flap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After throwing out the first ball at the  
World Series, Secretary-General Kofi Annan jokingly offered his 
peacemaking skills Wednesday in the dispute between the New York 
Yankees and NBC over Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, who threw out the first ball at Yankee Stadium Tuesday  
night, wouldn't comment on his pitching prowess, saying, ``What I 
think is more important is the performance of the teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan was asked about ``a bit of a diplomatic controversy''  
sparked by NBC reporter Jim Gray asking former Cincinnati Reds star 
Pete Rose some tough questions. Gray's interview angered the 
Yankees and led to a team boycott of the reporter following the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Did Annan think a little diplomacy was needed?  
</P>
<P>
	Chuckling, the secretary-general replied, ``If they need a bit  
of peacemaking, this is what we are here for. I will give them 
whatever help we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC was deluged by complaints from fans Sunday night after  
Gray's interview with Rose at Turner Field in Atlanta. It centered 
on Rose's lifetime ban from the sport for gambling, and came 
minutes after he returned to a major league field for the first 
time in 10 years as a member of baseball's All-Century team.

<HEADLINE> Gore Starts Debate on His Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore staged a bit of political theater  
reminiscent of Ronald Reagan in 1980, seizing the initiative -- if 
not the microphone -- to begin debating rival Bill Bradley 15 
minutes before the debate officially began. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we do now?'' the vice president asked Wednesday night  
after he and the former New Jersey senator were introduced to the 
in-studio audience. It was an awkward period before airtime -- the 
candidates were fidgeting on their stools -- and Gore knew exactly 
what he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you start asking some questions while we're  
waiting?'' he told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	They did as he suggested. And the debate began on Gore's terms,  
just as he had planned. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tactic borrowed from former President Reagan, who broke  
the format in a 1980 debate and, when a moderator threatened to 
turn off his microphone, shot back: ``I paid for this microphone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan looked strong and in charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Advisers said Gore's strategy was to solicit questions from the  
get-go. It is part of what they hope is a new-and-improved 
candidate, one eager to answer every question, shake every hand and 
solicit every vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's trying very hard to connect with voters,'' said  
Vanderbilt University political science professor Erwin Hargrove. 
``Notice that he was asking people for their names, how many kids 
they have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like a fighter throwing the first punch before the opening bell,  
Gore never let up -- raising questions about Bradley's education, 
health care and spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers have to add up,'' said the vice president.  
</P>
<P>
	``The cost is way excessive.''  
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to shred the safety net'' that protects the poor.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradley calmly rebutted Gore and passed up chance after chance  
to lash out. ``I'm not going to get into the details at this point 
of the game,'' he said after being served a softball-sized chance 
to criticize Clinton-Gore fund-raising excesses in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made sweeping promises filled with vision and few  
specifics, saying it was time to reduce poverty, reform campaign 
finance laws and provide affordable health insurance to almost 
every American. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore all but begged for votes -- ``give me a chance to roll  
up my sleeves'' -- a typically understated Bradley said, ``If you 
agree, then you'll vote for me. I hope you do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first head-to-head encounter of their presidential campaign  
underscored the differences in styles. Gore was combative and 
coached, trying hard to look more homespun and drive down Bradley's 
rising poll numbers. The former New Jersey senator said voters are 
tired of political sniping and slick campaigning, so he avoided 
direct criticism and worked hard not to look like he's working 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It thought Gore was as good as I've ever seen him,'' said  
Democratic consultant Jim Duffy. ``He was trying desperately to 
look like a guy who is a friend, look like a guy who is 
intelligent, look like a guy who is compassionate. And yet, he 
pressed Bradley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy, who is not tied to either campaign, said Bradley came  
across as a soft-spoken, nontraditional candidate ``in an era where 
that might be very welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bradley talked about big ideas and handled them well,''  
Hargrove said. ``Gore seemed over eager at times -- kind of 
frantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time will tell whether voters welcome the change or not. ``I  
wonder if people will see him in this format and forget about his 
ties to President Clinton. It's possible,'' Hargrove said. ``It's 
nice to see him try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And try. And try.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to stick around,'' Gore said, as the television  
lights dimmed, ``and answer some more questions.'' Which he did, 
for 90 minutes. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Not Really an `Average' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average actually isn't  
an ``average'' of the 30 stocks it represents -- although it started 
out that way. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was first devised in 1896, the Dow's value was  
calculated by adding up the stock prices of 12 major companies and 
then simply dividing by 12. The resulting average was expressed in 
terms of points, rather than dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The formula remained the same in 1916 when the editors of The  
Wall Street Journal -- which created and still controls the Dow -- 
expanded it to 20 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Dow was expanded to 30 companies in 1928, the  
editors began using a new ``divisor'' rather than the number of 
stocks, to keep the average stable even if one stock was 
substituted for another, or if a stock was split. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock splits occur when a company cancels its shares and issues  
a larger amount of new shares, but at a lower price. For instance, 
in a 2-for-1 split, the price would be cut in half, but the number 
of shares would double. 
</P>
<P>
	The new divisor will be calculated to make sure the Dow starts  
Monday with the same value as it had the preceding Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only after trading begins Monday will the new stocks have an  
impact. High-tech stocks like Intel and Microsoft could cause the 
average to rise faster than the old stocks being deleted, but they 
will also likely mean bigger swings in the average since tech 
stocks are more volatile than those being removed.

<P>
	``Stuff that you picked out from a Dumpster has that trashed-out  
look that you can't get with new materials,'' Wing said. ``Death 
and decay is unsettling -- and that's what we're going for here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The enormous, scream-inducing Halloween attraction in this town  
80 miles north of New York City, takes visitors on a harrowing, 
10-minute journey through a Transylvanian graveyard, a wicked 
witches' forest, Miss Ann Thrope's fortune teller's den, the Mad 
Hatter's tea party, an opium den, an execution yard and 
Frankenstein's lab, where the 7-foot monster makes a brief 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing, 52, started building the fortress on town property last  
year -- the town commissioned him for the job. It will remain an 
annual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 80 children and adolescents turn out each October  
weekend night to work at the fortress. All must be members of the 
Stanford Recreation Program in order to take part. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is community theater,'' Wing said. ``This isn't like  
sports, where you have to be a certain height or size. Any child 
can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``cast'' also includes more than 200 adults who sew  
costumes, apply makeup, do construction work or sell tickets. Local 
residents donated an old school bus and a speaker system that pumps 
out creepy sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun making people scream,'' said 11-year-old actor Eban  
Coenen, who plays a different role each night. ``By the time they 
get to me, they're so scared that I think I could do anything and 
they would freak.''

<HEADLINE> Houston Tops L.A. As Smog Capital </HEADLINE>

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It was probably just a chemical belch at a  
factory on the edge of town. But it was enough to push Houston past 
Los Angeles to become the smoggiest city in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Los Angeles were running neck-and-neck in air  
pollution stakes until Oct. 7, when the nation's fourth-largest 
city surpassed the second-largest by recording its 44th smog day of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day that will live in infamy,'' Houston Health Department  
spokeswoman Kathy Barton said. ``Really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, the Houston count had reached 46. Los Angeles  
was still at 43. A smog day is when the ozone level rises above a 
certain mark set by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what caused the smog remains a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers know that large clouds of ethylene and propylene  
billowed over the city Oct. 7, and believe the gases were the 
product of one of the industrial plants on the edge of town. But 
they don't know which one. 
</P>
<P>
	The search has been narrowed down to 25 factories, all clustered  
around the Houston Ship Channel, home of the nation's largest 
concentration of petrochemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has had smoggy air for decades and has long been the  
butt of jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said unusually dry weather played a part in trapping  
dirty air over Houston, and Los Angeles may very well reclaim the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably pass it back and forth with each other for a  
few more years,'' said Gene McMullen, who has been monitoring 
pollution levels for the Health Department in Houston for decades. 
``It'll depend on whose weather is worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is staring at an EPA deadline next month to come up with a  
plan to clean its skies by 2007. The government has threatened to 
take away money for Texas highway construction if the state doesn't 
start making progress soon.

<HEADLINE> Financial Overhaul Bill Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top administration officials on Wednesday  
defended sweeping legislation to overhaul the financial services 
industries but failed to win over liberal Democrats in the House 
who assail the bill as a threat to consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would lift Depression-era barriers and allow banks,  
securities firms and insurance companies to merge. It appears 
headed toward enactment by the Republican-controlled Congress and a 
likely signature by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It has vocal opponents who are disturbed by provisions that  
would allow affiliated businesses of the newly merged companies to 
share customers' personal financial data as they offer one-stop 
shopping for loans, insurance and investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Clinton's top economic  
adviser, Gene Sperling, met with the Democrats in the House as 
several prominent liberals among them called on Clinton to veto the 
legislation. Many moderate House Democrats support it, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there will be a divided vote'' among Democrats,  
Summers said after the closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill. But he 
insisted that the legislation would protect consumers' financial 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hard-fought compromise ... represents a very significant  
step forward for the American economy and for American consumers,'' 
Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks would not be allowed to provide customers' data to  
telemarketers under the new legislation, but would be able to share 
it with affiliated financial companies under the same corporate 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
	With the White House having lifted its long-standing veto threat  
and now supporting it, the financial overhaul measure is being 
given the best chance ever of adoption after 20 years of 
congressional battles and intense lobbying by the financial 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a leader in the fight for  
liberal House Democrats on the privacy issue, said after 
Wednesday's meeting he was not persuaded by the administration's 
defense of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no protection'' for consumers, he said. ``Their  
privacy is now for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Democrats' leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told The  
Associated Press he has yet to decide whether he would endorse the 
legislation. Gephardt voted for a similar financial overhaul 
measure when it passed the House with a veto-proof vote, 343-86, in 
early July. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, who have complained bitterly about the  
privacy impact of the legislation, continued their criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a crying shame that the secretary of the  
Treasury is a cheerleader now for Wall Street,'' said Frank Torres, 
legislative counsel for Consumers Union. ``This bill isn't about 
helping consumers, it's about giving the industry what it wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markey, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, senior Democrat on the  
House Commerce Committee, and Reps. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., and Bill 
Luther, D-Minn., on Tuesday started circulating a letter among 
colleagues that urges Clinton to veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy is a pivotal issue in the transformation of the  
financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Data sharing is a major reason why financial companies want to  
merge, as it opens numerous opportunities for the companies to 
market a range of products and services. Proponents of the 
legislation maintain it will save American consumers billions of 
dollars a year by providing them more financial choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers are alarmed, however, at the prospect that their  
personal financial data could be shared and sold by companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad coalition of consumer groups, privacy advocates, the  
American Civil Liberties Union and Phyllis Schlafly's conservative 
Eagle Forum sent its own letter to Clinton on Tuesday urging his 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, conservative Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has  
broken with Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over 
the privacy issue and said he would vote against the bill. Shelby 
served notice on Monday that he will try to force changes in the 
privacy provisions and failing that, attempt to derail the measure. 
Under Senate rules, a single senator can hold up action for hours 
or days if he chooses to.

<HEADLINE> Bush Visits Crisis Pregnancy Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Touring a crisis pregnancy center  
Wednesday, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush touted 
``the beauty of adoption'' but said he wasn't prepared to offer 
direct federal help to churches that finance such programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush, the Texas governor, said he saw no conflict with  
taxpayer support for programs to which women are referred from the 
3,000 such centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of my job, should I become president, is to herald the  
beauty and love of adoptions and to recognize that in centers like 
this women find loving alternatives,'' Bush said at the Tri-State 
Pregnancy Center in blue-collar, heavily Catholic Dubuque -- the 
heart of the state's anti-abortion movement. Financed by local 
churches, the center counsels women who have had abortions as well 
as those who continue their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight day that Bush has focused on reducing  
the number of problem pregnancies. On Tuesday, he urged high school 
students to practice abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
	``These events show where my heart is,'' Bush said when  
reporters asked what signal he was trying to send. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that, if elected, he would use the power of the White  
House to bring attention to such centers, but offered no specific 
programs to help finance them. 
</P>
<P>
	He ruled out any backing for churches that ban together to  
support such centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to fund the programs or individuals who are  
trying to help, not the church from which the program draws its 
strength,'' said Bush. ``That would step over the separation of 
church and state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's focus is aimed squarely at social conservatives in the  
party who are leery of his commitment to oppose abortion. Bush 
insisted Wednesday that he's ``strongly pro-life'' but has said the 
nation isn't ready for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says he would refuse to apply litmus tests in appointing  
only judges who oppose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	In touring the crisis center, Bush said he was focusing on  
pragmatic ways to reduce the number of abortions, including 
adoption. He pointed to Texas laws making it easier to place 
children for adoption as a model he would follow if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our society must recognize the beauty of adoption,'' Bush  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did say his position on supporting such crisis centers was  
evolving. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an amazing accomplishment,'' said Bush. ``I don't have  
a specific role in mind yet, but I'm willing to listen to ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush is the solid front-runner in the race for Iowa's  
leadoff precinct caucuses, he is being challenged by rivals making 
a strong appeal to the GOP's social and religious conservatives. 
Best financed among those is publisher Steve Forbes, who routinely 
attacks Bush for not taking a tougher stand against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Those conservatives complain that Bush doesn't really support a  
constitutional amendment banning abortion, but Bush argued that 
distorts his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would support one, I recognize America is not prepared to  
pass one,'' said Bush. ``America will be ready when we value 
life.''

<HEADLINE> Losing Getting to Lou Holtz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Lou Holtz studies the Bible. Bill Parcells  
gets fed up. Joe Paterno calls friends and colleagues asking, 
``Why?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Losing gets to everyone, even coaches whose offices are lined  
with national championship plaques and filled with Super Bowl 
trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how much you win, no matter how well things have  
gone for you, they're not going well now, so I'm miserable,'' said 
Parcells, whose New York Jets fell short of going to last year's 
Super Bowl by one bad half but are 1-6 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz knows the feeling. His best-selling book is titled,  
``Winning Every Day.'' His office is filled with pictures and 
slogans -- among them a bumper sticker that says, ``How do you spell 
relief? H-O-L-T-Z'' -- testifying to his winning legacy at five 
previous schools the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of that has stopped South Carolina's free fall this  
season. The Gamecocks are 0-8, their losing streak the country's 
longest at 18. 
</P>
<P>
	So after the playbooks are put away and the practice tapes  
rewound, Holtz looks for comfort in the Bible. And he can't help 
but compare himself at times to Job, a farmer who saw his life 
overturned to test his faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get up and say I hurt, I'm in pain. That's not my  
job,'' he said. But ``I've never been through anything as painful 
as this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno has won 315 games and two national titles at Penn State  
and earned the respect of the sports world. But if his Nittany 
Lions falter -- as they did in 1988 going 5-6 or 1992 at 7-5 -- the 
72-year-old Paterno is first to pick apart his style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're always questioning your methods,'' he said.  
``When you're losing, I talk to friends, other coaches to see what 
they have to say. That doesn't mean you change things or lose your 
confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Dorsal, a sport psychologist at Francis Marion University in  
South Carolina, said successful coaches question themselves quicker 
if proven plans fail, but they usually stick with those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theory's called anchoring,'' Dorsal said. ``If you've got  
some success experience and can learn to tap into it, it may pull 
you through difficult times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz and others who are used to tremendous winning face two  
choices in defeats, Dorsal said, ``get depressed about it or stay 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A depressed person tends to internalize problems and blame  
themselves, see problems as stable or permanent and think those 
problems apply to everything they do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I see, (Holtz) hasn't done any of that so far,''  
said Dorsal, a Notre Dame graduate who has followed the coach's 
career. ``He has stayed positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz has changed his tactics, his running backs and his  
quarterbacks. He has clapped and cried, cajoled and coddled. 
</P>
<P>
	It has not helped that his wife of 38 years, Beth, whom he  
credits for bringing new enthusiasm to his life, is in Orlando, 
Fla., recuperating from major surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wonder how in the world can everything be going wrong,''  
Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He once lost seven straight games during his first two years at  
William &AMP; Mary, but he still took the Tribe to a bowl game in his 
second year there. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz opened 1-4 his first season at Notre Dame in 1986 and a  
year later lost his final three games with the Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it did at that time, it caused you to sit down and  
evaluate and think about the future and where you're going and how 
you're going to get there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next season, Holtz went undefeated and won the national  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's son and offensive coordinator, Skip, says his father  
becomes more driven when he loses. Skip says the Gamecocks, who 
have used six quarterbacks and 15 offensive linemen this year, have 
not had time to mature with his dad's system. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I admire the most about him as a coach and as a  
father is the standards he holds everyone to, including himself,'' 
Skip said. 
</P>
<P>
	So Holtz draws on his past to reshape the Gamecocks' future.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Recovering Lost Savings Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bestowed at christenings, tucked into birthday  
cards and doled out at graduations, the U.S. savings bond has been 
one of the most popular gift items in America over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also one of the most misplaced.  
</P>
<P>
	Right now, a whopping $6.5 billion in savings bonds is  
languishing out there, past maturity and no longer earning 
interest, simply because the owners have lost track of them. Some 
of these unredeemed securities may be collecting dust in basements 
and attics, others inadvertently thrown away, still others may 
never have made it to the intended recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who don't realize you can reclaim  
them,'' said Daniel J. Pederson, author of ``Savings Bonds: When to 
Hold, When to Fold and Everything in Between.'' ``They think 
they're like cash and they're gone forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, with a little work, they could be replaced and  
eventually cashed in. The federal government keeps records on all 
the savings bonds that have been issued (from the original ``E'' 
Series bonds issued in 1941 through today's newest ``I'' Series 
bonds) and will conduct a free search for any bondholder who 
requests one in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery process may take several weeks or months. It begins  
by filling out a special form -- PDF 1048, ``Application for Relief 
on Account of Loss, Theft or Destruction of United States Savings 
and Retirement Securities'' -- and mailing it to the Bureau of 
Public Debt in West Virginia. The completed form must be certified 
by a notary public or an officer of a financial institution. If the 
bonds were stolen, a police report also must be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Forms can be downloaded from the bureau's Web site  
(www.savingsbonds.gov) or requested by telephone (304-480-6112). 
Commercial banks and regional Federal Reserve Banks also have them 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Detailed questions about issue dates, denominations, serial  
numbers and inscription are asked on the form. Of course, the more 
information you can provide the better your chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially important: registered names of individual owners and  
Social Security and serial numbers as they may have appeared on the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Hollenbach, a spokesman for the Bureau of Public Debt,  
says that even if you don't know all the answers to those 
questions, it's still worth sending in the form. ``We'll take a 
shot at it (and) if we need more information we'll ask,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned, ``We're trying not to encourage fishing  
expeditions. The oldest bonds are on microfilm. It costs us a huge 
amount of money to go in there and extract all this stuff to turn 
microfilm images into data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Pederson's tips: List as many past home addresses as  
possible and provide several spelling variations of your name. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gift giver could have made a mistake in spelling or maybe  
a relative knew someone as 'Johnny' when the real name is 
'Jonathan,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollenbach says the bureau receives about 800,000 inquiries  
about bond replacements each year. During the fiscal year ended 
Sept. 30, the bureau handled 30,000 claims and replaced 160,000 
bonds, or about five bonds per claim. A common occurrence: Some 
bond owners may have thought their bonds were missing but forgot 
that they actually cashed them in years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson expects more replacement requests through the next  
century as additional bonds mature. 
</P>
<P>
	Series E bonds issued May 1941 through November 1965 have a  
final maturity of 40 years from date of original issue, and those 
issued December 1965 through June 1980 have a final maturity of 30 
years from the date of original issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Series EE bonds, first issued in 1980, have a final maturity of  
30 years from date of original issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonds only pay interest up to their final maturity date.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Entertainment highlights during the week of Oct. 31-Nov. 6:  
</P>
<P>
	60 years ago: James Cagney's new contract with Warner Bros.  
raised his salary from $5,000 to $12,500 per week, but he did not 
get the script approval he demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	30 years ago: ``Suspicious Minds'' was Elvis Presley's first No.  
1 hit on the U.S. singles chart in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	25 years ago: Elton John released his ``Greatest Hits'' album.  
</P>
<P>
	And George Harrison was the first Beatle to go on a solo world  
tour. The 30-date North American tour was to promote his ``Dark 
Horse'' album. 
</P>
<P>
	20 years ago: The movie version of the Who's ``Quadrophenia''  
was released. Sting made his acting debut in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	And Bob Dylan performed in San Francisco. It was the first city  
on a national tour to promote his religious album, ``Slow Train 
Coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	15 years ago: Sam Waterston, Haing S. Ngor and John Malkovich  
starred in ``The Killing Fields.'' Ngor won a best supporting actor 
Oscar for his acting debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' was  
tied as the second biggest-selling LP in the country. The Recording 
Industry Association of America said the 1984 album had reached 14 
million in domestic sales, joining Fleetwood Mac's ``Rumours'' as 
runner-up to Michael Jackson's ``Thriller,'' which had sold 24 
million copies. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken five years ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``My face and neck -- I guess from the stress of everything that  
had been going on -- broke out in a really bad way. In a rash. It's 
never happened to me before. The doctor asked me, `Are you under 
any stress?''' -- Jimmy Smits, on his new ``NYPD Blue'' role. 

</P>
<P>
	``People are still trying to figure out what the words are to  
some of those songs. I hate to break it to them, but ... it's just 
utter nonsense, it's sounds, and it doesn't make sense sometimes, 
and it doesn't have to.'' -- Michael Stipe of R.E.M., referring to 
the band's earlier albums. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken one year ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``I see people all the time who are better rappers than me,  
better actors than me, better-looking and stronger than me. But my 
ace in the hole is my dangerously obsessive drive, you know? I'm a 
terminator. I absolutely, positively will not stop until I win.'' -- 
Actor-rapper Will Smith. 

</P>
<P>
	``I thought that fame and success would solve your problems,  
that there would be a sense of peace or self-esteem raised by 
having all this external success. So the question became, `If not 
this, then what can make me feel connected?''' -- Alanis Morissette, 
explaining that she battled depression after her album ``Jagged 
Little Pill'' became a hit.

	``I'm not mad at Doug,'' Spurrier said. ``But certainly I'm  
frustrated with some of his plays that I've not been able to coach 
him out of. I fully expect Doug to go the distance this week. But 
if it comes to a point that we've got to get somebody else in 
there, then that's what I have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Spurrier said Johnson still had the starting job.  
But unlike earlier in the season, the coach says he won't hesitate 
bringing Jesse Palmer off the bench if Johnson isn't performing up 
to standards. 
</P>
<P>
	How will this affect Johnson?  
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier doesn't know, doesn't seem to care and doesn't want  
anyone to find out. He has banned both quarterbacks from talking to 
the media this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have anything to say,'' he said. ``I'll try to talk  
for them a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he seems to be saying is there's a good chance of Johnson  
getting the hook at some point Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have seemingly been at odds since Florida's 31-10  
victory at LSU, in which Spurrier and Johnson had several heated 
discussions on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier has been most upset with Johnson's decisions to change  
plays at the line of scrimmage. Johnson has admitted his mistakes. 
Teammates are trying to avoid the crossfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everybody's perfect,'' offensive lineman Mike Pearson  
said. ``Players make mistakes. Hopefully, we learn from them and 
don't make them again. Coach is going to put in there who he feels 
can best execute for him. I'm confident with either one in there. I 
don't see it as a distraction at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By now, it's more the norm than a distraction.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Dean was benched in October when he threw four  
interceptions against Auburn. He was replaced by Wuerffel, who went 
on to become, in Spurrier's view, the best quarterback ever to play 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before, Wuerffel won the starting job briefly before  
being replaced by Dean in the midst of a three-interception 
performance in a rainstorm against Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Palmer are the latest characters in Spurrier's  
shuffle. Last season, they alternated each play for awhile before 
Palmer won the job outright in October. Palmer broke his 
collarbone, however, and Johnson got the job back. It stayed like 
that at the beginning of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spurrier felt increasingly boxed in due to his attempt to  
seek a medical redshirt for Palmer for this season. The coach has 
realized the redshirt idea was a bad one and has given up on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a mistake to go in thinking you've just got one  
experienced quarterback,'' Spurrier said. ``I think we're better 
off bringing in two or three -- two at least. That's all we're 
trying to do.''

<HEADLINE> NBC, Yanks Work Out Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A day after NBC sports reporter Jim Gray was  
snubbed on live TV, the network threw him right back into the thick 
of things with the New York Yankees -- and everyone talked this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	After team owner George Steinbrenner and commissioner Bud Selig  
intervened, Gray interviewed Yankees manager Joe Torre and second 
baseman Chuck Knoblauch with no problems before Game 4 of the World 
Series on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The network even changed its plans and scheduled Gray to present  
New York with the World Series trophy if the team completed a sweep 
of the Atlanta Braves. Hannah Storm had presented the trophy in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	At Game 3 Tuesday night, some members of the Yankees wouldn't  
talk to Gray because of a contentious live interview he had with 
Pete Rose on Sunday night regarding accusations Rose gambled on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chad Curtis hit his game-winning homer, he refused to talk  
to Gray, who shouted after him as he walked away: ``Don't you want 
to talk about your home run?'' Curtis did not turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and the Yankees worked out their differences after  
Steinbrenner and Selig stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about it late last night and they both jumped into  
it,'' NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said. ``George walked into 
the situation and took control. ... He made it abundantly clear 
that nothing like that would happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol, who admitted the Rose interview might have gone on too  
long, especially considering the circumstances, called Gray ``the 
best reporter in the business, maybe ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who apologized for the Rose interview on the air before  
Game 3, was unavailable for comment before Wednesday night's game. 
While fans shouted insults at him, Gray was escorted by security 
men as he left the stadium for the NBC trailer before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who had criticized Gray's interview of Rose, confirmed  
there wouldn't be any more problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a certain obligation to NBC that we will fulfill,'' he  
said. ``I just wish Chad would have said it was his choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Game 4, Curtis said Gray shouldn't take his actions  
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it didn't come across that way,'' Curtis said. ``It  
seemed to me that he stepped out of bounds on the interview with 
Pete. It was something that needed to be done. ... I don't think 
we'll do it again because my personal feeling is we've made our 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC World Series analyst Joe Morgan, who played with Rose with  
the Cincinnati Reds, refrained from putting blame on either side. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff is taking away from the World Series and none  
of this is good for the game,'' Morgan said. ``All the players are 
individuals. I heard they took a vote, but I don't believe it.''

<HEADLINE> On Stage: Elaine Stritch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He was the witty, urbane writer, performer and  
20th-century English Renaissance Man. She was -- and still is -- the 
bold, brassy American musical comedy star. Yet Noel Coward and 
Elaine Stritch got along just famously. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clicked,'' Stritch says of her 15-year friendship with the  
author of such stage and screen classics as ``Private Lives'' and 
``Brief Encounter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a chemical attraction to one another. He said in his  
biography, `She knew how to handle my material.' It wasn't anything 
I worked on. It was an unconscious thing. But having a similar 
sense of humor had a great deal to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder Coward wrote the 1961 musical ``Sail Away'' with a  
juicy role for Stritch. The show had only a five-month run in New 
York and then an equally disappointing engagement in London. Yet it 
holds a special place in the hearts of musical theater buffs, 
primarily because of a superb Broadway cast album on Capitol 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Now as part of Coward's 100th birthday celebration, Stritch will  
reprise her starring role in the musical in a special concert 
version at Weill Recital Hall, a small theater located within 
Carnegie Hall. The production, which runs Nov. 3-13, also features 
such theater veterans as Marian Seldes, Jane Connell, Gordon 
Connell, Alison Fraser, Jerry Lanning and Jonathan Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Stritch met Coward in the late 1950s when she was appearing in  
``Goldilocks,'' a musical about the days of silent movies. In the 
show's funniest scene, Stritch, as an acerbic screen star, is 
filming a movie in which she portrays a valiant mother defending 
her baby from animals in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	A bear comes into the cabin and after Stritch uses up chairs,  
tables and bread knives, the only thing she has left is the child. 
``So she hits the bear with the baby,'' Stritch recalls. ``I didn't 
react to the bear. I just hit him with the baby. Coward later said, 
`Any actress who doesn't do a double take when attacked by a 
life-size bear is my kind of performer.''' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was readying ``Sail Away'' for Broadway, Coward, who  
wrote the book, music and lyrics as well as designing the show's 
poster, thought of Stritch. He wanted her to play Mimi Paragon, the 
sardonic cruise director of the S.S. Coronia. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress was to have been the show's comic relief, battling  
obnoxious tourists, while singing such Coward ditties as ``Why Do 
the Wrong People Travel?'' The musical's other plot line focused on 
a May-December romance between an older opera singer, played by 
Jean Fenn, and a younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	The out-of-town tryout was turbulent. The romance plot wasn't  
working. Midway through the Philadelphia run, the opera singer was 
out, and the role incorporated into Stritch's part. It was one of 
those classic, frantic theater experiences, with Stritch learning 
new material on a Saturday and Sunday -- and performing it Monday on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about `Sail Away' that's extraordinary is it was one  
of the few times in the history of musical comedy, aside from 
Merman's shows, where the funny girl got the guy at the end,'' 
Stritch says. ``Nobody ever expects comedians to fall in love. 
People expect them to just keep laughing and go off into the night. 
Most funny women go to the nearest saloon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broadway reviews were mixed, with some critics complaining  
that the show was too old-fashioned. ``Noel Coward's `Sail Away' 
easily could have qualified as the musical of the year -- if it had 
opened in 1936,'' sniffed one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The musical has a very wispy plot that was just an excuse for  
a pleasant evening of songs, some dances and comedy,'' says musical 
theater expert Ken Mandelbaum, author of ``Not Since `Carrie,''' a 
compendium of flop musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	```Sail Away' is an entertaining score, a fun score. Noel Coward  
was a very good composer-lyricist even when he wasn't at his 
absolute peak,'' Mandelbaum says. ``But there already were too many 
good shows at that time -- `How to Succeed in Business Without 
Really Trying' opened the next week -- so there was a lot of 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sail Away'' arrived at New York's Broadhurst Theater Oct. 3,  
1961, and closed the following February. 
</P>
<P>
	Stritch and Coward remained good friends until his death in 1973  
at age 73. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a father image to me in many ways,'' Stritch says. ``He  
taught me a lot and I taught him a lot. I think we were very good 
for each other and we loved each other very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly four decades, Stritch, who later went on to  
Broadway success in ``Company'' and revivals of ``Show Boat'' and 
``A Delicate Balance,'' is looking forward to her reunion with 
``Sail Away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are good songs, and they stick in your head,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	The actress says that although Coward's public persona was the  
ultimate in carefree sophistication, ``he was a deeply, deeply 
troubled man as all very humorous, witty people are. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think humor is a dangerous, wonderful quality and has to be  
handled with care, just like any giant talent has to be handled 
with care. You can't laugh all the time. It's impossible. Plus, I 
think Noel was an absolute, to-a-fault, romantic. With that kind of 
talent comes a lot of baggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What she remembers most about the man, though, is his honesty.  
</P>
<P>
	``Noel told me something that was full of truth and I'll never  
forget it. One of my deepest fears in this business is that you are 
only loved for what you can do. The fact that Noel separated that 
for me was important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't get so upset when you are only accepted for your last  
show or your last laugh or your last review. Know you have other 
things in your life that are as important as that.''

<HEADLINE> Man Creates Charity, Kills Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Hal Hovey took a long look at the high  
cost of battling cancer and didn't like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	The former state finance director first consulted with his  
doctor on treatment options, which were painful and not at all 
promising. He decided against them. Then, his daughter said, he 
pored over a computer spreadsheet, calculating what he would have 
spent on treatment -- as much as $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He donated the amount to create a fund that would help young  
cancer patients. Then he took his own life. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey's decision was ``consistent with everything I knew about  
Hal Hovey,'' said David Sweet, dean of Cleveland State University's 
College of Urban Affairs and a former state development director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could just see him there doing a cold-hearted analysis of  
cost and benefits and coming to a conclusion that not many would 
probably follow,'' Sweet said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey chose not to watch himself deteriorate into a husk of his  
former self, his daughter said. Hovey died at age 60 of a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound Oct. 18 on Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months leading up to his death, Hovey, a smoker without  
health insurance, read several books on his illness -- cancer of the 
mouth -- and set up projections of estimated expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	His final decisions ``were really just a continuation of his  
whole life and the difficult decisions you make in government,'' 
said his daughter Kendra Hovey. ``Trying to make a decision that 
will do the most good, put the money where it will do the most 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hovey Fund will cover costs incurred by cancer patients not  
covered by insurance, such as transportation, lodging, child care 
and nonprescription drugs. The fund will accept donations to keep 
it going. 
</P>
<P>
	Money will be available to children up to age 19 suffering  
chronic illnesses such as sickle cell anemia or cerebral palsy, and 
cancer patients 16 to 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey was a public policy analyst at the Battelle Memorial  
Institute in Columbus when Democratic Gov.-elect John Gilligan 
tapped him to become state finance director in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the architect of Ohio's income tax. Legislators  
``quickly learned to take his word and his figures as rock-solid, 
the absolute truth,'' Gilligan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, he became state budget director in Illinois, and later  
worked as a budgeting consultant to several federal agencies and 
state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey left Gilligan's office in 1973 to become state budget  
director in Illinois. He later worked as a budgeting consultant to 
several federal agencies and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hovey ``had a fantastically well-organized analytical mind,''  
Gilligan said. ``He could take over just a haystack of papers and 
reports and accounts, all speaking a different language, and make 
absolutely good sense about them so that anybody could read and 
understand them.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Fall Sharply / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell sharply today with  
investors discouraged by the dollar's weakening against the yen and 
an overnight decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 289.43 points,  
or 1.64 percent, to end the day at 17,382.36 points. On Tuesday, 
the average closed up 23.00 points, or 0.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.32 yen at 5 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT), down 0.82  
yen from late Tuesday and also below its late New York level of 
104.69 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 103.71 yen to 
104.90 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, prices started lower following Tuesday's  
moderate decline in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial 
average lost 47.80 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,302.13. That fall 
came on worries about rising U.S. inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline in Tokyo was led by sharp drops in export oriented  
issues, including high technology shares and bank shares. Exporters 
are particularly vulnerable to the stronger yen, as it can reduce 
dollar denominated earnings of Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many players kept to the sidelines to monitor dollar yen  
movements,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko 
Securities Co. Nishi said that some were also awaiting U.S. gross 
domestic product data expected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 19.71 points, or 1.28 percent, to finish at 
1,523.38. The TOPIX closed up 8.82 points, or 0.57 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 506 million shares,  
down from 598.02 million shares Tuesday. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 834 to 377, while 130 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell against the yen amid hopes  
of a larger than expected Japanese supplementary budget, which will 
be submitted in the upcoming session of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Total spending is expected to be between 10 trillion yen and 13  
trillion yen ($95 billion and $124 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Duke, foreign-exchange strategist at Citibank in Tokyo,  
said the dollar could dip even lower, toward 101 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is getting more bang for each yen spent because  
the entire economic backdrop is more favorable now,'' Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market shrugged off apprehension about the outcome of a Bank  
of Japan policy meeting today. Players seem to have decided that 
the central bank will not step in to stem the yen's further rise 
and that economic factors generally support a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.69 yen, down  
from 111.80 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.8300 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8850 percent. Its 
price rose 0.46 point to 99.74.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Long To Miss 4-6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Veteran forward Grant Long,  
one of Vancouver's key offseason acquisitions, will miss four to 
six weeks with a sprained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Long, an 11-year veteran, was hurt in a three-player collision  
during Tuesday's 105-97 win over Denver. It was Long's first game 
back after missing four games with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is a big blow to the Grizzlies, who signed the  
free-agent power forward to bolster their frontcourt depth last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a tough loss for us,'' coach Brian Hill said  
Wednesday. ``We just got the guy back and bang, another injury 
happens right away. ... It was obvious what type of impact Grant 
was making on our team prior to his injury with his leadership and 
his communication. It was rubbing off on everybody and we miss that 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long hopes to be back by the end of November.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is frustrating,'' he said. ``Luckily it's still the  
preseason. We don't get under way for another week, and I'm still 
counting that week as a week into my rehab. I look at it as a 
three-to-four week deal as opposed to five or six. Hopefully some 
good things will happen with some good rehab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long is the latest in a long line of hobbled Grizzlies. The  
injured include center Bryant Reeves (sore knee), Othella 
Harrington (bruised ankle), Doug West (toe surgery) and Antoine 
Carr (sore knee).

<HEADLINE> Young Not Ready To Call it Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *By DENNIS GEORGATOS    	
</P>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young wants to play again. His  
doctors, teammates, coaches and friends are telling him it may be 
time to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, it appears that Young -- a two-time NFL MVP who has  
had four concussions in three years -- clings to one view and 
everyone else to another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know we would all love him to be healthy and playing  
again,'' coach Steve Mariucci said Wednesday. ``But it may be very 
unlikely that he gets back into a 49ers uniform. There's always 
that glimmer of hope, but let's be realistic. It's really a long 
shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old quarterback won't put a timetable on his return  
and refused to rule out a comeback this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you can put percentages on it, but today I'm  
not on the field, so it's zero percent,'' he said. ``I'm not going 
to play in the next couple weeks or the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put a time frame on it. But I think in time I  
will be able to put enough time between the incident, that the 
unknowable might become knowable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the team has discussed putting Young on injured  
reserve, which would finish him for the year. But Young has pleaded 
for patience, and out of respect to him the team is allowing more 
time before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injured reserve list has come up. We spoke about it  
briefly,'' Mariucci said. ``It may happen. It may be inevitable but 
we haven't decided as of yet. At this point, we don't need that 
roster spot. Now, if we get an injury or two, we may reconsider. 
And Steve knows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young insists he is indeed serious about his health. He says the  
death of a San Jose high school football player following a 
concussion was ``sobering to all of us, not just myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he needs more time and information before deciding  
on his future. Young continues to consult with specialists and 
speak with players who have been driven from the game by repeated 
concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will ultimately abide by his doctor's recommendations  
and does not fear being forced to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been preparing for retirement since I started playing  
football,'' Young said. ``I went to law school. I've done a lot of 
other things. So when that comes, that will be fine. We'll just 
move right on in and do something new. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize these concussions can have their effects, so I'm  
not in any way in denial about it. But certainly I've talked about 
the possibility of coming back and I would like to explore that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver J.J. Stokes said Young's teammates are coming to  
realize their quarterback won't be back any time soon, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought until just recently he would be back at some point  
in time this season,'' Stokes said. ``The fact that he will 
probably not be back is going to be rough, but we just have to go 
with Jeff (Garcia).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's latest concussion came during a game at Arizona on Sept.  
27. He lapsed into unconsciousness for about 30 seconds after being 
leveled by blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams and then hit his 
head on tackle Dave Fiore's knee before being slammed to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Young has been bothered by headaches, lethargy and  
general wooziness. 
</P>
<P>
	His chief neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, made a recommendation  
about his future. Young still wouldn't say what it was in his first 
public comments in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's telling me I can't play right now,'' Young said. ``It's  
like any injury. You have to give it time to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, for now, Mariucci and the rest of the 49ers are preparing  
for life without Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any of us that has a date in mind, four  
games down the road, that hopefully, boom, he gets cleared or gets 
back,'' the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sense that from anybody. Mentally, we're all prepared  
not to have him. Sure we'd like to have him, but that may not be 
what ends up happening.''

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Center Has Clot in Lung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks have lost starting  
center Kevin Glover for the remainder of the season because of a 
blood clot in his lung, his second major physical crisis in two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, a 15-year NFL veteran who returned to the lineup this  
season after having back surgery in December, will be hospitalized 
for four or five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding it's not life threatening,'' coach Mike  
Holmgren said Wednesday. ``But that does not diminish the 
seriousness of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, 36, had trouble breathing during Sunday's game against  
Buffalo in the Kingdome, but thought it was a reoccurence of asthma 
problems he had as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered the blood clot when he underwent tests  
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He's being given blood thinners in the hospital to dissolve the  
clot, Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said Glover will probably be placed on injured reserve  
and replaced by Chris Gray for Monday night's game at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, a seven-year veteran in his second season in Seattle, took  
Glover's place last season after eight games. Glover, who had been 
injured during a practice, eventually was diagnosed with a 
fractured disc in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' said Holmgren, whose team is 4-2 and in a  
three-way tie for first in the AFC West. ``He's one of our leaders 
and he's a good player. The center gets overlooked at times, but 
it's really a crucial position for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said doctors weren't sure what caused the blood clot.  
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said the doctors did tell him the clot shouldn't be  
career-ending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be three to six months of treatment and watching  
this, and then after that it's my understanding he can play,'' 
Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover started all six of the Seahawks' games this season,  
giving him 175 starts in 191 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Seattle as a free agent last year after 13 seasons in  
Detroit, where he was a three-time Pro Bowl selection. The Lions 
made him a second-round draft choice out of Maryland in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Tony Banks Gets Chance With Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Tony Banks received no guarantees upon  
joining the Baltimore Ravens in April, yet he fully expected to be 
the starting quarterback in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? Banks was a starter in high school, junior college  
and at Michigan State before getting 43 starts in three seasons 
with the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine his surprise when he began his first year in Baltimore  
as the No. 3 quarterback behind Scott Mitchell and Stoney Case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a new experience for me, something I didn't expect,''  
he said Wednesday. ``I struggled with it for a while, feeling sorry 
for myself. Every sport I played, I never sat. But I found strength 
I never knew I had and was able to get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His patience was rewarded this week when Ravens coach Brian  
Billick made Banks his starter in Sunday's game against the Buffalo 
Bills. Banks plans to succeed where Mitchell and Case failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My receivers have a lot of confidence in my ability to throw  
the ball down the field and in tight spots,'' Banks said. ``I'm not 
saying Stoney and Scott weren't able to do that, but I think with 
the reps I've taken in practice I've showed my receivers I'm 
capable of doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks proved that in St. Louis, where he had three 300-yard  
games and threw 36 touchdown passes. He puts plenty of zip on the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can throw the 18-yard outs on a rope,'' wide receiver  
Justin Armour said. ``I was in Denver last year during John Elway's 
last season, and both he and Tony have similar range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick has coached several talented quarterbacks, and he likes  
what he sees in Banks. With Banks it never was a question of 
talent, but rather a matter of him adjusting to his new role as a 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony hadn't been in that position before,'' Billick said.  
``You have to learn the game plan even when you don't get the reps 
in practice. It was process he had to get used to, and he got 
better at it every week. But Stoney understood that role almost 
immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Case got the call when Mitchell faltered in the  
second game of the season, even though Banks had 42 more career 
starts in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks threw seven touchdown passes as a rookie, 14 in his second  
season and 15 last year. He also had 554 yards rushing in those 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I like about Tony is what everybody has liked about him  
since he came out of college,'' Billick said. ``He's big, he's 
physical, a good athlete and has an extremely strong arm. Like a 
lot of strong-armed quarterbacks, he has to learn to temper his 
throws from one pass to the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks' other problem is holding onto the football. He fumbled 21  
times as a rookie, 15 times in 1997 and 10 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early in my career that was a problem, holding onto the too  
long,'' Banks said. ``But if you look at the numbers last year, out 
of the games I started, I didn't have many fumbles. I think I've 
corrected that. It's a matter of better technique and getting rid 
of the football.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Shows Off New Campaign Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore couldn't claim to have paid for the  
microphone at his debate with Bill Bradley, but he took it over 
anyhow to get the first word and the last, determined to upstage 
his Democratic rival and put his new-look campaign style on 
televised display. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley debated by the rules, stuck to his message, and defended  
his proposals, particularly a health insurance expansion plan, 
against Gore's charges that it would spend away the next decade's 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dispute the cost figure that Al has used,'' Bradley  
countered. That was as vehement as he got. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore quipped, chatted with questioners, told a joke -- obviously  
bent on erasing the image of the stiff and wooden vice president 
and creating one of a friendly, freewheeling candidate. He said 
later he'd been liberated, in part when the formidable challenge 
Bradley is waging forced him to re-examine his whole campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of Wednesday night's debate -- actually a question and  
answer session in which the candidates took turns -- wasn't clear 
despite the rival claims of victory posted afterward by their 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's spokesman said he came across as presidential.  
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign flew in three Cabinet members to praise his  
performance. ``I think people saw the real Al Gore, the man I know 
in private,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Gore supporter, had said  
the debate probably wouldn't change many minds, especially this far 
in advance of the state's Feb. 1 presidential primary. Gore has 
said he's probably behind; the polls indicate Bradley has gained 
strength to pull even or marginally ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	So Bradley stuck to his game plan, steady, not confrontational.  
Gore was the candidate out to change things. 
</P>
<P>
	He started before the debate did, as soon as the two men entered  
the Dartmouth College theater to be introduced to the audience of 
500 people chosen by lottery. It was 15 minutes to air time on CNN 
and WMUR of Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now what?'' the vice president said, and took over. ``Why  
don't you start asking some questions while we're waiting?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a ploy reminiscent of the 1980 Republican debate in  
Nashua, N.H., and Ronald Reagan's retort when the moderator 
threatened to shut off his microphone for breaking the format. The 
Reagan campaign had hired the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I paid for this microphone, Mr. Green,'' Reagan snapped,  
taking charge and mispronouncing the moderator's name. Rival George 
Bush sat by in silence, although he could have had the audience to 
himself while Reagan was off stage, haggling about the rules. They 
finally debated, but Bush had lost before he began, outmaneuvered 
in what he later described as the low point of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it was Gore taking center stage in a lull.  
</P>
<P>
	First question: How could a new Democratic president work with  
Congress. ``Build personal bridges,'' Gore concluded. Then he 
played moderator. ``Bill,'' he invited, and Bradley answered the 
question. ``It's a matter of reaching out to people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more questions before the cameras went on.  
</P>
<P>
	Then the hourlong forum, in which Gore and Bradley disagreed  
most directly on how to expand health care, and at what cost. On 
most of the agenda, they differed only on details. Gore even 
praised Bradley as eloquent in urging equal rights for gays. 
</P>
<P>
	One recurrent question was campaign finance reform. Both  
candidates said they'd work to achieve it. Bradley passed up an 
opportunity to criticize the White House for illicit campaign 
contributions taken by the Democrats for the 1996 campaign. ``I'm 
not going to get into the details at this point of the game,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, in contrast, volunteered criticism of President Clinton  
for his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. He was asked 
what he would do to restore confidence in the American political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	He answered:  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward  
President Clinton and I felt it myself.'' At the time, Gore said, 
he felt it his duty to try to strive for continuity and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore got the final debate question, about overcoming cynicism.  
``That's one reason why I'd like to have a debate every week on a 
different issue,'' he said, repeating the challenge Bradley has 
declined. Bradley has agreed to seven debates this year and early 
next year, but Gore insists that isn't enough. They meet next on 
Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore also had a postscript invitation. He said he'd stick  
around to answer more questions as long as anybody wanted to ask 
them. Bradley shook hands on the way out. Gore stayed, for an hour 
and a half, until the last questioner. He said it fit the open 
meeting style he's adopted, prompted by the tightening race. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it feels liberating,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Something Familiar on Morning TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When CBS launches ``The Early Show'' Monday from  
a studio overlooking Central Park, network television's three-way 
battle for the morning news audience begins in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	Early risers may have their own show in mind: The Attack of the  
Morning Clones. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast-hour competitors -- ``Today'' on NBC, ``Good  
Morning America'' on ABC, and ``The Early Show'' -- are eerily 
similar, a bow to what some television executives say is the 
conservatism of a morning audience. Others suspect it has more to 
do with the conservatism of television executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Each show starts at 7 a.m. and runs for two hours. Each has a  
man and woman as co-hosts, while a colleague reads news headlines. 
Each has a black man delivering the weather. Each cuts away to 
local news from affiliates at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's story mix won't become clear until well after Monday, but  
it isn't expected to deviate from formula: Hard news reports early, 
light features as 9 a.m. approaches and the audience becomes 
predominantly women. 
</P>
<P>
	Each show has a midtown Manhattan storefront studio so  
passers-by can peer in and maybe get on camera. And they're close 
enough to one another so you can walk from show to show in a single 
morning: Start at Times Square for ``GMA,'' head up Sixth Avenue to 
``Today'' in Rockefeller Center, then north on Fifth Avenue to see 
what CBS built. 
</P>
<P>
	You might even see the same newsmaker guest. After the U.S.  
Open, women's champion Serena Williams batted tennis balls with 
Katie Couric on ``Today,'' and within an hour she was chatting with 
Diane Sawyer on ``GMA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only the hosts set the programs apart: Couric and Matt Lauer on  
``Today,'' Sawyer and Charles Gibson on ``Good Morning America,'' 
Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson on ``The Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morning television has a rhythm that should be not be tampered  
with, says Steve Friedman, executive producer of CBS's new entry. 
``I don't think we have to go out there and reinvent the wheel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman is one example of the incestuous nature of morning TV.  
He's a former executive producer of ``Today,'' where Gumbel spent 
15 years. Diane Sawyer was once a morning anchor at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much the same, why compete?  
</P>
<P>
	Money, that's why.  
</P>
<P>
	Morning may be the last remaining gold rush open to networks,  
the one time period when audiences are growing instead of 
shrinking. ``Today'' is so dominant in the ratings that it netted 
more than $100 million for NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've established a program that the others are trying  
to copy,'' says Jeff Zucker, ``Today'' executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	It wouldn't be the first time; imitation is television's  
favorite compliment because it signals success. For example, 
networks are rushing to develop game shows now after ABC's ``Who 
Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' dominated the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, the morning shows are moving in the direction of  
becoming more similar because the `Today' show has been so 
successful,'' says Mike Greco, who monitors the morning television 
market for the New York City advertising firm BBD&AMP;O. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has been the morning doormat for decades, and ``The Early  
Show'' represents the network's boldest competitive move in years. 
ABC put great effort into improving ``Good Morning America'' in the 
past year, installing Sawyer and Gibson and opening its flashy 
Times Square studio. 
</P>
<P>
	During the depths of ratings trouble at ``GMA,'' it briefly sank  
to third behind CBS early last winter. And at times, the two shows 
combined couldn't match the ``Today'' audience numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News President David Westin groped for ways to halt the long  
decline at ``Good Morning America,'' but he never really considered 
trying something completely different. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason why the basic formula for morning programs  
are somewhat similar,'' Westin says, ``and it's because that's 
what's worked and it's worked for many, many years. I'm sure it's 
possible to come up with a radical new format that nobody else has 
ever thought of, but the chances are against that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, he says, success lies in building a stronger program,  
not in changing the format. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings provide ammunition for his theory: ``Good Morning  
America'' doesn't have anywhere near the audience that ``Today'' 
has, but for the first time in years it's gaining viewers instead 
of losing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives say that morning, more than any other time, is when  
viewers yearn for the familiar. They want to know what happened 
while they slept; they want to hear about the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just waking up and running around in their  
underwear with toothpaste dripping out of their mouth,'' says 
Zucker. ``It's the time of day when the audience neither wants to 
be irritated nor jolted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The experience of veteran TV producer Bob Shanks is a cautionary  
tale. Shanks honed the traditional format to great success in the 
late 1970s with ``Good Morning America,'' but failed miserably at 
trying to develop something new for CBS in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Actress Mariette Hartley and newsman Rolland Smith were hosts of  
``The Morning Program,'' a show with a studio audience that 
featured comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Ellen DeGeneres -- unsual 
programming for the time slot. The show also offered a TV critic 
and personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to break the mold,'' Shanks says.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Morning Program'' annoyed viewers and CBS's  
traditionalists. It was off the air in less than a year, yet is 
still cited as the last real network attempt to try something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Shanks smells the fear of TV executives. ``Maybe it's my  
example,'' he says. ``They saw it was a plane crash, and they don't 
want to do something like that. The risks are so high and the 
failures so public, that most of them are afraid to take chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just this month, NBC News President Andrew Lack expressed  
concern about too much sameness. It was unusual, since TV 
executives usually avoid public criticism of rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually a terrible indictment of television that we've  
ended up with three programs now that look so much like each 
other,'' Lack told reporters at a celebration of the ``Today'' 
ratings success. 
</P>
<P>
	There are, of course, obvious differences in what stories each  
network does. And, at least for now, ABC and NBC are different in 
how they use their windows for public interaction. ``Good Morning 
America'' uses the public as a studio audience for cooking 
demonstrations and town meetings with presidential contenders. NBC 
uses fans to lend a festive air to events like outdoor concerts. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, in touting ``The Early Show,'' says it wants more  
information than personalities -- a dig at NBC's attempts, through 
advertising, to depict its team as ``America's First Family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something of a creeping narcissism in the morning  
shows that we would like to be an antidote to,'' says CBS News 
President Andrew Heyward. 
</P>
<P>
	Can three shows succeed, given their sameness? It's certainly  
not unprecedented. The same three networks have been running 
similar evening news shows in the same time slot for decades.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes Man for '78 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A man who fatally stabbed his ex-lover,  
tried to kill her children and then set the woman's body on fire 
was executed by injection Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignacio Alberto Ortiz, 57, was convicted of the 1978 murder of  
Manuelita McCormack at her Tucson home. He also was convicted of 
attempting to kill her three young children that night to eliminate 
witnesses and of later plotting to have them killed by a jail 
cellmate. 
</P>
<P>
	According to trial testimony, Ortiz had been romantically  
involved with Mrs. McCormack while she was estranged from her 
husband. Mrs. McCormack was killed after she reconciled with her 
husband and told Ortiz she did not want to see him anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz fatally stabbed Mrs. McCormack and then attacked the  
children. The children fled the house after Ortiz poured gasoline 
on and around their mother's body and set it afire.

<HEADLINE> Florida Panthers' Bure Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure returned to the lineup for the  
Florida Panthers on Wednesday night and wasted little time in 
scoring his first goal after a five-game absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, who had been sidelined with a groin injury since Oct. 12,  
scored Florida's first goal against the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure worked his way from behind the net and scored at 2:55 of  
the first period, his fourth goal of the season. Bure, whom Florida 
acquired from Vancouver in a trade last Januray, had three goals 
and three assists in his first four games before the injury.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European share prices fell Wednesday, led down by  
banks and pharmaceuticals, over concerns about a possible interest 
rate rise from the European Central Bank next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology was the best performer of the day, rising 0.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the question isn't whether the ECB will lift rates  
next week, but by how much,'' said David Coleman, chief economist 
at CIBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks came under pressure because higher interest rates reduce  
borrowing demand. In London, Barclays fell 3.4 percent and NatWest 
Bank fell 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other banks that fell included Deutsche Bank and HypoVereinsbank  
in Frankfurt, Societe Generale and BNP in Paris, and UBS in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pharmaceutical sector, Glaxo Wellcome fell after the  
company said it withdrew its Raxar antibiotic because of emerging 
safety concerns. AstraZeneca lost 2.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 600 European companies fell 0.75  
points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 307.82, with the 
worst-performing sectors banks, down 0.8 percent, and 
pharmaceuticals, with the respective index down 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 0.60 points 
at 323.69.

<HEADLINE> Knight Discusses Hunting Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Indiana coach Bob Knight held center  
court once again -- discussing fan support, Luke Recker and 
occasional tiffs with officials -- as he addressed about 3,000 
people during a speech at the university Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight also made a quick reference to his latest public incident  
-- accidentally shooting a friend while hunting grouse earlier this 
month in Spooner, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight was cited last week for failure to report a hunting  
accident and for hunting without a nonresident small game license. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, a student asked Knight for a seat at the end  
of the bench during one game this season. Knight granted the 
student his wish, on one condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can sit at the end of the bench, but if I hear the first  
word, you're gone,'' Knight said. ``I don't mean gone for the day, 
I've been known to shoot people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The response brought a round of applause.  
</P>
<P>
	After lecturing for 30 minutes, Knight opened the floor to any  
student who had a ``highly intelligent question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first student asked two questions, including whether the  
coach was bothered when Luke Recker transferred while Knight was 
away in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as where I was when the decision was made, I don't  
think that's a big deal,'' Knight said. ``I think when a guy has an 
announcement, make the announcement. I didn't really care, I still 
caught a lot of fishes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker transferred to Arizona in April after two seasons at  
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've given 117 scholarships since I've been at Indiana for 28  
years,'' Knight said. ``And of that 117, 37 kids for one reason or 
another have left. Eighty have stayed and played all four years. 
That's about 30 percent that we've lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The national average is about 38 percent. That is never  
mentioned when somebody talks about a kid leaving Indiana. Not only 
are we not near the bottom, we are well into the upper half of 
schools relative to retaining scholarship players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight also took a jab at the officials while discussing fan  
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every once in a while even I get upset at the officials,''  
Knight said. ``So I don't mind you adding in your two bits 
occasionally when there is a bad call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second consecutive year Knight addressed students  
and members of the Bloomington community. Knight's lectures had 
been an Indiana tradition, but he took a five-year hiatus starting 
in 1993.

<HEADLINE> NatWest Defends Against Hostile Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- National Westminster PLC took steps today to  
defend itself against a $34.4 billion hostile bid by the Bank of 
Scotland, announcing plans to sell several businesses, cut 1,650 
jobs and return cash to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest scoffed at its Scottish rival's claim that $1.7 billion  
could be saved by merging the two companies and advised 
shareholders to spurn the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank of Scotland is attempting to hijack cost savings that  
belong to NatWest shareholders and is claiming unrealistic merger 
benefits,'' chief executive David Rowland said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge NatWest shareholders to reject the offer which is  
ill-conceived and significantly undervalues NatWest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest unveiled its strategy in documents sent to shareholders  
and the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland shocked the genteel British banking  
establishment last month when it announced a takeover bid for 
NatWest and harshly criticized the London-based bank's executives 
for their performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scottish bank's aggressive move triggered speculation that  
other bidders for NatWest might emerge with offers of their own. So 
far, none has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to NatWest's announcement, Bank of Scotland said the  
defense plan does nothing to detract from the logic of its takeover 
offer. The Scottish Bank said that NatWest's latest ideas even 
concede the merits of key elements of its own proposed strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The credibility of NatWest's claims is undermined by its  
history of failure to deliver under substantially the same 
management team,'' Bank of Scotland said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest plans to sell its institutional fund management arm,  
Gartmore; its capital market business, Greenwich NatWest; its 
venture capital unit, NatWest Equity Partners; and a bank in 
Northern Ireland, Ulster Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest will return money from the asset sales to its  
shareholders in an effort to keep them loyal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland, for its part, has said it intends to unload  
Gartmore, Greenwich and Ulster Bank if its bid succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its defense, NatWest stressed its goal of  
streamlining management and focusing on services for retail 
customers, business clients and wealthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	It plans to reduce the number of its business units to five from  
13 and ``de-layer'' management to allow for speedier 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also plans to cut 1,650 jobs, most of them by year's  
end. These would be in addition to a planned reduction of 10,000 
jobs announced previously. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest fired chief executive Derek Wanless earlier this month  
and replaced him with Rowland. It also hired former Lloyd's of 
London trouble-shooter Ron Sandler as chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Bank of Scotland made its bid on Sept. 24, NatWest  
share prices have traded well above the Scottish bank's offer 
price. Analysts have said that investors were probably holding out 
for a higher bid from Bank of Scotland or a counterbid from another 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest is currently valued at around $38.8 billion, some $4.37  
billion more than what Bank of Scotland has offered. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest stock was trading down 2 percent while Bank of Scotland  
shares were up 1 percent in midday trading on London.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Shipyard Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Striking workers agreed Wednesday to  
return to work in Halla Heavy Industries Co., South Korea's third 
largest shipyard, which had been paralyzed by a two-month-long 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Halla workers went on strike in early August,  
demanding that the ailing company guarantee job security and hire 
back all labor leaders fired for illegal labor activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Management reached a compromise with labor leaders on Tuesday,  
agreeing to gradually hire back fired labor activists. On 
Wednesday, rank-and-file union members voted for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had threatened to raid Halla's Youngam shipyard on the  
south coast. Halla workers erected barricades at the shipyard's 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers said they will return to work this week and clean up the  
shipyard for operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipyard is an affiliate of Halla Group, South Korea's  
12th-largest conglomerate, which collapsed under $4 billion in debt 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks took over the shipyard and asked Hyundai, South Korea's  
largest shipbuilder, to operate it on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs aimed at restructuring South Korea's inefficient  
industries were among conditions set by the International Monetary 
Fund when it bailed out the country's battered economy in late 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But that prescription was anathema to union members accustomed  
to lifetime employment.

<HEADLINE> Internet Art Reaching the Masses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Julie Fergang always loved art but found buying  
intimidating -- until she got on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	She bought a $1,700 Mario Giacomelli photograph last spring from  
the comfort of her New York City apartment. It went so well, she 
has been checking the Net once or twice a week for more items to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
	High-end art priced at $1,000 or more is reaching the masses.  
With the Internet, no longer are buyers required to visit galleries 
or auction houses, where newcomers complain they do not always feel 
welcome unless they carry checkbooks with large balances. 
</P>
<P>
	Artstar.com will join the growing list of art-auction sites  
Thursday. Last week, mass-market auction site eBay created a 
special section for higher-priced artwork and antiques. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the old-line auction houses such as Christie's and  
Sotheby's are preparing to go online. Sotheby's has more than 
10,000 pieces lined up for two sites later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fergang, who used artnet.com for her purchase, said the Net  
opens up art to ``a whole different class of buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very old-world charm to running into Christie's or  
Sotheby's,'' she said, ``but there the eyes are on you, and there's 
an old-world intimidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artnet.com has sold some 350 pieces worth more than $1 million  
to Ms. Fergang and other collectors since March. During the past 
two weeks, the site sold a 1967 Andy Warhol screenprint for $34,650 
and a 1980 Marc Chagall lithograph for $16,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Neuendorf, a former gallery owner who started Artnet, said  
he is trying to change the traditionally exclusive art world by 
giving customers privacy and access to information. ``That 
liberates them and makes it easier for them to buy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Galleries that have sold online agree that the Net is changing  
the industry for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bartman, who runs Art Resources Transfer in New York,  
said galleries and art dealers are generally in big cities such as 
New York and Los Angeles. Through the Internet, he has received 35 
orders from such locales as Gulfport, Miss., and Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are coming from places we would never normally have  
contact with,'' he said. ``They never would have walked into the 
space we have in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inability to actually touch the art is not necessarily a  
drawback. Long before the Internet, art collectors bought without 
first seeing the work in person. Galleries and auction houses 
published catalogs and accepted bids by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Internet raises concerns about the potential  
for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-time collector Ken Raboy in Dallas said he bought an Warhol  
print through eBay for about $1,200, and it arrived with a two-inch 
tear. He contacted the seller and was told the warranty lasted only 
three days. He still buys on the Internet, but with caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many art auction sites now offer authentication services and  
guarantees for the higher-priced goods. Even eBay, which considers 
itself no more than a pipeline to connect buyer with seller, now 
offers guarantees for the higher-end items sold at its Great 
Collections section. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before you write a ten- or maybe a hundred-thousand-dollar  
check, you want a guarantee. You want to chat with an expert,'' 
said Steve Westly, eBay's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	David Redden, executive vice president for Sotheby's in New  
York, can no longer ignore the Internet. When Sotheby's held an 
online auction last year, 40 percent of customers were new. 
</P>
<P>
	Redden said he does not think the Internet will entirely replace  
the traditional auction house, particularly for the items priced in 
the millions of dollars, but he is not ruling anything out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been an auctioneer for 24 years, and I don't really want  
to be redundant yet,'' he said. ``But one thing I've learned is 
that no one will speculate too far ahead. You just don't know 
what's going to be coming down the road in terms of technology.''

<HEADLINE> Inventor of Ear Thermometer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Theodore H. Benzinger, inventor of the ear  
thermometer and a pioneer in the field of biothermodynamics, died 
Tuesday at Maplewood retirement community in Bethesda, Md. He was 
94. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Stuttgart, Germany, Benzinger became director of  
aero-medical department of the German air force in 1934. During the 
next decade he studied decompression and physiology in pilots and 
was a test pilot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, Benzinger joined the U.S. Naval Medical  
Research Institute in Bethesda, where his discoveries included the 
thermodynamic quantities of biochemical reactions and the mechanism 
for measuring temperatures in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	His invention 40 years ago of a highly accurate ear thermometer,  
later modified by other researchers, made it possible to zone in on 
the ``human thermostat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benzinger held patents for a dozen inventions and authored 136  
scientific papers and chapters in 12 books. He retired from the 
Naval Research Medical Institute in 1970 as director of its 
bioenergetics division but continued working at the National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Anderson Aches for Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- As the Atlanta Falcons' 1-6 season continues  
to unwind, Jamal Anderson feels helpless. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Pro running back can only massage his surgically  
repaired knee and watch each week as his teammates find new ways to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the hardest part -- knowing you can't help,'' Anderson  
said Wednesday. ``The thing for me is watching all this -- we did so 
much to build up football in this town. Now it's going down the 
tubes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are at the bottom of the NFC as they prepare to play  
Carolina (2-4) at the Georgia Dome on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson reflected on last season as if it happened in another  
lifetime. On their way to a 14-2 regular season and a 
franchise-first trip to the Super Bowl, the Falcons captured the 
state's attention by winning their first division title in 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of it all was the flamboyant and talkative  
Anderson. Though tight end O.J. Santiago originated the notorious 
Dirty Bird moves, most of the credit went Anderson, who broke into 
the dance every time he scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to come back to a ship that's sinking and have to  
pull out all the water,'' said Anderson, whose season ended Sept. 
20 with a knee injury at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of guys with a lot of pride in this room. We're  
so close (to finding ways to win).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ranking 29th in the NFL with an average of 69.3 yards per game,  
Atlanta's ground game has bottomed out. Running backs Ken Oxendine 
and Byron Hanspard are averaging a meager 2.7 yards per carry. 
Neither has scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest run for an active player belongs to a quarterback.  
Chris Chandler broke off a 14-yard run in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, backup quarterback Tony Graziani has the team's best  
average per carry at 5.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	How badly does this team need a 100-yard effort from one of its  
running backs? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's like asking what $100 would do for a homeless person,''  
right tackle Ephraim Salaam said. ``We've got to find some 
confidence, that's the biggest thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is bleak enough that Atlanta is considering former  
Carolina return specialist Winslow Oliver, who was cut by the 
Panthers and then signed to the Falcons' practice squad when 
Anderson was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's claim to fame is owning the NFC's third-best punt  
return average in his rookie year of 1996. The 5-foot-7, 180-pound 
former New Mexico standout has carried the ball one time since the 
beginning of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to try everything we can,'' said Falcons coach  
Dan Reeves. ``I think Winslow is familiar enough now that we could 
utilize him some, but we have got to try something. We can't 
continue to run the football averaging 2.7 a carry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who signed a five-year deal worth $32 million in  
August, traces the problems to a breakdown in communication and a 
lack of familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
	A Falcon since 1994, Anderson played his entire career with left  
tackle Bob Whitfield and center Robbie Tobeck. He spent four years 
running behind right guard Gene Williams and two behind left guard 
Calvin Collins. Salaam was a rookie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal names this year are the same -- despite Collins  
shifting to a backup role and Greg Bishop splitting time with Bob 
Hallen at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew how Tobeck and Gene would lean on a certain play, which  
way they tended to go,'' Anderson said. ``When you play that long 
together, you become like family.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Probe of Starr May Be Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress may delve into the details of the  
difficult relationship between Independent Counsel Ken Starr and 
the Justice Department, Sen. Arlen Specter said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's statement followed an Associated Press story that  
Attorney General Janet Reno had informed Starr just four days 
before his impeachment testimony that the department would review 
allegations against his office's conduct of the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation. Unknown to Starr, word of Reno's plans had already 
leaked to the news media before the Sunday afternoon meeting 
between the prosecutor and the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter said he was ``a little surprised'' by the timing of  
Reno's decision to review the conduct of Starr's office, so close 
to the independent counsel's testimony before the House impeachment 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said  
the panel might want to examine the situation of ``the investigator 
being investigated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter also said the committee might want to evaluate new  
Justice Department regulations that are replacing the Independent 
Counsel law that expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Starr stepped down this month after five stormy years of  
investigating President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the results 
of Justice's internal review remain secret. Any findings still 
could affect how the public ultimately views Starr's work, which 
will be summarized in a final report to be written by his 
successor, Robert Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Justice official said the department took two steps in  
deference to Starr's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	First, department officials waited until after Starr had  
completed the Lewinsky grand jury investigation and had sent his 
report to the House to discuss the issue of the review with him 
again, the official said, speaking only on condition of anonymity. 
Second, Starr was told the department was prepared to work with his 
office to find a way to conduct a review ``in the least intrusive 
way possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, a critic of the  
Lewinsky sex-and-cover-up investigation, said he sympathized with 
Starr and ``would hate to have the Justice Department doing that to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``As long as the attorney general has the power to  
remove an independent counsel, she has the power to investigate his 
questionable activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said friction between an independent counsel and the  
department is inevitable because the department ``feels a duty to 
assist bona fide prosecutions, but at the same time it's counsel 
for the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from letters provided to AP show the relationship  
between Justice and Starr only grew worse behind closed doors as 
the impeachment drama played out in public last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks of the meeting, Starr's office became convinced  
Justice had made its move in order to give Democrats fresh fodder 
to attack Starr as the House drew closer to the impeachment vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing'' of the review ``raises more starkly than anything  
in our relationship to date -- the specter of politically motivated 
interference,'' Starr deputy Robert Bittman wrote the office of 
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder on Dec. 2, 1998. ``You decline 
to apprise us of even the nature of the allegations against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department -- which could not investigate the  
president owing to the obvious conflict of interest -- proposes at 
this most delicate juncture to investigate the investigator,'' 
Bittman wrote, adding a complaint about the leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's prosecutors, at Reno's suggestion, had met with Justice  
officials on Nov. 23 and Dec. 1 to explore ways of working together 
to review the allegations, which had been flooding into the 
department from Clinton supporters on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them:  
</P>
<P>
	--Starr should have told the Justice Department of his 1994  
contacts with Paula Jones's lawyers in her sexual harassment 
lawsuit against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	--Starr's prosecutors should not have discussed an immunity deal  
with Ms. Lewinsky without her lawyer present. 
</P>
<P>
	--Starr's office wired Linda Tripp to record a conversation with  
Ms. Lewinsky before Starr had jurisdiction from Reno to proceed 
with the Lewinsky probe. 
</P>
<P>
	For six weeks after the Dec. 1 meeting, there was no contact.  
Then came a reply Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reject in the strongest terms'' the ``charge that the  
department has engaged in 'politically motivated interference,''' 
Holder's office wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder's office said the letter from Starr's office was ``wholly  
unjustified'' and that the department would list the allegations it 
intended to review. 
</P>
<P>
	The friction with Justice weighed heavily on Starr, who has  
flashed his bitterness at Reno in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our relations soured over the last 18 months,'' Starr wrote in  
The Wall Street Journal last week. ``At times, political appointees 
in the department actively interfered with our investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, discussions resumed between Justice and Starr. On  
May 28, Starr supplied the department's Office of Professional 
Responsibility a point-by-point rebuttal to the allegations
